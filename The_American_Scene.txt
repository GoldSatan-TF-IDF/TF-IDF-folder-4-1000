boston viii concord and salem ix philadelphia x baltimore xi washington xii richmond xiii charleston xiv florida preface the following pages duly explain themselves i judge as to the authors point of view and his relation to his subject but i prefix this word on the chance of any suspected or perceived failure of such references my visit to america had been the first possible to me for nearly a quarter of a century and i had before my last previous one brief and distant to memory spent other years in continuous absence so that i was to return with much of the freshness of eye outward and inward which with the further contribution of a state of desire is commonly held a precious agent of perception i felt no doubt i confess of my great advantage on that score since if i had had time to become almost as fresh as an inquiring stranger i had not on the other hand had enough to cease to be or at least to feel as acute as an initiated native i made no scruple of my conviction that i should understand and should care better and more than the most earnest of visitors and yet that i should vibrate with more curiosity on the extent of ground that is on which i might aspire to intimate intelligence at all than the pilgrim with the longest list of questions the sharpest appetite for explanations and the largest exposure to mistakes i felt myself then all serenely not exposed to grave mistakes though there were also doubtless explanations which would find me and quite as contentedly impenetrable i would take my stand on my gathered impressions since it was all for them for them only that i returned i would in fact go to the stake for them which is a sign of the value that i both in particular and in general attach to them and that i have endeavoured vi to preserve for them in this transcription my cultivated sense of aspects and prospects affected me absolutely as an enrichment of my subject and i was prepared to abide by the law of that sense the appearance that it would react promptly in some presences only to remain imperturbably inert in others there would be a thousand matters matters already the theme of prodigious reports and statistics as to which i should have no sense whatever and as to information about which my record would accordingly stand naked and unashamed it should unfailingly be proved against me that my opportunity had found me incapable of information incapable alike of receiving and of imparting it for then and then only would it be clearly enough attested that i had cared and understood there are features of the human scene there are properties of the social air that the newspapers reports surveys and bluebooks would seem to confess themselves powerless to handle and that yet represented to me a greater array of items a heavier expression of character than my own pair of scales would ever weigh keep them as clear for it as i might i became aware soon enough on the spot that these elements of the human subject the results of these attempted appreciations of life itself would prove much too numerous even for a capacity all given to them for some ten months but at least therefore artistically concerned as i had been all my days with the human subject with the appreciation of life itself and with the consequent question of literary representation i should not find such matters scant or simple i was not in fact to do so and they but led me on and on how far this might have been my several chapters show and yet even here i fall short i shall have to take a few others for the rest of my story h j the american scene i new england an autumn impression i conscious that the impressions of the very first hours have always the value of their intensity i shrink from wasting those that attended my arrival my return after long years even though they be out of order with the others that were promptly to follow and that i here gather in as best i may under a single head they referred partly these instant vibrations to a past recalled from very far back fell into a train of association that receded for its beginning to the dimness of extreme youth ones extremest youth had been full of new york and one was absurdly finding it again meeting it at every turn in sights sounds smells even in the chaos of confusion and change a process under which verily recognition became more interesting and more amusing in proportion as it became more difficult like the spellingout of foreign sentences of which one knows but half the words it was not indeed at hoboken on emerging from the comparatively assured order of the great berth of the ship that recognition was difficult there only too confoundingly familiar and too serenely exempt from change the waterside squalor of the great city put forth again its most inimitable notes showed so true to the barbarisms it had not outlived that one could only fall to wondering what obscure inward virtue had preserved it there was virtue evident enough in the crossing of the water that brave sense of the big bright breezy bay of light and space and multitudinous movement of the serried bristling city held in the easy embrace of its great goodnatured rivers very much as a battered and accommodating beauty may sometimes be distinguished by a gallant less fastidious with his open arms than his type would seem to imply but what was it that was still holding together for observation on the hither shore the same old sordid facts all the ugly items that had seemed destined so long ago to fall apart from their very cynicism the rude cavities the loose cobbles the dislodged supports the unreclaimed pools of the roadway the unregulated traffic as of innumerable desperate drays charging upon each other with tragic longnecked sharpribbed horses a length and a sharpness all emphasized by the anguish of effort the corpulent constables with helmets askew swinging their legs in high detachment from coigns of contemplation the huddled houses of the other time redfaced off their balance almost prone as from too conscious an affinity with saloon civilization it was doubtless open to the repentant absentee to feel these things sweetened by some shy principle of picturesqueness and i admit that i asked myself while i considered and bumped why what was sauce for the goose should not be in this case sauce for the gander and why antique shabbiness shouldnt plead on this particular waterside the cause it more or less successfully pleads on so many others the light of the september day was lovely and the sun of new york rests mostly with a laziness all its own on that dull glaze of crimson paint as thick as on the check of the cruder coquetry which is in general beneath its range the sign of the oldfashioned yes i could remind myself as i went that naples that tangiers or constantinople has probably nothing braver to flaunt and mingle with excited recognition the still finer throb of seeing in advance seeing even to alarm many of the responsibilities lying in wait for the habit of headlong critical or fanciful reaction many of the inconsistencies in which it would probably have at the best more or less defiantly to drape itself such meditations at all events bridged over alike the weak places of criticism and some of the rougher ones of my material passage nothing was left for the rest of the episode but a kind of fluidity of appreciation a mild warm wave that broke over the succession of aspects and objects according to some odd inward rhythm and often no doubt with a violence that there was little in the phenomena themselves flagrantly to justify it floated me my wave all that day and the next so that i still think tenderly for the short backward view is already a distance with tone of the service it rendered me and of the various perceptive penetrations charming coves of still blue water that carried me up into the subject so to speak and enabled me to step ashore the subject was everywhere that was the beauty that the advantage it was thrilling really to find ones self in presence of a theme to which everything directly contributed leaving no touch of experience irrelevant that at any rate so far as feeling it went treating it evidently was going to be a matter of prodigious difficulty and selection in consequence of which indeed there might even be a certain recklessness in the largest surrender to impressions clearly however these were not for the present and such as they were to be kept at bay the hour of reckoning obviously would come with more of them heaped up than would prove usable a greater quantity of vision possibly than might fit into decent form whereby assuredly the part of wisdom was to put in as much as possible of ones recklessness while it was fresh it was fairly droll for instance the quantity of vision that began to press during a wayside rest in a house of genial but discriminating hospitality that opened its doors just where the fiddlestring of association could most intensely vibrate just where the sense of old new york of the earlier stages of the picture now so violently overpainted found most of its occasions found them to extravagance within and without the good easy square known in childhood and as if the light were yellower there from that small accident bristled with reminders as vague as they were sweet within especially the place was a cool backwater for time as well as for space out of the slightly dim depths of which at the turn of staircases and from the walls of communicating rooms portraits and relics and records faintly quaintly Ñ•sthetic in intention at least and discreetly yet bravely too and all so archaically and pathetically bohemian laid traps of a pleasantly primitive order for memory for sentiment for relenting irony gross little devices on the part of the circumscribed past which appealed with scarce more emphasis than so many tailpieces of closed chapters the whole impression had fairly a rococo tone and it was in this perceptibly golden air the air of old empty new york afternoons of the waning summertime when the long the perpendicular rattle as of buckets forever thirsty in the bottomless well of fortune almost dies out in the merciful crossstreets that the ample rearward loggia of the club seemed serenely to hang the glazed disglazed gallery dedicated to the array of small spread tables for which blank backs right and left and opposite made a privacy backs blank with the bold crimson of the new york housepainter and playing upon the chord of remembrance all so absurdly with the scarcely less simplified green of their great cascades of virginia creeper as yet unturned an admonition this for piety as well as a reminder since one had somehow failed to treasure it up that the rather pettifogging plan of the city the fruit on the spot of an artless age happened to leave even so much margin as that for consoling chances there were plenty of these which i perhaps seem unduly to patronize in speaking of them as only consoling for many hours to come and while the easy wave that i have mentioned continued to float me so abysmal are the resources of the foredoomed student of manners or so helpless at least his case when once adrift in that tide if in gramercy park already three hours after his arrival he had felt himself this victim up to his neck in what i have called his subject the matter was quite beyond calculation by the time he had tumbled in such a glorified fourwheeler and with such an odd consciousness of roughness superimposed upon smoothness far downtown again and on the deck of a shining steamer bound for the jersey shore was taking all the breeze of the bay the note of manners the note that begins to sound everywhere for the spirit newly disembarked with the first word exchanged seemed on the great clean deck fairly to vociferate in the breeze and not at all so far as was pleasant to remark to the harshening of that element nothing could have been more to the spectators purpose moreover than the fact he was ready to hail as the most characteristic in the world the fact that what surrounded him was a rare collection of young men of business returning as the phrase is and in the pride of their youth and their might to their homes and that if treasures of type were not here to be disengaged the fault would be all his ownit was perhaps this simple sense of treasure to be gathered in it was doubtless this very confidence in the objective reality of impressions so that they could deliciously be left to ripen like golden apples on the tree it was all this that gave a charm to ones sitting in the orchard gave a strange and inordinate charm both to the prospect of the jersey shore and to every inch of the entertainment so divinely inexpensive by the way the immense liberality of the bay the noble amplitude of the boat the great unlocked and tumbledout city on one hand and the low accessible mystery of the opposite state on the other watching any approach to all appearance with so gentle and patient an eye the gaiety of the light the gladness of the air and above all for it most came back to that the unconscious affluence the variety in identity of the young men of business these things somehow left speculation left curiosity exciting yet kept it beguilingly safe and what shall i say more of all that presently followed than that it sharpened to the last pleasantness quite draining it of fears of fatuity that consciousness of strolling in the orchard that was all ones own to pluck and counting overhead the apples of gold i figure i repeat under this name those thickgrowing items of the characteristic that were surely going to drop into ones hand for vivid illustration as soon as one could begin to hold it out heavy with fruit in particular was the whole spreading bough that rustled above me during an afternoon a very wonderful afternoon that i spent in being ever so wisely driven driven further and further into the large lucidity of well of what else shall i call it but a new jersey condition that no doubt is a loose label for the picture but impressions had to range themselves for the hour as they could i had come forth for a view of such parts of the condition as might peep out at the hour and on the spot and it was clearly not going to be the restless analysts own fault if conditions in general everywhere should strike him as peculiarly as almost affectingly at the mercy of observation they came out to meet us in their actuality in the soft afternoon they stood artless unconscious unshamed at the very gates of appearance they might verily have been there in their plenitude at the call of some procession of drums and banners the principal facts of the case being collected along our passage to my fancy quite as if they had been principal citizens and then there was the further fact of the case ones own ridiculous property and sign the romantic if not the pathetic circumstance of ones having had to wait till now to read even such meagre meanings as this into a page at which ones geography might so easily have opened it might have threatened for twenty minutes to be almost complicating but the truth was recorded it was an adventure unmistakably to have a revelation made so convenient to be learning at last in the maturity of ones powers what new jersey might connote this was nearer than i had ever come to any such experience and it was now as if all my life my curiosity had been greater than i knew such for an excited sensibility are the refinements of personal contact these influences then were present as a source of glamour at every turn of our drive and especially present i imagined during that longest perspective when the road took no turn but showed us with a large calm consistency the straight blue band of summer sea between the sandy shore and the reclaimed margin of which the chain of big villas was stretched tight or at least kept straight almost as for the close stringing of more or less monstrous pearls the association of the monstrous thrusts itself somehow into my retrospect for all the decent humility of the low quiet coast where the shadows of the waning afternoon could lengthen at their will and the chariots of israel on the wide and admirable road could advance in the glittering eye of each array of extraordinarily exposed windows as through an harmonious golden haze there was golddust in the air no doubt which would have been again an element of glamour if it had not rather lighted the scene with too crude a confidence it was one of the phases full of its own marks and signs of new york the immense in villeggiatura and presently with little room left for doubt of what particular phase it might be the huge new houses up and down looked over their smart short lawns as with a certain familiar prominence in their profiles which was borne out by the accent loud assertive yet benevolent withal with which they confessed to their extreme expensiveness oh yes we were awfully dear for what we are and for what we do it was proud but it was rather rueful with the odd appearance everywhere as of florid creations waiting a little bewilderingly for their justification waiting for the next clause in the sequence waiting in short for life for time for interest for character for identity itself to come to them quite as large spread tables or superfluous shops may wait for guests and customers the scene overflowed with curious suggestion it comes back to me with the afternoon air and the amiable flatness the note of the sea in a drowsy mood and i thus somehow think of the great white boxes as standing there with the silvered ghostliness for all the silver involved of a series of candid new moons it could only be the occupants moreover who were driving on the vast featureless highway to and fro in front of their ingenuous palaces and as if pretending not to recognize them when they passed german jewry wasnt it conceivable tending to the stout the simple the kind quite visibly to the patriarchal and with the old superseded shabbiness of long branch partly for the goal of their course the big brown wooden barracks of the hotels the bold rotunda of the gamingroom monuments already these in truth of a more artless age and yet with too little history about them for dignity of ruin dignity if not of ruin at least of reverence was what at other points doubtless we failed considerably less to read into the cottage where grant lived and the cottage where garfield died though they had for all the world those modest structures exactly the effect of objects diminished by recession into space as if to symbolize the rapidity of their recession into time they have been left so far behind by the expensive as the expensive is now practised in spite of having apparently been originally a sufficient expression of it this could pass it seemed for the greatest vividness of the picture that the expensive for new york in villeggiatura even on such subordinate showing is like a train covering ground at maximum speed and pushing on at present into regions unmeasurable it included however other lights some of which glimmered to my eyes as with the promise of great future intensity hanging themselves as directly over the question of manners as if they had been a row of lustres reflected in the polished floor of a ballroom here was the expensive as a power by itself a power unguided undirected practically unapplied really exerting itself in a void that could make it no response that had nothing poor gentle patient rueful but altogether helpless void to offer in return the game was that of its doing each party to the whole combination what it could but with the result of the common efforts falling so short nothing could be of a livelier interest with the question of manners always in view than to note that the most as yet accomplished at such a cost was the air of unmitigated publicity publicity as a condition as a doom from which there could be no appeal just as in all the topsyturvy order the defeated scheme the misplaced confidence or whatever one may call it there was no achieved protection no constituted mystery of retreat no saving complexity not so much as might be represented by a foot of garden wall or a preliminary sketch of interposing shade the homely principle under which the picture held at all together was that of the famous freedom of the cat to look at the king that seemed so clearly throughout the only motto that would work the ample villas in their full dress planted each on its little square of brightlygreen carpet and as with their stiff skirts pulled well down eyed each other at short range from head to foot while the open road the chariots the buggies the motors the pedestrians which last number indeed was remarkably small regarded at their ease both this reciprocity and the parties to it it was in fact all one participation with an effect deterrent to those ingenuities or perhaps indeed rather to those commonplaces of conjecture produced in general by the outward show of the fortunate life that precisely appeared the answer to the question of manners the fact that in such conditions there couldnt be any manners to speak of that the basis of privacy was somehow wanting for them and that nothing accordingly no image no presumption of constituted relations possibilities amenities in the social the domestic order was inwardly projected it was as if the projection had been so completely outward that one could but find ones self almost uneasy about the mere perspective required for the common acts of the personal life that minimum of vagueness as to what takes place in it for which the complete home aspires to provide what had it been their idea to do the good people do exactly for their manners their habits their intercourse their relations their pleasures their general advantage and justification do that is in affirming their wealth with such innocent emphasis and yet not at the same time affirming anything else it would have rested on the coldblooded critic doubtless to explain why the crudity of wealth did strike him with so direct a force accompanied after all with no paraphernalia no visible redundancies of possession not so much as a lodge at any gate nothing but the scale of many of the houses and their candid look of having cost as much as they knew how unmistakably they all proclaimed it they would have cost still more had the way but been shown them and meanwhile they added as with one voice they would take a fresh start as soon as ever it should be we are only instalments symbols stopgaps they practically admitted and with no shade of embarrassment expensive as we are we have nothing to do with continuity responsibility transmission and dont in the least care what becomes of us after we have served our present purpose on the detail of this impression however i neednt insist the essence of it which was all that was worth catching was ones recognition of the odd treachery that may practically lie in wait for isolated opulence the highest luxury of all the supremely expensive thing is constituted privacy and yet it was the supremely expensive thing that the good people had supposed themselves to be getting all of which i repeat enriched the case for the restless analyst with an illustrative importance for what did it offer but the sharp interest of the match everywhere and everlastingly played between the shortcut and the long road an interest never so sharp as since the shortcut has been able to find itself so endlessly backed by money money in fact is the shortcut or the shortcut money and the long road having in the instance before me so little operated operated for the effect as we may say of the cumulative the game remained all in the hands of its adversary the example went straight to the point and thus was the drama presented what turn on the larger the general stage was the game going to take the whole spectacle with the question opened out diffusing positively a multitudinous murmur that was in my ears for some of the more subtlyromantic parts of the drive as who should say the sweet american vaguenesses hailed again the dear old nameless promiscuous lengths of woodside and waterside like the collective afternoon hum of invisible insects yes it was all actually going to be drama and that drama than which nothing could be more to the occult purpose of the confirmed the systematic storyseeker or to that even of the mere ancient contemplative person curious of character the very donnee of the piece could be given the subject formulated the great adventure of a society reaching out into the apparent void for the amenities the consummations after having earnestly gathered in so many of the preparations and necessities into the apparent void i had to insist on that since without it there would be neither comedy nor tragedy besides which so little was wanting in the way of vacancy to the completeness of the appearance what would lurk beneath this or indeed what wouldnt what mightnt to thicken the plot from stage to stage and to intensify the action the storyseeker would be present quite intimately present at the general effort showing doubtless as quite heroic in many a case to gouge an interest out of the vacancy gouge it with tools of price even as copper and gold and diamonds are extracted by elaborate processes from earthsections of small superficial expression what was such an effort on its associated side for the attentive mind but a more or less adventurous fight carried on from scene to scene with fluctuations and variations the shifting quantity of success and failure never would be such a chance to see how the shortcut works and if there be really any substitute for roundabout experience for troublesome history for the long the immitigable process of time it was a promise clearly of the highest entertainment ii it was presently to come back to me however that there were other sorts too so many sorts in fact for the ancient contemplative person that selection and omission in face of them become almost a pain and the sacrifice of even the least of these immediate sequences of impression in its freshness a lively regret but without much foreshortening is no representation and i was promptly to become conscious at all events of quite a different part of the picture and of personal perceptions to match it of a different order i woke up by a quick transition in the new hampshire mountains in the deep valleys and the wide woodlands on the forestfringed slopes the farseeing crests of the high places and by the side of the liberal streams and the lonely lakes things full at first of the sweetness of belated recognition that of the sense of some bedimmed summer of the distant prime flushing back into life and asking to give again as much as possible of what it had given before all in spite too of much unacquaintedness of the newness to my eyes through the mild september glow of the particular rich region i call it rich without compunction despite its several poverties caring little that half the charm or half the response to it may have been shamelessly subjective since that but slightly shifts the ground of the beauty of the impression when you wander about in arcadia you ask as few questions as possible that is arcadia in fact and questions drop or at least get themselves deferred and shiftlessly shirked in conformity with which truth the new england hills and woods since they were not all for the weeks to come of mere new hampshire the mild september glow and even the clear october blaze were things to play on the chords of memory and association to say nothing of those of surprise with an admirable art of their own the tune may have dropped at last but it succeeded for a month in being strangely sweet and in producing quite with intensity the fine illusion here moreover was interest of the sort that could come easily and therefore not of the sort quite the contrary that involved a consideration of the millions spent a fact none the fainter into the bargain for having its curious unexpected inscrutable side why was the whole connotation so delicately arcadian like that of the arcadia of an old tapestry an old legend an old lovestory in fifteen volumes one of those of mademoiselle why in default of other elements of the higher finish did all the woodwalks and nestled nooks and shallow carpeted dells why did most of the larger views themselves the outlooks to purple crag and blue horizon insist on referring themselves to the idyllic type in its purity as if the higher finish even at the hand of nature were in some sort a perversion and hillsides and rocky eminences and wild orchards in short any common sequestered spot could strike one as the more exquisitely and ideally sicilian theocritan poetic romantic academic from their not bearing the burden of too much history the history was there in its degree and one came upon it on sunny afternoons in the form of the classic abandoned farm of the rude forefather who had lost patience with his fate these scenes of old hard new england effort defeated by the soil and the climate and reclaimed by nature and time the crumbled lonely chimneystack the overgrown threshold the driedup well the carttrack vague and lost these seemed the only notes to interfere in their meagreness with the queer other the larger eloquence that one kept reading into the picture even the wild legend immediately local of the indian who having a hundred years ago murdered a husbandman was pursued by roused avengers to the topmost peak of chocorua mountain and thence to escape took his leap into the abyss even so sharp an echo of a definite faroff past enriching the effect of an admirable silvered summit for chocorua mountain carries its grey head quite with the grandest air spent itself in the mere idleness of the undiscriminated tangled actual there was one thinkable reason of course for everything which hung there as a possible answer to any question should any question insist did one by chance exaggerate did one rhapsodize amiss and was the apparent superior charm of the whole thing mainly but an accident of ones own situation the state of having happened to be deprived to excess that is for too long of naturalism in quantity here it was in such quantity as one hadnt for years had to deal with and that might by itself be a luxury corrupting the judgment it was absurd perhaps to have ones head so easily turned but there was perfect convenience at least in the way the parts of the impression fell together and took a particular light this light from whatever source proceeding cast an irresistible spell bathed the picture in the confessed resignation of early autumn the charming sadness that resigned itself with a silent smile i say silent because the voice of the air had dropped as forever dropped to a stillness exquisite day by day for a pilgrim from a land of stertorous breathing one of the windiest corners of the world the leaves of the forest turned one by one to crimson and to gold but never broke off all to the enhancement of this strange conscious hush of the landscape which kept one in presence as of a world created a stage set a sort of ample capacity constituted for well for things that wouldnt after all happen more the pity for them and for me and for you this view of so many of the high places of the hills and deep places of the woods the lost trails and wasted bowers the vague empty rockroughened pastures the lonely intervals where the afternoon lingered and the hidden ponds over which the season itself seemed to bend as a young bedizened a slightly melodramatic mother before taking some guilty flight hangs over the crib of her sleeping child these things put you so far as you were preoccupied with the human history of places into a mood in which appreciation became a positive wantonness and the sense of quality plucking up unexpectedly a spirit fairly threatened to take the game into its hands you discovered when once it was stirred an elegance in the commonest objects and a mystery even in accidents that really represented perhaps mere plainness unashamed why otherwise for instance the inveterate charm of the silvergrey rock cropping through thinlygrassed acres with a placed and composed felicity that suggested the furniture of a drawingroom the great boulders in the woods the pulpitstones the couchant and rampant beasts the isolated cliffs and lichened cathedrals had all seen as one passed through their drizzle of forest light a special new hampshire beauty but i never tired of finding myself of a sudden in some lonely confined place that was yet at the same time both wide and bright where i could recognize after the fashion of the old new hampshire sociability every facility for spending the day there was the oddity the place was furnished by its own good taste its bosky ring shut it in the two or three gaps of the old forgotten enclosure made symmetrical doors the sweet old stones had the surface of grey velvet and the scattered wild apples were like figures in the carpet it might be an ado about trifles and half the poetry roundabout the poetry in solution in the air was doubtless but the alertness of the touch of autumn the imprisoned painter the bohemian with a rusty jacket who had already broken out with palette and brush yet the way the colour begins in those days to be dabbed the way here and there for a start a solitary maple on a woodside flames in single scarlet recalls nothing so much as the daughter of a noble house dressed for a fancyball with the whole family gathered round to admire her before she goes one speaks at the same time of the orchards but there are properly no orchards where half the countryside shows all september the easiest most familiar sacrifice to pomona the appletree in new england plays the part of the olive in italy charges itself with the effect of detail for the most part otherwise too scantly produced and engaged in this charming care becomes infinitely decorative and delicate what it must do for the too underdressed land in may and june is easily supposable but its office in the early autumn is to scatter coral and gold the apples are everywhere and every interval every old clearing an orchard they have run down from neglect and shrunken from cheapness you pick them up from under your feet but to bite into them for fellowship and throw them away but as you catch their young brightness in the blue air where they suggest strings of strangecoloured pearls tangled in the knotted boughs as you note their manner of swarming for a brief and wasted gaiety they seem to ask to be praised only by the cheerful shepherd and the oaten pipe the question of the encircled waters too larger and smaller that again was perhaps an ado about trifles but you cant in such conditions and especially at first resist the appeal of their extraordinarily mild faces and wooded brims with the various choice spots where the great straight pines interspaced beside them and yielding to small strands as finely curved as the eyebrows of beauty make the sacred grove and the american classic temple the temple for the worship of the evening sky the cult of the indian canoe of fenimore cooper of w c bryant of the immortalizable waterfowl they ook too much alike the lakes and the ponds and this is indeed all over the world too much a reproach to lakes and ponds to all save the pick of the family say like george and champlain the american idea moreover is too inveterately that woods shall grow thick to the water yet there is no feature of grace the landscape could so ill spare let alone ones not knowing what other what baser promiscuity mightnt oppress the banks if that of the free overgrowth didnt each surface of this sort is a breathingspace in the large monotony the rich recurrence of water gives a polish to the manner itself so to speak of nature thanks to which in any case the memory of a characteristic perfection attaches i find to certain hours of declining day spent in a shallow cove on a fallen log by the scarceheard plash of the largest liquid expanse under chocorua a situation interfused with every properest item of sunset and evening star of darkening circle of forest of boat that across the water put noiselessly out of analogy in short with every typical triumph of the american landscape school now as rococo as so many squares of ingenious woolwork but the remembered delight of our childhood on terra firma in new england too often dusty or scrubby the guarantee is small that some object at variance cruelly at variance with the glamour of the landscape school may not put out but that boat across the water is safe is sustaining as far as it goes it puts out from the cove of romance from the inlet of poetry and glides straight over with muffled oar to the well to the right place the consciousness of quantity rather as opposed to quality to which i just alluded quantity inordinate quantity duly impressive and duly if need be overwhelming had been the form of vigilance posting itself at the window whence incontestably after a little yielding to the so marked agitation of its sistersense it stepped back into the shadow of the room if memory at any rate with its message so far to carry had played one a trick imagination or some finer faculty still could play another to match it if it had settled to a convenience of the mind that new england scenery was hard and dry and thin scrubby and meagre and plain here was that comfort routed by every plea of fancy though of a fancy indeed perhaps open to the charge of the morbid and by every refinement of appeal the oddest thing in the world would delightfully have happened and happened just there in case one had really found the right word for the anomaly of ones surprise what would the right word be but that nature in these lights was no single one of the horrid things i have named but was instead of them all that quite other happy and charming thing feminine feminine from head to foot in expression tone and touch mistress throughout of the feminine attitude and effect that had by no means the figure recalled from far back but when once it had fully glimmered out it fitted to perfection it became the case like a crown of flowers and provided completely for ones relation to the subject oh italy thou womanland breaks out browning more than once straight at that mark and with a force of example that for this other collocation served much more as an incitement than as a warning reminded vividly of the identities of latitude and living so much in the same relation to the sun you never really in new hampshire nor in massachusetts i was soon able to observe look out at certain hours for the violet spur of an apennine or venture to speak in your admiration of tuscan or umbrian forms without feeling that the ground has quite gratefully borne you the matter however the matter of the insidious grace is not at all only a question of amusing coincidence something intrinsically lovable everywhere lurks which most comes out indeed no doubt under the consummate art of autumn how shall one lightly enough express it how describe it or to what compare it since unmistakably after all the numbered items the few flagrant facts fail perfectly to account for it it is like some diffused some slightly confounding sweetness of voice charm of tone and accent on the part of some enormous family of rugged of almost ragged rustics a tribe of sons and daughters too numerous to be counted and homogeneous perhaps to monotony there was a voice in the air from week to week a spiritual voice oh the lands all right it took on fairly a fondness of emphasis it rebounded from other aspects at times with such a tenderness thus it sounded the blessed note under many promptings but always in the same form and to the effect that the poor dear land itself if that was all that was the matter would beautifully do it seemed to plead the pathetic presence to be liked to be loved to be stayed with lived with handled with some kindness shown even some courtesy of admiration what was that but the feminine attitude not the actual current impeachable but the old ideal and classic the air of meeting you everywhere standing in wait everywhere yet always without conscious defiance only in mild submission to your doing what you would with it the mildness was of the very essence the essence of all the forms and lines all the postures and surfaces all the slimness and thinness and elegance all the consent on the part of trees and rocks and streams even of vague happy valleys and fine undistinguished hills to be viewed to their humiliation in the mass instead of being viewed in the piece it is perhaps absurd to have to hasten to add that doing what you would with it in these irresponsible senses simply left out of account for the country in general the proved the notorious fact that nothing useful nothing profitable nothing directly economic could be done at all written over the great new hampshire region at least and stamped in particular in the shadow of the admirable highperched cone of chocorua which rears itself all granite over a huge interposing shoulder quite with the allure of a minor matterhorn everywhere legible was the hard little historic record of agricultural failure and defeat it had to pass for the historic background that traceable truth that a stout human experiment had been tried had broken down one was in presence everywhere of the refusal to consent to history and of the consciousness on the part of every site that this precious compound is in no small degree being insolently made on the other side of the continent at the expense of such sites the touching appeal of nature as i have called it therefore the do something kind for me is not so much a live upon me and thrive by me as a live with me somehow and let us make out together what we may do for each other something that is not merely estimable in more or less greasy greenbacks see how sympathetic i am the still voice seemed everywhere to proceed and how i am therefore better than my fate see how i lend myself to poetry and sociability positively to aesthetic use give me that consolation the appeal was thus not only from the rude absence of the company that had gone and the still ruder presence of the company left the scattered families of poor spirit and loose habits who had feared the risk of change it was to a listening ear directly that of the summer people to whom in general one soon began to figure so much of the country in new england as looking for its future with the consequence in fact that from place to place the summer people themselves almost promised to glow with a reflected light it was a clue at any rate in the maze of contemplation for this vision of the relation so established the disinherited the impracticable land throwing itself as for a finer argument on the nonrural the intensely urban class and the class in question throwing itself upon the land for reasons of its own what would come of such an entente on the great scale for both parties that special wonderment was to strike me everywhere as in order how populations with money to spare may extract a vulgar joy from show sections of the earth like switzerland and scotland we have seen abundantly proved so that this particular lesson has little more to teach us in america however evidently the difference in the conditions and above all in the scale of demonstration is apt to make lessons new and larger once the whole question had ranged itself under that head what would the summer people as a highly comprehensive term do with the aspects perhaps as a highly comprehensive term also and what would the aspects do with the summer people it became conveniently portable and recurrently interesting perhaps one of the best reasons i can give for this last side of it was that it kept again and again presenting the idea of that responsibility for appearances which in such an association as loomed thus large was certain to have to fix itself somewhere what was one to say of appearances as they actually prevailed from the moment i mean they were not of the charming order that nature herself could care for the appearances of man the appearances of woman and of their conjoined life the general latent spectacle of their arrangements appurtenances manners devices opened up a different chapter the leaves of which one could but musingly turn a better expression of the effect of most of this imagery on the mind should really be sought i think in its seeming through its sad consistency a mere complete negation of appearances using the term in the sense of any familiar and customary care for looks even the recognition that the scattered summer people apart the thin population was poor and bare had its bewilderment on which i shall presently touch but the poverty and the bareness were as we seemed to measure them a straight admonition of all we had from far back so easily and comfortably taken for granted in the rural picture on the other side of the world there was a particular thing that more than any other had been pulled out of the view and that left the whole show humanly and socially a collapse this particular thing was exactly the fact of the importance the significance imputable in a degree to appearances in the region in which these observations first languished into life that importance simply didnt exist at all and its absence was everywhere forlornly almost tragically attested there was the little white wooden village of course with its houses in queer alignment and its rudelyemphasized meetinghouse in particular very nearly as unconsecrated as the store or the town pump but this represented throughout the highest tribute to the amenities a sordid ugliness and shabbiness hung inveterately about the wayside farms and all their appurtenances and incidents above all about their inmates when the idea of appearance was anywhere expressed and its highest flights were but in the matter of fresh paint or a swept dooryard a summer person was usually the author of the boon the teams the carts the conveyances in their kinds the sallow saturnine natives in charge of them the enclosures the fences the gates the wayside bits of whatever sort so far as these were referable to human attention or human neglect kept telling the tale of the difference made in a land of long winters by the suppression of the two great factors of the familiar english landscape the squire and the parson what the squire and the parson do between them for appearances which is what i am talking of in scenes predominantly anglosaxon subject to their sway is brought home as in an ineffable glow when the elements are reduced to composing in the still larger anglosaxon light without them here was no church to begin with and the shrill effect of the new england meetinghouse in general so merely continuous and congruous as to type and tone with the common objects about it the single straight breath with which it seems to blow the ground clear of the seated solidity of religion is an impression that responds to the renewed sight of one of these structures as promptly as the sharp ring to the pressure of the electric button one lives among english ancientries for instance as in a world toward the furnishing of which religion has done a large part and here immediately was a room vast and vacant with a vacancy especially reducible for most of the senses to the fact of that elimination perpetually inevitably moreover as the restless analyst wandered the eliminated thing par excellence was the thing most absent to sight and for which oh a thousand times the small substitutes the mere multiplication of the signs of theological enterprise in the tradition and on the scale of commercial and industrial enterprise had no attenuation worth mentioning the case in the new hampshire hills at least was quite the same for the pervasive patron whose absence made such a hole we went on counting up all the blessings we had too unthankfully elsewhere owed to him we lost ourselves in the intensity of the truth that to compare a simplified social order with a social order in which feudalism had once struck deep was the right way to measure the penetration of feudalism if there was no point here at which they had perceptibly begun there was on the other side of the world no point at which they had perceptibly ceased ones philosophy ones logic might perhaps be muddled but one clung to them for the convenience of their explanation of so much of the ugliness the ugliness one pounced indeed on this as on a talisman for the future was the so complete abolition of forms if with so little reference to their past present or future possibility they could be said to have been even so much honoured as to be abolished the pounce at any rate was for a guiding light effectual the guiding light worked to the degree of seeming at times positively to save the restless analyst from madness he could make the absence of forms responsible and he could thus react without bitterness react absolutely with pity he could judge without cruelty and condemn without despair he could think of the case as perfectly definite and say to himself that could forms only be as a recognized accessory to manners introduced and developed the ugliness might begin scarcely to know itself he could play with the fancy that the people might at last grow fairly to like them far better at any rate than the class in question may in its actual ignorance suppose the necessity would be to give it on an adequate scale and in some lucid way a taste of the revelation what form meanwhile could there be in the almost sophisticated dinginess of the present destitution one thoughtfully asked that though at the cost of being occasionally pulled up by odd glimpses of the underlying existence of a standard there was the wagestandard to begin with the wellnigh awestruck view of the high rate of remuneration open to the most abysmally formless of hired men indeed to field or house labour expert or inexpert on the part of either sex in any connection the ascertainment of which was one of the bewilderments i just now spoke of one of the failures of consistency in the grey revelation after this there was the standard ah the very high standard of sensibility and propriety so far as tribute on this ground was not owed by the parties themselves but owed to them not to be rendered but to be received and with a stiff a warningly stiff account kept of it didnt it appear at moments a theme for endless study this queer range of the finer irritability in the breasts of those whose fastidiousness was compatible with the violation of almost every grace in life but that one are you the woman of the house a rustic cynically squalid and who makes it a condition of any intercourse that he be received at the front door of the house not at the back tresse de maison a summer person trained to resignation as preliminary to a message brought as he then mentions from the washerlady these are the phenomena of course that prompt the woman of the house and perhaps still more the man to throw herself as i say on the land for what it may give her of balm and beauty a character to which as i also say the land may affect these unfortunates as so consciously and tenderly playing up the lesson had perhaps to be taught if the patron is at every point so out of the picture the end is none the less not yet of the demonstration on the part of the figures peopling it that they are not to be patronized once to see this however was again to focus the possible evolution of manners the latent drama to come the aesthetic enrichment of the summer people so far as they should be capable or worthy of it by contact with the consoling background so full of charming secrets and the forces thus conjoined for the production and the imposition of forms thrown back again almost altogether as by the jersey shore on the excitement of the speculative one could extend unlimitedly by which i mean one could apply to a thousand phases of the waiting spectacle the idea of the possible drama so everything worked round afresh to the promise of the large interest iii if the interest then was large this particular interest of the social side of the general scene more and more likely to emerge what better proof could i want again than the differences of angle at which it continued to present itself the differences of angle as obvious most immediately for instance north of the mountains and first of all in the valley of the saco gathered into their train a hundred happy variations i kept tight hold of my temporary clue the plea of the countrys amiability as i have called it its insinuating appeal from too rigorous a doom but there was a certain strain in this from day to day and relief was apparent as soon as the conditions changed they changed notably by the rapid and complete drop of the sordid element from the picture it was for all the world of a sudden as if appearance precious principle had again asserted its rights that confidence clearly at north conway had come to it in the course of the long years too many to reckon over that separated my late from my early vision though i recognized as disconcerting toward the close of the autumn day to have to owe this perception in part to the great straddling bellowing railway the high heavy dominant american train that so reverses the relation of the parties concerned suggesting somehow that the country exists for the cars which overhang it like a conquering army and not the cars for the country this presence had learned to penetrate the high valleys and had altered unmistakably the old felicity of proportion the old informal earthy coachroad was a firm highway wide and white and ground to dust for all its firmness by the whirling motor without which i might have followed it back and back a little into the near into the far country of youth left lying however as the case stood beyond the crest of a hill only the high rockwalls of the ledges the striking sign of the spot were there grey and perpendicular with their lodged patches of shrublike forest growth and the immense floor below them where the saco spreads and turns and the elms of the great general meadow stand about like candelabra with their arms reversed interspaced on a green table there hung over these things the insistent hush of a september sunday morning nowhere greater than in the tended woods enclosing the admirable country home that i was able to enjoy as a centre for contemplation woods with their dignity maintained by a large and artful clearance of undergrowth and repaying this attention as always by something of the semblance of a sacred grove a place prepared for high uses even if for none rarer than high talk there was a latent poetry old echoes ever so faint that would come back it made a general meaning lighted the way to the great modern farm all so contemporary and exemplary so replete with beauty of beasts and convenience of man with a positive dilettantism of care but making one perhaps regret a little the big dusky heterogeneous barns the more bohemian bucolics of the earlier time i went down into the valley that was an impression to woo by stages i walked beside one of those great fields of standing indian corn which make to the eye so perfect a note for the rest of the american rural picture throwing the conditions back as far as our past permits rather than forward as so many other things do into the age to come the maker of these reflections betook himself at last in any case to an expanse of rock by a large bend of the saco and lingered there under the infinite charm of the place the rich full lapse of the river the perfect brownness clear and deep as of liquid agate in its wide swirl the large indifferent ease in its pace and motion as of some great benevolent institution smoothly working all this with the sense of the deepening autumn about gave i scarce know what pastoral nobleness to the scene something raising it out of the reach of even the most restless of analysts the analyst in fact could scarce be restless here the impression so strong and so final persuaded him perfectly to peace this on september sunday mornings was what american beauty should be it filled to the brim its idea and its measure albeit mount washington hazily overhung happened not to contribute to the effect it was the great gay river singing as it went like some reckless adventurer goodhumoured for the hour and with his hands in his pockets that argued the whole case and carried everything assentingly before it who for that matter shall speak who shall begin to speak of the alacrity with which in the new england scene to confine ourselves for the moment only to that the eye and the fancy take to the water take to it often for relief and security the corrective it supplies to the danger of the common the case is rare when it is not better than the other elements of the picture even if these be at their best and its strength is in the fact that the common has for the most part to stop short at its brink no water being intrinsically less distinguished save when it is dirty than any other by a fortunate circumstance moreover are not the objects usually afloat on american lakes and rivers to say nothing of bays and sounds almost always white and wonderful highpiled characteristic fantastic things begotten of the native conditions and shining in the native light let my question however not embroider too extravagantly my mere sense of driving presently though after nightfall and in the public conveyance into a village that gave out through the dusk something of the sense of a flourishing swiss village of the tourist season as one recalls old alpine associations the swing of the coach the cold high air the scattered hotels and their lighted windows the loitering people who might be celebrated climbers or celebrated guides the resonance of the bridge as one crossed the gleam of the swift river under the lamps my village had no happy name it was crudely speaking but jackson n h just as the swift river that later on in the morning light to the immediate vision easily surpassed everything else was only the river of the wildcat a superiority strictly comparative the note of this superiority was in any case already there for the first for the nocturnal impression scarce seen only heard as yet it could still give the gloom a larger lift than any derived from a tour of the piazzas of the hotels this tour undertaken while supper was preparing in the interest of a study of manners left room all the same for much support to the conviction i just expressed the conviction that name for name the stream had got off better than the village that streams couldnt at the worst have such cruel names as villages and that this too after all was an intimation of their relative value that inference was for the actual case to be highly confirmed the wildcat river on the autumn morning in its deep valley and its precipitous bed was as headlong and romantic as one could desire though indeed i am not in frankness prepared to say better things of it than of the great picture the feature of the place to a view of which i mounted an hour or two after breakfast here at least where a small and charming countryhouse had seated itself very much as the best box on the most expensive tier rakes the prospect for grand opera here might manners too be happily studied save perhaps for their being enjoyed at too short range here verily were verandahs of contemplation but admitting to such images of furnished peace within as could but illustrate a rare personal history this was a felicity apart whereas down in the valley the night before the story told at the lighted windows of the inns was precisely was above all of advantages impartially diffused and shared that at any rate would seem in each instance the most direct message of the life displayed to the observer on the fresher evenings in the halls and parlours the large clean bare spaces almost penally clean and bare where plain respectable families seemed to sit and study in silence with a kind of awe indeed as from a sense of inevitable doom their reflected resemblances from group to group their baffling identities of type and tone their inability to escape from participations and communities my figure of the operabox for the other the removed case is justified meanwhile by the memory of the happy vision that was to make up to me for having missed mount washington at intervale the something splendidly scenic in the composition of the presidential range hung in the air across the valley with its most eminent object holding exactly the middle of the stage and the grand effect stretching without a break to either wing mount washington seen from such a point of vantage a kind of noble equality of intercourse looks admirably solidly seated as with the other presidential peaks standing at his chair and the picture is especially sublime far off to the right with the grand style of carters dome a masterly piece of drawing against the sky and the romantic dip of carters notch the very ideal of the pass other than alpine that announces itself to the winding wayfarer for beauty and interest from a distance the names presidential and other minister little to the poetry of association but that throughout the american scene is a source of irritation with which the restless analyst has had from far back to count charming places charming objects languish all round him under designations that seem to leave on them the smudge of a great vulgar thumb which is precisely a part of what the pleading land appears to hint to you when it murmurs in autumn its intelligent refrain if it feels itself better than so many of the phases of its fate so there are spots where you see it turn up at you under some familiar tasteless infliction of this order the plaintive eye of a creature wounded with a poisoned arrow you learn after a little not to insist on names that is not to inquire of them and are happiest perchance when the answer is made you as it was made me by a neighbour in a railway train on the occasion of my greatly admiring right and left of us a tortuous brawling river i had supposed it for a moment in my innocence the connecticut which it decidedly was not it was only as appeared a stream quelconque a stream without an identity that was better somehow than the adventure of a little later my learning too definitely that another stream ample admirable in every way distinguished a stream worthy of ruysdael or salvator rosa was known but as the farmington river this i could in no manner put up with this taking by the greater of the comparatively common little names of the less farmington as i was presently to learn is a delightful a model village but villages fords bridges are not the godparents of the element that makes them possible they are much rather the godchildren so far as such reflections might be idle however in an order so differently determined they easily lost themselves on the morrow of jackson n h in an impression of sharper intensity that of a drive away on the top of the coach in the wondrous lustrous early morning and in company that positively gave what it had to give quite as if it had had my curiosity on its conscience that curiosity held its breath in truth for fear of breaking the spell the spell of the large liberty with which a pair of summer girls and a summer youth from the hotel took all nature and all society so far as society was present on the top of the coach into the confidence of their personal relation their personal relation that of the young man was with the two summer girls whose own was all with him any other with their mother for instance who sat speechless and serene beside me with the other passengers with the coachman the guard the quickeared fourinhand being for the time completely suspended the freedoms of the young three who were by the way not in their earliest bloom either were thus bandied in the void of the gorgeous valley without even a consciousness of its shriller its recording echoes the whole phenomenon was documentary it started for the restless analyst innumerable questions amid which he felt himself sink beyond his depth the immodesty was too colossal to be anything but innocence yet the innocence on the other hand was too colossal to be anything but inane and they were alive the slightly stale three they talked they laughed they sang they shrieked they romped they scaled the pinnacle of publicity and perched on it flapping their wings whereby they were shown in possession of many of the movements of life life however involved in some degree experience if only the experience for instance of the summer apparently just spent at a great cost in the gorgeous valley how was that how was the perception of any concurrent presence how was the human or social function at all compatible with the degree of the inanity there was as against this the possibility that the inanity was feigned if not the immodesty and the fact that there would have been more immodesty in feigning it than in letting it flow clear these were maddening mystifications and the puzzle fortunately dropped with the arrival of the coach at the station iv clearly none the less there were puzzles and puzzles and i had almost immediately the amusement of waking up to another this one of a different order altogether the point was that if the bewilderments i have just mentioned had dropped most other things had dropped too the challenge to curiosity here was in the extreme simplification of the picture a simplification on original lines not that there was not still much to think of if only because one had to stare at the very wonder of a picture so simplified the thing now was to catch this note to keep it in the ear and see really how far and how long it would sound the simplification for that immediate vision was to a broad band of deep and clear blue sea a blue of the deepest and clearest conceivable limited in one quarter by its far and sharp horizon of sky and in the other by its near and sharp horizon of yellow sand overfringed with a low woody shore the whole seen through the contorted crosspieces of stunted windtwisted farspreading quite fantastic old pines and cedars whose bunched bristles at the ends of long limbs produced against the light the most vivid of all reminders cape cod on this showing was exactly a pendent pictured japanese screen or banner a delightful little triumph of impressionism which during my short visit at least never departed under any provocation from its type its type so easily formulated so completely filled was there the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning there was rest for the mind for that certainly of the restless analyst in having it so exactly under ones hand after that one could read into it other meanings without straining or disturbing it there was a couchant promontory in particular half bosky with the evergreen boskage of the elegant kakemono half bare with the bareness of refined the most refined new england decoration a low hospitable headland projected as by some watercolourist master of the trick into a mere brave wash of cobalt it interfered the sweet promontory with its generous boston bungalow its verandahs still haunted with old summertimes and so wide that the present could elbow and yet not jostle the past it interfered no whit for all its purity of style with the human the social question always dogging the steps of the ancient contemplative person and making him before each scene wish really to get into the picture to cross as it were the threshold of the frame it never lifts verily this obsession of the storyseeker however often it may flutter its wings it may bruise its breast against surfaces either too hard or too blank the manners the manners where and what are they and what have they to tell that haunting curiosity essential to the honour of his office yet making it much of a burden fairly buzzes about his head the more pressingly in proportion as the social mystery the lurking human secret seems more shy then it is that as he says to himself the secret must be most queer and it might therefore well have had so insidiously sounded a supreme queerness on cape cod for not the faintest echo of it trembled out of the blankness there were always the little white houses of the village there were always the elegant elms feebler and more feathery here than further inland but the life of the little community was practically locked up as tight as if it had all been a question of painted japanese silk and that was doubtless for the storyseeker absolutely the little story the constituted blankness was the whole business and ones opportunity was all thereby for a study of exquisite emptiness this was stuff in its own way of a beautiful quality that impression came to me with a special sweetness that i have not forgotten the help in the matter was that i had not forgotten either a small pilgrimage or two of faraway earlier years the sense as of absent things in other summertimes golden afternoons that referred themselves for their character simply to sandy roads and primitive farms crooked inlets of mild sea and at the richest large possibilities of worked cranberryswamp i remembered in fine mattapoisett i remembered marion as admirable examples of that frequent new england phenomenon the case the consummate example of which i was soon again to recognize in newport the presence of an unreasoned appeal in nature to the sense of beauty the appeal on a basis of items that failed somehow count and recount them as one would to justify the effect and make up the precious sum the sum at newport above all as i was soon again to see is the exquisite the irresistible but you falter before beginning to name the parts of the explanation conscious how short the list may appear thus everything in the whole range of imagery affirms itself and interposes you will you inwardly determine arrive at some notation of manners even if you perish in the attempt thus as i jogged southward from boston in a train that stopped and stopped again for my fuller enlightenment and that insisted the good old promiscuous american car itself on having as much of its native character as possible for my benefit i already knew i must fall back on old props of association some revival of the process of seeing the land grow mild and vague and interchangeably familiar with the sea all under the spell of the reported gulfstream those mystic words that breathe a softness wherever they sound it was imperative here that they should do what they could for me and they must have been in full operation when on my arrival at the small station from which i was to drive across to cotuit across the cape as who should say romantic thought though i strain a point geographically for the romance i found initiation awaiting me in the form of minimized horseandbuggy and minimized man the man was a little boy in tight knickerbockers the horse barely an animal at all a mere ambling spirit in shafts on the scale of a hairpin the buggy disembodied save for its wheels the whole thing the barest infraction of the road of the void circumstances altogether that struck the note the right the persistent one that of my baffled endeavour while in the neighbourhood to catch life in the fact and of my then having to recognize it as present without facts or with only the few the little white houses the feathery elms the band of ocean blue the stripe of sandy yellow the tufted pines in angular silhouette the cranberryswamps stringed across for the picking like the ruled pages of ledgers that fell incorruptibly silent into the picture we were still far from our goal that first hour when i had recognized the full pictorial and other value of my little boy and his little accessories had seen in the amiable waste that we continued to plough till we struck almost with a shock the inconsistency of a long stretch of new stone road that socially economically every contributive scrap of this detail was required i drained my small companion by gentle pressure of such sidelights as he could project consisting almost wholly as they did of a prompt and shrill an oddlyemphasized yes sir to each interrogative attempt to break ground the summer people had already departed with as it seemed to me undue precipitation the very hotel offered in its manywindowed bulk the semblance of a mere huge brittle seashell that children tired of playing with it have cast again upon the beach the alignments of white cottages were once more as if the children had taken for a change to building houses of cards and then had deserted them i remember the sense that something must be done for penetration for discovery i remember an earnest stroll undertaken for a view of waterside life which resulted in the perception of a young man in a spacious but otherwise unpeopled nook a clear straightforward young man to converse with for a grand opportunity across the water waisthigh in the quiet tide and prodding the seabottom for oysters also in the discovery of an animated centre of industry of which oysters again were the motive a mute citizen or two packing them in boxes on the beach for the boston market the hammer of some vague carpentry hard by and filling the air more than anything else the unabashed discourse of three or four schoolchildren at leisure visibly prominent and apparently in charge of the life of the place i remember not less a longish walk and a longer drive into low extensions of woody piney pondy landscape veined with blue inlets and trimmed on opportunity with blond beaches through all of which i pursued in vain the shy spectre of a revelation the only revelation seemed really to be that quite as in new hampshire so many people had left that the remaining characters on the sketchy page were too few to form a word with this accordingly of what in the bright air for the charmed visitor were the softness and sweetness of impression made i had again to take it for a mystery v this was really for that matter but the first phase of a resumed or rather of a greatlyenlarged acquaintance with the new england village in its most exemplary state the state of being both sunned and shaded of exhibiting more fresh white paint than can be found elsewhere in equal areas and yet of correcting that conscious that doubtless often somewhat embarrassed hardness of countenance with an art of its own the descriptive term is of the simplest the term that suffices for the whole family when at its best having spoken of them as elmshaded you have said so much about them that little else remains it is but a question throughout of the quantity the density of their shade often so thick and ample from may to november that their function in the social in the economic order would seem on occasion to consist solely of their being passive to that effect to note the latter accordingly to praise it to respond to its appeal for admiration practically represents as you pass beneath the great feathery arches the only comment that may be addressed to the scene the charming thing if that be the best way to take it is that the scene is everywhere the same whereby tribute is always ready and easy and you are spared all shocks of surprise and saved any extravagance of discrimination these communities stray so little from the type that you often ask yourself by what sign or difference you know one from the other the goodly elms on either side of the large straight street rise from their grassy margin in double ever and anon in triple file the white paint on wooden walls amid open dooryards reaffirms itself eternally behind them though hanging back during the best of the season with a suncheckered amusing vagueness while the great verdurous vista the high canopy of meeting branches has the air of consciously playing the trick and carrying off the picture see with how little we do it count over the elements and judge how few they are in other words come back in winter in the months of the naked glare when the white paint looks dead and dingy against the snow the poor dear old white paint immemorial ubiquitous save as venturing into brown or yellow which is really all we have to build on some such sense as that you may catch from the murmur of the amiable elms if you are a very restless analyst indeed that is a very indiscreet listener as you wouldnt however go back in winter on any account whatever and least of all for any such dire discovery the picture hangs undisturbed in your gallery and you even with extended study of it class it among your best mementos of the great autumnal harmony the truth is that for six or seven weeks after the midseptember among the mountains of massachusetts and connecticut the mere fusion of earth and air and water of light and shade and colour the almost shameless tolerance of nature for the poor human experiment are so happily effective that you lose all reckoning of the items of the sum that you in short find in your draught contentedly a single strong savour by all of which i dont mean to say that this sweetness of the waning year has not more taste in the presence of certain objects than in the presence of certain others objects remarkable enough objects rich and rare perhaps objects at any rate curious and interesting emerge for genial reference from the gorgeous blur and would commit me should i give them their way to excesses of specification so i throw myself back upon the fusion as i have called it with the rich light hanging on but halfadozen spots this renews the vision of the massachusetts berkshire land beyond any other in america today as one was much reminded of leisure on the way to legitimation of the social idyll of the workable the expensively workable american form of country life and in especial of a perfect consistency of surrender to the argument of the verdurous vista this is practically the last word of such communities as stockbridge pittsfield lenox or of such villages as salisbury and farmington over the connecticut border i speak of consistency in spite of the fact that it has doubtless here and there under the planted elms suffered some injury at the hands of the summer people for really beneath the wide mantle of particoloured nature nothing matters but the accidental liability of the mantle here and there to fall thickest thus it is then that you do after a little differentiate from place to place and compare and even prefer thus it is that you recognize a scale and a range of amplitude nay more wonderful to say on occasion an emergence of detail thus it is in fine that while accepting the just eminence of stockbridge and pittsfield for instance you treat yourself on behalf of farmington to something like a luxury of discrimination i may perhaps not go the length of asserting that farmington might brave undismayed the absolute removal of the mantle of charity since the great elmgallery there struck me as not less than elsewhere essentially mistress of the scene only there were particular felicities there within the general and anything very particular in the land at large always gave the case an appearance of rarity when the great elmgallery happens to be garnished with old houses and the old houses happen to show style and form and proportion and the hand of time further has been so good as to rest on them with all the pressure of protection and none of that of interference then it is that the new england village may placidly await any comer farmington sits with this confidence on the top of a ridge that presents itself in its fringed length a straight avenue seen in profile to the visitor taking his way from the station across a couple of miles of level bottom that speak for new england of a luxury of culture and nothing could be more fastidious and exceptional and thereby more impressive in advance than such upliftedness of posture what is it but the note of the aristocratic in an air that so often affects us as drained precisely and wellnigh to our gasping of any exception to the common the indication i here glance at secures for the place in advance as you measure its detachment across the valley a positively thrilled attention then comes under the canopy of autumn your vision of the grounds of this mild haughtiness every one of which you gratefully allow stay as many hours as you will and my stay was but of hours they dont break down you trace them into fifty minor titles and dignities all charming aspects and high refinements of the older new england domestic architecture not only moreover are the best houses so good the good ones are so surprisingly numerous that is all they seem together to say we are good yes we are excellent though if we know it very well we make no vulgar noise about it we only just stand here in our long double line in the manner of mature and just slightlyreduced gentlewomen seated against the wall at an evening party some party where mature gentlewomen unusually abound and neither too boldly affront the light nor shrink from the favouring shade that again on the spot is the discreet voice of the air which quavered away for me into still other admissions it takes but the barest semitone to start the storyseeker curious of manners the storyseeker impenitent and uncorrected as happened in this case by a lesson unmistakably received or at least intended a short time before he had put a question on that occasion with an expectancy doubtless too crude he had asked a resident of a large city of the middle west what might be credibly the conditions of the life socially led there he had not at farmington forgotten the ominous pause that had preceded the reply the conditions of the life why the same conditions as everywhere else he had not forgotten either the thrill of his sense of this collapse of his interlocutor the case being obviously that it is of the very nature of conditions as reported on by the expert and it was to the expert he had appealed to vary from place to place so that they fall into as many groups and constitute as many stamps as there are different congregations of men his interlocutor was not of the expert that had really been the lesson and it was with a far different poetry the sweet shyness of veracity that farmington confessed to idiosyncrasies i have too little space however as i had then too little time to pretend to have lifted more than the smallest corner of this particular veil besides which if it is of the essence of the land in these regions to throw you back after a little upon the possible humanities so it often results from the social study too baffling in many a case that you are thrown back upon the land that agreeable if sometimes bewildering seesaw is perhaps the best figure in such conditions for the restless analysts tenor of life it was an effect of the fusion he has endeavoured to suggest it is certainly true at least that among the craggy hills among little mountains that turned so easily at any opening to clearness of violet and blue among the woodcircled dells that seemed to wait as for afternoon dances among the horizons that recalled at their will the umbrian note and the finer drawing every ugliness melted and dropped any wonderment at the other face of the medal seemed more trouble than it was worth it was enough that the white village or the painted farm could gleam from afar on the faintly purple slope like a thing of mystery or of history it was enough that the charming hillmass happily presented and foreshortened should lie there like some beast almost heraldic resting his nose on his paws those images for retrospect insistently supplant the others though i have notes enough i find about the others too about the inscrutability of the village street in general for instance in any relation but its relation to its elms what they seemed to say is what i have mentioned but what secrets meanwhile did the rest of the scene keep were there any secrets at all or had the outward blankness the quantity of absence as it were in the air its inward equivalent as well there was the high thin church made higher made highest and sometimes as at farmington made as pretty as a monstrous dutch toy by its steeple of quaint and classic carpentry but this monument appeared to testify scarce more than some large white card embellished with a stencilled border on which a message or a sentence an invitation or a revelation might be still to be inscribed the present the positive was mainly represented ever by the level railwaycrossing gaining expression from its localization of possible death and destruction where the great stilted strident yet so almost comically impersonal train which with its so often undesignated and so always unservanted stations and its general air of bossing the neighbourhoods it warns for climax of its characteristic curtness to look out for its rush is everywhere a large contribution to ones impression of a kind of monotony of acquiescence this look as of universal acquiescence plays somehow through the visible vacancy seems a part of the thinness the passivity of that absence of the settled standard which contains as i more and more felt from day to day the germ of the most final of all my generalizations i neednt be too prompt with it so much higher may it hold its head i foresee when it flowers perfectly as a conclusion than when it merely struggles through the side of the subject as a tuft for provisional clutching it sprouts in that soil none the less betimes this apprehension that the common man and the common woman have here their appointed paradise and sphere and that the sign of it is the abeyance on many a scene of any wants any tastes any habits any traditions but theirs the bullying railway orders them off their own decent avenue without a fear that they will stand up to it the tone of the picture is the pitch of their lives and when you listen to what the village street seems to say marking it at the end with your is that all it is as if you had had your account of a scheme fashioned preponderantly in their image i mean in theirs exactly with as little provision for what is too foul for them as for what is too fair the very middle the golden mean of the note of the common to which the two extremes of condition are equally wanting though with the mark strongest if anywhere against dusky misfortune and precarious dependence the romance of costume for better or worse the implication of vices accomplishments manners accents attitudes is as absent for evil as for good for a low connection as for a high which is why the simplification covers so much ground that of public houses that of kinds of people that of suggestions however faint of discernible opportunity of any deviation in other words into the uncommon there are no kinds of people there are simply people very very few and all of one kind the kind who thus simply invest themselves for you in the grey truth that they dont go to the public house its a negative garment but it must serve you which it makes shift to do while you keep on asking from the force of acquired habit what may be behind what beneath what within what may represent in such conditions the appeal of the senses or the tribute to them what in such a show of life may take the place to put it as simply as possible of amusement of social and sensual margin overflow and byplay of course there is byplay here and there here and there of course extremes are touched otherwise the whole concretion in its thinness would crack and the fact is that two or three of these strong patches of surfaceembroidery remain with me as curious and interesting never was such byplay as in a great new house on a hilltop that overlooked the most composed of communities a house apparently conceived and with great felicity on the lines of a magnified mount vernon and in which an array of modern impressionistic pictures mainly french wondrous examples of manet of degas of claude monet of whistler of other rare recent hands treated us to the momentary effect of a large slippery sweet inserted without a warning between the compressed lips of halfconscious inanition one hadnt quite known one was starved but the morsel went down by the mere authority of the thing consummately prepared nothing else had been in all the circle prepared to anything like the same extent and though the consequent taste as a mixture with the other tastes was of the queerest no proof of the sovereign power of art could have been for the moment sharper it happened to be that particular art it might as well no doubt have been another it made everything else shrivel and fade it was like the sudden trill of a nightingale lord of the hushed evening these appeared to be over the land always possible adventures obviously i should have others of the same kind i could let them in all confidence accumulate and wait but if that was one kind of extreme what meanwhile was the other kind the kind portentously alluded to by those of the sagacious who had occasionally put it before me that the village street the arched umbrageous vista half so candid and half so cool is too frequently in respect to morals but a whited sepulchre they had so put it before me these advisers but they had as well absolutely and all tormentingly so left it partly as if the facts were too abysmal for a permitted distinctness and partly no doubt as from the general american habit of indirectness of positive primness of allusion to those matters that are sometimes collectively spoken of as the great facts of life it had been intimated to me that the great facts of life are in high fermentation on the other side of the ground glass that never for a moment flushes to the casual eye with the hint of a lurid light so much at least one had no alternative under pressure but to infer the inference however still left the question a prey to vagueness it being obvious that vice requires forms not less than virtue or perhaps even more and that forms up and down the prospect were exactly what one waited in vain for the theory that no community can live wholly without byplay and the confirmatory word for the particular case of more initiated reporters these things were all very well but before a scene peeled as bare of palpable pretext as the american sky is often peeled of clouds in the interest of the slightly acid juice of its light where and how was the application to be made it came at last the application that i mean of the portentous hint and under it after a fashion the elements fell together why the picture shouldnt bristle with the truth that was all conceivable that the truth could only strike inward horribly inward not playing up to the surface this too needed no insistence what was sharpest for reflection being meanwhile a couple of minor appearances which one gathered as one went that our little arts of pathetic of humorous portrayal may for all their claim to an edifying realism have on occasion small veracity and courage that again was a remark pertinent to the matter but the strangest link in the chain and quite the horridest was this other of high value to the restless analyst that as the interesting puts in its note but where it can and where it will so the village street and the lonely farm and the hillside cabin became positively richer objects under the smutch of imputation twitched with a grim effect the thinness of their mantle shook out of its folds such crudity and levity as they might and borrowed for dignity a shade of the darkness of cencidrama of monstrous legend of old greek tragedy and thus helped themselves out for the storyseeker more patient almost of anything than of flatness there was not flatness accordingly though there might be dire dreariness in some of those impressions gathered for a climax in the berkshire country of massachusetts which forced it upon the fancy that here at last in far deep mountain valleys where the winter is fierce and the summer irresponsible was that heart of new england which makes so pretty a phrase for print and so stern a fact as yet for feeling during the great loops thrown out by the lasso of observation from the wonderworking motorcar that defied the shrinkage of autumn days this remained constantly the best formula of the impression and even of the emotion it sat in the vehicle with us but spreading its wings to the magnificence of movement and gathering under them indeed most of the meanings of the picture the heart of new england at this rate was an ample a generous heart the largest demands on which as to extent and variety seemed not to overstrain its capacity but it was where the mountainwalls rose straight and made the valleys happiest or saddest one couldnt tell which as to the felicity of the image and it didnt much matter that penetration was for the poetry of it deepest just as generalization for an opposite sort of beauty was grandest on those several occasions when we perched for a moment on the summit of a pass a real little pass slowly climbed to and keeping its other side with an art all but alpine for a complete revelation and hung there over the full vertiginous effect of the long and steep descent the clinging road the precipitous fall the spreading shimmering land bounded by blue horizons we liked the very vocabulary reduced to whatever minimum of these romanticisms of aspect again and again the land would do beautifully if that were all that was wanted and it deserved the dear thing thoroughly any verbal caress any tenderness of term any share in a claim to the grand manner to which we could responsively treat it the grand manner was in the winding ascent the rocky defile the sudden rest for wonder and all the splendid reverse of the medal the world belted afresh as with purple sewn with pearls melting in other words into violet hills with vague white towns on their breasts that was at the worst for october afternoons the motor helping our frequent fare the habit of confidence in which was perhaps on no occasion so rewarded as on that of a particular plunge from one of the highest places through an ebbing golden light into the great lebanon bowl the vast scooped hollow in one of the hither depths of which given the quarter of our approach we found the shaker settlement once more or less i believe known to fame ever so grimly planted the grimness even was all right when once we had admiringly dropped down and down and down it would have done for that of a buddhist monastery in the himalayas though more savagely clean and more economically impersonal we seemed to make out than the communities of older faiths are apt to show themselves i remember the mere chill of contiguity like the breath of the sepulchre as we skirted on the wide hard floor of the valley the rows of gaunt windows polished for no whitest stillest meanest face even to look out so that they resembled the parallelograms of black paint crisscrossed with white lines that represent transparency in nuremberg dollshouses it wore the whole settlement as seen from without the strangest air of active operative death as if the state of extinction were somehow obscurely administered and applied the final hush of passions desires dangers converted into a sort of huge stiff brush for sweeping away rubbish or still more perhaps into a monstrous comb for raking in profit the whole thing had the oddest appearance of mortification made to pay this was really however sounding the heart of new england beyond its depth for i am not sure that the new york boundary had not been just there overpassed there flowered out of that impression at any rate another adventure the very bravest possible for a shortened day of which the motive whether formulated or not had doubtless virtually been to feel with a farstretched arm for the heart of new york had new york the miscellaneous monster a heart at all this inquiry amid so much encouraged and rewarded curiosity might have been well on the way to become sincere and we kept groping between a prompt start and an extremely retarded return for any stray sign of an answer the answer perhaps in the event still eluded us but the pursuit itself away across state lines through zones of other manners through images of other ideals through densities of other values into a separate sovereign civilization in short this with a view of the autumnal hudson for an added incentive became in all the conditions one of the finer flowers of experience to be on the lookout for differences was not unnaturally to begin to meet them just over the border and see them increase and multiply was indeed with a mild consistency to feel it steal over us that we were as we advanced in a looser shabbier perhaps even rowdier world where the roads were of an easier virtue and the farms of a scantier pride where the absence of the ubiquitous signpost of new england joy of lonely corners left the great spaces with an accent the less where in fine the wayside bravery of the commonwealth of massachusetts settled itself for memory all serenely to suffer by no comparison whatever and yet it wasnt either that this other was not also a big bold country with ridge upon ridge and horizon by horizon to deal with insistently pantingly puffingly pausingly before the great river showed signs of taking up the tale with its higher hand it wasnt above all that the most striking signs by which the nearness of the river was first announced three or four fine old houses overlooking the long road reputedly dutch manors seats of patriarchs and patroons and unmistakably rich values in the vast vague scene had not a nobler archaic note than even the best of the new england colonial it wasnt that finally the hudson when we reached the town that repeats in so minor a key the name of the stream was not autumnal indeed with majestic impenetrable mists that veiled the waters almost from sight showing only the dim catskills off in space as perfunctory graces cheaply thrown in and leaving us to roam the length of a large straight street which was yes decidedly for comparison for curiosity not as the streets of massachusetts the best here to speak of was that the motor underwent repair and that its occupants foraged for dinner finding it indeed excellently at a quiet cookshop about the middle of the longdrawn way after we had encountered coldness at the door of the main hotel by reason of our french poodle this personage had made our group admirably composed to our own sense as it was only the more illustrious but minds indifferent to an opportunity of intercourse if but the intercourse of mere vision with fine french poodles may be taken always as suffering where they have sinned the hospitality of the cookshop was meanwhile touchingly winningly unconditioned yet full of character of local of national truth as we liked to think documentary in a high degree we talked it over for american life wasnt it interesting that with american life so personally so freely affirmed the superstition of cookery should yet be so little denied it was the queer old complexion of the long straight street however that most came home to me hudson in the afternoon quiet seemed to stretch back with fumbling friendly hand to the earliest outlook of my consciousness many matters had come and gone innumerable impressions had supervened yet here in the stir of the senses a whole range of small forgotten things revived things intensely hudsonian more than hudsonian small echoes and tones and sleeping lights small sights and sounds and smells that made one for an hour as small carried one up the rest of the river the very river of life indeed as a thrilled roundabouted pilgrim by primitive steamboat to a mellow medieval albany vi it is a convenience to be free to confess that the play of perception during those first weeks was quickened in the oddest way by the wonderment which was partly also the amusement of my finding how many corners of the general of the local picture had anciently never been unveiled for me at all and how many unveiled too briefly and too scantly with quite insufficient bravery of gesture that might make one ask by what strange law one had lived in the other time with gaps to that number in ones experience in ones consciousness with so many muffled spots in ones general vibration and the answer indeed to such a question might carry with it an infinite penetration of retrospect a penetration productive of ghostly echoes as sharp sometimes as aches or pangs so many had been the easy things the contiguous places the conspicuous objects to right or to left of the path that had been either unaccountably or all too inevitably left undiscovered and which were to live on to the inner vision through the long years as mere blank faces round empty metallic senseless disks dangling from familiar and reiterated names why at the same time one might ask had the consciousness of irritation from these vain forms not grown greater why had the inconvenience or the disgrace of early privation become an accepted memory all doubtless in the very interest precisely of this eventual belated romance and so that adventures even of minor type so preposterously postponed should be able to deck themselves at last with a kind of accumulation of freshness so the freshness all the autumn kept breaking through the staleness when the staleness so agreeably flavoured with hospitality and indeed with new ingredients was a felt element at all there was after all no moment perhaps at which one element stood out so very sharply from the other the hundred emendations and retouches of the old picture its greater depth of tone greater show of detail greater size and scale tending by themselves to confound and mislead in a manner the lights and shades of remembrance very promptly in the boston neighbourhoods the work of time loomed large and the difference made by it as one might say for the general richness the richness might have its poverties still and the larger complexity its crudities but all the same to look back was to seem to have been present at an extraordinary general process that of the rapid that of the ceaseless relegation of the previous on the part of the whole visible order to one of the wan categories of misery what was taking place was a perpetual repudiation of the past so far as there had been a past to repudiate so far as the past was a positive rather than a negative quantity there had been plenty in it assuredly of the negative and that was but a shabbiness to disown or a deception to expose yet there had been an old conscious commemorated life too and it was this that had become the victim of supersession the pathos so to call it of the impression was somehow that it didnt the earlier simpler condition still resist or protest or at all expressively flush through it was consenting to become a past with all the fine candour with which it had tried to affirm itself in its day as a present and very much for that matter as with a due ironic forecast of the fate in store for the hungry triumphant actual this savours perhaps of distorted reflection but there was really a light over it in which the whole spectacle was to shine the will to grow was everywhere written large and to grow at no matter what or whose expense i had naturally seen it before i had seen it on the other side of the world in a thousand places and forms a thousand hits and misses these things are the very screeches of the pipe to which humanity is actually dancing but here clearly it was a question of scale and space and chance margin and elbowroom the quantity of floor and loudness of the dancemusic a question of the ambient air above all the permitting medium which had at once for the visitors personal inhalation a dry taste in the mouth thin and clear and colourless what would it ever say no to or what would it ever paint thick indeed with sympathy and sanction with so little accordingly within the great frame of the picture to prevent or to prescribe it was as if anything might be done there that any sufficient number of subscribers to any sufficient number of sufficiently noisy newspapers might want that moreover was but another name for the largest and straightest perception the restless analyst had yet risen to the perception that awaits the returning absentee from this great country on the wharf of disembarkation with an embodied intensity that no superficial confusion no extremity of chaos any more than any brief mercy of accident avails to mitigate the waiting observer need be little enough of an analyst in truth to arrive at that consciousness for the phenomenon is vivid in direct proportion as the ship draws near the great presence that bristles for him on the sounding dock and that shakes the planks the loose boards of its theatric stage to an inordinate unprecedented rumble is the monstrous form of democracy which is thereafter to project its shifting angular shadow at one time and another across the democratic consistencyevery inch of the field of his vision it is the huge democratic broom that has made the clearance and that one seems to see brandished in the empty sky that is of course on one side no great discovery for what does even the simplest soul ever sail westward for at this time of day if not to profit so far as possible by the working of democratic institutions the political the civic the economic view of them is a study that may be followed more or less at a distance but the way in which they determine and qualify manners feelings communications modes of contact and conceptions of life this is a revelation that has its full force and its lively interest only on the spot where when once caught it becomes the only clue worth mentioning in the labyrinth the condition notoriously represents an immense boon but what does the enjoyment of the boon represent the clue is never out of your hands whatever other objects extremely disconnected from it may appear at the moment to fill them the democratic consistency consummately and immitigably complete shines through with its hard light whatever equivocal gloss may happen momentarily to prevail you may talk of other things and you do as much as possible but you are really thinking of that one which has everything else at its mercy what indeed is this circumstance that the condition is thus magnified but the commanding value of the picture its message and challenge to intelligent curiosity curiosity is fairly fascinated by the sense of the immensity of the chance and by the sense that the whole of the chance has been taken it is rarely given to us to see a great game played as to the very end and that was where with his impression of nothing to prevent of nothing anywhere around him to prevent anything the ancient contemplative person floating serenely in his medium had yet occasionally to gasp before the assault of the quantity of illustration the illustration might be enormously of something deficient absent in which case it was for the aching void to be as an aching void striking and interesting as an explication or an implication the democratic intensity could always figure vii there was little need for that matter to drag it into the foreground on the evening of my renewed introduction to the particular boston neighbourhood the only one of them all with which i had been formerly somewhat acquainted i had alighted in new york but three days before and my senses were all so full of it that as i look back i can again feel it under the immediate cambridge impression assert itself by turning quite to insidious softness to confused and surprised recognition i had driven out from boston through the warm september night and through a town picture as of extraordinary virtuous vacancy without so much as the figure of a policeman in sight from the south station to the region of harvard square and i remember how the odorous hour charged with the old distinctively american earthsmell which in the darkness fairly poetized the suburbs and with the queer far wild throb of shrilling insects prescribed to me the exact form of the response to the question as to ones sense of a great change already so often sounded a great change no change at all where then would the intensity be but changes ever so many and so amusing and so agreeable the intensity is compatible with them nothing clearly is going to be so interesting as to make out with plenty of goodwill how compatible there was unmistakably everywhere a more embroidered surface the new free figures played over the canvas so that at this rate in the time to come how far might the embroidery not go what silk and gold mightnt it weave into the pattern it wasnt of course a question of rhapsodizing cambridge was cambridge still and all faithful to its type but the rustle of the trees in the summer night had a larger tone the more frequent lamplight slept on ampler walls the body of impression was greater and the university above all seemed in more confident possession it massed there in multiplied forms with new and strange architectures looming through the dark it appeared to have wandered wide and to be stretching forth in many directions long acquisitive arms this vision for the moment of a great dim clustered but restlessly expansive harvard hushed to vacation stillness as to a deep ambitious dream was for the impressible storyseeker practically the germ of the most engaging of the generalized images of reassurance the furniture so to speak of the other scale that the extension of his view was to cause him to cultivate reassurance is required before the spectacle of american manners at large whenever one most acutely perceives how little honour they tend to heap on the art of discrimination and it is at such hours that turning in his frequent stupefaction the restless analyst reaches out for support to the nearest faint ghost of a constituted faculty it takes no exceptional exposure to the promiscuous life to show almost any institution pretending to university form as stamped here with the character and function of the lifesaving monasteries of the dark ages they glow the humblest of them to the imagination the imagination that fixes the surrounding scene as a huge rappacinigarden rank with each variety of the poisonplant of the moneypassion they glow with all the vividness of the defined alternative the possible antidote and seem to call on us to blow upon the flame till it is made inextinguishable so little time had it taken at any rate to suggest to me that a new and higher price in american conditions is attaching to the cloister literally the place inaccessible to put it most pertinently to the shout of the newspaper the place to perambulate the place to think apart from the crowd doubtless indeed i was not all aware of it at the time but the image i touch upon in connection with those first moments was to remain with me the figure of the rich old harvard organism brooding exactly through the long vacation brooding through the summer night on discriminations on insistences on sublime and exquisite heresies to come after that arrived daylight recognitions but they were really for the most part offered me as in a full cup by the accident of a couple of hours that were to leave me the pure essence the finer sense of them these were a matter of a fortnight later as i had had immediately to make an absence and the waning september afternoon of the second occasion took on a particular quality for this deferred surrender of a dozen stored secrets secrets i call them because the total impression was of the production of some handful of odds and ends that had lurked for long in a locked drawer and which being brought out might promote by their blinking consciousness either derision or respect they excited as befell an extraordinary tenderness on which conclusion it was fortunate to be able afterwards to rest i wandered for the days end with a young modern for whom the past had not been and who was admirably unconscious of the haunting moral of the whole mutation the tune to which the pampered present made the other time look comparatively grim each item of the pampered state contributed to this effect the finer mise en scene the multiplied resources halls faculties museums undergraduate and postgraduate habitations these last of so large a luxury the pompous little clubhouses visited all vacant in the serious telltale twilight that seemed to give them intellectually away the beautiful new union with its great grave noble hall of which there would be so much more to be said and above all doubtless the later majesties of the law school in the near presence of which the tiny old disinherited seat of that subject outfaced and bedimmed seemed unable to make even a futile plea for quaintness i went into the new law library immense and supreme in the shadow of which i caught myself sniffing the very dust prehistoric but still pungent of the old i saw in the distance a distinguished friend all alone belatedly working there but to go to him i should have had to cross the bridge that spans the gulf of time and with a suspicion of weak places i was nervous about its bearing me what such delicacies came to then and afterwards for the whole impression was the instinct not to press not to push on till forced through any halfopen door of the real the real was there certainly enough outside and all round but there was standingground more immediately for a brief idyll and one would walk in the idyll if only from hour to hour while one could this could but mean that one would cultivate the idyllic for the social for the pictorial illusion by every invoking and caressing art and in fact as a consequence the reflection of our observers experience for the next few weeks that is so long as the spell of the autumn lasted would be but the history of his more or less ingenious arts with the breaking of the autumn later on everything broke everything went everything was transposed at least into another key but for the time so much had been gained the happy trick had been played viii it was after all in the great hall of the union perhaps to come back to that delicate days end that the actual vibration of response seemed most to turn to audible music repeated with all its suggestiveness on another occasion or two for the case was unmistakably that just there more than anywhere by a magnificent stroke an inspiration working perhaps even beyond its consciousness the right provision had been made for the remembering mind the place was addressed in truth so largely to an enjoying and producing future that it might seem to frown on mere commemoration on the backward vision and yet at the moment i speak of its very finest meaning might have been that of a liberal monument to those who had come and gone to the company of the lurking ghosts the air there was full of them and this was its service that it cared for them all and so eased off the intensity of their appeal and yet it appeared to play that part for a reason more interesting than reducible to words a reason that mainly came out for me while in the admirable hall aforesaid i stood before sargents high portrait of major henry lee higginson donatorio of the house as well as author all round about of innumerable other civil gifts a representation of life and character a projection of genius which even that great painter has never outdone innumerable ever are the functions performed and the blessings wrought by the supreme work of art but i know of no case in which it has been so given to such a work to make the human statement with a great effect to interfuse a group of public acts with the personality with the characteristics of the actor the acts would still have had all their value if the portrait had had less but they would not assuredly have been able to become so interesting would not have grown to affect each beneficiary however obscure as proceeding for him from a possible relation a possible intimacy it is to the question of intimacy with somebody or other that all great practical public recognition is finally carried back but carried only by the magic carpet when the magic carpet happens to be there mr sargents portrait of henry higginson is exactly the magic carpet that was the pull one kept on feeling that this happy commemorative creation of the union had over the great official the great bristling brick valhalla of the early seventies that house of honour and of hospitality which under the name of the alumni hall dispenses apart from its containing a noble auditorium laurels to the dead and dinners to the living the recording tablets of the members of the university sacrificed on the northern side in the civil war are too impressive not to retain here always their collective beauty but the monumental office and character suffer throughout from the too scant presence of the massive and the mature the great structure spreads and soars with the best will in the world but succeeds in resembling rather some highmasted ship at sea in slightly prosaic equilibrium than a thing of builded foundations and embrasured walls to which it is impossible not immediately to add that these distinctions are relative and these comparisons almost odious in face of the recent generations gathered in from beneath emptier skies who must have found in the big building as it stands an admonition and an ideal so much the better for the big building assuredly and none so calculably the worse for the generations themselves the reflection follows close moreover that tactfully speaking criticism has no close concern with alumni hall it is as if that grim visitor found the approaches closed to him had to enter to the loss of all his identity some relaxing air of mere sentimental mere shameless association he turns his back a trifle ruefully whistling and wanders wide so at least i seemed to see him do all september all october and hereabouts in particular i felt him resignedly reduced for the time to looking over to looking through the fence all the more that at cambridge there was at last something in the nature of a fence so to be dealt with the smaller aspects the sight of mere material arrears made up may seem unduly to have held me when i say that few fresh circumstances struck me as falling more happily into the picture than this especial decency of the definite the palpable affirmation and belated delimitation of college yard the high decorated recurrent gates and the still insufficiently high iron palings representing a vast ring and even now incomplete may appear in spots extemporized and thin but that signifies little in presence of the precious idea on the side of which in the land of the open door the allabstract outline the timid term and the general concession they bravely range themselves the open door as it figures here in respect to everything but trade may make a magnificent place but it makes poor places and in places despite our large mistrust of privacy and until the national ingenuity shall have invented a substitute for them we must content ourselves with living this especial drawing of the belt at harvard is an admirably interesting example of the way in which the formal enclosure of objects at all interesting immediately refines upon their interest immediately establishes values the enclosure may be impressive from without but from within it is sovereign nothing is more curious than to trace in the aspects so controlled the effect of their established relation to it this resembles in the human or social order the improved situation of the foundling who has discovered his family or of the actor who has mastered his part the older buildings in the yard profit indeed on the spot to the storyseeking mind by the fact of their comparative exhibition of the tone of time so prompt an ecstasy and so deep a relief reward in america everywhere any suggested source of interest that is not the interest of importunate newness that source overflows all others run thin but the wonder and the satisfaction are that in college yard more than one of these should have finally been set to running thick the best pieces of the earlier cluster from massachusetts to stoughton emerge from their elongation of history with a paler archaic pink in their brickwork their scant primitive details small quaintnesses of form have turned each to the expressive accent that no shortcut of style can ever successfully imitate and from their manypaned windows where on the ensconced benches so many generations have looked out they fall in their minor key into the great main current of ghostly gossip see see we are getting on we are getting almost ripe ripe enough to justify the question of taste about us we are growing a complexion which takes almost as long and is in fact pretty well the same thing as growing a philosophy but we are putting it on and entering into the dignity of time the beauty of life we are in a word beginning to begin and we have that best sign of it havent we that we make the vulgar the very vulgar think we are beginning to end that moreover was not the only relation thus richly promoted there could be no unrest of analysis worthy of the name that failed to perceive how after term had opened the type of the young men coming and going in the yard gained for vivacity of appeal through this more marked constitution of a milieu for it here verily questions could swarm for there was scarce an impression of the local life at large that didnt play into them one thing i had not yet done i had not been under the best guidance out to ellis island the seat of the commissioner of immigration in the bay of new york to catch in the fact as i was to catch later on a couple of hours of the ceaseless process of the recruiting of our race of the plenishing of our huge national pot au feu of the introduction of fresh of perpetually fresh so far it isnt perpetually stale foreign matter into our heterogeneous system but even without that a haunting wonder as to what might be becoming of us all typically ethnically and thereby physiognomically linguistically personally was always in order the young men in their degree as they flocked candidly up to college struck me as having much to say about it and there was always the sense of light on the subject for comparison and reference that a long experience of other types and other manners could supply swarming ingenuous youths whom did they look like the sons of that inquiry as to any group any couple any case represented a game that it was positively thrilling to play out there was plenty to make it so for there was to begin with both the forecast of the thing that might easily settle the issue and the forecast of the thing that might easily complicate it no impression so promptly assaults the arriving visitor of the united states as that of the overwhelming preponderance wherever he turns and twists of the unmitigated business man face ranging through its various possibilities its extraordinary actualities of intensity and i speak here of facial cast and expression alone leaving out of account the questions of voice tone utterance and attitude the chorus of which would vastly swell the testimony and in which i seem to discern for these remarks at large a treasure of illustration to come nothing meanwhile is more concomitantly striking than the fact that the women over the land allowing for every element of exception appear to be of a markedly finer texture than the men and that one of the liveliest signs of this difference is precisely in their less narrowly specialized their less commercialized distinctly more generalized physiognomic character the superiority thus noted and which is quite another matter from the universal fact of the mere usual female femininity is far from constituting absolute distinction but it constitutes relative and it is a circumstance at which interested observation snatches from the first with an immense sense of its portee there are with all the qualifications it is yet open to fifty reflections to be made upon the truth it seems to represent the appearance of a queer deep split or chasm between the two stages of personal polish the two levels of the conversible state at which the sexes have arrived it is at all events no exaggeration to say that the imagination at once embraces it as the feature of the social scene recognizing it as a subject fruitful beyond the common and wondering even if for pure drama the drama of manners anything anywhere else touches it if it be a subject verily with the big vision of the intersexual relation as at such an increasing rate a prey to it the right measure for it would seem to be offered in the art of the painter of life by the concrete example the art of the dramatist or the novelist rather than in that of the talker the reporter at large the only thing is that from the moment the painter begins to look at american life brush in hand he is in danger of seeing in comparison almost nothing else in it nothing that is so characteristic as this apparent privation for the man of his right kind of woman and this apparent privation for the woman of her right kind of man the right kind of woman for the american man may really be of course as things are turning out with him the woman as to whom his most workable relation is to support her and bear with her just as the right kind of man for the american woman may really be the man who intervenes in her life only by occult by barely divinable by practically disavowed courses but the ascertainment and illustration of these truths would be exactly very conceivably high sport for the ironic poet who has surely hitherto neglected one of his greatest current opportunities it in any case remains vivid that american life may as regards much of its manifestation fall upon the earnest view as a society of women located in a world of men which is so different a matter from a collection of men of the world the men supplying as it were all the canvas and the women all the embroidery just this vividness it was that held up the torch through the cambridge autumn to that question of the affiliation of the encountered harvard undergraduate which i may not abandon in what proportion of instances would it stick out that the canvas rather than the embroidery was what he had to show in what proportion would he wear the stamp of the unredeemed commercialism that should betray his paternity in what proportion in his appearance would the different social value imputable to his mother have succeeded in interposing the discerned answer to these inquiries is really after all too precious in its character of contribution to ones total gathered wisdom to be given away prematurely but there was at least always the sense to which the imagination reverted that in the collegiate cloisters and academic shades of other countries this absence of a possible range of origin and breeding in a young type had not been so felt the question of origin the question of breeding had been large never settled in advance there had been fifty sorts of persons fifty representatives of careers to whom the english the french the german universitarian of tender years might refer you for a preliminary account of him i speak of my keeping back for the present many of my ultimate perceptions but i may none the less recall my having had all the season from early the ring in my ears of a reply i had heard made on the spot to a generous lady offering entertainment to a guest a stranger to the scene whose good impression she had had at heart what kind of people should i like to meet why my dear madam have you more than one kind at the same time that i could remember this however i could also remember that the consistently bourgeois fathers must themselves in many cases have had mothers whose invitation to their male offspring to clutch at their relatively finer type had not succeeded in getting itself accepted that constituted a fatal precedent and it would have to be in the female offspring probably that one should look for evidences of the clutching an extension of the inquiry for which there was plenty of time what did escape from submersion meanwhile as is worth mentioning was the golden state of being reminded at moments that there are no such pleasuregiving accidents for the mind as violations of the usual in conditions that make them really precarious and rare as the usual in our vast crude democracy of trade is the new the simple the cheap the common the commercial the immediate and all too often the ugly so any human product that those elements fail conspicuously to involve or to explain any creature or even any feature not turned out to pattern any form of suggested rarity subtlety ancientry or other pleasant perversity prepares for us a recognition akin to rapture these lonely ecstasies of the truly open sense make up often in the hustling bustling desert for such sinkings of the starved stomach as have led one too often to have to tighten ones aesthetic waistband ix all of which is sufficiently to imply again that for adventurous contemplation at any of the beguiled hours of which i pretend here but to give the general happier drift there was scarce such a thing as a variation of insistence as every fact was convertible into a fancy there was only an encouraged fusion of possible felicities and possible mistakes stopgaps before the awful advent of a serious sense of critical responsibility or say perhaps rather to alter the image that there was only a builded breakwater against the assault of matters demanding a literal notation i walked at the best but on the breakwater looking down if one would over the flood of the real but much more occupied with the sight of the old cambridge ghosts who seemed to advance one by one even at that precarious eminence to meet me my small story would gain infinitely in richness if i were able to name them but they swarmed all the while too thick and of but two or three of them alone is it true that they push their way of themselves through any silence it was thus at any rate a question as i have indeed already sufficiently shown of what one read into anything not of what one read out of it and the occasions that operated for that mild magic resolve themselves now into three or four of an intrinsic colour so dim as to be otherwise wellnigh indistinguishable why if one could tell it would it be so wonderful for instance to have stood on the low cliff that hangs over the charles by the nearer side of mount auburn and felt the whole place bristle with merciless memories it was late in the autumn and in the day almost evening with a wintry pink light in the west the special shade fading into a heartless prettiness of grey that shows with a polar chill through the grim tracery of november just opposite at a distance beyond the river and its meadows the white face of the great empty stadium stared at me as blank as a rising moon with soldiers field squaring itself like some flat memorial slab that waits to be inscribed i had seen it inscribed a week or two before in the fantastic lettering of a great intercollegiate game of football and that impression had been so documentary as to the capacity of the american public for momentary gregarious emphasis that i regret having to omit here all the reflections it prompted they were not however what was now relevant save in so far as the manymouthed uproar they recalled was a voice in the more multitudinous modern hum through which one listened almost in vain for the sound of the old names one of these in particular rose to my lips it was impossible to stand there and not reach out a hand to jrl as to a responsive personal presence the very genius of the spot who had given it from so early the direct literary consecration without which even the most charming seats of civilization go through life awkwardly and ruefully after the manner of unchristened children they lack thus for the great occasions the great formal necessities their papers it was thanks to lowell even more immediately than to longfellow that cambridge had its papers though if i find myself putting that word into the past tense it is perhaps because of the irresistible admonition too proceeding so from a thousand local symptoms that titles embodied in literary form are less and less likely in the harvard air to be asked for that is clearly not the way the wind sets we see the great university sit and look very hard at blue horizons of possibility across the high tableland of her future but the light of literary desire is not perceptibly in her eye nothing is more striking than the recent drop in her of any outward sign of literary curiosity precisely for which reason it was doubtless in part that the changed world seemed reflected with a certain tragic intensity even in faces ever so turned to cheerful lights as those of my two constructive companions i had passed high square sad old elmwood on the way to my cliff over the charles and had wonderingly lingered a little about it i had passed mr longfellows immemorial historical admired residence still ample and symmetrical and visibly touristhaunted the only detected ruffle of its noble calm elements of the picture that had rekindled for an hour the finer sensibility the finer continuity and piety it was because of these things again that i felt the invoked pair beside me presently turn away as under a chill from that too spectral in its own turn stare of the stadium perceived as a portent of the more roaring more reported and excursionized scene and in particular seemed to see jr ls robust humour yield to the recognition of the irony of fate dear to every poet in one of its most pointed forms that humour had played of old charmingly over the thesis that cambridge mass was taken altogether the most inwardly civilized most intimately humane among the haunts of men whereby it had committed itself this honest adventurer to a patient joy in the development of the genius loci and was therefore without provision either of poetry or of prose against the picture of proportions and relations overwhelmingly readjusted if the little old place with its accessible ear had been so brave what was the matter with the big new one going in as it would itself say for greater braveries still nothing no doubt but that the possession of an ear would be ceasing to count as an advantage in what produced form for instance if he had been right was now represented the love of letters of which he had been so distinguished an example if he had on the other hand not been right well it would all be rather dreadful such at all events may be the disconcertments of a revisiting spirit when he has happened to revisit too ingenious an old friend the old friend moreover had meanwhile had and in relation to this large loose fringe of the town there so freely disposed one of his very own disconcertments he had turned his steps for the pleasure of memory to fresh pond dear to the muses of youth the sunday afternoons of spring and had to accept there his clearest vision perhaps of the new differences and indifferences the little nestling lake of other days had ceased to nestle there was practically no fresh pond any more and i seemed somehow to see why the muses had fled even as from the place at large the light flutter of their robes had surrounded faraway walks and talks one could at this day on printed on almost faded pages give chapter and verse for the effect audible on the sunday afternoons of their habit of murmurous hinted approval other things had come by makeweight the charming country club on toward watertown all verandahs and golflinks and tennislawns all tea and ices and selfconsciousness and there had come thereabouts too the large extension of the park system the admirable commissioners roads that reach across the ruder countryside like the arms of carnivorous giants stretching over a teatable of blackberries and buns but these things were in the eternal american note the note of the gregarious the concentric and pervaded moreover by the rustle of petticoats too distinguishable from any garmenthem of the sacred nine the desecrated the destroyed resort had favoured save on rare feastdays the single stroll or at the worst the double dedicated to shared literary secrets which was why i almost angrily missed among the ruins what i had mainly gone back to recover some echo of the dreams of youth the titles of tales the communities of friendship the sympathies and patiences in fine of dear w d h ii new york revisited i the single impression or particular vision most answering to the greatness of the subject would have been i think a certain hour of large circumnavigation that i found prescribed in the fulness of the spring as the almost immediate crown of a return from the far west i had arrived at one of the transpontine stations of the pennsylvania railroad the question was of proceeding to boston for the occasion without pushing through the terrible town why terrible to my sense in many ways i shall presently explain and the easy and agreeable attainment of this great advantage was to embark on one of the mightiest as appeared to me of trainbearing barges and descending the western waters pass round the bottom of the city and remount the other current to harlem all without losing touch of the pullman that had brought me from washington this absence of the need of losing touch this breadth of effect as to the whole process involved in the prompt floating of the huge concatenated cars not only without arrest or confusion but as for positive prodigal beguilement of the artless traveller had doubtless much to say to the ensuing state of mind the happilyexcited and amused view of the great face of new york the extent the ease the energy the quantity and number all notes scattered about as if in the whole business and in the splendid light nature and science were joyously romping together might have been taking on again for their symbol some collective presence of great circling and plunging hovering and perching seabirds whitewinged images of the spirit of the restless freedom of the bay the bay had always on other opportunities seemed to blow its immense character straight into ones face coming at you so to speak bearing down on you with the full force of a thousand prows of steamers seen exactly on the line of their longitudinal axis but i had never before been so conscious of its boundless cool assurance or seemed to see its genius so grandly at play this was presumably indeed because i had never before enjoyed the remarkable adventure of taking in so much of the vast bristling promontory from the water of ascending the east river in especial to its upper diminishing expanses something of the air of the occasion and of the mood of the moment caused the whole picture to speak with its largest suggestion which suggestion is irresistible when once it is sounded clear it is all absolutely an expression of things lately and currently done done on a large impersonal stage and on the basis of inordinate gain it is not an expression of any other matters whatever and yet the sense of the scene which had at several previous junctures as well put forth to my imagination its power was commanding and thrilling was in certain lights almost charming so it befell exactly that an element of mystery and wonder entered into the impression the interest of trying to make out in the absence of features of the sort usually supposed indispensable the reason of the beauty and the joy it is indubitably a great bay a great harbour but no one item of the romantic or even of the picturesque as commonly understood contributes to its effect the shores are low and for the most part depressingly furnished and prosaically peopled the islands though numerous have not a grace to exhibit and one thinks of the other the real flowers of geography in this order of naples of capetown of sydney of seattle of san francisco of rio asking how if they justify a reputation new york should seem to justify one then after all we remember that there are reputations and reputations we remember above all that the imaginative response to the conditions here presented may just happen to proceed from the intellectual extravagance of the given observer when this personage is open to corruption by almost any large view of an intensity of life his vibrations tend to become a matter difficult even for him to explain he may have to confess that the group of evident facts fails to account by itself for the complacency of his appreciation therefore it is that i find myself rather backward with a perceived sanction of an at all proportionate kind for the fine exhilaration with which in this free wayfaring relation to them the wide waters of new york inspire me there is the beauty of light and air the great scale of space and seen far away to the west the open gates of the hudson majestic in their degree even at a distance and announcing still nobler things but the real appeal unmistakably is in that note of vehemence in the local life of which i have spoken for it is the appeal of a particular type of dauntless power the aspect the power wears then is indescribable it is the power of the most extravagant of cities rejoicing as with the voice of the morning in its might its fortune its unsurpassable conditions and imparting to every object and element to the motion and expression of every floating hurrying panting thing to the throb of ferries and tugs to the plash of waves and the play of winds and the glint of lights and the shrill of whistles and the quality and authority of breezeborne cries all practically a diffused wasted clamour of detonations something of its sharp free accent and above all of its sovereign sense of being backed and able to back the universal applied passion struck me as shining unprecedentedly out of the composition in the bigness and bravery and insolence especially of everything that rushed and shrieked in the air as of a great intricate frenzied dance half merry half desperate or at least half defiant performed on the huge watery floor this appearance of the bold lacingtogether across the waters of the scattered members of the monstrous organism lacing as by the ceaseless play of an enormous system of steamshuttles or electric bobbins i scarce know what to call them commensurate in form with their infinite work does perhaps more than anything else to give the pitch of the vision of energy one has the sense that the monster grows and grows flinging abroad its loose limbs even as some unmannered young giant at his larks and that the binding stitches must for ever fly further and faster and draw harder the future complexity of the web all under the sky and over the sea becoming thus that of some colossal set of clockworks some steelsouled machineroom of brandished arms and hammering fists and opening and closing jaws the immeasurable bridges are but as the horizontal sheaths of pistons working at high pressure day and night and subject one apprehends with perhaps inconsistent gloom to certain to fantastic to merciless multiplication in the light of this apprehension indeed the breezy brightness of the bay puts on the semblance of the vast white page that awaits beyond any other perhaps the black overscoring of science let me hasten to add that its present whiteness is precisely its charming note the frankest of the signs you recognize and remember it by that is the distinction i was just feeling my way to name as the main ground of its doing so well for effect without technical scenery there are great imposing ports glasgow and liverpool and london that have already their page blackened almost beyond redemption from any such light of the picturesque as can hope to irradiate fog and grime and there are others marseilles and constantinople say or for all i know to the contrary new orleans that contrive to abound before everything else in colour and so to make a rich and instant and obvious show but memory and the actual impression keep investing new york with the tone predominantly of summer dawns and winter frosts of seafoam of bleached sails and stretched awnings of blanched hulls of scoured decks of new ropes of polished brasses of streamers clear in the blue air and it is by this harmony doubtless that the projection of the individual character of the place of the candour of its avidity and the freshness of its audacity is most conveyed the tall buildings which have so promptly usurped a glory that affects you as rather surprised as yet at itself the multitudinous skyscrapers standing up to the view from the water like extravagant pins in a cushion already overplanted and stuck in as in the dark anywhere and anyhow have at least the felicity of carrying out the fairness of tone of taking the sun and the shade in the manner of towers of marble they are not all of marble i believe by any means even if some may be but they are impudently new and still more impudently novel this in common with so many other terrible things in america and they are triumphant payers of dividends all of which uncontested and unabashed pride with flash of innumerable windows and flicker of subordinate gilt attributions is like the flare up and down their long narrow faces of the lamps of some general permanent celebration you see the pincushion in profile so to speak on passing between jersey city and twentythird street but you get it broadside on this loose nosegay of architectural flowers if you skirt the battery well out and embrace the whole plantation then the american beauty the rose of interminable stem becomes the token of the cluster at large to that degree that positively this is all that is wanted for emphasis of your final impression such growths you feel have confessedly arisen but to be picked in time with a shears nipped short off by waiting fate as soon as science applied to gain has put upon the table from far up its sleeve some more winning card crowned not only with no history but with no credible possibility of time for history and consecrated by no uses save the commercial at any cost they are simply the most piercing notes in that concert of the expensively provisional into which your supreme sense of new york resolves itself they never begin to speak to you in the manner of the builded majesties of the world as we have heretofore known such towers or temples or fortresses or palaces with the authority of things of permanence or even of things of long duration one story is good only till another is told and skyscrapers are the last word of economic ingenuity only till another word be written this shall be possibly a word of still uglier meaning but the vocabulary of thrift at any price shows boundless resources and the consciousness of that truth the consciousness of the finite the menaced the essentially invented state twinkles ever to my perception in the thousand glassy eyes of these giants of the mere market such a structure as the comparatively windowless belltower of giotto in florence looks supremely serene in its beauty you dont feel it to have risen by the breath of an interested passion that restless beyond all passions is for ever seeking more pliable forms beauty has been the object of its creators idea and having found beauty it has found the form in which it splendidly rests beauty indeed was the aim of the creator of the spire of trinity church so cruelly overtopped and so barely distinguishable from your trainbearing barge as you stand off in its abject helpless humility and it may of course be asked how much of this superstition finds voice in the actual shrunken presence of that laudable effort where for the eye is the felicity of simplified gothic of noble preeminence that once made of this highlypleasing edifice the pride of the town and the feature of broadway the answer is as obviously that these charming elements are still there just where they ever were but that they have been mercilessly deprived of their visibility it aches and throbs this smothered visibility we easily feel in its caged and dishonoured condition supported only by the consciousness that the dishonour is no fault of its own we commune with it in tenderness and pity through the encumbered air our eyes made however unwillingly at home in strange vertiginous upper atmospheres look down on it as on a poor ineffectual thing an architectural object addressed even in its prime aspiration to the patient pedestrian sense and permitting thereby a relation of intimacy it was to speak to me audibly enough on two or three other occasions even through the thick of that frenzy of broadway just where broadway receives from wall street the fiercest application of the maddening lash it was to put its tragic case there with irresistible lucidity yes the wretched figure i am making is as little as you see my fault it is the fault of the buildings whose very first care is to deprive churches of their visibility there are but two or three two or three outward and visible churches left in new york anyway as you must have noticed and even they are hideously threatened a fact at which no one indeed appears to be shocked from which no one draws the least of the inferences that stick straight out of it which every one seems in short to take for granted either with remarkable stupidity or with remarkable cynicism so at any rate they may still effectively communicate ruddybrown where not brownyblack old trinity and any pausing any attending survivor of the clearer age and there is yet more of the bitterness of history to be tasted in such a tacit passage as i shall presently show was it not the bitterness of history meanwhile that on that day of circumnavigation that day of highest intensity of impression of which i began by speaking the ancient rotunda of castle garden viewed from just opposite should have lurked there as a vague nonentity one had known it from far far back and with the indelibility of the childish vision from the time when it was the commodious concerthall of new york the firmament of longextinguished stars in spite of which extinction there outlives for me the image of the infant phenomenon adelina patti whom another largeeyed infant i had been benevolently taken to hear adelina patti in a fanlike little white frock and pantalettes and a hussarlike red jacket mounted on an armchair its back supporting her wheeled to the front of the stage and warbling like a tiny thrush even in the nest shabby shrunken barely discernible today the ancient rotunda adjusted to other uses had afterwards for many decades carried on a conspicuous life and it was the present remoteness the repudiated barbarism of all this foreshortened by ones own experience that dropped the acid into the cup the skyscrapers and the leaguelong bridges present and to come marked the point where the age the age for which castle garden could have been in its day a value had come out that in itself was nothing ages do come out as a matter of course so far from where they have gone in but it had done so the latter half of the nineteenth century in ones own more or less immediate presence the difference from pole to pole was so vivid and concrete that no single shade of any one of its aspects was lost this impact of the whole condensed past at once produced a horrible hateful sense of personal antiquity yet was it after all that those monsters of the mere market as i have called them had more to say on the question of effect than i had at first allowed since they are the element that looms largest for me through a particular impression with remembered parts and pieces melting together rather richly now of downtown seen and felt from the inside felt i use that word i dare say all presumptuously for a relation to matters of magnitude and mystery that i could begin neither to measure nor to penetrate hovering about them only in magnanimous wonder staring at them as at a world of immovablyclosed doors behind which immense material lurked material for the artist the painter of life as we say who shouldnt have begun so early and so fatally to fall away from possible initiations this sense of a baffled curiosity an intellectual adventure forever renounced was surely enough a state of feeling and indeed in presence of the different halfhours as memory presents them at which i gave myself up both to the thrill of wall street by which i mean that of the whole wide edge of the whirlpool and the too accepted too irredeemable ignorance i am at a loss to see what intensity of response was wanting the imagination might have responded more if there had been a slightly less settled inability to understand what every one what any one was really doing but the picture as it comes back to me is for all this foolish subjective poverty so crowded with its features that i rejoice i confess in not having more of them to handle no open apprehension even if it be as open as a public vehicle plying for hire can carry more than a certain amount of life of a kind and there was nothing at play in the outer air at least of the scene during these glimpses that didnt scramble for admission into mine very much as i had seen the mob seeking entrance to an uptown or a downtown electric car fight for life at one of the apertures if it had been the final function of the bay to make one feel ones age so assuredly the mouth of wall street proclaimed it for ones private ear distinctly enough the breath of existence being taken wherever one turned as that of youth on the run and with the prize of the race in sight and the new landmarks crushing the old quite as violent children stamp on snails and caterpillars the hour i first recall was a morning of winter drizzle and mist of dense fog in the bay one of the strangest sights of which i was on my way to enjoy and i had stopped in the heart of the business quarter to pick up a friend who was to be my companion the weather such as it was worked wonders for the upper reaches of the buildings round which it drifted and hung very much as about the flanks and summits of emergent mountainmasses for to be just all round there was some evidence of their having a message for the eyes let me parenthesize once for all that there are other glimpses of this message up and down the city frequently to be caught lights and shades of winter and summer air of the literally finishing afternoon in particular when refinement of modelling descends from the skies and lends the white towers all new and crude and commercial and overwindowed as they are a fleeting distinction the morning i speak of offered me my first chance of seeing one of them from the inside which was an opportunity i sought again repeatedly in respect to others and i became conscious of the force with which this vision of their prodigious working and of the multitudinous life as if each were a swarming city in itself that they are capable of housing may beget on the part of the free observer in other words of the restless analyst the impulse to describe and present the facts and express the sense of them each of these huge constructed and compressed communities throbbing through its myriad arteries and pores with a single passion even as a complicated watch throbs with the one purpose of telling you the hour and the minute testified overwhelmingly to the character of new york and the passion of the restless analyst on his side is for the extraction of character but there would be too much to say just here were this incurable eccentric to let himself go the impression in question fed by however brief an experience kept overflowing the cup and spreading in a wide waste of speculation i must dip into these depths if it prove possible later on let me content myself for the moment with remembering how from the first on all such ground my thought went straight to poor great wonderworking emile zola and his love of the human aggregation the artificial microcosm which had to spend itself on great shops great businesses great apartmenthouses of inferior of mere parisian scale his image it seemed to me really asked for compassion in the presence of this material that his energy of evocation his alone would have been of a stature to meddle with what if le ventre de paris what if au bonheur des dames what if potbouille and largent could but have come into being under the new york inspiration the answer to that however for the hour was that in all probability new york was not going as it turns such remarks to produce both the maximum of business spectacle and the maximum of ironic reflection of it zolas huge reflector got itself formed after all in a far other air it had hung there in essence awaiting the scene that was to play over it long before the scene really approached it in scale the reflecting surfaces of the ironic of the epic order suspended in the new york atmosphere have yet to show symptoms of shining out and the monstrous phenomena themselves meanwhile strike me as having with their immense momentum got the start got ahead of in proper parlance any possibility of poetic of dramatic capture that conviction came to me most perhaps while i gazed across at the special skyscraper that overhangs poor old trinity to the north a south face as high and wide as the mountainwall that drops the alpine avalanche from time to time upon the village and the village spire at its foot the interest of this case being above all as i learned to my stupefaction in the fact that the very creators of the extinguisher are the churchwardens themselves or at least the trustees of the church property what was the case but magnificent for pitiless ferocity that inexorable law of the growing invisibility of churches their everywhere reduced or abolished presence which is ninetenths of their virtue receiving thus at such hands its supreme consecration this consecration was positively the greater that just then as i have said the vast moneymaking structure quite horribly quite romantically justified itself looming through the weather with an insolent clifflike sublimity the weather for all that experience mixes intimately with the fulness of my impression speaking not least for instance of the way the state of the streets and the assault of the turbid air seemed all one with the look the tramp the whole quality and allure the consummate monotonous commonness of the pushing male crowd moving in its dense mass with the confusion carried to chaos for any intelligence any perception a welter of objects and sounds in which relief detachment dignity meaning perished utterly and lost all rights it appeared the muddy medium all one with every other element and note as well all the signs of the heaped industrial battlefield all the sounds and silences grim pushing trudging silences too of the universal will to move to move move move as an end in itself an appetite at any price in the bay the rest of the morning the dense raw fog that delayed the big boat allowing sight but of the immediate icemasses through which it thumped its way was not less of the essence anything blander as a medium would have seemed a mockery of the facts of the terrible little ellis island the first harbour of refuge and stage of patience for the million or so of immigrants annually knocking at our official door before this door which opens to them there only with a hundred forms and ceremonies grindings and grumblings of the key they stand appealing and waiting marshalled herded divided subdivided sorted sifted searched fumigated for longer or shorter periods the effect of all which prodigious process an intendedly scientific feeding of the mill is again to give the earnest observer a thousand more things to think of than he can pretend to retail the impression of ellis island in fine would be as i was to find throughout that so many of my impressions would be a chapter by itself and with a particular page for recognition of the degree in which the liberal hospitality of the eminent commissioner of this wonderful service to whom i had been introduced helped to make the interest of the whole watched drama poignant and unforgettable it is a drama that goes on without a pause day by day and year by year this visible act of ingurgitation on the part of our body politic and social and constituting really an appeal to amazement beyond that of any swordswallowing or fireswallowing of the circus the wonder that one couldnt keep down was the thought that these two or three hours of ones own chance vision of the business were but as a tick or two of the mighty clock the clock that never never stops least of all when it strikes for a sign of so much windingup some louder hour of our national fate than usual i think indeed that the simplest account of the action of ellis island on the spirit of any sensitive citizen who may have happened to look in is that he comes back from his visit not at all the same person that he went he has eaten of the tree of knowledge and the taste will be for ever in his mouth he had thought he knew before thought he had the sense of the degree in which it is his american fate to share the sanctity of his american consciousness the intimacy of his american patriotism with the inconceivable alien but the truth had never come home to him with any such force in the lurid light projected upon it by those courts of dismay it shakes him or i like at least to imagine it shakes him to the depths of his being i like to think of him i positively have to think of him as going about ever afterwards with a new look for those who can see it in his face the outward sign of the new chill in his heart so is stamped for detection the questionably privileged person who has had an apparition seen a ghost in his supposedly safe old house let not the unwary therefore visit ellis island the aftersense of that acute experience however i myself found was by no means to be brushed away i felt it grow and grow on the contrary wherever i turned other impressions might come and go but this affirmed claim of the alien however immeasurably alien to share in ones supreme relation was everywhere the fixed clement the reminder not to be dodged ones supreme relation as one had always put it was ones relation to ones country a conception made up so largely of ones countrymen and ones countrywomen thus it was as if all the while with such a fond tradition of what these products predominantly were the idea of the country itself underwent something of that profane overhauling through which it appears to suffer the indignity of change is not our instinct in this matter in general essentially the safe one that of keeping the idea simple and strong and continuous so that it shall be perfectly sound to touch it overmuch to pull it about is to put it in peril of weakening yet on this free assault upon it this readjustment of it in their monstrous presumptuous interest the aliens in new york seemed perpetually to insist the combination there of their quantity and their quality that loud primary stage of alienism which new york most offers to sight operates for the native as their note of settled possession something they have nobody to thank for so that unsettled possession is what we on our side seem reduced to the implication of which in its turn is that to recover confidence and regain lost ground we not they must make the surrender and accept the orientation we must go in other words more than halfway to meet them which is all the difference for us between possession and dispossession this sense of dispossession to be brief about it haunted me so i was to feel in the new york streets and in the packed trajectiles to which one clingingly appeals from the streets just as one tumbles back into the streets in appalled reaction from them that the art of beguiling or duping it became an art to be cultivated though the fond alternative vision was never long to be obscured the imagination exasperated to envy of the ideal in the order in question of the luxury of some such close and sweet and whole national consciousness as that of the switzer and the scot ii my recovery of impressions after a short interval yet with their flush a little faded may have been judged to involve itself with excursions of memory memory directed to the antecedent time reckless almost to extravagance but i recall them today none the less for that value in them which ministered at happy moments to an artful evasion of the actual there was no escape from the ubiquitous alien into the future or even into the present there was an escape but into the past i count as quite a triumph in this interest an unbroken ease of frequentation of that ancient end of fifth avenue to the whole neighbourhood of which ones earlier vibrations a very faraway matter now were attuned the precious stretch of space between washington square and fourteenth street had a value had even a charm for the revisiting spirit a mild and melancholy glamour which i am conscious of the difficulty of rendering for new and heedless generations here again the assault of suggestion is too great too large i mean the number of hares started before the pursuing imagination the quickened memory by this fact of the felt moral and social value of this comparatively unimpaired morsel of the fifth avenue heritage its reference to a pleasanter easier hazier past is absolutely comparative just as the past in question itself enjoys as such the merest courtesytitle it is all recent history enough by the measure of the whole and there are flaws and defacements enough surely even in its appearance of decency of duration the tall building grossly tall and grossly ugly has failed of an admirable chance of distinguished consideration for it and the dignity of many of its peaceful fronts has succumbed to the presence of those industries whose foremost need is to make a good thing of them the good thing is doubtless being made and yet this lower end of the once agreeable street still just escapes being a wholly bad thing what held the fancy in thrall however as i say was the admonition proceeding from all the facts that values of this romantic order are at best anywhere strangely relative it was an extraordinary statement on the subject of new york that the space between fourteenth street and washington square should count for tone figure as the old ivory of an overscored tablet true wisdom i found was to let it to make it so count and figure as much as it would and charming assistance came for this i also found from the young goodnature of may and june there had been neither assistance nor goodnature during the grim weeks of midwinter there had been but the meagre fact of a discomfort and an ugliness less formidable here than elsewhere when toward the top of the town circulation alimentation recreation every art of existence gave way before the full onset of winter when the upper avenues had become as so many congested bottlenecks through which the wine of life simply refused to be decanted getting back to these latitudes resembled really a return from the north pole to the temperate zone it was as if the wine of life had been poured for you in advance into some pleasant old punchbowl that would support you through the temporary stress your condition was not reduced to the endless vista of a clogged tube of a thoroughfare occupied as to the narrow central ridge with trolleycars stuffed to suffocation and as to the mere margin on either side with snowbanks resulting from the cleared rails and offering themselves as a field for all remaining action free existence and good manners in new york are too much brought down to a bare rigour of marginal relation to the endless electric coil the monstrous chain that winds round the general neck and body the general middle and legs very much as the boaconstrictor winds round the group of the laocoon it struck me that when these folds are tightened in the terrible stricture of the snowsmothered months of the year the new york predicament leaves far behind the anguish represented in the vatican figures to come and go where east eleventh street where west tenth opened their kind short arms was at least to keep clear of the awful hug of the serpent and this was a grace that grew large as i have hinted with the approach of summer and that made in the afternoons of may and of the first half of june above all an insidious appeal there i repeat was the delicacy there the mystery there the wonder in especial of the unquenchable intensity of the impressions received in childhood they are made then once for all be their intrinsic beauty interest importance small or great the stamp is indelible and never wholly fades this in fact gives it an importance when a lifetime has intervened i found myself intimately recognizing every house my officious tenth year had in the way of imagined adventure introduced to me incomparable master of ceremonies after all the privilege had been offered since to millions of other objects that had made nothing of it that had gone as they came so that here were fifth avenue corners with which ones connection was fairly exquisite the lowered light of the days ends of early summer became them moreover exceedingly and they fell for the quiet northward perspective into a dozen delicacies of composition and tone one could talk of quietness now for the shrinkage of life so marked in the higher latitudes of the town after easter the visible early flight of that society which by the old custom used never to budge before june or july had almost the effect of clearing some of the streets and indeed of suggesting that a truly clear new york might have an unsuspected charm or two to put forth an approach to peace and harmony might have been in a manner promised and the sense of other days took advantage of it to steal abroad with a ghostly tread it kept meeting half the time to its discomfiture the lamentable little arch of triumph which bestrides these beginnings of washington square lamentable because of its poor and lonely and unsupported and unaffiliated state with this melancholy monument it could make no terms at all but turned its back to the strange sight as often as possible helping itself thereby moreover to do a little of the pretending required no doubt by the fond theory that nothing hereabouts was changed nothing was it could occasionally appear to me there was no new note in the picture not one for instance when i paused before a low house in a small row on the south side of waverley place and lived again into the queer medieval costume preserved by the daguerreotypists art of the very little boy for whom the scene had once embodied the pangs and pleasures of a dames small school the dame must have been irish by her name and the irish tradition only intensified and coarsened seemed still to possess the place the fact of survival the sturdy sameness of which arrested me again and again to fascination the shabby red house with its mere two storeys its lowly stoop its dislocated ironwork of the forties the early fifties the record in its face of blistering summers and of the long stages of the loss of selfrespect made it as consummate a morsel of the old liquorscented heatedlooking city the city of no pavements but of such a plenty of politics as i could have desired and neighbouring sixth avenue overstraddled though it might be with feats of engineering unknown to the primitive age that otherwise so persisted wanted only to carry off the illusion the warm smell of the bakery on the corner of eighth street a blessed repository of doughnuts cookies creamcakes and pies the slow passing by which on returns from school must have had much in common with the experience of the shipmen of old who came in long voyages while they tacked and hung back upon those belts of ocean that are haunted with the balm and spice of tropic islands these were the felicities of the backward reach which however had also its melancholy checks and snubs nowhere quite so sharp as in presence so to speak of the rudely the ruthlessly suppressed birthhouse on the other side of the square that was where the pretence that nearly nothing was changed had most to come in for a high square impersonal structure proclaiming its lack of interest with a crudity all its own so blocks at the right moment for its own success the view of the past that the effect for me in washington place was of having been amputated of half my history the grey and more or less hallowed university building wasnt it somehow with a desperate bravery both castellated and gabled has vanished from the earth and vanished with it the two or three adjacent houses of which the birthplace was one this was the snub for the complacency of retrospect that whereas the inner sense had positively erected there for its private contemplation a commemorative mural tablet the very wall that should have borne this inscription had been smashed as for demonstration that tablets in new york are unthinkable and i have had indeed to permit myself this free fantasy of the hypothetic rescued identity of a given house taking the vanished number in washington place as most pertinent in order to invite the reader to gasp properly with me before the fact that we not only fail to remember in the whole length of the city one of these frontal records of birth sojourn or death under a celebrated name but that we have only to reflect an instant to see any such form of civic piety inevitably and for ever absent the form is cultivated to the greatly quickened interest of streetscenery in many of the cities of europe and is it not verily bitter for those who feel a poetry in the noted passage longer or shorter here and there of great lost spirits that the institution the profit the glory of any such association is denied in advance to communities tending as the phrase is to run preponderantly to the skyscraper where in fact is the point of inserting a mural tablet at any legible height in a building certain to be destroyed to make room for a skyscraper and from where on the other hand in a facade of fifty floors does one see the pious plate recording the honour attached to one of the apartments look down on a responsive people we have but to ask the question to recognize our necessary failure to answer it as a supremely characteristic local note a note in the light of which the great city is projected into its future as practically a huge continuous fiftyfloored conspiracy against the very idea of the ancient graces those that strike us as having flourished just in proportion as the parts of life and the signs of character have not been lumped together not been indistinguishably sunk in the common fund of mere economic convenience so interesting as objectlessons may the developments of the american gregarious ideal become so traceable at every turn to the restless analyst at least are the heavy footprints in the finer texture of life of a great commercial democracy seeking to abound supremely in its own sense and having none to gainsay it let me not however forget amid such contemplations what may serve here as a much more relevant instance of the operation of values the price of the as yet undiminished dignity of the two most southward of the fifth avenue churches half the charm of the prospect at that extremity is in their still being there and being as they are this charm this serenity of escape and survival positively works as a blind on the side of the question of their architectural importance the last shade of pedantry or priggishness drops from your view of that element they illustrate again supremely your grasped truth of the comparative character in such conditions of beauty and of interest the special standard they may or may not square with signifies you feel not a jot all you know and want to know is that they are probably menaced some horrible voice of the air has murmured it and that with them will go if fate overtakes them the last cases worth mentioning with a single exception of the modest felicity that sometimes used to be remarkable certainly the state of things in which mere exemption from the squashed condition can shed such a glamour but we may accept the state of things if only we can keep the glamour undispelled it reached its maximum for me i hasten to add on my penetrating into the ascension at chosen noon and standing for the first time in presence of that noble work of john la farge the representation on the west wall in the grand manner of the theological event from which the church takes its title wonderful enough in new york to find ones sell in a charming and considerably dim old church hushed to admiration before a great religious picture the sensation for the moment upset so all the facts the hot light outside might have been that of an italian piazzetta the cool shade within with the important work of art shining through it seemed part of some otherworld pilgrimage all the more that the important work of art itself a thing of the highest distinction spoke as soon as one had taken it in with that authority which makes the difference ever afterwards between the remembered and the forgotten quest a rich note of interference came i admit through the splendid windowglass the finest of which unsurpassably fine to my sense is the work of the same artist so that the church as it stands is very nearly as commemorative a monument as a great reputation need wish the deeply pictorial windows in which clearness of picture and fulness of expression consort so successfully with a tone as of magnified gems did not strike one as looking into a yellow little square of the souththey put forth a different implication but the flaw in the harmony was more than anything else that sinister voice of the air of which i have spoken the fact that one could stand there vibrating to such impressions only to remember the suspended danger the possibility of the doom here was the loveliest cluster of images begotten on the spot that the preoccupied city had ever taken thought to offer itself and here to match them like some black shadow they had been condemned to cast was this particular prepared honour of removal that appeared to hover about them ones fear i repeat was perhaps misplaced but what an air to live in the shuddering pilgrim mused the air in which such fears are not misplaced only when we are conscious of very special reassurances the vision of the doom that does descend that had descended all round was at all events for the halfhour all that was wanted to charge with the last tenderness ones memory of the transfigured interior afterwards outside again and again the powers of removal struck me as looming awfully in the newest mass of multiplied floors and windows visible at this point they ranged in this terrible recent erection were going to bring in money and was not money the only thing a selfrespecting structure could be thought of as bringing in hadnt one heard just before in boston that the security that the sweet serenity of the park street church charmingest there of aboriginal notes the very light with its perfect position and its dear old delightful wrenlike spire of the starved citys eyes had been artfully practised against and that the question of saving it might become in the near future acute nothing fortunately i think is so much the making of new york at its central point for the visual almost for the romantic sense as the park street church is the making by its happy comingin of boston and therefore if it were thinkable that the peculiar rectitude of boston might be laid in the dust what mightnt easily come about for the reputedly less austere conscience of new york once such questions had obtained lodgment to take ones walks was verily to look at almost everything in their light and to commune with the skyscraper under this influence was really to feel worsted more and more in any magnanimous attempt to adopt the aesthetic view of it i may appear to make too much of these invidious presences but it must be remembered that they represent for our time the only claim to any consideration other than merely statistical established by the resounding growth of new york the attempt to take the aesthetic view is invariably blighted sooner or later by their most salient characteristic the feature that speaks loudest for the economic idea window upon window at any cost is a condition never to be reconciled with any grace of building and the logic of the matter here happens to put on a particularly fatal front if quiet interspaces always half the architectural battle exist no more in such a structural scheme than quiet tones blest breathingspaces occur for the most part in new york conversation so the reason is demonstrably that the building cant afford them it is by very much the same law one supposes that new york conversation cannot afford stops the building can only afford lights each light having a superlative value as all aid to the transaction of business and the conclusion of sharp bargains doesnt it take in fact acres of windowglass to help even an expert new yorker to get the better of another expert one or to see that the other expert one doesnt get the better of him it is easy to conceive that after all with this origin and nature stamped upon their foreheads the last word of the mercenary monsters should not be their address to our sense of formal beauty still as i have already hinted there was always the case of the one other rescued identity and preserved felicity the happy accident of the elder day still ungrudged and finally legitimated when i say ungrudged indeed i seem to remember how i had heard that the divine little city hall had been grudged at a critical moment to within an inch of its life had but just escaped in the event the extremity of grudging it lives on securely by the mercy of fate lives on in the delicacy of its beauty speaking volumes again more volumes distinctly than are anywhere else spoken for the exquisite truth of the conferred value of interesting objects the value derived from the social the civilizing function for which they have happened to find their opportunity it is the opportunity that gives them their price and the luck of there being round about them nothing greater than themselves to steal it away from them they strike thus virtually the supreme note and such is the mysterious play of our finer sensibility one takes this note one is glad to work it as the phrase goes for all it is worth i so work the note of the city hall no doubt in speaking of the spectacle there constituted as divine but i do it precisely by reason of the spectacle taken with the delightful small facts of the building largely by reason in other words of the elegant the gallant little structures situation and history the way it has played artistically ornamentally its part has held out for the good cause through the long years alone and unprotected the fact is it has been the very centre of that assault of vulgarity of which the innumerable mementos rise within view of it and tower at a certain distance over it and yet it has never parted with a square inch of its character it has forced them in a manner to stand off i hasten to add that in expressing thus its uncompromised state i speak of its outward its aesthetic character only so at all events it has discharged the civilizing function i just named as inherent in such cases that of representing to the community possessed of it all the style the community is likely to get and of making itself responsible for the same the consistency of this effort under difficulties has been the story that brings tears to the eyes of the hovering kindly critic and it is through his tears no doubt that such a personage reads the best passages of the tale and makes out the proportions of the object mine i recognize didnt prevent my seeing that the pale yellow marble or whatever it may be of the city hall has lost by some late excoriation the remembered charm of its old surface the pleasant promiscuous patina of time but the perfect taste and finish the reduced yet ample scale the harmony of parts the just proportions the modest classic grace the living look of the type aimed at these things with gaiety of detail undiminished and quaintness of effect augmented are all there and i see them as i write in that glow of appreciation which made it necessary of a fine june morning that i should somehow pay the whole place my respects the simplest in fact the only way was obviously to pass under the charming portico and brave the consequences this impunity of such audacities being in america one of the last of the lessons the repatriated absentee finds himself learning the crushed spirit he brings back from european discipline never quite rises to the height of the native argument the brave sense that the public the civic building is his very own for any honest use so that he may tread even its most expensive pavements and staircases and very expensive for the american citizen these have lately become without a question asked this further and further unchallenged penetration begets in the perverted person i speak of a really romantic thrill it is like some assault of the dim seraglio with the guards bribed the eunuchs drugged and ones life carried in ones hand the only drawback to such freedom is that penetralia it is so easy to penetrate fail a little of a due impressiveness and that if stationed sentinels are bad for the temper of the freeman they are good for the prestige of the building never in any case it seemed to me had any freeman made so free with the majesty of things as i was to make on this occasion with the mysteries of the city hall even to the point of coming out into the presence of the representative of the highest office with which city halls are associated and whose thoroughly gracious condonation of my act set the seal of success upon the whole adventure its dizziest intensity in fact sprang precisely from the unexpected view opened into the old official the old so thickpeopled local municipal world upper chambers of council and state delightfully of their nineteenthcentury time as to design and ornament in spite of rank restoration but replete above all with portraits of past worthies past celebrities and city fathers mayors bosses presidents governors statesmen at large generals and commodores at large florid hosts looking so unsophisticated now of years not remarkable municipally for the absence of sophistication here were types running mainly to ugliness and all bristling with the taste of their day and the quite touching provincialism of their conditions as to many of which nothing would be more interesting than a study of new york annals in the light of their personal look their very noses and mouths and complexions and heads of hair to say nothing of their waistcoats and neckties with such colour such sound and movement would the thick stream of local history then be interfused wouldnt its thickness fairly become transparent since to walk through the collection was not only to see and feel so much that had happened but to understand with the truth again and again inimitably pointed why nothing could have happened otherwise the whole array thus presenting itself as an unsurpassed demonstration of the real reasons of things the florid ghosts look out from their exceedingly gilded frames all that that can do is bravely done for them with the frankest responsibility for everything their collective presence becomes a kind of copious telltale document signed with a hundred names there are few of these that at this hour i think we particularly desire to repeat but the place where they may be read is all the way from river to river and from the battery to harlem the place in which there is most of the terrible town iii if the bay had seemed to me as i have noted most to help the fond observer of new york aspects to a sense through the eyes of embracing possession so the part played there for the outward view found its match for the inward in the portentous impression of one of the great caravansaries administered to me of a winter afternoon i say with intention administered on so assiduous a guide through the endless labyrinth of the waldorfastoria was i happily to chance after turning out of the early dusk and the january sleet and slosh into permitted into enlightened contemplation of a pandemonium not less admirably ordered to all appearance than rarely intermitted the seer of great cities is liable to easy error i know when he finds this that or the other caught glimpse the supremely significant one and i am willing to preface with that remark my confession that new york told me more of her story at once then and there than she was again and elsewhere to tell with this apprehension that she was in fact fairly shrieking it into ones ears came a curiosity corresponding as to its kind and its degree of interest so that there was nought to do as we picked our tortuous way but to stare with all our eyes and miss as little as possible of the revelation that harshness of the essential conditions the outward which almost any large attempt at the amenities in new york has to take account of and make the best of has at least the effect of projecting the visitor with force upon the spectacle prepared for him at this particular point and of marking the more its sudden high pitch the character of violence which all its warmth its colour and glitter so completely muffle there is violence outside mitigating sadly the frontal majesty of the monument leaving it exposed to the vulgar assault of the street by the operation of those dire facts of absence of margin of meagreness of site of the brevity of the block of the inveteracy of the near thoroughfare which leave style in construction at the mercy of the impertinent crossstreets make detachment and independence save in the rarest cases an insoluble problem preclude without pity any element of court or garden and open to the builder in quest of distinction the one alternative and the great adventure of seeking his reward in the sky of their licence to pursue it there to any extent whatever new yorkers are i think a trifle too assertively proud no court of approach no interspace worth mention ever forming meanwhile part of the groundplan or helping to receive the force of the breaking public wave new york pays at this rate the penalty of her primal topographic curse her old inconceivably bourgeois scheme of composition and distribution the uncorrected labour of minds with no imagination of the future and blind before the opportunity given them by their two magnificent waterfronts this original sin of the longitudinal avenues perpetually yet meanly intersected and of the organized sacrifice of the indicated alternative the great perspectives from east to west might still have earned forgiveness by some occasional departure from its pettifogging consistency but thanks to this consistency the city is of all great cities the least endowed with any blest item of stately square or goodly garden with any happy accident or surprise any fortunate nook or casual corner any deviation in fine into the liberal or the charming that way however for the regenerate filial mind madness may be said to lie the way of imagining what might have been and putting it all together in the light of what so helplessly is one of the things that helplessly are for instance is just this assault of the street as i have called it upon any direct dealing with our caravansary the electric cars with their double track are everywhere almost as tight a fit in the narrow channel of the roadway as the projectile in the bore of a gun so that the waldorfastoria sitting by this absent margin for life with her open lap and arms is reduced to confessing with a strained smile across the traffic and the danger how little outside her mere swingdoor she can do for you she seems to admit that the attempt to get at her may cost you your safety but reminds you at the same time that any good american and even any good inquiring stranger is supposed willing to risk that boon for her un bon mouvement therefore you must make a dash for it but youll see im worth it if such a claim as this last be ever justified it would indubitably be justified here the survivor scrambling out of the current and up the bank finds in the amplitude of the entertainment awaiting him an instant sense as of applied restoratives the amazing hotelworld quickly closes round him with the process of transition reduced to its minimum he is transported to conditions of extraordinary complexity and brilliancy operating and with proportionate perfection by laws of their own and expressing after their fashion a complete scheme of life the air swarms to intensity with the characteristic the characteristic condensed and accumulated as he rarely elsewhere has had the luck to find it it jumps out to meet his every glance and this unanimity of its spring of all its aspects and voices is what i just now referred to as the essence of the loud new york story that effect of violence in the whole communication at which i thus hint results from the inordinate mass the quantity of presence as it were of the testimony heaped together for emphasis of the wondrous moral the moral in question the high interest of the tale is that you are in presence of a revelation of the possibilities of the hotel for which the american spirit has found so unprecedented a use and a value leading it on to express so a social indeed positively an aesthetic ideal and making it so at this supreme pitch a synonym for civilization for the capture of conceived manners themselves that one is verily tempted to ask if the hotelspirit may not just be the american spirit most seeking and most finding itself that truth the truth that the present is more and more the day of the hotel had not waited to burst on the mind at the view of this particular establishment we have all more or less been educated to it the world over by the fruitbearing action of the american example in consequence of which it has been opened to us to see still other societies moved by the same irresistible spring and trying with whatever grace and ease they may bring to the business to unlearn as many as possible of their old social canons and in especial their old discrimination in favour of the private life the business for them for communities to which the american ease in such matters is not native goes much less of itself and produces as yet a scantier show the great difference with the american show being that in the united states every one is for the lubrication of the general machinery practically in everything whereas in europe mostly it is only certain people who are in anything so that the machinery so much less generalized works in a smaller stiffer way this one caravansary makes the american case vivid gives it you feel that quantity of illustration which renders the place a new thing under the sun it is an expression of the gregarious state breaking down every barrier but two one of which the barrier consisting of the high pecuniary tax is the immediately obvious the other the rather more subtle is the condition for any member of the flock that he or she in other words especially she be presumably respectable be that is not discoverably anything else the rigour with which any appearance of pursued or desired adventure is kept down adventure in the florid sense of the word the sense in which it remains an euphemism is not the least interesting note of the whole immense promiscuity protected at those two points the promiscuity carries through the rest of the range everything before it it sat there it walked and talked and ate and drank and listened and danced to music and otherwise revelled and roamed and bought and sold and came and went there all on its own splendid terms and with an encompassing material splendour a wealth and variety of constituted picture and background that might well feed it with the finest illusions about itself it paraded through halls and saloons in which art and history in masquerading dress muffled almost to suffocation as in the gold brocade of their pretended majesties and their conciliatory graces stood smirking on its passage with the last cynicism of hypocrisy the exhibition is wonderful for that for the suggested sense of a promiscuity which manages to be at the same time an inordinate untempered monotony manages to be so on such ground as this by an extraordinary trick of its own wherever one finds it the combination forms i think largely the very interest such as it is of these phases of the human scene in the united states if only for the pleasant puzzle of our wondering how when types aspects conditions have so much in common they should seem at all to make up a conscious miscellany that question however the question of the play and range the practical elasticity of the social sameness in america will meet us elsewhere on our path and i confess that all questions gave way in my mind to a single irresistible obsession this was just the ache of envy of the spirit of a society which had found there in its prodigious public setting so exactly what it wanted one was in presence as never before of a realized ideal and of that childlike rush of surrender to it and clutch at it which one was so repeatedly to recognize in america as the note of the supremely gregarious state it made the whole vision unforgettable and i am now carried back to it i confess in musing hours as to one of my few glimpses of perfect human felicity it had the admirable sign that it was precisely so comprehensively collective that it made so vividly in the old phrase for the greatest happiness of the greatest number its rare beauty one felt with instant clarity of perception was that it was for a mixed social manifestation blissfully exempt from any principle or possibility of disaccord with itself it was absolutely a fit to its conditions those conditions which were both its earth and its heaven and every part of the picture every item of the immense sum every wheel of the wondrous complexity was on the best terms with all the rest the sense of these things became for the hour as the golden glow in which ones envy burned and through which while the sleet and the slosh and the clangorous charge of cars and the hustling hustled crowds held the outer world one carried ones charmed attention from one chamber of the temple to another for that is how the place speaks as great constructed and achieved harmonies mostly speak as a temple builded with clustering chapels and shrines to an idea the hundreds and hundreds of people in circulation the innumerable hugehatted ladies in especial with their air of finding in the gilded and storied labyrinth the very firesides and pathways of home became thus the serene faithful whose rites one would no more have sceptically brushed than one would doff ones disguise in a mohammedan mosque the question of who they all might be seated under palms and by fountains or communing to some inimitable new york tune with the shade of marie antoinette in the queer recaptured actuality of an easy versailles or an intimate trianon such questions as that interesting in other societies and at other times insisted on yielding here to the mere eloquence of the general truth here was a social order in positively stable equilibrium here was a world whose relation to its form and medium was practically imperturbable here was a conception of publicity as the vital medium organized with the authority with which the american genius for organization put on its mettle alone could organize it the whole thing remains for me however i repeat a gorgeous golden blur a paradise peopled with unmistakable american shapes yet in which the general and the particular the organized and the extemporized the element of ingenuous joy below and of consummate management above melted together and left one uncertain which of them one was at a given turn of the maze most admiring when i reflect indeed that without my clue i should not have even known the maze should not have known at the given turn whether i was engulfed for instance in the vente de charite of the theatrical profession and the onset of persuasive peddling actresses or in the annual teaparty of german ladypatronesses of i know not what filling with their oriental opulence and their strange idiom a playhouse of the richest rococo where some other expensive anniversary the ball of a guild or the carouse of a club was to tread on their heels and instantly mobilize away their paraphernalia when i so reflect i see the sharpest dazzle of the eyes as precisely the play of the genius for organization there are a thousand forms of this ubiquitous american force the most ubiquitous of all that i was in no position to measure but there was often no resisting a vivid view of the form it may take on occasion under pressure of the native conception of the hotel encountered embodiments of the gift in this connection masterspirits of management whose influence was as the very air the very expensive air one breathed abide with me as the intensest examples of american character indeed as the very interesting supreme examples of a type which has even on the american ground doubtless not said its last word but which has at least treated itself there to a luxury of development it gives the impression when at all directly met of having at its service something of that fine flame that makes up personal greatness so that again and again as i found one would have liked to see it more intimately at work such failures of opportunity and of penetration however are but the daily bread of the visionary tourist whenever i dip back in fond memory none the less into the vision i have here attempted once more to call up i see the whole thing overswept as by the colossal extended arms waving the magical baton of some highstationed orchestral leader the absolute presiding power conscious of every note of every instrument controlling and commanding the whole volume of sound keeping the whole effect together and making it what it is what may one say of such a spirit if not that he understands so to speak the forces he sways understands his boundless american material and plays with it like a master indeed one sees it thus in its crude plasticity almost in the likeness of an army of puppets whose strings the wealth of his technical imagination teaches him innumerable ways of pulling and yet whose innocent whose always ingenuous agitation of their members he has found means to make them think of themselves as delightfully free and easy such was my impression of the perfection of the concert that for fear of its being spoiled by some chance false note i never went into the place again it might meanwhile seem no great adventure merely to walk the streets but beside the fact that there is in general never a better way of taking in life this pursuit irresistibly solicited on the least pretext the observer whose impressions i note accustomed as he had ever been conscientiously to yield to it more particularly with the relenting year when the breath of spring mildness being really installed appeared the one vague and disinterested presence in the place the one presence not vociferous and clamorous any definite presence that doesnt bellow and bang takes on in new york by that simple fact a distinction practically exquisite so that one goes forth to meet it as a guest of honour and that for my own experience i remember certain aimless strolls as snatches of intimate communion with the spirit of may and june as abounding almost to enchantment in the comparatively still condition two secrets at this time seemed to profit by that influence to tremble out one of these to the effect that new york would really have been meant to be charming and the other to the effect that the restless analyst willing at the lightest persuasion to let so much of its ugliness edge away unscathed from his analysis must have had for it from far back one of those loyalties that are beyond any reason its all very well the voice of the air seemed to say if i may so take it up its all very well to criticize but you distinctly take an interest and are the victim of your interest be the grounds of your perversity what they will you cant escape from it and dont you see that this precisely is what makes an adventure for you an adventure i admit as with some strident battered questionable beauty truly some bold bad charmer of almost any odd stroll or waste halfhour or other promiscuous passage that results for you in an impression there is always your bad habit of receiving through almost any accident of vision more impressions than you know what to do with but that for common convenience is your eternal handicap and may not be allowed to plead here against your special responsibility you care for the terrible town yea even for the horrible as i have overheard you call it or at least think it when you supposed no one would know and you see now how if you fly such fancies as that it was conceivably meant to be charming you are tangled by that weakness in some underhand imagination of its possibly one of these days as a riper fruit of time becoming so to do that you indeed sneakingly provide it must get away from itself but you are ready to follow its hypothetic dance even to the mainland and to the very end of its tether what makes the general relation of your adventure with it is that at bottom you are all the while wondering in presence of the aspects of its genius and its shame what elements or parts if any would be worth its saving worth carrying off for the fresh embodiment and the better life and which of them would have on the other hand to face the notoriety of going first by the board i have literally heard you qualify the monster as shameless though that was wrung from you i admit by the worst of the winter conditions when circulation in any fashion consistent with personal decency or dignity was merely mocked at when the stonyhearted trolleys cars of juggernaut in their power to squash triumphed all along the line when the february blasts became as cyclones in the darkened gorges of masonry which downtown in particular put on at their mouths the semblance of black ratholes holes of gigantic rats inhabited by whirlwinds when all the pretences and impunities and infirmities in fine had massed themselves to be hurled at you in the fury of the elements in the character of the traffic in the unadapted state of the place to almost any dense movement and beyond everything in that pitch of all the noises which acted on your nerves as so much wanton provocation so much conscious cynicism the fury of sound took the form of derision of the rest of your woe and thus it might i admit have struck you as brazen that the horrible place should in such confessed collapse still be swaggering and shouting it might have struck you that great cities with the eyes of the world on them as the phrase is should be capable either of a proper form or failing this of a proper compunction which tributes to propriety were on the part of new york equally wanting this made you remark precisely that nothing was wanting on the other hand to that analogy with the character of the bad bold beauty the creature the most blatant of whose pretensions is that she is one of those to whom everything is always forgiven on what ground forgiven of course you ask but note that you ask it while youre in the very act of forgiving oh yes you are youve as much as said so yourself so there it all is arrange it as you can poor dear bad bold beauty there must indeed be something about her let me grant then to get on that there was doubtless in the better time something about her there was enough about her at all events to conduce to that distinct cultivation of her company for which the contemplative stroll when there was time for it was but another name the analogy was in truth complete since the repetition of such walks and the admission of the beguiled state contained in them resembled nothing so much as the visits so often still incorrigibly made to compromised charmers i defy even a master of morbid observation to perambulate new york unless he be interested so that in a case of memories so gathered the interest must be taken as a final fact let me figure it to this end as lively in every connection and so indeed no more lively at one mild crisis than at another the crisis even of observation at the morbid pitch is inevitably mild in cities intensely new and it was with the quite peculiarly insistent newness of the upper reaches of the town that the spirit of romantic inquiry had always at the best to reckon there are new cities enough about the world goodness knows and there are new parts enough of old cities for examples of which we need go no farther than london paris and rome all of late so mercilessly renovated but the newness of new york unlike even that of boston i seemed to discern had this mark of its very own that it affects one in every case as having treated itself as still more provisional if possible than any poor dear little interest of antiquity it may have annihilated the very sign of its energy is that it doesnt believe in itself it fails to succeed even at a cost of millions in persuading you that it does its mission would appear to be exactly to gild the temporary with its gold as many inches thick as may be and then with a fresh shrug a shrug of its splendid cynicism for its freshly detected inability to convince give up its actual work however exorbitant as the merest of stopgaps the difficulty with the compromised charmer is just this constant inability to convince to convince ever i mean that she is serious serious about any form whatever or about anything but that perpetual passionate pecuniary purpose which plays with all forms which derides and devours them though it may pile up the cost of them in order to rest a while spent and haggard in the illusion of their finality the perception of this truth grows for you by your simply walking up fifth avenue and pausing a little in presence of certain forms certain exorbitant structures in other words the elegant domiciliary as to which the illusion of finality was within ones memory magnificent and complete but as to which one feels today that their life wouldnt be as against any whisper of a higher interest worth an hours purchase they sit there in the florid majesty of the taste of their time a light now alas generally clouded and i pretend of course to speak in alluding to them of no individual case of danger or doom it is only a question of that unintending and unconvincing expression of new york everywhere as yet on the matter of the maintenance of a given effect which comes back to the general insincerity of effects and truly even as i have already noted to the insincerity of the effect of the skyscrapers themselves there results from all this and as much where the place most smells of its millions as elsewhere that unmistakable new york admission of unattempted impossible maturity the new paris and the new rome do at least propose i think to be old one of these days the new london even erect as she is on leaseholds destitute of dignity yet does for the period appear to believe in herself the vice i glance at is however when showing in our flagrant example on the forehead of its victims much more a cause for pitying than for decrying them again and again in the upper reaches you pause with that pity you learn on the occasion of a kindly glance up and down a quiet crossstreet there being objects and aspects in many of them appealing to kindness that such and such a house or a row is coming down and you gasp in presence of the elements involved at the strangeness of the moral so pointed it rings out like the crack of that lash in the sky the play of some mighty teamsters whip which ends by affecting you as the poor new yorkers one association with the idea of powers above no this is the tune to which the whip seems flourished theres no step at which you shall rest no form as im constantly showing you to which consistently with my interests you can i build you up but to tear you down for if i were to let sentiment and sincerity once take root were to let any tenderness of association once accumulate or any love of the old once pass unsnubbed what would become of us who have our hands on the whipstock please fortunately weve learned the secret for keeping association at bay weve learned that the great thing is not to suffer it to so much as begin wherever it does begin we find were lost but as that takes some time we get in ahead its the reason if you must know why you shall run all without exception to the fifty floors we defy you even to aspire to venerate shapes so grossly constructed as the arrangement in fifty floors you may have a feeling for keeping on with an old staircase consecrated by the tread of generations especially when its good and old staircases are often so lovely but how can you have a feeling for keeping on with an old elevator how can you have it any more than for keeping on with an old omnibus youd be ashamed to venerate the arrangement in fifty floors accordingly even if you could whereby saving you any moral trouble or struggle they are conceived and constructed and you must do us the justice of this care for your sensibility in a manner to cut the thing out of the question in such a manner moreover as that there shall be immeasurably more of them in quantity to tear down than of the actual past that we are now sweeping away wherefore we shall be kept in precious practice the word will perhaps be then who knows for building from the earthsurface downwards in which case it will be a question of tearing so to speak up it little matters so long as we blight the superstition of rest yet even in the midst of this vision of eternal waste of conscious sentientlooking houses and rows full sections of streets to which the rich taste of history is forbidden even while their fresh young lips are just touching the cup something charmingly done here and there some bid for the ampler permanence seems to say to you that the particular place only asks as a human home to lead the life it has begun only asks to enfold generations and gather in traditions to show itself capable of growing up to character and authority houses of the best taste are like clothes of the best tailors it takes their age to show us how good they are and i frequently recognized in the region of the upper reaches this direct appeal of the individual case of happy construction construction at large abounds in the upper reaches construction indescribably precipitate and elaborate the latter fact about it always so oddly hand in hand with the former and we should exceed in saying that felicity is always its mark but some highly liberal some extravagant intention almost always is and we meet here even that happy accident already encountered and acclaimed in its few examples downtown of the object shining almost absurdly in the light of its merely comparative distinction all but lost in the welter of instances of sham refinement the shy little case of real refinement detaches itself ridiculously as being like the saved city hall or like the pleasant old gardenwalled house on the northwest corner of washington square and fifth avenue of so beneficent an admonition as to show relatively speaking for priceless these things which i may not take time to pick out are the salt that saves and it is enough to say for their delicacy that they are the direct counterpart of those other dreadful presences looming round them which embody the imagination of new kinds and new clustered emphasized quantities of vulgarity to recall these fine notes and these loud ones the whole play of wealth and energy and untutored liberty of the movement of a breathless civilization reflected as brick and stone and marble may reflect through all the contrasts of prodigious flight and portentous stumble is to acknowledge positively that ones rambles were delightful and that the district abutting on the east side of the park in particular never engaged my attention without by the same stroke making the social question dance before it in a hundred interesting forms the social question quite fills the air in new york for any spectator whose impressions at all follow themselves up it wears at any rate in what i have called the upper reaches the perpetual strange appearance as of property perched high aloft and yet itself looking about all ruefully in the wonder of what it is exactly doing there we see it perched assuredly in other and older cities other and older social orders but it strikes us in those situations as knowing a little more where it is it strikes us as knowing how it has got up and why it must infallibly stay up it has not the frightened look measuring the spaces around of a small child set on a mantelshelf and about to cry out if old societies are interesting however i am far from thinking that young ones may not be more so with their collective countenance so much more presented precisely to observation as by their artless need to get themselves explained the american world produces almost everywhere the impression of appealing to any attested interest for the word the fin mot of what it may mean but i somehow see those parts of it most at a loss that are already explained not a little by the ample possession of money this is the amiable side there of the large developments of private ease in general the amiable side of those numerous groups that are rich enough and in the happy vulgar phrase bloated enough to be candidates for the classic imputation of haughtiness the amiability proceeds from an essential vagueness whereas real haughtiness is never vague about itself it is only vague about others that is the human note in the huge american rattle of gold so far as the social field is the scene of the rattle the business field is a different matter as to which the determination of the audibility in it of the human note so interesting to try for if one had but the warrant is a line of research closed to me alas by my fatally uninitiated state my point is at all events that you cannot be hard really with any society that affects you as ready to learn from you and from this resource for it of your detachment combining with your proximity what in the name of all its possessions and all its destitutions it would honestly be at iii new york and the hudson a spring impression i it was a concomitant always of the downtown hour that it could be felt as most playing into the surrendered consciousness and making the sharpest impression yet since the uptown hour was apt in its turn to claim the same distinction i could only let each of them take its way with me as it would the oddity was that they seemed not at all to speak of different things by so quick a process does any one aspect in the united states in general i was to note connect itself with the rest so little does any link in the huge looseness of new york in especial appear to come as a whole or as final out of the fusion the fusion as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot is always going on and one stage of the process is as typical or as vivid as another whatever i might be looking at or be struck with the object or the phase was an item in the pressing conditions of the place and as such had more in common with its sister items than it had in difference from them it mattered little moreover whether this might be a proof that new york among cities most deeply languishes and palpitates or vibrates and flourishes whichever way one may put it under the breath of her conditions or whether simply this habit of finding a little of all my impressions reflected in any one of them testified to the enjoyment of a real relation with the subject i like indeed to think of my relation to new york as in that manner almost inexpressibly intimate and as hence making for daily sensation a keyboard as continuous and as free from hard transitions as if swept by the fingers of a masterpianist you cannot surely say more for your sense of the underlying unity of an occasion than that the taste of each dish in the banquet recalls the taste of most of the others which is what i mean by the continuity not to say the affinity on the island of manhattan between the fish and the sweets between the soup and the game the whole feast affects one as eaten that is the point with the general queer sauce of new york a preparation as freely diffused somehow on the east side as on the west in the quarter of grand street as in the quarter of murray hill no fact i hasten to add would appear to make the place more amenable to delineations of the order that may be spoken of as hanging together i must confess notwithstanding to not being quite ready to point directly to the common element in the dense italian neighbourhoods of the lower east side and in the upper reaches of fifth and of madison avenues though indeed i wonder at this inability in recollecting two or three of those charming afternoons of early summer in central park which showed the fruit of the foreign tree as shaken down there with a force that smothered everything else the long residential vistas i have named were within a quarter of an hours walk but the alien was as truly in possession under the high aristocratic nose as if he had had but three steps to come if it be asked why the alien still striking you so as an alien the singleness of impression throughout the place should still be so marked the answer close at hand would seem to be that the alien himself fairly makes the singleness of impression is not the universal sauce essentially his sauce and do we not feel ourselves feeding half the time from the ladle as greasy as he chooses to leave it for us that he holds out such questions were in my ears at all events with the cheerful hum of that babel of tongues established in the vernal park and they supplied beyond doubt the livelier interest of any hour of contemplation there i hate to drift into dealing with them at the expense of a proper tribute kept distinct and vivid to the charming bosky precinct itself the great field of recreation with which they swarmed but it could not be the fault of the brooding visitor and still less that of the restored absentee if he was conscious of the need of mental adjustment to phenomena absolutely fresh he could remember still how months before a day or two after his restoration a noted element of one of his first impressions had been this particular revealed anomaly he had been on the jersey shore walking with a couple of friends through the grounds of a large new rural residence where groups of diggers and ditchers were working on those lines of breathless haste which seem always in the united states of the essence of any question toward an expensive effect of landscape gardening to pause before them for interest in their labour was and would have been everywhere instinctive but what came home to me on the spot was that whatever more would have been anywhere else involved had here inevitably to lapse what lapsed on the spot was the element of communication with the workers as i may call it for want of a better name that element which in a european country would have operated from side to side as the play of mutual recognition founded on old familiarities and heredities and involving for the moment some impalpable exchange the men in the case i speak of were italians of superlatively southern type and any impalpable exchange struck me as absent from the air to positive intensity to mere unthinkability it was as if contact were out of the question and the sterility of the passage between us recorded with due dryness in our staring silence this impression was for one of the party a shock a member of the party for whom on the other side of the world the imagination of the main furniture as it might be called of any rural excursion of the rural in particular had been during years the easy sense for the excursionist of a social relation with any encountered type from whichever end of the scale proceeding had that not ever been exactly a part of the vague warmth the intrinsic colour of any honest mans rural walk in his england or his italy his germany or his france and was not the effect of its so suddenly dropping out in the land of universal brotherhood for i was to find it drop out again and again rather a chill straightway for the heart and rather a puzzle not less for the head shortly after the spring of this question was first touched for me i found it ring out again with a sharper stroke happening to have lost my way during a long ramble among the new hampshire hills i appealed for information at a parting of the roads to a young man whom at the moment of my need i happily saw emerge from a neighbouring wood but his stare was blank in answer to my inquiry and seeing that he failed to understand me and that he had a darkeyed latin look i jumped to the inference of his being a french canadian my repetition of my query in french however forwarded the case as little and my trying him with italian had no better effect what are you then i wonderingly asked on which my accent loosened in him the faculty of speech im an armenian he replied as if it were the most natural thing in the world for a wageearning youth in the heart of new england to be so that all i could do was to try and make my profit of the lesson i could have made it better for the occasion if even on the armenian basis he had appeared to expect brotherhood but this had been as little his seeming as it had been that of the diggers by the jersey shore to inquire of these things on the spot to betray that is ones sense of the chill of which i have spoken is of course to hear it admitted promptly enough that there is no claim to brotherhood with aliens in the first grossness of their alienism the material of which they consist is being dressed and prepared at this stage for brotherhood and the consummation in respect to many of them will not be cannot from the nature of the case be in any lifetime of their own their children are another matter as in fact the children throughout the united states are an immense matter are almost the greatest matter of all it is the younger generation who will fully profit rise to the occasion and enter into the privilege the machinery is colossal nothing is more characteristic of the country than the development of this machinery in the form of the political and social habit the common school and the newspaper so that there are always millions of little transformed strangers growing up in regard to whom the idea of intimacy of relation may be as freely cherished as you like they are the stuff of whom brothers and sisters are made and the making proceeds on a scale that really need leave nothing to desire all this you take in with a wondering mind and in the light of it the great ethnic question rises before you on a corresponding scale and with a corresponding majesty once it has set your observation to say nothing of your imagination working it becomes for you as you go and come the wonderment to which everything ministers and that is quickened wellnigh to madness in some places and on some occasions by every face and every accent that meet your eyes and ears the sense of the elements in the cauldron the cauldron of the american character becomes thus about as vivid a thing as you can at all quietly manage and the question settles into a form which makes the intelligible answer further and further recede what meaning in the presence of such impressions can continue to attach to such a term as the american character what type as the result of such a prodigious amalgam such a hotchpotch of racial ingredients is to be conceived as shaping itself the challenge to speculation fed thus by a thousand sources is so intense as to be as i say irritating but practically beyond doubt i should also say you take refuge from it since your case would otherwise be hard and you find your relief not in the least in any direct satisfaction or solution but absolutely in that blest general drop of the immediate need of conclusions or rather in that blest general feeling for the impossibility of them to which the philosophy of any really fine observation of the american spectacle must reduce itself and the large intellectual quite even the large aesthetic margin supplied by which accompanies the spectator as his one positively complete comfort it is more than a comfort to him truly in all the conditions this accepted vision of the toodefiant scale of numerosity and quantity the effect of which is so to multiply the possibilities so to open by the million contingent doors and windows he rests in it at last as an absolute luxury converting it even into a substitute into the constant substitute for many luxuries that are absent he doesnt know he cant say before the facts and he doesnt even want to know or to say the facts themselves loom before the understanding in too large a mass for a mere mouthful it is as if the syllables were too numerous to make a legible word the illegible word accordingly the great inscrutable answer to questions hangs in the vast american sky to his imagination as something fantastic and abracadabrant belonging to no known language and it is under this convenient ensign that he travels and considers and contemplates and to the best of his ability enjoys the interesting point in the connection is moreover that this particular effect of the scale of things is the only effect that throughout the land is not directly adverse to joy extent and reduplication the multiplication of cognate items and the continuity of motion are elements that count there in general for fatigue and satiety prompting the earnest observer overburdened perhaps already a little by his earnestness to the reflection that the country is too large for any human convenience that it can scarce in the scheme of providence have been meant to be dealt with as we are trying perhaps all in vain to deal with it and that its very possibilities of population themselves cause one to wince in the light of the question of intercourse and contact that relation to its superficies and content the relation of flat fatigue is with the traveller a constant quantity so that he feels himself justified of the inward the philosophic escape into the immensity and as it is the restored absentee with his acquired habit of nearer limits and shorter journeys and more muffled concussions who is doubtless most subject to flat fatigue so it is this same personage who most avails himself of the liberty of waiting to see it is an advantage acting often in the way of a compensation or of an appeal from the immediate that he becomes early in his period of inquiry conscious of intimately invoking in whatever apparent inconsistency it may lodge him there is too much of the whole thing he sighs for the personal relation with it and yet he would desire no inch less for the relation that he describes to himself best perhaps either as the provisionallyimaginative or as the distantlyrespectful diminution of quantity even by that inch might mark the difference of his having to begin to recognize from afar as through a rift in the obscurity the gleam of some propriety of opinion what would a man make many things still being as they are he finds himself asking of a small america and what may a big one on the other hand still not make of itself goodness be thanked accordingly for the bigness the state of flat fatigue obviously is not an opinion save in the sense attributed to the slumber of the gentleman of the anecdote who had lost consciousness during the reading of the play it belongs to the order of mere sensation and impression and as to these the case is quite different he may have as many of each as he can carry ii the process of the mitigation and still more of the conversion of the alien goes on meanwhile obviously not by leaps and bounds or any form of easy magic but under its own mystic laws and with an outward air of quite declining to be unduly precipitated how little it may be thought of in new york as a quick business we readily perceive as the effect of merely remembering the vast numbers of their kind that the arriving reinforcements from whatever ends of the earth find already in possession of the field there awaits the disembarked armenian for instance so warm and furnished an armenian corner that the need of hurrying to get rid of the sense of it must become less and less a pressing preliminary the corner growing warmer and warmer it is to be supposed by rich accretions he may take his time more and more for becoming absorbed in the surrounding element and he may in fact feel more and more that he can do so on his own conditions i seem to find indeed in this latter truth a hint for the best expression of a whole side of new york the best expression of much of the medium in which one consciously moves it is formed by this fact that the alien is taking his time and that you go about with him meanwhile sharing all respectfully in his deliberation waiting on his convenience watching him at his interesting work the vast foreign quarters of the city present him as thus engaged in it and they are curious and portentous and picturesque just by reason of their doing so you recognize in them freely those elements that are not elements of swift convertibility and you lose yourself in the wonder of what becomes as it were of the obstinate the unconverted residuum the country at large as you cross it in different senses keeps up its character for you as the hugest thinkable organism for successful assimilation but the assimilative force itself has the residuum still to count with the operation of the immense machine identical after all with the total of american life trembles away into mysteries that are beyond our present notation and that reduce us in many a mood to renouncing analysis who and what is an alien when it comes to that in a country peopled from the first under the jealous eye of history peopled that is by migrations at once extremely recent perfectly traceable and urgently required they are still it would appear urgently required if we look about far enough for the urgency though of that truth such a scene as new york may well make one doubt which is the american by these scant measures which is not the alien over a large part of the country at least and where does one put a finger on the dividing line or for that matter spot and identify any particular phase of the conversion any one of its successive moments the sense of the interest of so doing is doubtless half the interest of the general question the possibility of our seeing lucidly presented some such phenomenon in a given group of persons or even in a felicitous individual as the dawn of the american spirit while the declining rays of the croatian say or of the calabrian or of the lusitanian still linger more or less pensively in the sky fifty doubts and queries come up in regard to any such possibility as one circulates in new york with the so ambiguous element in the launched foreign personality always in ones eyes the wonder above all of whether there be comparatively in the vastly greater number of the representatives of the fresh contingent any spirit that the american does not find an easy prey repeatedly in the electric cars one seemed invited to take that for granted there being occasions days and weeks together when the electric cars offer you nothing else to think of the carful again and again is a foreign carful a row of faces up and down testifying without exception to alienism unmistakable alienism undisguised and unashamed you do here in a manner perhaps discriminate the launched condition as i have called it is more developed in some types than in others but i remember observing how in the broadway and the bowery conveyances in especial they tended almost alike to make the observer gasp with the sense of isolation it was not for this that the observer on whose behalf i more particularly write had sought to take up again the sweet sense of the natal air the great fact about his companions was that foreign as they might be newly inducted as they might be they were at home really more at home at the end of their few weeks or months or their year or two than they had ever in their lives been before and that he was at home too quite with the same intensity and yet that it was this very equality of condition that from side to side made the whole medium so strange here again however relief may be sought and found and i say this at the risk of perhaps picturing the restored absentee as too constantly requiring it for there is fascination in the study of the innumerable ways in which this sense of being at home on the part of all the types may show forth new york offers to such a study a wellnigh unlimited field but i seem to recall winter days harsh dusky sloshy winter afternoons in the denselypacked eastside streetcars as an especially intimate surrender to it it took its place thus i think under the general american law of all relief from the great equalizing pressure it took on that last disinterestedness which consists of ones getting away from ones subject by plunging into it for sweet truths sake still deeper if i speak moreover of this general first grossness of alienism as presented in types i use that word for easy convenience and not in respect to its indicating marked variety there are many different ways certainly in which obscure fighters of the battle of life may look under new high lights queer and crude and unwrought but the striking thing precisely in the crepuscular tunnellike avenues that the elevated overarches yet without quenching either that constant power of any american exhibition rather luridly to light itself the striking thing and the beguiling was always the manner in which figure after figure and face after face already betrayed the common consequence and action of their whereabouts face after face unmistakably was low particularly in the men squared all solidly in their new security and portability their vague but growing sense of many unprecedented things and as signs of the reinforcing of a large local conception of manners and relations it was difficult to say if they most affected one as promising or as portentous the great thing at any rate was that they were all together so visibly on the new the lifted level that of consciously not being what they had been and that this immediately glazed them over as with some mixture of indescribable hue and consistency the wholesale varnish of consecration that might have been applied out of a bottomless receptacle by a huge whitewashing brush here perhaps was the nearest approach to a seizable step in the evolution of the oncoming citizen the stage of his no longer being for you for any complacency of the romantic or even verily of the fraternizing sense in you the foreigner of the quality of the kind that he might have been chez lui whatever he might see himself becoming he was never to see himself that again any more than you were ever to see him he became then to my vision which i have called fascinated for want of a better description of it a creature promptly despoiled of those manners which were the grace as i am again reduced to calling it by which one had best known and on opportunity best liked him he presents himself thus most of all to be plain and not only in new york but throughout the country as wonderingly conscious that his manners of the other world that everything you have there known and praised him for have been a huge mistake to that degree that the sense of this luminous discovery is what we mainly imagine his weighted communications to those he has left behind charged with those rich letters home as to the number and content of which the post office gives us so remarkable a statistic if there are several lights in which the great assimilative organism itself may be looked at does it not still perhaps loom largest as an agent for revealing to the citizentobe the error in question he hears it under this aegis proclaimed in a thousand voices and it is as listening to these and as according to the individual more or less swiftly but always infallibly penetrated and convinced by them that i felt myself see him go about his business see him above all for some odd reason sit there in the streetcar and with a slow brooding gravity a dim calculation of bearings which yet never takes a backward step expand to the full measure of it so in new york largely the american value of the immigrant who arrives at all mature is restricted to the enjoyment all prepared to increase of that important preliminary truth which makes him for us we must own till more comes of it a tolerably neutral and colourless image he resembles for the time the dog who sniffs round the freshlyacquired bone giving it a push and a lick betraying a sense of its possibilities but not and quite as from a positive deep tremor of consciousness directly attacking it there are categories of foreigners truly meanwhile of whom we are moved to say that only a mechanism working with scientific force could have performed this feat of making them colourless the italians who over the whole land strike us i am afraid as after the negro and the chinaman the human value most easily produced the italians meet us at every turn only to make us ask what has become of that element of the agreeable address in them which has from far back so enhanced for the stranger the interest and pleasure of a visit to their beautiful country they shed it utterly i couldnt but observe on their advent after a deep inhalation or two of the clear native air shed it with a conscientious completeness which leaves one looking for any faint trace of it colour of that pleasant sort was what they had appeared among the races of the european family most to have so that the effect i speak of the rapid action of the ambient air is like that of the tub of hot water that reduces a piece of brighthued stuff on immersion to the proved state of not washing the only fault of my image indeed being that if the stuff loses its brightness the water of the tub at least is more or less agreeably dyed with it that is doubtless not the case for the ambient air operating after the fashion i here note since we surely fail to observe that the property washed out of the new subject begins to tint with its pink or its azure his fellowsoakers in the terrible tank if this property that has quitted him the general amenity of attitude in the absence of provocation to its opposite could be accounted for by its having rubbed off on any number of surrounding persons the whole process would be easier and perhaps more comforting to follow it will not have been his first occasion of taking leave of shortsighted comfort in the united states however if the patient inquirer postpones that ideal to the real solicitation of the question i here touch on what does become of the various positive properties on the part of certain of the installed tribes the good manners say among them as to which the process of shedding and the fact of eclipse come so promptly into play it has taken long ages of history in the other world to produce them and you ask yourself with independent curiosity if they may really be thus extinguished in an hour and if they are not extinguished into what pathless tracts of the native atmosphere do they virtually do they provisionally and so all undiscoverably melt do they burrow underground to await their day again or in what strange secret places are they held in deposit and in trust the american identity that has profited by their sacrifice has meanwhile acquired in the happiest cases all apparent confidence and consistency but may not the doubt remain of whether the extinction of qualities ingrained in generations is to be taken for quite complete isnt it conceivable that for something like a final efflorescence the business of slow comminglings and makingsover at last ended they may rise again to the surface affirming their vitality and value and playing their part it would be for them of course in this event to attest that they had been worth waiting so long for but the speculation at any rate irresistibly forced upon us is a sign of the interest in the american world of what i have called the ethnic outlook the cauldron for the great stew has such circumference and such depth that we can only deal here with ultimate syntheses ultimate combinations and possibilities yet i am well aware that if these vague evocations of them in their nebulous remoteness may charm the ingenuity of the student of the scene there are matters of the foreground that they have no call to supplant any temptation to let them do so is meanwhile no doubt but a proof of that impulse irresponsibly to escape from the formidable foreground which so often in the american world lies in wait for the spirit of intellectual dalliance iii new york really i think is all formidable foreground or if it be not there is more than enough of this pressure of the present and the immediate to cut out the close sketchers work for him these things are a thick growth all round him and when i recall the intensity of the material picture in the dense yiddish quarter for instance i wonder at its not having forestalled on my page mere musings and as they will doubtless be called moonings there abides with me ineffaceably the memory of a summer evening spent there by invitation of a high public functionary domiciled on the spot to the extreme enhancement of the romantic interest his visitor found him foredoomed to inspire who was to prove one of the most liberal of hosts and most luminous of guides i can scarce help it if this brilliant personality on that occasion the very medium itself through which the whole spectacle showed so colours my impressions that if i speak by intention of the facts that played into them i may really but reflect the rich talk and the general privilege of the hour that accident moreover must take its place simply as the highest value and the strongest note in the total show so much did it testify to the quality of appealing surrounding life the sense of this quality was already strong in my drive with a companion through the long warm june twilight from a comparatively conventional neighbourhood it was the sense after all of a great swarming a swarming that had begun to thicken infinitely as soon as we had crossed to the east side and long before we had got to rutgers street there is no swarming like that of israel when once israel has got a start and the scene here bristled at every step with the signs and sounds immitigable unmistakable of a jewry that had burst all bounds that it has burst all bounds in new york almost any combination of figures or of objects taken at hazard sufficiently proclaims but i remember how the rising waters on this summer night rose to the imagination even above the housetops and seemed to sound their murmur to the pale distant stars it was as if we had been thus in the crowded hustled roadway where multiplication multiplication of everything was the dominant note at the bottom of some vast sallow aquarium in which innumerable fish of overdeveloped proboscis were to bump together for ever amid heaped spoils of the sea the children swarmed above all here was multiplication with a vengeance and the number of very old persons of either sex was almost equally remarkable the very old persons being in equal vague occupation of the doorstep pavement curbstone gutter roadway and every one alike using the street for overflow as overflow in the whole quarter is the main fact of life i was to learn later on that with the exception of some shy corner of asia no district in the world known to the statistician has so many inhabitants to the yard the scene hummed with the human presence beyond any i had ever faced in quest even of refreshment producing part of the impression moreover no doubt as a direct consequence of the intensity of the jewish aspect this i think makes the individual jew more of a concentrated person savingly possessed of everything that is in him than any other human noted at random or is it simply rather that the unsurpassed strength of the race permits of the chopping into myriads of fine fragments without loss of racequality there are small strange animals known to natural history snakes or worms i believe who when cut into pieces wriggle away contentedly and live in the snippet as completely as in the whole so the denizens of the new york ghetto heaped as thick as the splinters on the table of a glassblower had each like the fine glass particle his or her individual share of the whole hard glitter of israel this diffused intensity as i have called it causes any array of jews to resemble if i may be allowed another image some long nocturnal street where every window in every house shows a maintained light the advanced age of so many of the figures the ubiquity of the children carried out in fact this analogy they were all there for race and not as it were for reason that excess of lurid meaning in some of the old mens and old womens faces in particular would have been absurd in the conditions as a really directed attention it could only be the gathered past of israel mechanically pushing through the way at the same time this chapter of history did all that evening seem to push was a matter that made the ethnic apparition again sit like a skeleton at the feast it was fairly as if i could see the spectre grin while the talk of the hour gave me across the board facts and figures chapter and verse for the extent of the hebrew conquest of new york with a reverence for intellect one should doubtless have drunk in tribute to an intellectual people but i remember being at no time more conscious of that merely portentous element in the aspects of american growth which reduces to inanity any marked dismay quite as much as any high elation the portent is one of too many you always come back as i have hinted with your easier gasp to that it will be time enough to sigh or to shout when the relation of the particular appearance to all the other relations shall have cleared itself up phantasmagoric for me accordingly in a high degree are the interesting hours i here glance at content to remain setting in this respect i recognize an excellent example to all the rest of the new york phantasmagoria let me speak of the remainder only as phantasmagoric too so that i may both the more kindly recall it and the sooner have done with it i have not done however with the impression of that large evening in the ghetto there was too much in the vision and it has left too much the sense of a rare experience for what did it all really come to but that one had seen with ones eyes the new jerusalem on earth what less than that could it all have been in its farspreading light and its celestial serenity of multiplication there it was there it is and when i think of the dark foul stifling ghettos of other remembered cities i shall think by the same stroke of the city of redemption and evoke in particular the rich rutgers street perspective rich so peculiarly for the eye in that complexity of fireescapes with which each housefront bristles and which gives the whole vista so modernized and appointed a look omnipresent in the poor regions this neat applied machinery has for the stranger a common side with the electric light and the telephone suggests the distance achieved from the old jerusalem these frontal iron ladders and platforms by the way so numerous throughout new york strike more new york notes than can be parenthetically named and among them perhaps most sharply the note of the ease with which in the terrible town on opportunity architecture goes by the board but the appearance to which they often most conduce is that of the spaciously organized cage for the nimbler class of animals in some great zoological garden this general analogy is irresistible it seems to offer in each district a little world of bars and perches and swings for human squirrels and monkeys the very name of architecture perishes for the fireescapes look like abashed afterthoughts staircases and communications forgotten in the construction but the inhabitants lead like the squirrels and monkeys all the merrier life it was while i hung over the prospect from the windows of my friend however the presiding genius of the district and it was while at a later hour i proceeded in his company and in that of a trio of contributive fellowpilgrims from one characteristic place of public entertainment to another it was during this rich climax i say that the city of redemption was least to be taken for anything less than it was the windows while we sat at meat looked out on a swarming little square in which an antlike population darted to and fro the square consisted in part of a district public garden or public lounge rather one of those small backwaters or refuges artfully economized for rest here and there in the very heart of the new york whirlpool and which spoke louder than anything else of a jerusalem disinfected what spoke loudest no doubt was the great overtowering school which formed a main boundary and in the shadow of which we all comparatively crouched but the school must not lead me on just yet so colossally has its presence still to loom for us that presence which profits so for predominance in america by the failure of concurrent and competitive presences the failure of any others looming at all on the same scale save that of business those in particular of a visible church a visible state a visible society a visible past those of the many visibilities in short that warmly cumber the ground in older countries yet it also spoke loud that my friend was quartered for the interest of the thing from his so interesting point of view in a tenementhouse the new jerusalem would so have triumphed had it triumphed nowhere else in the fact that this charming little structure could be ranged on the wonderful little square under that invidious head on my asking to what latent vice it owed its stigma i was asked in return if it didnt sufficiently pay for its name by harbouring some fiveandtwenty families but this exactly was the way it testified this circumstance of the simultaneous enjoyment by fiveandtwenty families on tenement lines of conditions so little sordid so highly evolved i remember the evolved fireproof staircase a thing of scientific surfaces impenetrable to the microbe and above all plated against side friction with white marble of a goodly grain the white marble was surely the new jerusalem note and we followed that note up and down the district the rest of the evening through more happy changes than i may take time to count what struck me in the flaring streets over and beyond the everywhere insistent defiant unhumorous exotic face was the blaze of the shops addressed to the new jerusalem wants and the splendour with which these were taken for granted the only thing indeed a little ambiguous was just this look of the trap too brilliantly too candidly baited for the wary side of israel itself it is not for israel in general that israel so artfully shines yet its being moved to do so at last in that luxurious style might be precisely the grand side of the city of redemption who can ever tell moreover in any conditions and in presence of any apparent anomaly what the genius of israel may or may not really be up to the grateful way to take it all at any rate was with the sense of its coming back again to the inveterate rise in the american air of every value and especially of the lower ones those most subject to multiplication such a wealth of meaning did this keep appearing to pour into the value and function of the country at large importances are all strikingly shifted and reconstituted in the united states for the visitor attuned from far back to european importances but i think of no other moment of my total impression as so sharply working over my own benighted vision of them the scale in this light of the new jerusalem seemed completely rearranged or to put it more simply the wants the gratifications the aspirations of the poor as expressed in the shops which were the shops of the poor denoted a new style of poverty and this new style of poverty from street to street stuck out of the possible purchasers ones jostling fellowpedestrians and made them to every man and woman individual throbs in the larger harmony one can speak only of what one has seen and there were grosser elements of the sordid and the squalid that i doubtless never saw that with a good deal of observation and of curiosity i should have failed of this the country over affected me as by itself something of an indication to miss that part of the spectacle or to know it only by its having so unfamiliar a pitch was an indication that made up for a great many others it is when this one in particular is forced home to you this immense vivid general lift of poverty and general appreciation of the living units paying property in himself that the picture seems most to clear and the way to jubilation most to open for it meets you there at every turn as the result most definitely attested you are as constantly reminded no doubt that these rises in enjoyed value shrink and dwindle under the icy breath of trusts and the weight of the new remorseless monopolies that operate as no madnesses of ancient personal power thrilling us on the historic page ever operated the living units property in himself becoming more and more merely such a property as may consist with a relation to properties overwhelmingly greater and that allow the asking of no questions and the making for coexistence with them of no conditions but that in the fortunate phrase is another story and will be altogether evidently a new and different drama there is such a thing in the united states it is hence to be inferred as freedom to grow up to be blighted and it may be the only freedom in store for the smaller fry of future generations if it is accordingly of the smaller fry i speak and of how large they massed on that evening of endless admonitions this will be because i caught them thus in their comparative humility and at an early stage of their american growth the lifethread has i suppose to be of a certain thickness for the great shears of fate to feel for it put it at the worst that the ogres were to devour them they were but the more certainly to fatten into food for the ogres their dream at all events as i noted it was meanwhile sweet and undisguised nowhere sweeter than in the halfdozen picked beerhouses and cafes in which our ingenuous enquete that of my fellowpilgrims and i wound up these establishments had each been selected for its playing off some facet of the jewel and they wondrously testified by their range and their individual colour to the spread of that lustre it was a pious rosary of which i should like to tell each bead but i must let the general sense of the adventure serve our successive stations were in no case of the seamy order an inquiry into seaminess having been unanimously pronounced futile but each had its separate social connotation and it was for the number and variety of these connotations and their individual plenitude and prosperity to set one thinking truly the yiddish world was a vast world with its own deeps and complexities and what struck one above all was that it sat there at its cups and in no instance vulgarly the worse for them with a sublimity of good conscience that took away the breath a protrusion of elbow never aggressive but absolutely proof against jostling it was the incurable man of letters under the skin of one of the party who gasped i confess for it was in the light of letters that is in the light of our language as literature has hitherto known it that one stared at this allunconscious impudence of the agency of future ravage the man of letters in the united states has his own difficulties to face and his own current to stem for dealing with which his liveliest inspiration may be i think that they are still very much his own even in an americanized world and that more than elsewhere they press him to intimate communion with his honour for that honour the honour that sits astride of the consecrated english tradition to his mind quite as old knighthood astride of its caparisoned charger the dragon most rousing over the land the proper spirit of st george is just this immensity of the alien presence climbing higher and higher climbing itself into the very light of publicity i scarce know why but i saw it that evening as in some dim dawn of that promise to its own consciousness and perhaps this was precisely what made it a little exasperating under the impression of the mere mob the question doesnt come up but in these haunts of comparative civility we saw the mob sifted and strained and the exasperation was the sharper no doubt because what the process had left most visible was just the various possibilities of the waiting spring of intelligence such elements constituted the germ of a public and it was impossible possessed of a sensibility worth speaking of to be exposed to them without feeling how new a thing under the sun the resulting public would be that was where ones lettered anguish came in in the turn of ones eye from face to face for some betrayal of a prehensile hook for the linguistic tradition as one had known it each warm lighted and supplied circle each group of served tables and smoked pipes and fostered decencies and unprecedented accents beneath the extravagant lamps took on thus for the brooding critic a likeness to that terrible modernized and civilized room in the tower of london haunted by the shade of guy fawkes which had more than once formed part of the scene of the critics taking tea there in this chamber of the present urbanities the wretched man had been stretched on the rack and the critics ear how else should it have been a critics could still always catch in pauses of talk the faint groan of his ghost just so the east side cafes and increasingly as their place in the scale was higher showed to my inner sense beneath their bedizenment as torturerooms of the living idiom the piteous gasp of which at the portent of lacerations to come could reach me in any drop of the surrounding accent of the future the accent of the very ultimate future in the states may be destined to become the most beautiful on the globe and the very music of humanity here the ethnic synthesis shrouds itself thicker than ever but whatever we shall know it for certainly we shall not know it for english in any sense for which there is an existing literary measure iv the huge jagged city it must be nevertheless said has always at the worst for propitiation the resource of its easy reference to its almost incomparable river new york may indeed be jagged in her long leanness where she lies looking at the sky in the manner of some colossal haircomb turned upward and so deprived of half its teeth that the others at their uneven intervals count doubly as sharp spikes but unmistakably you can bear with some of her aspects and her airs better when you have really taken in that reference which i speak of as easy because she has in this latter time begun to make it with an appearance of some intention she has come at last far up on the west side into possession of her birthright into the roused consciousness that some possibility of a riverfront may still remain to her though obviously a justified pride in this property has yet to await the birth of a more responsible sense of style in her dealings with it the dawn of some adequate plan or controlling idea splendid the elements of position on the part of the new riverside drive over the small suburbanizing name of which as at the effect of a secondrate shopworn article we sigh as we pass yet not less irresistible the pang of our seeing it settle itself on meagre bourgeois happygolucky lines the pity of this is sharp in proportion as the chance has been magnificent and the soreness of perception of what merely might have been is as constant as the flippancy of the little vulgar private houses or the big vulgar apartment hotels that are having their own way so unchallenged with the whole question of composition and picture the fatal tall pecuniary enterprise rises where it will in the candid glee of new worlds to conquer the intervals between take whatever foolish little form they like the skyline eternal victim of the artless jumble submits again to the type of the broken haircomb turned up the streets that abut from the east condescend at their corners to any crudity or poverty that may suit their convenience and all this in presence of an occasion for noble congruity such as one scarce knows where to seek in the case of another great city a sense of the waste of criticism however a sense that is almost in itself consoling descends upon the fond critic after his vision has fixed the scene awhile in this light of its lost accessibility to some informed and benevolent despot some power working in one great way and so that the interest of beauty should have been better saved is not criticism wasted in other words just by the reason of the constant remembrance on new york soil that one is almost impudently cheated by any part of the show that pretends to prolong its actuality or to rest on its present basis since every part however blazingly new fails to affect us as doing more than hold the ground for something else some conceit of the bigger dividend that is still to come so we may bind up the aesthetic wound i think quite as promptly as we feel it open the particular ugliness or combination of uglinesses is no more final than the particular felicity since there are several even of these up and down the town to be noted and whatever crudelyextemporized look the riverside heights may wear today the spectator of fifty years hence will find his sorrow if not his joy in a different extemporization the whole thing is the vividest of lectures on the subject of individualism and on the strange truth no doubt that this principle may in the field of art at least if the art be architecture often conjure away just that mystery of distinction which it sometimes so markedly promotes in the field of life it is also quite as suggestive perhaps on the everinteresting question for the artist of the entirely relative nature and value of treatment a manner so right in one relation may be so wrong in another and a housefront so amusing for its personal note or its perversity in a short perspective may amid larger elements merely dishonour the harmony and yet why should the charm ever fall out of the personal which is so often the very condition of the exquisite why should conformity and subordination that acceptance of control and assent to collectivism in the name of which our age has seen such dreary things done become on a given occasion the one not vulgar way of meeting a problem inquiries these evidently that are answerable only in presence of the particular cases provoking them when indeed they may hold us as under a spell endless for instance the aesthetic nobleness of such a question as that of the authority with which the spreading hudson at the opening of its gates would have imposed on the constructive powers if listened to some proportionate order would in other words have admirably given us collectivism at its highest one has only to stand there and see of such value are lessons in authority but the great vista of the stream alone speaks of it save in so far at least as the voice is shared and to so different to so dreadful a tune by the grosslydefacing railway that clings to the bank the authority of railways in the united states sits enthroned as none other and has always of course in any vision of aspects to be taken into account here at any rate it is the rule that has prevailed the other the high interest of the possible picture is one that lapses so that the cliffs overhang the water and at various points descend to it in green slopes and hollows where the landscapegardener does what he can only to find a wealth of visible baseness installed there before them that so familiar circumstance in america of the completion of the good thing ironically and as would often seem for the time insuperably baffled meets here one of its liveliest illustrations it at all events helps to give meanwhile the mingled pitch of the whole concert that columbia college to sound the old and easier name should have moved up moved up twice if i am not mistaken to adorn with an ampler presence this very neighbourhood it has taken new york to invent for the thickening of classic shades the moving university and does not that quite mark the tune of the dance of the local unwritten law that forbids almost any planted object to gather in a history where it stands forbids in fact any accumulation that may not be recorded in the mere bankbook this last became long ago the historic page it is however just because the beauty of the hudson seems to speak of other matters and because the sordid city has the honour after all of sitting there at the beautiful gate that i alluded above to her profiting in a manner even from the point of view of taste by this close and fortunate connection the place puts on thus not a little the likeness of a large loose family which has had queer adventures and fallen into vulgar ways but for which a glorious cousinship never quite repudiated by the indifferent princely cousin bon prince in this as in other matters may still be pleaded at the rate new york is growing in fine she will more and more command in familiar intercourse the great perspective of the river so that here a certain point reached her whole case must change and her general opportunity swallowing up the mainland become a new question altogether let me hasten to add that in the light of this opportunity even the most restless analyst can but take the hopeful view of her i fear i am finding too many personal comparisons for her than which indeed there can be no greater sign of a confessed preoccupation but she figures once again as an heir whose expectations are so vast and so certain that no temporary sowing of wild oats need be felt to endanger them as soon as the place begins to spread at ease real responsibility of all sorts will begin and the goodnatured feeling must surely be that the civic conscience in her at such a stage will fall into step of the spreading woods and waters amid which the future in question appears still half to lurk that mainland region of the bronx vast above all in possibilities of park out of which it already appears half to emerge i unluckily failed of occasion to take the adequate measure but my confused impression was of a kind of waiting abundance an extraordinary quantity of nature for the reformed rake that is the sobered heir to play with it is the fashion in the east to speak of new york as poor of environment unpossessed of the agreeable accessible countryside that crowns the convenience not only of london and of paris but even with more humiliating promptitude that of boston of philadelphia of baltimore in spite however of the memory from far back of a hundred marginal mahattanese miseries an immediate belt of the most sordid character i cannot but think of this invidious legend as attempting to prove too much the countryside is there on the most liberal of scales it is the townside only that having the great waters and the greater distances generally to deal with has worn so rude and demoralized a face as to frighten the country away and if the townside is now making after the countryside fast as i say and with a little less of the mere roughness of the satyr pursuing the nymph what finer warrant could be desired than such felicities of position as those enjoyed on the riverside heights by the monument erected to the soldiers and sailors of the civil war and even in a greater degree by the tomb of general grant these are verily monumental sites of the first order and i confess that though introduced to them on a bleak winter morning with no ingratiation in any element i felt the critical question as to the structures themselves as to taste or intention as to the amount of involved or achieved consecration or profanation carried off in the general greatness of the effect i shall in fact always remember that icy hour with the templecrowned headlands the wide hudson vista white with the cold all nature armourplated and grim as an extraordinarily strong and simple composition made stern and kept simple as for some visit of the god of battles to his chosen he might have been riding there on the north wind to look down at them and one caught for the moment the true hard light in which military greatness should be seen it shone over the miles of ice with its lustre of steel and if what thus attested it makes one think of was its incomparable indestructible prestige so that association affected me both then and on a later occasion as with a strange indefinable consequence an influence in which the aesthetic consideration the artistic value of either memorial melted away and became irrelevant for here if ever was a great democratic demonstration caught in the fact the nakedest possible effort to strike the note of the august the tomb of the single hero in particular presents itself in a manner so opposed to our common ideas of the impressive to any past vision of sepulchral state that we can only wonder if a new kind and degree of solemnity may not have been arrived at in this complete rupture with old consecrating forms the tabernacle of grants ashes stands there by the pleasuredrive unguarded and unenclosed the feature of the prospect and the property of the people as open as an hotel or a railwaystation to any coming and going and as dedicated to the public use as builded things in america when not mere closed churches only can be unmistakable its air of having had all consciously from the first to raise its head and play its part without pomp and circumstance to back it without mystery or ceremony to protect it without church or state to intervene on its behalf with only its immediacy its familiarity of interest to circle it about and only its proud outlook to preserve so far as possible its character the tomb of napoleon at the invalides is a great national property and the play of democratic manners sufficiently surrounds it but as compared to the small pavilion on the riverside bluff it is a holy of holies a great temple jealously guarded and formally approached and yet one doesnt conclude strange to say that the riverside pavilion fails of its expression a whit more than the paris dome one perhaps even feels it triumph by its use of its want of reserve as a very last word the admonition of all of which possibly is i confess i but grope for it that when there has been in such cases a certain other happy combination an original sincerity of intention an original propriety of site and above all an original high value of name and fame something in this line really supreme publicity familiarity immediacy as i have called them carried far enough may stalk in and out of the shrine with their hands in their pockets and their hats on their heads and yet not dispel the presence the question at any rate puts itself as new questions in america are always putting themselves do certain impressions there represent the absolute extinction of old sensibilities or do they represent only new forms of them the inquiry would be doubtless easier to answer if so many of these feelings were not mainly known to us just by their attendant forms at this rate or on such a showing in the united states attendant forms being in every quarter remarkably scarce it would indeed seem that the sentiments implied are extinct for it would be an abuse of ingenuity i fear to try to read mere freshness of form into some of the more rank failures of observance there are failures of observance that stand at the best for failures of sense whereby however the question grows too great one must leave the tomb of grant to its conditions and its future with the simple note for it that if it be not in fact one of the most effective of commemorations it is one of the most missed on the whole i distinctly liked it v it is still vivid to me that returning in the springtime from a few weeks in the far west i reentered new york state with the absurdest sense of meeting again a ripe old civilization and travelling through a country that showed the mark of established manners it will seem i fear ones perpetual refrain but the moral was yet once more that values of a certain order are in such conditions all relative and that as some wants of the spirit must somehow be met one knocks together any substitute that will fairly stay the appetite we had passed great smoky buffalo in the raw vernal dawn with a vision for me of curiosity character charm whatever it might be too needfully sacrificed opportunity perhaps forever missed yet at the same time a vision in which the lost object failed to mock at me with the last concentration of shape and history as we moved eastward appeared to meet us in the look of the land in its more overwrought surface and thicker detail quite as if she had ever consciously declined to cross the border and were aware precisely of the queer feast we should find in her the recognition i profess was a preposterous ecstasy one couldnt have felt more if one had passed into the presence of some seated placid richvoiced gentlewoman after leaving that of an honest but boisterous hoyden it was doubtless a matter only of degrees and shades but never was such a pointing of the lesson that a sign of any sort may count double if it be but artfully placed i spent that day literally in the company of the richvoiced gentlewoman making my profit of it even in spite of a second privation the doom i was under of having only all wistfully all ruefully to avert my lips from the quaint silver bowl as i here quite definitely figured it in which she offered me the entertainment of antique albany at antique albany to a certainty the mature matron involved in my metaphor would have put on a particular grace and as our train crossed the river for further progress i almost seemed to see her stand at some gablewindow of dutch association one of the two or three impressed there on my infantile imagination to ask me why then i had come so far at all i could have replied but in troubled tones and i looked at the rest of the scene for some time no doubt as through the glaze of allbut filial tears thus it was possibly that i saw the river shine from that moment on as a great romantic stream such as could throw not a little of its glamour for the mood of that particular hour over the city at its mouth i had not even known in my untravelled state that we were to strike it on our way from chicago so that it represented all that afternoon so much beauty thrown in so much benefit beyond the bargain the so hard bargain for the traveller of the american railwayjourney at its best that ordeal was in any case at its best here and the perpetually interesting river kept its course by my right elbow with such splendid consistency that as i recall the impression i repent a little of having just now reflected with acrimony on the cost of the obtrusion of track and stations to the riverside view one must of course choose between dispensing with the ugly presence and enjoying the scenery by the aid of the same which but means really that to use the train at all had been to put ones self for any proper justice to the scenery in a false position that however takes us too far back and one can only save ones dignity by laying all such blames on our detestable age a decent respect for the hudson would confine us to the use of the boat all the more that american riversteamers have had from the earliest time for the true raffine their peculiar note of romance a possible commerce on the other hand with ones time which is always also the time of so many other busy people has long since made mincemeat of the rights of contemplation rights as reduced in the united states today and by quite the same argument as those of the noble savage whom we have banished to his narrowing reservation letting that pass at all events i still remember that i was able to put from the carwindow as many questions to the scene as it could have answered in the time even had its face been clearer to read its face was veiled for the most part in a mist of premature spring heat an atmosphere draping it indeed in luminous mystery hanging it about with sunshot silver and minimizing any happy detail any element of the definite from which the romantic effect might here and there have gained an accent there was not an accent in the picture from the beginning of the run to albany to the end for which thank goodness one is tempted to say on remembering how often over the land in general the accents are wrong yet if the romantic effect as we know it elsewhere mostly depends on them why should that glamour have so shimmered before me in their absence how should the picture have managed to be a constant combination of felicities was it just because the felicities were all vaguenesses and the beauties even the most celebrated all blurs was it perchance on that very account that i could meet my wonder so promptly with the inference that what i had in my eyes on so magnificent a scale was simply was famously style i was landed by that conclusion in the odd further proposition that style could then exist without accents a quandary soon after to be quenched however in the mere blinding radiance of a visit to west point i was to make that memorable pilgrimage a fortnight later and i was to find my question when it in fact took place shivered by it to mere silver atoms the very powers of the air seemed to have taken the case in hand and positively to have been interested in making it transcend all argument our sunday of midmay wet and windy let loose over the vast stage the whole procession of stormeffects the raw green of wooded heights and hollows was only everywhere rainbrightened the weather playing over it all day as with some great grey watercolour brush the essential character of west point and its native nobleness of position can have been but intensified i think by this artful process yet what was mainly unmistakable was the fact again of the suppression of detail as in the positive interest of the grand style one had therefore only to take detail as another name for accent the accent that might prove compromising in order to see it made good that style could do without them and that the grand style in fact almost always must how on this occasion the trick was played is more than i shall attempt to say it is enough to have been conscious of our being from hour to hour literally bathed in that high element with the very face of nature washed so to speak the more clearly to express and utter it such accordingly is the strong silver light all simplifying and ennobling in which i see west point see it as a cluster of high promontories of the last classic elegance overhanging vast receding reaches of river mountainguarded and dim which took their place in the geography of the ideal in the long perspective of the poetry of association rather than in those of the state of new york it was as if the genius of the scene had said no you shant have accent because accent is at the best local and special and might here by some perversity how do i know after all interfere i want you to have something unforgettable and therefore you shall have type yes absolutely have type and even tone without accent an impossibility you may hitherto have supposed but which you have only to look about you now really to see expressed and type and tone of the very finest and rarest type and tone good enough for claude or turner if they could have walked by these rivers instead of by their thin rivers of france and italy type and tone in short that gather in shy detail under wings as wide as those with which a motherly hen covers her endangered brood so there you are deprived of all accent as a peg for criticism and reduced thereby you see to asking me no more questions i was able so to take home i may add this formula of the matter that even the interesting facts of the school of the soldier which have carried the name of the place about the world almost put on the shyness the air of conscious evasion and escape noted in the above allocution they struck me as forsaking the foreground of the picture it was part of the play again no doubt of the grey watercolour brush there was to be no consent of the elements that day to anything but a generalized elegance in which effect certainly the clustered the scattered academy played on its high green stage its part but of all things in the world it massed to my vision more mildly than i had somehow expected and i take that for a feature precisely of the pure poetry of the impression it lurked there with grace it insisted without swagger and i could have hailed it just for this reason indeed as a presence of the last distinction it is doubtless too much to say in fine that the institution at west point suffers comparatively for vulgar individual emphasis from the overwhelming liberality of its setting and i perhaps chanced to see it in the very conditions that most invest it with poetry the fact remains that both as to essence and as to quantity its prose seemed washed away and i shall recall it in the future much less as the sternest the world over of all the seats of discipline than as some great corotcomposition of young vague wandering figures in splendidlyclassic shades vi i make that point for what it is worth only to remind myself of another occasion on which the romantic note sounded for me with the last intensity and yet on which the picture swarmed with accents as absent or present i must again call them that contributed alike to its interest and to its dignity the proof was complete on this second sunday with the glow of early summer already in possession that affirmed detail was not always affirmed infelicity since the scene here bristled with detail and detail of the importance that frankly constitutes accent only to the enhancement of its charm it was a matter once more of hanging over the hudson on the side opposite west point but further down the situation was founded as at west point on the presence of the great feature and on the consequent general lift of foreground and distance alike and yet infinitely sweet was it to gather that style in such conditions and for the success of such effects had not really to depend on mere kind vaguenesses on any anxious deprecation of distinctness there was no vagueness now a wealth of distinctness in the splendid light met the eyes but with the very result of showing them how happily it could play what it came back to was that the accents in the delightful old pillared and porticoed house that crowned the cliff and commanded the stream were as right as they were numerous so that there immediately followed again on this observation a lively recognition of the ground of the rightness to wonder what this was could be but to see straightway that though many reasons had worked together for them mere time had done more than all that beneficence of time enjoying in general in the united states so little even of the chance that so admirably justifies itself for the most part when interference happens to have spared it cases of this rare mercy yet exist as i had had occasion to note and their consequent appeal to the touched sense within us comes as i have also hinted with a force out of all proportion comes with a kind of accepted insolence of authority the things that have lasted in short whatever they may be succeed as no newness try as it will succeeds inasmuch as their success is a created interest there we catch the golden truth which so much of the american world strikes us as positively organized to gainsay the truth that production takes time and that the production of interest in particular takes most time desperate again and again the ingenuity of the offered the obtruded substitute and pathetic in many an instance its confessed failure this remark being meanwhile relevant to the fact that my charming old historic house of the golden sunday put me off among its great trees its goodly gardens its acquired signs and gathered memories with no substitute whatever even the most specious but just paid cash down so to speak ripe ringing gold over the counter for all the attention it invited it had character as one might say and character is scarce less precious on the part of the homes of men in a raw medium than on the part of responsible persons at a difficult crisis this virtue was there within and without and on every face but perhaps nowhere so present i thought as in the ideal refuge for summer days formed by the wide north porch if porch that disposition may be called happiest disposition of the old american countryhouse which sets tall columns in a row under a pediment suitably severe to present them as the making of a high deep gallery i know not what dignity of old afternoons suffused with what languor seems to me always under the murmur of american trees and by the lap of american streams to abide in these mild shades there are combinations with depths of congruity beyond the plummet it would seem even of the most restless of analysts and rather than try to say why my whole impression here melted into the general iridescence of a past of indian summers hanging about mild ghosts half asleep in hammocks over still milder novels i would renounce altogether the art of refining for the iridescence consists in this connection of a shimmer of association that still more refuses to be reduced to terms some sense of legend of aboriginal mystery with a still earlier past for its dim background and the insistent idea of the river as above all romantic for its warrant helplessly analyzed perhaps this amounts to no more than the very childish experience of a galleried house or two round about which the views and the trees and the peaches and the pony seemed prodigious and to the remembrance of which the wonder of rip van winkle and that of the hudson river school of landscape art were a little later on to contribute their glamour if rip van winkle had been really at the bottom of it all nothing could have furthered the whole case more on the occasion i speak of than the happy nearness of the home of washington irving the impression of which i was thus able in the course of an hour to work in with the effect of intensifying more than i can say the oldtime charm and the general legendary fusion these are beautiful delicate modest matters and how can one touch them with a light enough hand how can i give the comparatively coarse reasons for my finding at sunnyside which contrives by some grace of its own to be at once all ensconced and embowered in relation to the world and all frank and uplifted in relation to the river a perfect treasure of mild moralities the highway the old state road to albany bristling now with the cloudcompelling motor passes at the head of a deep long lane winding embanked overarched such an oldworld lane as one scarce ever meets in america but if you embrace this chance to plunge away to the left you come out for your reward into the quite indefinable air of the little american literary past the place is inevitably today but a qualified sleepy hollow the sleepy hollow of the authors charming imagination was as i take it off somewhere in the hills or in some dreamland of old autumns happily unprofanable now for modernity with its terrible power of working its will of abounding in its sense of gilding its toy modernity with its pockets full of money and its conscience full of virtue its heart really full of tenderness has seated itself there under pretext of guarding the shrine what has happened in a word is very much what has happened in the case of other shy retreats of anchorites doomed to celebrity the primitive cell has seen itself encompassed in time by a temple of many chambers all dedicated to the history of the hermit the cell is still there at sunnyside and there is even yet so much charm that one doesnt attempt to say where the parts of it all kept together in a rich conciliatory way begin or end though indeed i hasten to add the identity of the original modest house the shrine within the gilded shell has been religiously preserved one has in fact i think no quarrel whatever with the amplified state of the place for it is the manner and the effect of this amplification that enable us to read into the scene its very most interesting message the little american literary past i just now said using that word whatever the real size of the subject because the caressing diminutive at sunnyside is what rises of itself to the lips the small uncommodious study the limited library the dear old portraitprints of the first half of the century very dear today when properly signed and properly sallow these things with the beauty of the site with the sense that the man of letters of the unimproved age the age of processes still comparatively slow could have wanted no deeper softer dell for mulling material over represent the conditions that encounter now on the spot the sharp reflection of our own increase of arrangement and loss of leisure this is the admirable interest of the exhibition of which wolferts roost had been a hundred years before the date of irvings purchase the rudimentary principle that it throws the facts of our earlier intellectual activity into a vague golden perspective a haze as of some unbroken spell of the same indian summer i a moment ago had occasion to help myself out with a fond appearance than which nothing could minister more to envy if we envy the spinners of prose and tellers of tales to whom our american air anciently either administered or refused sustenance this is all and quite the best thing it would seem that we need do for them it exhausts or rather it forestalls the futilities of discrimination strictly critical mooning about wolferts roost of a summer sunday i defy even the hungriest of analysts to be his predecessors the whole connected company profit so there to his rueful vision by the splendour of their possession of better conditions than his it has taken our ugly era to thrust in the railroad at the foot of the slope among the masking trees the railroad that is part exactly of the pomp and circumstance the quickened pace the heightened fever the narrowed margin expressed within the very frame of the present picture as i say and all in the perfect good faith of collateral piety i had hoped not to have to name the railroad it seems so to give away my case there was no railroad however till long after irvings settlement he survived the railroad but by a few years and my case is simply that disengaging his sunnyside from its beautiful extensions and arriving thus at the sense of his easy elements easy for everything but rushing about and being rushed at the sense of his command of the admirable river and the admirable country his command of all the mildness of his life of his pleasant powers and his ample hours of his friends and his contemporaries and his fame and his honour and his temper and above all of his delightful fund of reminiscence and material i seemed to hear in the summer sounds and in the very urbanity of my entertainers the last faint echo of a felicity forever gone that is the true voice of such places and not the imputed challenge to the chronicler or the critic iv new york social notes i were i not afraid of appearing to strike to excess the socalled pessimistic note i should really make much of the interesting appealing touching vision of waste i know not how else to name it that flung its odd melancholy mantle even over ones walks through the parts of the town supposedly noblest and fairest for it proceeded the vision i think from a source or two still deeper than the most obvious the constant shocked sense of houses and rows of recent expensive construction that had cost thought as well as money that had taken birth presumably as a serious demonstration and that were thereby just beginning to live into history marked for removal for extinction in their prime and awaiting it with their handsome faces so fresh and yet so wan and so anxious the most tragic element in the french revolution and thence surely the most tragic in human annals was the so frequent case of the very young sent to the scaffold the youths and maidens all bewildered and stainless lately born into a world decked for them socially with flowers and for whom none the less suddenly the horror of horrors uprose they were literally the victims i thought of absurd as it may seem under the shock in question in spite of which however even this is not what i mean by my impression of the squandered effort i have had occasion to speak and one can only speak with sympathy of the really human the communicative side of that vivid show of a society trying to build itself with every elaboration into some coherent sense of itself and literally putting forth interrogative feelers as it goes into the ambient air literally reaching out to the charmed beholder say for some measure and some test of its success this effect of certain of the manifestations of wealth in new york is so far as i know unique nowhere else does pecuniary power so beat its wings in the void and so look round it for the charity of some hint as to the possible awkwardness or possible grace of its motion some sign of whether it be flying for good taste too high or too low in the other american cities on the one hand the flights are as yet less numerous though already promising no small diversion and amid the older congregations of men in the proportionately rich cities of europe on the other hand good taste is present for reference and comparison in a hundred embodied and consecrated forms which is why to repeat i found myself recognizing in the new york predicament a particular character and a particular pathos the whole costly uptown demonstration was a record in the last analysis of individual loneliness whence came precisely its insistent testimony to waste waste of the still wider sort than the mere game of rebuilding that quite different admonition of the general european spectacle the effect in the picture of things as of a large consummate economy traditionally practised springs from the fact that old societies old and even new aristocracies are arranged exactly to supply functions forms the whole element of custom and perpetuity to any massiveness of private ease however great massive private ease attended with no force of assertion beyond the hour is an anomaly rarely encountered therefore in countries where the social arrangements strike one as undertaking by their very nature and pretension to make the future as interesting as the past these conditions the romantic ones for the pictureseeker are generally menaced one is reminded they tend to alter everywhere partly by the very force of the american example and it may be said that in france for instance they have done nothing but alter for a hundred years it none the less remains true that for once that we ask ourselves in europe what is going to become of a given piece of property whether family situation or else palace castle picture parure other attribute of wealth we indulge in the question twenty times in the united states so scant an engagement does the visible order strike us as taking to provide for it there comes in the note of loneliness on the part of these loose values deep as the look in the eyes of dogs who plead against a change of masters the visible order among ourselves undertakes at the most that they shall change hands and the meagreness and indignity of this doom affect them as a betrayal just in proportion as they have grown great uppermost fifth avenue for example is lined with dwellings the very intention both of the spread and of the finish of which would seem to be to imply that they are entailed as majestically as red tape can entail them but we know how little they enjoy any such courtesy or security and but for our tender heart and our charming imagination we would blight them in their bloom with our restless analysis its all very well for you to look as if since youve had no past youre going in as the next best thing for a magnificent compensatory future what are you going to make your future of for all your airs we want to know what elements of a future as futures have gone in the great world are at all assured to you do what you will you sit here only in the lurid light of business and you know without our reminding you what guarantees what majestic continuity and heredity that represents where are not only your eldest son and his eldest son those prime indispensables for any real projection of your estate unable as they would be to get rid of you even if they should wish but where even is the old family stocking properly stuffed and hanging so heavy as not to stir some dreadful day in the cold breath of wall street no what you are reduced to for importance is the present pure and simple squaring itself between an absent future and an absent past as solidly as it can you overdo it for what you are you overdo it still more for what you may be and dont pretend above all with the objectlesson supplied you close at hand by the queer case of newport dont pretend we say not to know what we mean we say i put it but the point is that we say nothing and it is that very small matter of newport exactly that keeps us compassionately silent the present state of newport shall be a chapter by itself which i long to take in hand but which must wait its turn so that i may mention it here only for the supreme support it gives to this reading of the conditions of new york opulence the show of the case today oh so vividly and pathetically is that new york and other opulence creating the place for a series of years as part of the effort of american society to find out by experiment what it would be at now has no further use for it has only learned from it at an immense expenditure how to get rid of an illusion weve found out after all since its a question of what we would be at that we wouldnt be at newport if we can possibly be anywhere else which with our means we indubitably can be so that we leave poor dear newport just ruefully to show it that remark is written now over the face of the scene and i can think nowhere of a mistake confessed to so promptly yet in terms so exquisite so charmingly cynical the terms of beautiful houses and delicate grounds closed condemned and forsaken yet so kept up at the same time as to cover the retreat of their projectors the very air and light soft and discreet seem to speak in tactful fashion for people who would be embarrassed to be there as if it might shame them to see it proved against them that they could once have been so artless and so bourgeois the point is that they have learned not to be by the rather terrible process of exhausting the list of mistakes newport for them or for us others is only one of these mistakes and we feel no confidence that the pompous new york houses most of them so flagrantly tentative and tentative only bristling with friezes and pinnacles but discernibly deficient in reasons shall not collectively form another it is the hard fate of new aristocracies that the element of error with them has to be contemporary not relegated to the dimness of the past but receiving the full modern glare a light fatal to the fond theory that the best society everywhere has grown in all sorts of ways in spite of itself we see it in new york trying trying its very hardest to grow not yet knowing by so many indications what to grow on there comes back to me again and again for many reasons a particular impression of this interesting struggle in the void a constituted image of the upper social organism floundering there all helplessly more or less floated by its immense goodwill and the splendour of its immediate environment but betrayed by its paucity of real resource the occasion i allude to was simply a dinnerparty of the most genial intention but at which the note of high ornament of the general uplifted situation was so consistently struck that it presented itself on the page of new york life as a purple patch without a possible context as consciously almost painfully unaccompanied by passages in anything like the same key the scene our feast was a palace and the perfection of setting and service absolute the ladies beautiful gracious and glittering with gems were in tiaras and a semblance of courttrains a sort of prescribed official magnificence but it was impossible not to ask ones self with what in the wide american frame such great matters might be supposed to consort or to rhyme the material pitch was so high that it carried with it really no social sequence no application and that as a tribute to the ideal to the exquisite it wanted company support some sort of consecration the difficulty the irony of the hour was that so many of the implications of completeness that is of a sustaining social order were absent there was nothing for us to do at eleven oclock or for the ladies at least but to scatter and go to bed there was nothing as in london or in paris to go on to the going on is for the new york aspiration always the stumblingblock a great courtfunction would alone have met the strain met the terms of the case would alone properly have crowned the hour when i speak of the terms of the case i must remind myself indeed that they were not all of one complexion which is but another sign however of the inevitable jaggedness of the purple patch in great commercial democracies the high colour required could be drawn in abundance from the ladies but in a very minor degree one easily perceived from the men the impression was singular but it was there had there been a courtfunction the ladies must have gone on to it alone trusting to have the proper partners and mates supplied them on the premises supplied say with the checks for recovery of their cloaks the high pitch all the exalted reference was of the palatial house the wouldbe harmonious women the tiaras and the trains it was not of the amiable gentlemen delightful in their way in whose so often quaint presence yet without whose immediate aid the effort of american society to arrive at the best consciousness still goes forward this failure of the sexes to keep step socially is to be noted in the united states at every turn and is perhaps more suggestive of interesting drama as i have already hinted than anything else in the country but it illustrates further that foredoomed grope of wealth in the conquest of the amenities the strange necessity under which the social interest labours of finding out for itself as a preliminary what civilization really is if the men are not to be taken as contributing to it but only the women what new case is that under the sun and under what strange aggravations of difficulty therefore is the problem not presented we should call any such treatment of a different order of question the empirical treatment the limitations and aberrations of which crop up for the restless analyst in the most illustrative way its presence is felt unmistakably for instance in the general extravagant insistence on the opera which plays its part as the great vessel of social salvation the comprehensive substitute for all other conceivable vessels the whole social consciousness thus clambering into it under stress as the whole community crams into the other public receptacles the desperate cars of the subway or the vast elevators of the tall buildings the opera indeed as new york enjoys it one promptly perceives is worthy musically and picturesquely of its immense function the effect of it is splendid but one has none the less the oddest sense of hearing it as an institution groan and creak positively almost split and crack with the extra weight thrown upon it the weight that in worlds otherwise arranged is artfully scattered distributed over all the ground in default of a courtfunction our ladies of the tiaras and courttrains might have gone on to the operafunction these occasions offering the only approach to the implication of the tiara known so to speak to the american law yet even here there would have been no one for them in congruity and consistency to curtsey to their only possible course becoming thus it would seem to make obeisance clingingly to each other this truth points again the effect of a picture poor in the male presence for to what male presence of native growth is it thinkable that the wearer of an american tiara should curtsey such a vision gives the measure of the degree in which we see the social empiricism in question putting perforce the cart before the horse in worlds otherwise arranged besides there being always plenty of subjects for genuflection the occasion itself with its character fully turned on produces the tiara in new york this symbol has by an arduous extension of its virtue to produce the occasion ii i found it interesting to note furthermore that the very clubs on whose behalf if anywhere expert tradition might have operated betrayed with a bonhomie touching in the midst of their magnificence the empirical character was not their admirable their unique hospitality for that matter an empirical note a departure from the consecrated collective egoism governing such institutions in worlds as i have said otherwise arranged let the hospitality in this case at least stand for the prospective discovery of a new and better law under which the consecrated egoism itself will have become the provincial sign endless at all events the power of one or two of these splendid structures to testify to the state of manners of manners undiscourageably seeking the superior stable equilibrium there had remained with me as illuminating from years before the confidential word of a friend on whom after a long absence from new york the privilege of one of the largest clubs had been conferred the place is a palace for scale and decoration but there is only one kind of letterpaper there would be more kinds of letterpaper now i take it though the american club struck me everywhere oddly considering the busy people who employ it as much less an institution for attending to ones correspondence than others i had had knowledge of generally destitute in fact of copious and various appliances for that purpose there is such a thing as the imagination of the writingtable and i nowhere save in a few private houses came upon its fruits to which i must add that this is the one connection in which the provision for ease has not an extraordinary amplitude an amplitude unequalled anywhere else one emphatic reservation throughout the country the restored absentee finds himself continually making but the universal custom of the house with almost no one of its indoor parts distinguishable from any other is an affliction against which he has to learn betimes to brace himself this diffused vagueness of separation between apartments between hall and room between one room and another between the one you are in and the one you are not in between place of passage and place of privacy is a provocation to despair which the public institution shares impartially with the luxurious home to the spirit attuned to a different practice these dispositions can only appear a strange perversity an extravagant aberration of taste but i may here touch on them scarce further than to mark their value for the characterization of manners they testify at every turn then to those of the american people to the prevailing conception of life they correspond within doors to the as inveterate suppression of almost every outward exclusory arrangement the instinct is throughout as we catch it at play that of minimizing for any interior the guilt or odium or responsibility whatever these may appear of its being an interior the custom rages like a conspiracy for nipping the interior in the bud for denying its right to exist for ignoring and defeating it in every possible way for wiping out successively each sign by which it may be known from an exterior the effacement of the difference has been marvellously triumphantly brought about and with all the ingenuity of young fresh frolicsome architecture aiding and abetting has been made to flourish alike in the small structure and the great as the very law of the structural fact thus we have the law fulfilled that every part of every house shall be as nearly as may be visible visitable penetrable not only from every other part but from as many parts of as many other houses as possible if they only be near enough thus we see systematized the indefinite extension of all spaces and the definite merging of all functions the enlargement of every opening the exaggeration of every passage the substitution of gaping arches and far perspectives and resounding voids for enclosing walls for practicable doors for controllable windows for all the rest of the essence of the roomcharacter that roomsuggestion which is so indispensable not only to occupation and concentration but to conversation itself to the play of the social relation at any other pitch than the pitch of a shriek or a shout this comprehensive canon has so succeeded in imposing itself that it strikes you as reflecting inordinately as positively serving you up for convenient inspection under a clear glass cover the social tone that has dictated it but i must confine myself to recording for the moment that it takes a whole new discipline to put the visitor at his ease in so merciless a medium he finds himself looking round for a background or a limit some localizing fact or two in the interest of talk of that good talk which always falters before the complete proscription of privacy he sees only doorless apertures vainly festooned which decline to tell him where he is which make him still a homeless wanderer which show him other apertures corridors staircases yawning expanding ascending descending and all as for the purpose of giving his presence away of reminding him that what he says must be said for the house he is beguiled in a measure by reading into these phenomena ever so sharply the reason of many another impression he is beguiled by remembering how many of the things said in america are said for the house so that if all that he wants is to keep catching the finer harmony of effect and cause of explanation and implication the cup of his perception is full to overflowing that satisfaction does represent certainly much of his quest all the more that what he misses in the place the comfort and support for instance of windows porches verandahs lawns gardens grounds that by not taking the whole world into their confidence have not the whole worlds confidence to take in return ranges itself for him in that large mass of american idiosyncrasy which contains unmistakably a precious principle of future reaction the desire to rake and be raked has doubtless he makes out a long day before it still but there are too many reasons why it should not be the last word of any social evolution the social idea has too inevitably secrets in store quite other constructive principles quite other refinements on the idea of intercourse with which it must eventually reckon it will be certain at a given moment i think to head in a different direction altogether though obviously many other remarkable things changes of ideal of habit of key will have to take place first the conception of the home and a fortiori of the club as a combination of the hall of echoes and the toy transparency held against the light will meanwhile sufficiently prevail to have made my reference to it not quite futile yet i must after all remember that the reservation on the ground of comfort to which i just alluded applies with its smallest force to the interchangeability of club compartments to the omnipresence of the majestic open arch in club conditions such conditions more or less prescribe that feature and criticism begins only when private houses emulate the form of clubs what i had mainly in mind was another of these so inexhaustible values of my subject with which the question of rigour of comfort has nothing to do i cherish certain remembered aspects for their general vivid eloquence for the sake of my impression of the type of great generous clubestablishments in which the empiricism of that alreadyobserved idea of the conquest of splendour could richly and irresponsibly flower it is of extreme interest to be reminded at many a turn of such an exhibition that it takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition and an endless amount of tradition to make even a little taste and an endless amount of taste by the same token to make even a little tranquillity tranquillity results largely from taste tactfully applied taste ighted siclighted above all by experience and possessed of a clue for its labyrinth there is no such clue for clubfelicity as some view of congruities and harmonies completeness of correspondence between aspects and uses a sense for that completeness is a thing of slow growth one of the flowers of tradition precisely of the good conservative tradition that walks apart from the extravagant use of money and the unregulated appeal to style passes in fact at its best quite on the other side of the way this discrimination occurs when the ground has the good fortune to be already held by some definite some transmitted conception of the adornments and enhancements that consort and that do not consort with the presence the habits the tone of lounging gossiping smoking newspaperreading bridgeplaying cocktailimbibing men the clubdevelopments of new york read here and there the lesson of the strange deserts in which the appeal to style may lose itself may wildly and wantonly stray without a certain light of the fine old gentlemanly prejudice to guide it iii but i should omit half my small story were i not meanwhile to make due record of the numerous hours at which one ceased consciously to discriminate just suffering ones sense to be flooded with the large clean light and with that suggestion of a crowded party of young persons which lurked in the general aspect of the handsomer regions a great circle of brilliant and dowered debutantes and impatient youths expert in the cotillon waiting together for the first bars of some wonderful imminent dancemusic something wilder than any ever yet it is such a wait for something more these innocents scarce know what it is this distinctly that the upper new york picture seems to cause to play before us but the wait is just that collective alertness of brighteyed lightlimbed clearvoiced youth without a doubt in the world and without a conviction which last however always may perfectly be absent without prejudice to confidence the confidence and the innocence are those of children whose world has ever been practically a safe one and the party so imaged is thus really even a childs party enormously attended but in which the united ages of the company make up no formidable sum in the light of that analogy the new york social movement of the day i think always shines as the whole show of the socalled social life of the country does for that matter since it comes home to the restless analyst everywhere that this childish explanation is the one that meets the greatest number of the social appearances to arrive and with tolerable promptitude at that generalization is to find it right and left immensely convenient and thereby quite to cling to it the newspapers alone for instance doing so much to feed it from day to day as with their huge playfully brandished wooden spoon we seem at moments to see the incoherence and volatility of childhood its living but in the sense of its hour and in the immediacy of its want its instinctive refusal to be brought to book its boundless liability to contagion and boundless incapacity for attention its ingenuous blankness today over the appetites and clamours of yesterday its chronic state of besprinklement with the sawdust of its rippedup dolls which it scarce goes even through the form of shaking out of its hair we seem at moments to see these things i say twinkle in the very air as by reflection of the movement of a great sunny playroom floor the immensity of the native accommodation socially speaking for the childish life is not that exactly the key of much of the spectacle the safety of the vast flat expanse where every margin abounds and nothing too untoward need happen the question is interesting but i remember quickly that i am concerned with it only so far as it is part of the light of new york it appeared at all events on the late days of spring just a response to the facility of things and to much of their juvenile pleasantry to find ones self liking without more ado and very much even at the risk of ones life the heterogeneous miscellaneous apology for a square marking the spot at which the main entrance as i suppose it may be called to the park opens toward fifth avenue opens toward the glittering monument to sherman toward the most deathdealing perhaps of all the climaxes of electric car crosscurrents toward the loosest of all the loose distributions of the overtopping apartment and other hotel toward the most jovial of all the sacrifices of preconsidered composition toward the finest of all the reckless revelations in short of the brave new york humour the best thing in the picture obviously is saintgaudenss great group splendid in its golden elegance and doing more for the scene by thus giving the beholder a point of such dignity for his orientation than all its other elements together strange and seductive for any lover of the reasons of things this inordinate value on the spot of the dauntless refinement of the sherman image the comparative vulgarity of the environment drinking it up on one side like an insatiable sponge and yet failing at the same time sensibly to impair its virtue the refinement prevails and as it were succeeds holds its own in the medley of accidents where nothing else is refined unless it be the amplitude of the quiet note in the front of the metropolitan club amuses itself in short with being as extravagantly intellectual as it likes why therefore given the surrounding medium does it so triumphantly impose itself and impose itself not insidiously and gradually but immediately and with force why does it not pay the penalty of expressing an idea and being founded on one such scant impunity seeming usually to be enjoyed among us at this hour by any artistic intention of the finer strain but i put these questions only to give them up for what i feel beyond anything else is that mr saintgaudens somehow takes care of himself to what measureless extent he does this on occasion one was to learn in due course from his magnificent lincoln at chicago the lesson there being simply that of a mystery exquisite the absolute inscrutable one of the happiest cases known to our time known doubtless to any time of the combination of intensity of effect with dissimulation with deep disavowal of process after seeing the lincoln one consents for its author to the drop of questions that is the lame truth a truth in the absence of which i should have risked another word or two have addressed perhaps even a brief challenge to a certain ambiguity in the sherman its idea to which i have alluded strikes me as equivocal or more exactly as double the image being on the one side and splendidly rendered that of an overwhelming military advance an irresistible march into an enemys country the strain forward the very inflation of drapery with the rush symbolizing the very breath of the destroyer but the idea is at the same time which part of it is also admirably expressed that the destroyer is a messenger of peace with the olive branch too waved in the blast and with embodied grace in the form of a beautiful american girl attending his business and i confess to a lapse of satisfaction in the presence of this interweaving the result doubtless of a sharp suspicion of all attempts however glittering and golden to confound destroyers with benefactors the military monument in the city square responds evidently wherever a pretext can be found for it to a desire of mens hearts but i would have it always as military as possible and i would have the destroyer in intention at least not docked of one of his bristles i would have him deadly and terrible and if he be wanted beautiful beautiful only as a wargod and crested not with peace but with snakes peace is a long way round from him and blood and ashes in between so with a less intimate perversity i think than that of mr saintgaudenss brilliant scheme i would have had a sherman of the terrible march the immortal march in all abundance if that be the needed note not irradiating benevolence but signifying by every ingenious device the misery the ruin and the vengeance of his track it is not ones affair to attempt to teach an artist how such horrors may be monumentally signified it is enough that their having been perpetrated is the very ground of the monument and monuments should always have a clean clear meaning iv i must positively get into the gate of the park however even at the risk of appearing to have marched round through georgia to do so i found myself in may and june getting into it whenever i could and if i spoke just now of the loud and inexpensive charm inexpensive in the aesthetic sense of the precinct of approach to it that must positively have been because the park diffuses its grace one grasped at every pretext for finding it inordinately amiable and nothing was more noteworthy than that one felt in doing so how this was the only way to play the game in fairness the perception comes quickly in new york of the singular and beautiful but almost crushing mission that has been laid as an effect of time upon this limited territory which has risen to the occasion from the first so consistently and bravely it is a case distinctly in which appreciation and gratitude for a public function admirably performed are twice the duty on the visitors part that they may be in other such cases we may even say putting it simply and strongly that if he doesnt here in his thought keep patting the park on the back he is guilty not alone of a failure of natural tenderness but of a real deviation from social morality for this mere narrow oblong much too narrow and very much too short had directly prescribed to it from its origin to do officially on behalf of the city the publicly amiable and all the publicly amiable all there could be any question of in the conditions incurring thus a heavier charge i respectfully submit than one has ever before seen so gallantly carried such places the municipallyinstituted pleasuregrounds of the greater and the smaller cities abound about the world and everywhere no doubt agreeably enough play their part but is the part anywhere else as heroically played in proportion to the difficulty the difficulty in new york that is the point for the restless analyst conscious as he is that other cities even in spite of themselves lighten the strain and beguile the task a burden which here on the contrary makes every inch of its weight felt this means a good deal for the space comprised in the original new york scheme represents in truth a wonderful economy and intensity of effort it would go hard with us not to satisfy ourselves in other quarters and it is of the political and commercial capitals we speak of some such amount of general outside amenity of charm in the town at large as may here and there even at widelyscattered points relieve the oerfraught heart the sense of the picturesque often finds its account in strange and unlikely matters but has none the less a way of finding it and so in the coming and going takes the chance but the new york problem has always resided in the absence of any chance to take however one might come and go come and go that is before reaching the park to the park accordingly and to the park only hitherto the aesthetic appetite has had to address itself and the place has therefore borne the brunt of many a peremptory call acting out year after year the character of the cheerful capable bustling even if overworked hostess of the one inn somewhere who has to take all the travel who is often at her wits end to know how to deal with it but who none the less has for the honour of the house never once failed of hospitality that is how we see central park utterly overdone by the run on its resources yet also never having had to make an excuse when once we have taken in thus its remarkable little history there is no endearment of appreciation that we are not ready to lay as a tribute on its breast with the interesting effect besides of our recognizing in this light how the place has had to be in detail and feature exactly what it is it has had to have something for everybody since everybody arrives famished it has had to multiply itself to extravagance to pathetic little efforts of exaggeration and deception to be breathlessly everywhere and everything at once and produce on the spot the particular romantic object demanded lake or river or cataract wild woodland or teeming garden boundless vista or bosky nook noble eminence or smiling valley it has had to have feature at any price the clamour of its customers being inevitably for feature which accounts as we forgivingly see for the general rather eruptive and agitated effect the effect of those old quaint prints which give in a single view the classic gothic and other architectural wonders of the world that is its sole defect its being inevitably too selfconscious being afraid to be just vague and frank and quiet i should compare her again and the propriety is proved by this instinctively feminine pronoun to an actress in a company destitute through an epidemic or some other stress of all other feminine talent so that she assumes on successive nights the most dissimilar parts and ranges in the course of a week from the tragedy queen to the singing chambermaid that valour by itself wins the public and brings down the house it being really a marvel that she should in no part fail of a hit which is what i mean in short by the sweet ingratiation of the park you are perfectly aware as you hang about her in may and june that you have as a travelled person beheld more remarkable scenery and communed with nature in ampler or fairer forms but it is quite equally definite to you that none of those adventures have counted more to you for experience for stirred sensibility inasmuch as you can be at the best and in the showiest countries only thrilled by the pastoral or the awful and as to pass in new york from the discipline of the streets to this so different manysmiling presence is to be thrilled at every turn the strange thing moreover is that the crowd in the happiest seasons at favouring hours the polyglot hebraic crowd of pedestrians in particular has for what it is none but the mildest action on the nerves the nerves are too grateful the intention of beauty everywhere too insistent it places the superfluous figures with an art of its own even when placing them in heavy masses and they become for you practically as your fellowspectators of the theatre whose proximity you take for granted while the little overworked cabotine we have hypothesized the darling of the public is vocalizing or capering i recall as singularly contributive in all this sense the impression of a splendid sunday afternoon of early summer when during a couple of hours spent in the mingled medium the variety of accents with which the air swarmed seemed to make it a question whether the park itself or its visitors were most polyglot the condensed geographical range the number of kinds of scenery in a given space competed with the number of languages heard and the whole impression was of ones having had but to turn in from the plaza to make in the most agreeable manner possible the tour of the little globe and that frankly i think was the best of all impressions was seeing new york at its best for if ever one could feel at ones ease about the social question it would be surely somehow on such an occasion the number of persons in circulation was enormous so great that the question of how they had got there from their distances and would get away again in the so formidable public conveyances loomed in the background rather like a skeleton at the feast but the general note was thereby intensely the popular and the brilliancy of the show proportionately striking that is the great and only brilliancy worth speaking of to my sense in the general american scene the air of hard prosperity the ruthlessly pushedup and promoted look worn by men women and children alike i remember taking that appearance of the hour or two for a climax to the sense that had most remained with me after a considerable previous moving about over the land the sense of the small quantity of mere human sordidness of state to be observed one is liable to observe it in any best of all possible worlds and i had not in truth gone out of my way either to avoid it or to look for it only i had met it enough in other climes without doing so and had to be veracious not absolutely and utterly missed it in the american images of confirmed though strangely of active occupied and above all sensitive squalor had i encountered in new hampshire hills also below the southern line certain special certain awful examples in black and white alike of the last crudity of condition these spots on the picture had however lost themselves in the general attestation of the truth most forced home the vision of the country as supremely a field for the unhampered revel the unchecked essor material and moral of the common man and the common woman how splendidly they were making it all answer for the most part or to the extent of the so rare public collapse of the individual had been an observation confirmed for me by a rapid journey to the pacific coast and back yet i had doubtless not before seen it so answer as in this very concrete case of the swarming new york afternoon it was little to say in that particular light that such grossnesses as want or tatters or gin as the unwashed face or the illshod and still less the unshod foot or the mendicant hand became strange unhappy faroff things it would even have been an insult to allude to them or to be explicitly complacent about their absence the case was unmistakably universally of the common the very common man the very common woman and the very common child but all enjoying what i have called their promotion their rise in the social scale with that absence of acknowledging flutter that serenity of assurance which marks for the impressed class the schoolboy or the schoolgirl who is accustomed and who always quite expects to move up the children at play more particularly the little girls formed the characters as it were in which the story was written largest frisking about over the greenswards grouping together in the vistas with an effect of the exquisite in attire of delicacies of dress and personal keepup as through the shimmer of silk the gloss of beribboned hair the gleam of caredfor teeth the pride of varnished shoe that might well have created a doubt as to their popular affiliation this affiliation was yet established by sufficiencies of context and might well have been for that matter by every accompanying vocal or linguistic note the swarm of queer sounds mostly not to be interpreted that circled round their pretty heads as if they had been tamers of odd outlandish perching little birds they fell moreover into the vast category of those ubiquitous children of the public schools who occupy everywhere in the united states so much of the forefront of the stage and at the sight of whose so remarkably clad and shod condition the brooding analyst with the social question never after all too much in abeyance could clap in private the most reactionary hands the brooding analyst had in fact from the first of his return recognized in the mere detail of the testimony everywhere offered to the high pitch of the american shoeindustry a lively incentive to cheerful views the population showing so promptly in this connection as the best equipped in the world the impression at first had been irresistible two industries at the most seemed to rule the american scene the dentist and the shoedealer divided it between them to that degree positively that in public places in the perpetual electric cars which seem to ones desperation at times so condemned is one to live in them all there measurably is of the american scene almost any other typical any other personal fact might be neglected for consideration in the interest of the presentable foot and the farshining dental gold it was a world in which every one without exception no matter how low in the social scale wore the best and the newest the neatest and the smartest boots to be added to which always for the brooding analyst was the fascination so to speak of noting how much more than any other single thing this may do for a possibly compromised appearance and if my claim for the interest of this exhibition seems excessive i refer the objector without hesitation to a course of equivalent observation in other countries taking an equally miscellaneous show for his basis nothing was more curious than to trace on a great ferryboat for instance the effect of letting ones eyes work up as in speculation from the lower to the higher extremities of some seated row of ones fellow passengers the testimony of the lower might preponderantly have been always to their comparative conquest of affluence and ease but this presumption gave way at successive points with the mounting vision and was apt to break down entirely under the evidence of face and head when i say head i mean more particularly where the men were concerned hat this feature of the equipment being almost always at pains and with the oddest most inveterate perversity to defeat and discredit whatever might be best in the others such are the problems in which a restless analysis may land us why should the general feeling for the boot in the united states be so mature so evolved and the feeling for the hat lag at such a distance behind it the standard as to that article of dress struck me as everywhere of the lowest governed by no consensus of view custom or instinct no sense of its vital importance in the manly aspect and yet the wearer of any loose improvisation in the way of a headcover will testify as frankly in his degree to the extreme consideration given by the community at large as i have intimated to the dental question the terms in which this evidence is presented are often among the people strikingly artless but they are a marked advance on the omnipresent opposite signs those of a systematic detachment from the chair of anguish with which any promiscuous european exhibition is apt to bristle i remember to have heard it remarked by a french friend of a young woman who had returned to her native land after some years of domestic service in america that she had acquired there with other advantages le sourire californien and the californian smile indeed expressed more or less copiously in undissimulated cubes of the precious metal plays between lips that render scant other tribute to civilization the greater interest in this connection however is that impression of the state and appearance of the teeth viewed among the refined as supremely important which the restored absentee long surrounded elsewhere with the strangest cynicisms of indifference on this article makes the subject of one of his very first notes every one in society has good handsome pretty has above all cherished and tended teeth so that the offered spectacle frequent in other societies of strange irregularities protrusions deficiencies fangs and tusks and cavities is quite refreshingly and consolingly absent the consequences of care and forethought from an early age thus write themselves on the facial page distinctly and happily and it is not too much to say that the total show is among american aspects cumulatively charming one sees it sometimes balance for charm against a greater number of less fortunate items in that totality than one would quite know how to begin estimating but i have strayed again far from my startingpoint and have again i fear succumbed to the danger of embroidering my small original proposition with too many and scarce larger derivatives i left the plaza i left the park steeped in the rosecolour of such a brightness of sunday and of summer as had given me on a couple of occasions exactly what i desired a simplified attention namely and the power to rest for the time in the appearance that the awful aliens were flourishing there in perfections of costume and contentment one had only to take them in as more completely conveniently and expensively endimanches than one had ever on the whole seen any other people in order to feel that one was calling down upon all the elements involved the benediction of the future and calling it down most of all on ones embraced permission not to worry any more it was by way of not worrying accordingly that i found in another presentment of the general scene chanced upon at a subsequent hour all sorts of interesting and harmonious suggestions these adventures of the critical spirit were such mere mild walks and talks as i almost blush to offer on this reduced scale as matter of history but i draw courage from the remembrance that history is never in any rich sense the immediate crudity of what happens but the much finer complexity of what we read into it and think of in connection with it if a walk across the park with a responsive friend late on the golden afternoon of a warm weekday and if a consequent desultory stroll for speculations sake through certain northward and eastward streets and avenues of an identity a little vague to me now save as a blur of builded evidence as to proprietary incomes if such an incident ministered on the spot to a boundless evocation it then became history of a splendid order though i perhaps must add that it became so for the two participants alone and with an effect after all not easy to communicate the season was over the recipients of income had retired for the summer and the large clear vistas were peopled mainly with that conscious hush and that spectral animation characteristic of places kept as with all command of time and space for the indifferent the all but insolent absentee it was a vast costly empty newness redeemed by the rare quiet and coloured by the pretty light and i scare know i confess why it should have had anything murmurous or solicitous to say at all why its eloquence was not over when it had thus defined itself as intensely rich and intensely modern if i have spoken with some emphasis of what it evoked i might easily be left it would appear with that emphasis on my hands did i not catch indeed for my explanation the very key to the anomaly ransacking my brain for the sources of the impressiveness i see them of a sudden locked up in that word modern the mystery clears in the light of the fact that one was perhaps for that halfhour more intimately than ever before in touch with the sense of the term it was exactly because i seemed with the ear of the spirit to hear the whole quarter bid as with one penetrating voice for the boon of the future for some guarantee or even mere hinted promise of history and opportunity that the attitude affected me as the last revelation of modernity what made the revelation was the collective sharpness so to speak of this vocal note offering any price offering everything wanting only to outbid and prevail at the great auction of life see how ready we are one caught the tone ready to buy to pay to promise ready to place to honour our purchase we have everything dont you see every capacity and appetite every advantage of education and every susceptibility of sense no tip in the world none that our time is capable of giving has been lost on us so that all we now desire is what you mr auctioneer have to dispose of the great going chance of a time to come that was the sound unprecedentedly evoked for me and in a form that made sound somehow overflow into sight it was as if in their high gallery the bidders new yorkers every one were before ones eyes pressing to the front hanging over the balustrade holding out clamorous importunate hands it was not certainly for general style pride and colour a paul veronese company even the women in spite of pearls and brocade and golden hair failed of that type and still more inevitably the men without doublet mantle ruff or sword the nearest approach might have been in the great hounds and the little blackamoors but my vision had a kind of analogy for what were the venetians after all but the children of a republic and of trade it was however mainly no doubt an affair of the supporting marble terrace the platform of my crowd with as many columns of onyx and curtains of velvet as any great picture could need about these there would be no difficulty whatever though this luxury of vision of the matter had meanwhile no excuse but the fact that the hour was charming the waning light still lucid the air admirable the neighbourhood a great empty stage expensively extravagantly set and the detail in frontage and cornice and architrave in every feature of every edifice as sharp as the uttered words of the plea i have just imagined v the american air i take advantage of this connection to remember lends a felicity to all the exactitudes of architecture and sculpture favours sharp effects disengages differences preserves lights defines projected shadows sculpture in it never either loses a value or conceals a loss and it is everywhere full of help to discriminated masses this remark was to be emphatically made i found myself observing in presence of so distinct an appeal to high clearness as the great palladian pile just erected by messrs tiffany on one of the upper corners of fifth avenue where it presents itself to the friendly sky with a great nobleness of white marble one is so thankful to it i recognize for not having twentyfive stories which it might easily have had i suppose in the wantonness of wealth or of greed that one gives it a double greeting rejoicing to excess perhaps at its merely remaining with the three fine arched and columned stages above its high basement within the conditions of sociable symmetry one may break ones heart certainly over its only being for interest a great miscellaneous shop if one has any heart left in new york for such adventures one may also reflect if any similar spring of reflection will still serve on its being to the very great limitation of its dignity but a more or less pious pastiche or reproduction the copy of a model that sits where venetian watersteps keep or used to keep vulgar invasion at bay but i hasten to add that one will do these things only at the cost of not putting in wherever one can the patch of optimism the sigh of relief the glow of satisfaction or whatever else the pardonably factitious emotion may be called which in new york is very bad economy look for interest where you may cultivate a working felicity press the spring hard and you will see that to whatever air palladian piles may have been native they can nowhere tell their great cold calculated story in measured chapter and verse better than to the strong sealight of new york this medium has the abundance of some ample childless mother who consoles herself for her sterility by an unbridled course of adoption as i seemed again to make out in presence of the tiers of white marble that are now on their way to replace the granitic mass of the old reservoir ultima thule of the northward walk of ones early time the reservoir of learning here taking form above great terraces which my minds eye makes as great as it would like lifts once more from the heart the weight of the tall building it apparently doesnt propose to become i could admire in the unfinished state of the work but the lower courses of this inestimable structure the public library that is to gather into rich alliance and splendid ease the great minor libraries of the town it was enough for my delight however that the conditions engage for a covering of the earth rather than an invasion of the air of so supreme an effect at the pitch things have reached is this single element of a generous area it offers the best of reasons for speaking of the project as inestimable any building that being beautiful presents itself as seated rather than as standing can do with your imagination what it will you ask it no question you give it a free field content only if it will sit and sit and sit and if you interrogate your joy in the connection you will find it largely founded i think on all the implications thus conveyed of a proportionately smaller quantity of the great religion of the elevator the lateral development of great buildings is as yet in the united states but an opportunity for the legs is in fact almost their sole opportunity a circumstance that taken alone should eloquently plead but it has another blest value for the imagination for the nerves as a check on the constant obsession of ones living of every ones living by the packed and hoisted basket the sempiternal lift for ones comings and goings affects one at last as an almost intolerable symbol of the herded and driven state and of that malady of preference for gregarious ways of insistence on gregarious ways only by which the people about one seem ridden to wait perpetually in a human bunch in order to be hustled under military drill the imperative order to step lively into some tight mechanic receptacle fearfully and wonderfully working is conceivable no doubt as a sad liability of our nature but represents surely when cherished and sacrificed to a strange perversion of sympathies and ideals anything that breaks the gregarious spell that relieves one of ones share however insignificant of the abject collective consciousness of being pushed and pressed in with something that ones shoulders and ones heels must dodge at their peril something that slides or slams or bangs operating in your rear as ruthlessly as the guillotine anything that performs this office puts a price on the lonely sweetness of a step or two taken by ones self of deviating into some sense of independent motive power of climbing even some grassgrown staircase with a dream perhaps of the thrill of fellowfeeling then taking then finding place something like robinson crusoes famous thrill before fridays footprint in the sand however these things might be i recall further as an incident of that hour of evocation the goodly glow under this same illumination of an immense red building off in the clear northeast quarter which had hung back with all success from the perpendicular form and which actually covered ground with its extensions of base its wide terrestrial wings it had i remember in the early evening light a homely kindness of diffused red brick and to make out then that it was a great exemplary hospital one of the many marvels of new york in this general order was to admire the exquisite art with which in such a medium it had so managed to invest itself with stillness it was as quiet there on its ample interspace as if the clamorous city roundabout as if the passion of the elevated and of the elevator in especial were forever at rest and no one were stepping lively for miles and miles away so that visibly it had spell to cast and a character to declare things i was won over on the spot to desire a nearer view of fortune presently favoured this purpose and almost my last impression of new york was gathered on a very hot june morning in the long cool corridors of the presbyterian hospital and in those halls of pain the high quiet active wards silverydim with their whiteness and their shade where the genius of the terrible city seemed to filter in with its energy sifted and softened with its huge goodnature refined there were reasons beyond the scope of these remarks for the interest of that hour but it is at least within the scope that i recall noting there all responsively as not before that if the direct pressure of new york is too often to ends that strike us as vulgar the indirect is capable and perhaps to an unlimited degree of these lurking effects of delicacy the immediate expression is the expression of violence but you may find there is something left something kept back for you if that has not from the first fatally deafened you it carries with it an aftersense which put on for me under several happy intimations the image of some garden of the finest flowers or of such as might be on the way to become the finest masked by an enormous bristling hedge of defensive and aggressive vegetation lacerating defiant not to be touched without blood one saw the garden itself behind its hedge and approachable only by those in the secret one divined it to contain treasures of delicacy many of them perhaps still to be developed but attesting the possibilities of the soil my presbyterian hospital was somehow in the garden just where the soil the very human soil itself was richest and though this may appear an odd tribute to an institution founded on the principle of instant decision and action it affected me amid its summer airs and its boundless soundless business as surpassingly delicate there if nowhere else was adjustment of tone there was the note of mildness and the sense of manners under the impression of which i am not sure of not having made up my mind that were i merely alone and disconcerted merely unprepared and unwarned in the vast dreadful place as must happen to so many a helpless mortal i should positively desire or elect as they say to become the victim of some such mischance as would put me into relation again the ambulance or the police aiding with these precious saving presences they might reestablish for me before the final extinction or dismissal some belief in manners and in tone was it in the garden also as i say that the metropolitan museum had meanwhile struck me as standing the impression of a quite other hazard of flanerie this and one of those memories once more that i find myself standing off from as under the shadow of their too numerous suggestion that institution is decidedly today part of the inner new york harmony that i have described as a touched aftersense so that if there were scattered about the place elements prompting rich if vague evocations this was recognizably one of the spots over which such elements would have most freedom to play the original museum was a thing of the far past hadnt i the vision of it from ancient days installed stately though scrappy in a large eccentric house in west fourteenth street a house the prior period even the early impressive construction of which one recalled from days still more ancient days so far away that to be able to travel back to them was almost as good or as bad as being a centenarian this superfluous consciousness of the original seat of the museum of where and what it had been was one of those terrible traps to memory about the town which baited themselves with the cheese of association so to speak in order to exhibit one afterwards as caught or otherwise expressed as old such being the convicted state of the unfortunate who knows the whole of so many of his stories the case is never really disguisable we get off perhaps when we only know the ends of things but beyond that our historic sense betrays us we have known the beginnings we have been present in the various connections at the birth the life and the death and it is wonderful how traceably in such a place as new york careers of importance may run their course and great institutions while you are just watching rise prosper and fall i had had my shudder in that same fourteenth street for the complete disappearance of a large church as massive as brown stone could make it at the engaging construction of which ones tender years had assisted it exactly faced the parental home and nefarious perilous play was found possible in the works but which after passing from youth to middle age and from middle age to antiquity has vanished as utterly as the assyrian empire so it was to be noted had the parental home and so the first home of the museum by what i made out beyond sixth avenue after which for the lastnamed had there not been a second seat long since superseded too a more prolonged etape on the glorious road this also gave out a shimmer from the middle time but with the present favouring stage of the journey the glorious road seems to stretch away it is a palace of art truly that sits there on the edge of the park rearing itself with a radiance yet offering you expanses to tread but i found it invite me to a matter of much more interest than any mere judging of its dispositions it spoke with a hundred voices of that huge process of historic waste that the place in general keeps putting before you but showing it in a light that drew out the harshness or the sadness the pang whatever it had seemed elsewhere of the reiterated sacrifice to pecuniary profit for the question here was to be of the advantage to the spirit not to the pocket to be of the aesthetic advantage involved in the wonderful clearance to come from the moment the visitor takes in two or three things first perhaps the scale on which in the past bewildering tribute has flowed in second the scale on which it must absolutely now flow out and third the presumption created by the vivacity of these two movements for a really fertilizing stir of the ground he sees the whole place as the field of a drama the nearer view of the future course of which he shall be sorry to lose one never winces after the first little shock when education is expensive one winces only at the expense which like so much of the expense of new york doesnt educate and education clearly was going to seat herself in these marble halls admirably prepared for her to all appearance and issue her instructions without regard to cost the obvious the beautiful the thrilling thing was that without regard to cost either they were going to be obeyed that inference was somehow irresistible the disembodied voices i have spoken of quite forcing it home and the palace roof arching to protect it as the dome of the theatre protects the performance i know not if all past purchase in these annals putting the cesnola collection aside has been without reproach but it struck me as safe to gather that putting aside again mr marquands rare munificence almost no past acceptance of gifts and bequests in kind had been without weakness in the light of sargents splendid portrait simply there would have been little enough weakness to associate with mr marquands collection but the gifts and bequests in general even when speciously pleasing or interesting constitute an objectlesson in the large presence of which the new york mind will perform its evolution an evolution traceable and with sharpness in advance i shall nevertheless not attempt to foretell it for sufficient to the situation surely is the appearance represented by its announcing shadow that acquisition acquisition if need be on the highest terms may during the years to come bask here as in a climate it has never before enjoyed there was money in the air ever so much money that was grossly expressed the sense of the whole intimation and the money was to be all for the most exquisite things for all the most exquisite except creation which was to be off the scene altogether for art selection criticism for knowledge piety taste the intimation which was somehow after all so pointed would have been detestable if interests other and smaller than these had been in question the education however was to be exclusively that of the sense of beauty this defined romantically for my evoked drama the central situation what left me wondering a little all the same was the contradiction involved in ones not thinking of some of its prospective passages as harsh here it is no doubt that one catches the charm of rigours that take place all in the aesthetic and the critical world they would be invidious would be cruel if applied to personal interests but they take on a high benignity as soon as the values concerned become values mainly for the mind if they happen to have also a tradevalue this is pure superfluity and excess the thought of the acres of canvas and the tons of marble to be turned out into the cold world as the penalty of old error and the warrant for a clean slate ought to have drawn tears from the eyes but these impending incidents affected me in fact on the spot as quite radiant demonstrations the museum in short was going to be great and in the geniality of the life to come such sacrifices though resembling those of the funeralpile of sardanapalus dwindled to nothing v the bowery and thereabouts i i scarce know once more if such a matter be a sign of the city itself or only another perversity on the part of a visitor apt to press a little too hard everywhere on the spring of the show but wherever i turned i confess wherever any aspect seemed to put forth a freshness there i found myself saying that this aspect was ones strongest impression it is impossible as i now recollect not to be amused at the great immediate differences of scene and occasion that could produce such a judgment and this remark directly applies no doubt to the accident of a visit one afternoon of the dire midwinter to a theatre in the bowery at which a young actor in whom i was interested had found for the moment a fine melodramatic opportunity this small adventure if the adventures of rash observation be ever small was to remain embalmed for me in all its odd sharp notes and perhaps in none more than in its element of contrast with an image antediluvian the memory of the conditions of a bowery theatre the bowery theatre in fact contemporary with my more or less gaping youth was that vast dingy edifice with its illustrious past still standing a point on which i was to remain vague while i electrically travelled through a strange a sinister overroofed clangorous darkness a wide thoroughfare beset for all its width with sound and fury and bristling amid the traffic with posts and piles that were as the supporting columns of a vast cold yet also uncannilyanimated sepulchre it was like moving the length of an interminable cage beyond the remoter of whose bars lighted shops struggling dimly under other penthouse effects offered their hebrew faces and hebrew names to a human movement that affected one even then as a breaking of waves that had rolled for their welter on this very strand from the other side of the globe i was on my way to enjoy no doubt some peculiarly american form of the theatric mystery but my way led me apparently through depths of the orient and i should clearly take my place with an oriental public i took it in fact in such a curtained corner of a private box as might have appeared to commit me to the most intimate interest possible might have done so that is if all old signs had not seemed visibly to fail and new questions mockingly insoluble to rise the old signs would have been those of some historic community so to speak between the play and the public between those opposed reciprocal quantities such a consciousness of the same general terms of intercourse for instance as i seemed to have seen prevail long years ago under the great dim bleak sonorous dome of the old bowery nothing so much imposed itself at first as this suggestive contrast the vision of the other big bare ranting stupid stage the grey void smelling of dust and tobaccojuice of a scene on which realism was yet to dawn but which addressed itself on the other hand to an audience at one with it audience and production had been then of the same stripe and the same tradition the pitch that is had been of our own domestic and romantic tradition to apply large words to a loose matter a matter rich in our very own aesthetic idiosyncrasy i should say in short if it didnt savour of pedantry that if this ancient poetic had been purely a homegrown thing nursed in the english intellectual cradle and in the american of a time when the american resembled the english closely enough so the instincts from which it sprang were instincts familiar to the whole body of spectators whose dim sense of art to use again the big word was only not thoroughly english because it must have been always so abundantly irish the foreign note in that thinner air was at the most the irish and i think of the elements of the jack sheppard and claude duval bowery including the peanuts and the orangepeel as quite harmoniously irish from the corner of the box of my so improved playhouse further down the very name of which moreover had the cosmopolite lack of point i made out in the audience the usual mere monotony of the richer exoticism no single face beginning with those close beside me for my box was a shared luxury but referred itself by my interpretation to some such strange outland form as we had not dreamed of in my day there they all sat the representatives of the races we have nothing in common with as naturally as comfortably as munchingly as if the theatre were their constant practice and as regards the munching i may add i was struck with the appearance of quality and cost in the various confections pressed from moment to moment upon our notice by the little playhouse peddlers it comes over me under this branch of my reminiscence that these almost highclass luxuries circulating in such a company were a sort of supreme symbol of the promoted state of the aspirant to american conditions he or more particularly she had been promoted and more or less at a bound to the habitual use of chocolatecreams and indeed of other dainties refined and ingenious compared with which these are quite vieux jeu this last remark might in fact open up for us had i space a view interesting to hold a moment or to follow as far as it might take us of the wondrous consumption by the people over the land of the most elaborate solid and liquid sweets such products as form in other countries an expensive and select dietary the whole phenomenon of this omnipresent and essentially popular appeal of the confectioner and pastrycook i can take time but to note is more significant of the economic and even of the social situation of the masses than many a circumstance honoured with more attention i found myself again and again in presence for example of the great glittering temples the bristling pagodas erected to the worship in question wherever men and women perhaps particularly women most congregate and above all under the high domes of the great modern railway stations i found myself wondering i say what such facts represented what light they might throw upon manners and wages wages in the country at large are largely manners the only manners i think it fair to say one mostly encounters the market and the home therefore look alike dazzling at first in this reflected manycoloured lustre it speaks somehow beyond anything else of the diffused sense of material ease since the solicitation of sugar couldnt be so hugely and artfully organized if the response were not clearly proportionate but how is the response itself organized and what are the other items of that general budget of labour what in especial are the attenuations of that general state of fatigue in which so much purchasingpower can flow to the supposedly superfluous the wageearners the toilers of old notably in other climes were known by the wealth of their songs and has it on these lines been given to the american people to be known by the number of their candies i must not let the question however carry me too far quite away from the point i was about to make of my sense of the queer chasm over which on the saturday afternoon at the windsor theatre i seemed to see the so domestic drama reach out to the so exotic audience and the so exotic audience reach out to the so domestic drama the play a masterpiece of its type if i may so far strain a point in such a case and in the interest of my young friends excellent performance as to predicate type was american to intensity in its blank conformity to convention the particular implanted convention of the place this convention simply expressed was that there should never be anything different in a play the most conservative of human institutions from what there had always been before that that place in a word should always know the very same theatric thing any deviation from which might be phrenology or freemasonry or ironmongery or anything else in the world but would never be drama especially drama addressed to the heart of the people the tricks and the traps the trucs the whole stagecarpentry might freely renew themselves to create for artless minds the illusion of a difference but the sense of the business would still have to reside in our ineradicable anglosaxon policy or our seemingly deepseated necessity of keeping where representation is concerned so far away from the truth and the facts of life as really to betray a fear in us of possibly doing something like them should we be caught nearer foreigners in general unmistakably in any attempt to render life obey the instinct of keeping closer positively recognize the presence and the solicitation of the deep waters yet here was my houseful of foreigners physiognomically branded as such confronted with our pale poetic fairly caught for schooling in our art of making the best of it nothing in the texture of the occasion could have had a sharper interest than this demonstration that since what we most pretend to do with them is thoroughly to school them the schooling by our system cannot begin too soon nor pervade their experience too much were they going to rise to it or rather to fall to it to our instinct as distinguished from their own for picturing life were they to take our lesson submissively in order to get with it our smarter traps and tricks our superior yankee machinery illustrated in the case before them for instance by a wonderful folding bed in which the villain of the piece pursuing the virtuous heroine round and round the room and trying to leap over it after her is at the young ladys touch of a hidden spring engulfed as in the jaws of a crocodile or would it be their dim intellectual resistance a vague stir in them of some unwitting heritage of the finer irony that i should make out on the contrary as withstanding the effort to corrupt them and thus perhaps really promising to react over the head of our offered mechanic bribes on our ingrained intellectual platitude one had only to formulate that question to seem to see the issue hang there for the excitement of the matter quite as if the determination were to be taken on the spot for the opposition over the chasm of the footlights as i have called it grew intense truly as i took in on one side the hue of the galician cheek the light of the moldavian eye the whole pervasive facial mystery swaying at the best for the moment over the gulf on the vertiginous bridge of american confectionery and took in on the other the perfect yankee quality of the challenge which stared back at them as in the white light of its hereditary thinness i neednt say that when i departed perhaps from excess of suspense it was without seeing the balance drop to either quarter and i am afraid i think of the odd scene as still enacted in many places and many ways the inevitable rough union in discord of the two groups of instincts the fusion of the two camps by a queer clumsy wasteful social chemistry such at all events are the roundabout processes of peaceful history the very history that succeeds for our edification in not consisting of battles and blood and tears ii i was happily to find at all events that i had not on that occasion done with the bowery or with its neighbourhood as how could one not rejoice to return to an air in which such infinite suggestion might flower the season had advanced though the summer night was no more than genial and the question for this second visit was of a lookin with two or three friends at three or four of the most characteristic evening resorts for reflection and conversation of the dwellers on the east side it was definitely not the question of any gaping view of the policed underworld unanimously pronounced an imposture in general at the best and essentially less interesting than the exhibition of public manners i found on the spot in harmony with this preference that nothing better could have been desired in the way of pure presentable picture subject always to the swinging lanternlight of the individual imagination than the first as i think it was for the roaming hour of our penetrated haunts a large semisubterranean establishment a beercellar rich in the sporting note adorned with images of strong men and lovely women prizefighters and ballerine and finding space in its deep bosom for a billiardroom and a bowlingalley all sociably squeezed together finding space above all for a collection of extraordinarily equivocal types of consumers an intensity of equivocation indeed planted just as if to await direct and convenient study in the most typical face of the collection a face which happened by good fortune to be that of the most officious presence when the element of the equivocal in personal character and history takes on in new york an addition from all the rest of the swarming ambiguity and fugacity of race and tongue the result becomes for the pictureseeker indescribably luridly strong there always comes up at view of the low physiognomy shown in conditions that denote a measure of impunity and ease the question than which few i think are more interesting to the psychologist of the forms of ability consistent with lowness the question of the quality of intellect the subtlety of character the mastery of the art of life with which the extremity of baseness may yet be associated that question held me i confess so under its spell during those almost first steps of our ingenuous enquete that i would gladly have prolonged just there my opportunity to sound it the fascination was of course in the perfection of the baseness and the puzzle in the fact that it could be subject without fatally muddling without tearing and rending them to those arts of life those quantities of conformity the numerous involved accommodations and patiences that are not in the repertory of the wolf and the snake extraordinary we say to ourselves on such occasions the amount of formal tribute that civilization is after all able to gouge out of apparently hopeless stuff extraordinary that it can make a presentable sheath for such fangs and such claws the mystery is in the how of the process in the wonderful little wavering borderland between nature and art the place of the crooked seam where if psychology had the adequate lens the white stitches would show all this played through ones thought to the infinite extension of the sufficiently close and thoroughly banal beercellar there happened to be reasons not to be shaded over why one of my companions should cause a particular chord of recognition to vibrate and the very convergence of hushed looks in the so loud general medium seemed to lay bare from table to table the secret of the common countenance common to that place put off its guard by curiosity almost by amiability the secret was doubtless in many cases but the poor familiar human secret of the vulgar mind of the soul unfurnished so to speak in respect to delicacy probity pity with a social decoration of the mere bleak walls of instinct but it was the unforgettable little personality that i have referred to as the presiding spirit it was the spokesman of our welcome the master of the scene himself who struck me as presenting my question in its finest terms to conduct a successful establishment to be a spokesman an administrator an employer of labour and converser on subjects let alone a citizen and a taxpayer was to have an existence abounding in relations and to be subject to the law that a relation however imperfectly human or social is at the worst a matter that can only be described as delicate well in presence of the abysmal obliquity of such a face of the abysmal absence of traceability or coherency in such antecedents where did the different delicacies involved come in at all how did intercourse emerge at all and much more emerge so brilliantly as it were from its dangers the answer had to be for the moment no doubt that if there be such a state as that of misrepresenting your value and use there is also the rarer condition of being so sunk beneath the level of appearance as not to be able to represent them at all appearance in you has thus not only no notes no language no authority but is literally condemned to operate as the treacherous sum of your poverties the jump was straight after this to a medium so different that i seem to see as the one drawback to evoking it again however briefly the circumstance that it started the speculative hare for even a longer and straighter run this irrepressible animal covered here however a much goodlier country covered it in the interest of a happy generalization the bold truth that even when apparently done to death by that property of the american air which reduces so many aspects to a common denominator certain finer shades of saliency and consistency do often by means known to themselves recover their rights they are like swimmers who have had to plunge to come round and under water but who pop out a panting head and shine for a moment in the sun my image is perhaps extravagant for the question is only of the kept recollection of a cafe pure and simple particularly pure and particularly simple in fact inasmuch as it dispensed none but soft drinks and presented itself thus in the light the quiet tempered intensely individual light of a beerhouse innocent of beer i have indeed no other excuse for calling it a beerhouse than the fact that it offered to every sense such a deep germanic peace as abides for the most part though not always even then where the deeplidded tankard balances with the scarce shallower bowl of the meditative pipe this modest asylum had its tone which i found myself after a few minutes ready to take for exquisite if on no other ground than its almost touching suggestion of discriminations made and preserved in the face of no small difficulty that is what i meant just now by my tribute to the occasional patience of unquenched individualism the practical subtlety of the spirit unashamed of its preference for the minor key clinging through thick and thin to its conception of decency and dignity and finding means to make it good even to the exact true shade these are the real triumphs of art the discriminations in favour of taste produced not by the gilded and guarded private room but by making publicity itself delicate making your barrier against vulgarity consist but in a few tables and chairs a few coffeecups and boxes of dominoes money in quantities enough can always create tone but it had been created here by mere unbuyable instinct the charm of the place in short was that its note of the exclusive had been arrived at with such a beautifully fine economy i try in memory and for the value of the lesson to analyze as it were the elements and seem to recall as the most obvious the contemplative stillness in which the faint click of the moved domino could he heard and into which the placid attention of the quiet honest men who were thus testifying for the exquisite could be read the exquisite yes was the triumph of their tiny temple with all the loud surrounding triumphs those of the coarse and the common making it but stick the faster like a wellinserted wedge and fully to catch this was to catch by the same stroke the main ground of the effect to see that it came most of all from felicity of suppression and omission there was so visibly too much everywhere else of everything vulgar that there reigned here for the difference the learnt lesson that there could scarce be in such an air of infection little enough in quantity and mass of anything the felicity had its climax in the type or rather in the individual character of our host who officiating alone had apparently suppressed all aids to service and succeeded as by an inspiration of genius in omitting for all his years to learn the current american he spoke but a dozen words of it and that was doubtless how he best kept the key of the old germanic peace of the friendly stillness in which while the east side roared a new metaphysic might have been thought out or the scheme of a new war intellectualized iii after this there were other places mostly higher in the scale and but a couple of which my memory recovers there was also as i recall a snatched interlude an associated dash into a small crammed convivial theatre an oblong hall bristling with pipe and glass at the end of which glowed for a moment a little dingily sonic broad passage of a yiddish comedy of manners it hovered there briefly as if seen through a spyglass reaching across the world to some faroff dowdy jewry then our sense of it became too mixed a matter it was a scent literally not further to be followed there remained with me none the less the patch of alien comedy with all it implied of esoteric vision on the part of the public something of that admonition had indeed earlier in the season been sharp so much had one heard of a brilliant yiddish actress who was drawing the town to the east side by the promise of a new note this lady however had disconcerted my own purpose by suddenly appearing in the orthodox quarter in a language only definable as not in intention yiddish not otherwise definable and i also missed through a like alarm the opportunity of hearing an admired actor of the same school he was yiddish on the east side but he cropped up with a wild growth in broadway as well and his auditors seemed to know as little as care to what idiom they supposed themselves to be listening marked in new york by many indications this vagueness of ear as to differences as to identities of idiom i must not however under that interference lose the echo of a couple of other of the impressions of my crowded summer night and all the less that they kept working it as i seem to remember up to a higher and higher pitch it had been intimated to me that one of these scenes of our climax had entered the sophisticated phase that of sacrificing to a selfconsciousness that was to be regretted that of making eyes so to speak at the larger the uptown public that pestilent favour of society which is fatal to everything it touches and which so quickly leaves the places of its passage unfit for its own use and uninteresting for any other this establishment had learned to lay on local colour with malice prepense the local colour of its slav origin and was the haunt on certain evenings of the week of yearning groups from fifth avenue sated with familiar horizons yet there were no yearning groups none that is save our own at the time of our visit there was only very amply and pleasantly presented another aspect of the perpetual process of the new york intermarriage as the venetian republic in the person of the doge used to go forth on occasion to espouse the adriatic so it is quite as if the american incarnate in its greatest port were for ever throwing the nuptial ring to the still more richlydowered atlantic i speak again less of the nuptial rites themselves than of those immediate fruits that struck me everywhere as so characteristic so equally characteristic i mean of each party to the union the flourishing establishment of my present reference offered distinctly its outland picture but showed it in an american frame and the features of frame and picture arranged themselves shrewdly together quiet couples elderly bourgeois husbands and wives sat there over belated sausage and cheese potatosalad and hungarian wine the wife with her knitting produced while the husband finished his cigar and the indication for the moment might have been of some evening note of dantzig or of budapesth but the conditioning foreign and the visibility of their quite so happily conjugal giveandtake in new york is my reason for this image of the repeated espousals why were the quiet easy couples with their homely cafe habit kept in the best relation to the growth under the clicking needles of the marital stocking such remote and indirect results of our local anecdotic past our famous escape at our psychological moment from king george and his works with all sorts of inevitable lapses and hitches in any grateful consciousness they might ever have of that prime cause of their new birth yet why on the other hand could they affect one even with the fatherland planked under them in the manner of the prayingcarpet spread beneath the good mahometan as still more disconnected from the historic consciousness implied in their own type and with the mere moral identity of german or slav or whatever it might be too extinct in them for any possibility of renewal the exotic boss here did speak i remember fluent eastside new yorkese and it was in this wonderful tongue that he expressed to us his superior policy his refined philosophy announced his plans for the future and presented himself to my vision as a possibly farreaching masterspirit what remains with me is this expression and the colour and the quality of it and the free familiarity and the damned foreign impudence with so much taken for granted and all the hitches and lapses all the solutions of continuity in his inward assimilation of our heritage and point of view matched as these were on our own side by such signs of large and comparatively witless concession what oh what again were he and his going to make of us well there was the impression and that was a question on which for a certain intensity in it our adventure might have closed but it was so far from closing that late though the hour it presently opened out into a vast and complicated picture which i find myself thinking of after an interval as the splendid crown of the evening here were we still on the east side but we had moved up by stages artfully inspired into the higher walks into a pavilion of light and sound and savoury science that struck one as vaguely vast as possibly gardened about and that blazing into the stillness of the small hours dazzled one with the show of its copious and various activity the whole vision was less intimate than elsewhere but it was a world of custom quite away from any mere delmonico tradition of ones earlier time and rich as one might reckon it in its own queer marks marks probably never yet reduced inspiring thought to literary notation with which it would seem better to form a point of departure for fresh exploration than serve as tailpiece to the end of a chapter who were all the people and whence and whither and why in the good new york small hours where was the place after all and what might it or might it not truly represent to slightlyfatigued feasters who in a recess like a privileged operabox at a bal masque and still communing with polyglot waiters looked down from their gallery at a multitudinous supper a booming orchestra an elegance of disposed plants and flowers a perfect organization and an abyss of mystery was it on third avenue on second on fabulous unattempted first nothing would induce me to cut down the romance of it in remembrance to a mere address least of all to an awful new york one new york addresses falling so below the grace of a city where the very restaurants may on occasion under restless analysis flash back the likeness of venetian palaces flaring with the old carnival the ambiguity is the element in which the whole thing swims for me so nocturnal so bacchanal so hugely hatted and feathered and flounced yet apparently so innocent almost so patriarchal again and matching in its mixture with nothing one had elsewhere known it breathed its simple new york new york at every impulse of inquiry so that i can only echo contentedly with analysis for once quite agreeably baffled remarkable unspeakable new york vi the sense of newport i newport on my finding myself back there threatened me sharply quite at first with that predicament at which i have glanced in another connection or two the felt condition of having known it too well and loved it too much for description or definition what was one to say about it except that one had been so affected so distraught and that discriminations and reasons were buried under the dust of use there was a chance indeed that the breath of the long years of the interval of absence i mean would have blown away this dust and that precisely was what one was eager to see to go out to look about to recover the sense was accordingly to put the question without delay to the proof and with the happy consequence i think of an escape from a grave discomfiture the charm was there again unmistakably the little old strange very simple charm to be expressed as a fine proposition or to be given up but the answer came in the fact that to have walked about for halfanhour was to have felt the question clear away it cleared away so conveniently so blissfully in the light of the benign little truth that nothing had been less possible even in the early ingenuous infatuated days than to describe or define newport it had clearly had nothing about it to describe or define so that ones fondness had fairly rested on this sweet oddity in it one had only to look back to recognize that it had never condescended to give a scrap of reasoned account of itself as a favourite of fortune and the haunt of the raffine it had simply lain there like a little bare white open hand with slightlyparted fingers for the observer with a presumed sense for hands to take or to leave the observer with a real sense never failed to pay this image the tribute of quite tenderly grasping the hand and even of raising it delicately to his lips having no less at the same time the instinct of not shaking it too hard and that above all of never putting it to any rough work such had been from the first under a chastened light and in a purple sea the dainty isle of aquidneck which might have avoided the weak mistake of giving up its pretty native name and of becoming thereby as good as nameless with an existence as rhode island practically monopolized by the state and a newport identity borrowed at the best and applicable but to a corner does not this vagueness of condition however fitly symbolize the small virtual promontory of which superficially nothing could be predicated but its sky and its sea and its sunsets one views it as placed there by some refinement in the scheme of nature just as a touchstone of taste with a beautiful little sense to be read into it by a few persons and nothing at all to be made of it as to its essence by most others i come back for its essence to that figure of the little white hand with the gracefullyspread fingers and the fine grain of skin even the dimples at the joints and the shelllike delicacy of the pink nails all the charms in short that a little white hand may have i see all the applications of the image i see a special truth in each it is the back of the hand rising to the swell of the wrist that is exposed which is the way i think the true lover takes and admires it he makes out in it bending over it or he used to in the old days innumerable shy and subtle beauties almost requiring for justice a magnifyingglass and he winces at the sight of certain other obtruded ways of dealing with it the touchstone of taste was indeed to operate for the critical the tender spirit from the moment the pink palm was turned up on the chance of what might be in it for nine persons out of ten among its visitors its purchasers of sites and builders of in the old parlance cottages there had never been anything in it at all except of course an opportunity an opportunity for escaping the summer heat of other places for bathing for boating for riding and driving and for many sorts of more or less expensive riot the pink palm being empty in other words to their vision they had begun from far back to put things into it things of their own and of all sorts and of many ugly and of more and more expensive sorts to fill it substantially that is with gold the gold that they have ended by heaping up there to an amount so oddly out of proportion to the scale of nature and of space this process one was immediately to perceive with that renewal of impression this process of injection and elaboration of creating the palpable pile had been going on for years to such a tune that the face of nature was now as much obliterated as possible and the original shy sweetness as much as possible bedizened and bedevilled all of which moreover might also at present be taken as having led in turn to the most unexpected climax a matter of which i shall presently speak the original shy sweetness however that range of effect which i have referred to as practically too latent and too modest for notation had meanwhile had its votaries the fond pedestrian minority for whom the little white hand to return for an instant to my figure with which as you see i am charmed had always been so full of treasures of its own as to discredit from the point of view of taste any attempt from without to stuff it fuller such attempts had in the nature of the case and from far back been condemned to show for violations violations of taste and discretion to begin with violations more intimately as the whole business became brisker of a thousand delicate secret places dear to the disinterested rambler small mild points and promontories far away little lonely sandy coves rockset lilysheeted ponds almost hidden and shallow arcadian summerhaunted valleys with the sea just over some stony shoulder a whole world that called out to the long afternoons of youth a world with its scale so measured and intended and happy its detail so finished and pencilled and stippled certainly for american detail that there comes back to me across the many years no better analogy for it than that of some fine foreground in an old line engraving there remained always a sense of course in which the superimpositions the multiplied excrescences were a tribute to the value of the place where no such liberty was ever taken save exactly because as even the most blundering builder would have claimed it was all so beautiful so solitary and so sympathetic and that indeed has been thanks to the pilerson of gold the fortune the history of its beauty that it now bristles with the villas and palaces into which the cottages have all turned and that these monuments of pecuniary power rise thick and close precisely in order that their occupants may constantly remark to each other from the windows to the grounds and from house to house that it is beautiful it is solitary and sympathetic the thing has been done it is impossible not to perceive with the best faith in the world though not altogether with the best light which is always so different a matter and it is with the general consequence only at the end of the story that i find myself today concerned so much concerned i found myself i profess after i had taken in this fact of a very distinct general consequence that the whole interest of the vision was quickened by it and that when in particular on one of the last days of june among the denselyarrayed villas i had followed the beautiful ocean drive to its uttermost reach and back without meeting either another vehicle or a single rider let alone a single pedestrian i recognized matter for the intellectual thrill that attests a social revolution foreseen and completed the term i use may appear extravagant but it was a fact none the less that i seemed to take full in my face on this occasion the cold stir of air produced when the whirligig of time has made one of its liveliest turns it is always going the whirligig but its effect is so to blow up the dust that we must wait for it to stop a moment as it now and then does with a pant of triumph in order to see what it has been at i saw beyond all doubt on the spot and there came in exactly the thrill i could remember far back enough to have seen it begin to blow all the artless buyers and builders and blunderers into their places leaving them there for half a century or so of fond security and then to see it of a sudden blow them quite out again as with the happy consciousness of some new amusing use for them some other game still to play with them this acquaintance as it practically had been with the whole rounding of the circle even though much of it from a distance was tantamount to the sense of having sat out the drama the social the local that of a real american period from the rise to the fall of the curtain always assuming that truth of the reached catastrophe or denouement how this climax or solution had been arrived at that clearly for the spectator would have been worth taking note of but what he made of it i shall not glance at till i have shown him as first of all on the spot quite modestly giving in to mere primary beguilement it had been certain in advance that he would find the whole picture overpainted and the question could only be at the best of how much of the ancient surface would here and there glimmer through the ancient surface had been the concern as i have hinted of the small fond minority the comparatively few people for whom the lurking shy charm all there but all to be felt rather than published did in fact constitute a surface the question as soon as one arrived was of whether some ghost of that were recoverable ii there was always to begin with the old town we used before we had become old ourselves to speak of it that way in the manner of an allusion to nuremberg or to carcassonne since it had been leading its little historic life for centuries as we implied before cottages and houseagents were dreamed of it was not that we had great illusions about it or great pretensions for it we only thought it without interference very good of its kind and we had as to its being of that kind no doubt whatever would it still be of that kind and what had the kind itself been these questions made ones heart beat faster as one went forth in search of it distinctly if it had been of a kind it would still be of it for the kind wouldnt at the worst or at the best one scarce knew how to put it have been worth changing so that the question for the restored absentee who so palpitated with the sense of it all hung absolutely on the validity of the past one might well hold ones breath if the past with the dear little blue distances in it were in danger now of being given away one might well pause before the possible indication that a cherished impression of youth had been but a figment of the mind fortunately however at newport and especially where the antiquities cluster distances are short and the note of reassurance awaited me almost round the first corner one had been a hundred times right for how was one to think of it all as one went on if one didnt think of it as old there played before ones eyes again in fine in that unmistakable silvery shimmer a particular property of the local air the exquisite law of the relative the application of which on the spot is required to make even such places as viterbo and bagdad not seem new one may sometimes be tired of the word but anything that has succeeded in living long enough to become conscious of its note is capable on occasion of making that note effectively sound it will sound we gather if we listen for it and the small silver whistle of the past with its charming quaver of weak gaiety quite played the tune i asked of it up and down the tiny sunny empty newport vistas perspectives coming to a stop like the very short walks of very old ladies what indeed but little very old ladies did they resemble the little very old streets with the same suggestion of present timidity and frugality of life the same implication in their few folds of drab of mourning of muslin still mysteriously starched the implication of no adventure at any time however far back that mightnt have been suitable to a lady the whole low promontory in its wider and remoter measurements is a region of jutting tidetroubled points but we had admired the old town too for the emphasis of its peculiar point the point a quarter distinguished we considered by a really refined interest here would have been my misadventure if i was to have any that of missing on the grey page of today the suggestive passages i remembered but i was to find to my satisfaction that there was still no more mistaking their pleasant sense than there had ever been a quiet mild waterside sense not that of the bold bluff outer sea but one in which shores and strands and small coast things played the greater part with overhanging back verandahs with little private wooden piers with painted boathouses and boats laid up with stillwater bathing the very words with their old slightly prim discrimination as of ladies and children jumping up and down reach me across the years with a widecurving bay and dim landward distances that melted into a mysterious rich superior but quite disconnected and not at all permittedly patronizing providence there were stories anciently for the point so prescribed a feature of it that one made them up freely and handsomely when they were not otherwise to be come by though one was never quite sure if they ought most to apply to the rather blankly and grimly colonial houses fadedly drab at their richest and mainly as the legend ran appurtenant to that quaker race whom massachusetts and connecticut had prehistorically cast forth and the great roger williams had handsomely welcomed or to the other habitations the felicitous cottages with their galleries on the bay and toward the sunset their pleasureboats at their little wharves and the supposition that clung to them of their harbouring the less fashionable of the outer great but also the more cultivated and the more artistic everything was there still as i say and quite as much as anything the prolonged echo of that ingenuous oldtime distinction it was a marvel no doubt that the handful of light elements i have named should add up to any total deserving the name of picture and if i must produce an explanation i seek it with a certain confidence in the sense of the secret enjoyed by that air for bathing or as one figures for dipping the objects it deals with it takes them uninteresting but feels immediately what submersion can do for them tips them in keeps them down holds them under just for the proper length of time after which they come up as i say irradiating vague silver the reflection of which i have perhaps here been trying to catch even to extravagance i did nothing at any rate all an autumn morning but discover again how good everything had been positively better than one had ventured to suppose in ones care to make the allowance for ones young simplicity some things indeed clearly had been better than one knew and now seemed to surpass any fair probability else why for instance should i have been quite awestruck by the ancient state house that overlooks the ancient parade an edifice ample majestic archaic of the finest proportions and full of a certain public dutch dignity having brave broad high windows in especial the distinctness of whose innumerable square whiteframed panes is the recall of some street view of haarlem or leyden here was the charming impression of a treasure of antiquity to the vague image of which through the years one hadnt clone justice any more than one had done it positively to three or four of the other oldtime ornaments of the parade which with its wide cobbly sleepy space of those years in the shadow of the state house must have been much more of a van der heyden or somebody of that sort than one could have dreamed there was a treasure of modernity to reckon with in the form of one of the commodores perry they are somehow much multiplied at newport and quite monumentally ubiquitous engaged in his great naval act but this was swept away in the general flood of justice to be done i continued to do it all over the place and i remember doing it next at a certain ample oldtime house which used to unite with the still prettier and archaic vernon near it to form an honourable pair in this mild towncorner where it was so indicated that the grass should be growing between the primitive pavingstones and where indeed i honestly think it mainly is amid whatever remains of them ancient peace had appeared formerly to reign though attended by the ghost of ancient war inasmuch as these had indubitably been the haunts of our auxiliary french officers during the revolution and no selfrespecting legend could fail to report that it was in the vernon house washington would have visited rochambeau there had hung about this structure which is architecturally speaking all rusticated and indefinable decency the implication of an inward charm that refined even on its outward and this was the tantalizing message its clean serious windows never yet debased struck me as still giving but it was still something told me a question of not putting anywhere too many presumptions to the touch so that my hand quitted the knocker when i was on the point of a tentative tap and i fell back on the neighbour and mate as to which there was unforgotten acquaintance to teach me certainty here alas cold change was installed the place had become a public office none of the artistic supercivilized no raffine of them all among the passing fanciers or collectors having strangely enough marked it for his own this mental appropriation it is or it was a few months ago really impossible not to make at sight of its delightful hall and almost grand staircase its charming recessed cupboarded windowseated parlours its general panelled amplitude and dignity the due taster of such things putting himself straight into possession on the spot and though wondering at the indifference and neglect breathing thanks for the absence of positive ravage for me there were special ghosts on the staircase known voices in the brown old rooms presences that one would have liked however to call a little to account people dont do those things people didnt let so clear a case clear for sound curiosity go like that they didnt somehow even if they were only ghosts but i thought too as i turned away of all the others of the foolish or at least of the responsible those who for so long have swarmed in the modern quarter and who make profession of the finer sense this impression had been disturbing but it had served its purpose in reconstituting with a touch a link in laying down again every inch of the train of association with the human the social personal newport of what i may call the middle years to go further afield to measure the length of the little old avenue and tread again the little old cliffwalk to hang over from above the little old white crescent of the principal bathingsands with the big pond behind them set in its stonewalled featureless fields to do these things and many others every one of them thus accompanied by the admission that all that had been had been little was to feel dead and buried generations push off even the transparence of their shroud and get into motion for the peopling of a scene that a present posterity has outgrown the company of the middle years the so considerably prolonged formative tentative imaginative newport time hadnt outgrown it this catastrophe was still to come as it constitutes precisely the striking dramatic denouement i have already referred to american society so far as that free mixture was to have arrived at cohesion had for half a century taken its whole relation with the place seriously which was by intention very gaily it long remained for its happiness quite at one with this most favoured resort of its comparative innocence in the attesting presence of all the constant elements of natural conditions that have after all persisted more than changed a hundred faraway passages of the extinct life and joy and of the comparative innocence came back to me with an inevitable grace a glamour as of the flushed ends of beautiful old summers making a quite rich medium a red sunset haze as it were for a processional throng of charioteers and riders fortunate folk fortunate above all in their untouched good faith adjourning from the pleasures of the day to those of the evening this benignity in particular overspread the picture hanging it there as the newport aspect that most lived again those good people all could make discoveries within the frame itself beginning of course to push it out in all directions so as sufficiently to enlarge it as they fondly fancied even for the experience of a sophisticated world they danced and they drove and they rode they dined and wined and dressed and flirted and yachted and polod and casinod responding to the subtlest inventions of their age on the old lawns and verandahs i saw them gather on the old shining sands i saw them gallop past the low headlands i saw their white sails verily flash and through the dusky old shrubberies came the light and sound of their feasts it had all been in truth a history for the imagination that could take it so and when once that kindly stage was offered them it was a wonder how many figures and faces how many names and voices images and embodiments of youth mainly and often of beauty and of felicity and fortune almost always or of what then passed for such pushed under my eyes in blurred gaiety to the front hadnt it been above all in its good faith the age of beauties the blessed age when it was so easy to be on the avenue a beauty and when it was so easy not less not to doubt of the unsurpassability of such as appeared there it was through the fact that the whole scheme and opportunity satisfied them the fact that the place was as i say good enough for them it was through this that with ingenuities and audacities and refinements of their own some of the more primitive of which are still touching to think of they extended the boundaries of civilization and fairly taught themselves to believe they were doing it in the interest of nature beautiful the time when the ocean drive had been hailed at once as a triumph of civilization and as a proof of the possible appeal of scenery even to the dissipated it was spoken of as of almost boundless extent as one of the wonders of the world as indeed it does turn often in the gloaming to purple and gold and as the small seacoves then gleam on its edge like barbaric gems on a mantle yet if it was a question of waving the wand and of breathing again till it stirred on the quaintness of the old manners i refer to those of the fifties sixties seventies and dont exclude those of the eighties it was most touching of all to go back to dimmest days days such as now appear antediluvian when oceandrives engineered by landscape artists and literally macadamized all the way were still in the lap of time when there was only an afternoon for the fort and another for the beach and another for the boathouse inconceivable innocence and even the shortness of the avenue seemed very long and even its narrowness very wide and even its shabbiness very promising for the future and when in fine chariots and cavaliers took their course across country to batemans by inelegant precarious tracts and returned through the darkling void with a sense of adventure and fatigue that i cant but think was the pure newport time the most perfectly guarded by a sense of margin and of mystery it was the time of settled possession and yet furthest removed from these blank days in which margin has been consumed and the palaces on the sites but the other day beyond price stare silently seaward monuments to the blase state of their absent proprietors purer still however i remind myself was that stretch of years which i have reasons for thinking sacred when the custom of seeking hibernation on the spot partly prevailed when the local winter inherited something of the best social grace as it liked at least to think of the splendid summer and when the strange sight might be seen of a considerable company of americans not gathered at a mere restcure who confessed brazenly to not being in business do i grossly exaggerate in saying that this company candidly quite excitedly selfconscious as all companies not commercial in america may be pleasantly noted as being formed for the time of its persistence an almost unprecedented small body unprecedented in american conditions a collection of the detached the slightly disenchanted and casually disqualified and yet of the resigned and contented of the socially orthodox a handful of mild oh delightfully mild cosmopolites united by three common circumstances that of their having for the most part more or less lived in europe that of their sacrificing openly to the ivory idol whose name is leisure and that not least of a formed critical habit these things had been felt as making them excrescences on the american surface where nobody ever criticized especially after the grand tour and where the great black ebony god of business was the only one recognized so i see them at all events in fond memory lasting as long as they could and finding no successors and they are most embalmed for me i confess in that scented somewhat tattered but faintly spiced wrapper of their various european antecedents i see them move about in the light of these and i understand how it was this that made them ask what would have become of them and where in the world the hard american world they could have hibernated how they could even in the season have bowed their economic heads and lurked if it hadnt been for newport i think of that question as in their reduced establishments over their winter whist under their private theatricals and pending constantly their loan and their return of the revue des deux mondes their main conversational note i find myself in fact tenderly evoking them as special instances of the great or perhaps i have a right only to say of the small american complication the state of ones having been so pierced betimes by the sharp outland dart as to be able ever afterwards but to move about vaguely and helplessly with the shaft still in ones side their nostalgia however exquisite was i none the less gather sterile for they appear to have left no seed they must have died some of them in order to go back to go back that is to paris if i make at all events too much of them it is for their propriety as a delicate subjective value matching with the intrinsic newport delicacy they must have felt that they obviously notably notoriously did match the proof of which was in the fact that to them alone of the customary thousands was the beauty of the good walk over the lovely little land revealed the customary thousands here as throughout the united states never set foot to earth yet this had happened so of old to be the particular corner of their earth that made that adventure most possible at newport as the phrase was in autumnal in vernal hibernation you could walk failing which in fact you failed of impressions the most consolatory and it is mainly to the far ends of the low densely shrubbed and perfectly finished little headlands that i see our friends ramble as if to stretch fond arms across the sea there used to be distant places beyond batemans or better still on the opposite isle of conanicut now blighted with ugly uses where nursing a nostalgia on the sunwarmed rocks was almost as good as having none at all so it was not only not our friends who had overloaded and overcrowded but it was they at last i infer who gave way before that grossness how should they have wished to leave seed only to be trampled by the white elephants the white elephants as one may best call them all cry and no wool all house and no garden make now for three or four miles a barely interrupted chain and i dare say i think of them best and of the distressful inevitable waste they represent as i recall the impression of a divine little drive roundabout them and pretty well everywhere taken for renewal of acquaintance while november was still mild i sought another renewal as i have intimated in the vacant splendour of june but the interesting evidence then only refined on that already gathered the place itself as man and often no doubt alas as woman with her love of the immediate and contiguous had taken it over was more than ever to the fancy like some dim simplified ghost of a small greek island where the clear walls of some pillared portico or pavilion perched afar looked like those of temples of the gods and where nature deprived of that ease in merely massing herself on which american scenery as we lump it together is too apt to depend for its effect might have shown a piping shepherd on any hillside or attached a mythic image to any point of rocks what an idea originally to have seen this miniature spot of earth where the seanymphs on the curved sands at the worst might have chanted back to the shepherds as a mere breedingground for white elephants they look queer and conscious and lumpish some of them as with an air of the brandished proboscis really grotesque while their averted owners roused from a witless dream wonder what in the world is to be done with them the answer to which i think can only be that there is absolutely nothing to be done nothing but to let them stand there always vast and blank for reminder to those concerned of the prohibited degrees of witlessness and of the peculiarly awkward vengeances of affronted proportion and discretion vii boston it sometimes uncomfortably happens for a writer consulting his remembrance that he remembers too much and finds himself knowing his subject too well which is but the case of the bottle too full for the wine to start there has to be room for the air to circulate between ones impressions between the parts of ones knowledge since it is the air or call it the intervals on the sea of ones ignorance of ones indifference that sets these floating fragments into motion this is more or less what i feel in presence of the invitation even the invitation written on the very face of the place itself of its actual aspects and appearances to register my impression of boston can one have in the conditions an impression of boston any that has not been for long years as inappreciable as a sunk picture that dead state of surface which requires a fresh application of varnish the situation i speak of is the consciousness of old knowledge knowledge so compacted by the years as to be unable like the bottled wine to flow the answer to such questions as these no doubt however is the practical one of trying a shake of the bottle or a brushful of the varnish my sunk sense of boston found itself vigorously varnished by mere renewal of vision at the end of long years though i confess that under this favouring influence i ask myself why i should have had after all the notion of overlaid deposits of experience the experience had anciently been small so far as smallness may be imputed to any of our prime initiations yet it had left consequences out of proportion to its limited seeming self early contacts had been brief and few and the slight bridge had long ago collapsed wherefore the impressed condition that acquired again on the spot an intensity struck me as but half explained by the inordinate power of assimilation of the imaginative young i should have had none the less to content myself with this evidence of the magic of past sensibilities had not the question suddenly been lighted for me as by a sudden flicker of the torch and for my special benefit carried in the hand of history this light waving for an instant over the scene gave me the measure of my relation to it both as to immense little extent and to quite subjective character i it was in strictness only a matter of noting the harshness of change since i scarce know what else to call it on the part of the approaches to a particular spot i had wished to revisit i made out after a little the entrance to ashburton place but i missed on that spacious summit of beacon hill more than i can say the pleasant little complexity of the other time marked with its share of the famous oldworld crookedness of boston that element of the mildly tortuous which did duty for the storyseeker as an ancient and romantic note and was half envied half derided by the merely rectangular criticism didnt one remember the day when new yorkers when philadelphians when pilgrims from the west sated with their eternal equidistances with the quadrilateral scheme of life raved about cornhill and appeared to find in the rear of the state house a recall of one of the topographical the architectural jumbles of europe or asia and did not indeed the small happy accidents of the disappearing boston exhale in a comparatively sensible manner the warm breath of history the history of something as against the history of nothing so that being gone or generally going they enabled one at last to feel and almost to talk about them as one had found ones self feeling and talking about the sacrificed relics of old paris and old london in this immediate neighbourhood of the enlarged state house where a great raw clearance has been made memory met that pang of loss knew itself sufficiently bereft to see the vanished objects a scant but adequate cluster of nooks of such odds and ends as parochial schemes of improvement sweep away positively overgrown within ones own spirit by a wealth of legend there was at least the gain at any rate that one was now going to be free to picture them to embroider them at ones ease to tangle them up in retrospect and make the real romantic claim for them this accordingly is what i am doing but i am doing it in particular for the sacrificed end of ashburton place the ashburton place that i anciently knew this eminently respectable byway on my return to question it opened its short vista for me honestly enough though looking rather exposed and undermined since the mouth of the passage to the west formerly measured and narrow had begun to yawn into space a space peopled in fact for the eye of appreciation with the horrific glazed perpendiculars of the future but the pair of ancient houses i was in quest of kept their tryst a pleasant individual pair mated with nothing else in the street yet looking at that hour as if their old still faces had lengthened their shuttered lidded eyes had closed their brick complexions had paled above the good granite basements to a fainter red all as with the cold consciousness of a possible doom that possibility on the spot was not present to me occupied as i was with reading into one of them a short page of history that i had my own reasons for finding of supreme interest the history of two years of faraway youth spent there at a period the closingtime of the war full both of public and of intimate vibrations the two years had been those of a young mans a very young mans earliest fond confidence in a literary career and the effort of actual attention was to recover on the spot some echo of ghostly footsteps the sound as of taps on the windowpane heard in the dim dawn the place itself was meanwhile at all events a conscious memento with old secrets to keep and old stories to witness for a saturation of life as closed together and preserved in it as the scent lingering in a folded pockethandkerchief but when a month later i returned again a justlyrebuked mistake to see if another whiff of the fragrance were not to be caught i found but a gaping void the brutal effacement at a stroke of every related object of the whole precious past both the houses had been levelled and the space to the corner cleared hammer and pickaxe had evidently begun to swing on the very morrow of my previous visit which had moreover been precisely the imminent doom announced without my understanding it in the poor scared faces i had been present by the oddest hazard at the very last moments of the victim in whom i was most interested the act of obliteration had been breathlessly swift and if i had often seen how fast history could be made i had doubtless never so felt that it could be unmade still faster it was as if the bottom had fallen out of ones own biography and one plunged backward into space without meeting anything that however seemed just to give me as i have hinted the whole figure of my connection with everything about a connection that had been sharp in spite of brevity and then had broken short off thus it was the sense of the rupture more than of anything else that i was and for a still much briefer time to carry with me it seemed to leave me with my early impression of the place on my hands inapt as might be for use so that i could only try rather vainly to fit it to present conditions among which it tended to shrink and stray it was on two or three such loitering occasions wondering and invoking pauses that had a little vaguely and helplessly perhaps the changed crest of beacon hill for their field it was at certain of these moments of charged yet rather chilled contemplation that i felt my small cluster of early associations shrivel to a scarce discernible point i recall a sunday afternoon in particular when i hung about on the now vaster platform of the state house for a near view of the military monuments erected there the statues of generals hooker and devens and for the charm at once and the pang of feeling the whole backward vista with all its features fall from that eminence into grey perspective the top of beacon hill quite rakes with a but slightly shifting range the old more definite boston for there seemed no item nor any number of that remarkable sum that it would not anciently have helped one to distinguish or divine there all these things essentially were at the moment i speak of but only again as something ghostly and dim something overlaid and smothered by the mere modern thickness i lingered halfanhour much of the new disposition of the elements here involved being duly impressive and the old uplifted front of the state house surely in its spare and austere its ruled and pencilled kind a thing of beauty more delightful and harmonious even than i had remembered it one of the inestimable values again in the eye of the town for taste and temperance as the perfectly felicitous park street church hard by was another the irresistible spell however i think was something sharper yet the coercion positively of feeling ones case the case of ones deeper discomfiture completely made out the day itself toward the winters end was all benignant like the immense majority of the days of the american year and there went forward across the top of the hill a continuous passage of men and women in couples and talkative companies who struck me as labouring wageearners of the simpler sort arrayed very comfortably in their sunday best and decently enjoying their leisure they came up as from over the common they passed or they paused exchanging remarks on the beauty of the scene but rapidly presenting themselves to me as of more interest for the moment than anything it contained for no sound of english in a single instance escaped their lips the greater number spoke a rude form of italian the others some outland dialect unknown to me though i waited and waited to catch an echo of antique refrains no note of any shade of american speech struck my ear save in so far as the sounds in question represent today so much of the substance of that idiom the types and faces bore them out the people before me were gross aliens to a man and they were in serene and triumphant possession nothing as i say could have been more effective for figuring the hitherward bars of a grating through which i might make out faroff in space my small homogeneous boston of the more interesting time it was not of course that our gross little aliens were immediate social figures in the narrower sense of the term or that any personal commerce of which there might be question could colour itself to its detriment from their presence but simply that they expressed as everywhere and always the great cost at which every place on my list had become braver and louder and that they gave the measure of the distance by which the general movement was away away always and everywhere from the old presumptions and conceivabilities boston the bigger braver louder boston was away and it was quite at that hour as if each figure in my procession were there on purpose to leave me no doubt of it therefore had i the vision as filling the sky no longer of the great puritan whip the whip for the conscience and the nerves of the local legend but that of a huge applied sponge a sponge saturated with the foreign mixture and passed over almost everything i remembered and might still have recovered the detail of this obliteration would take me too far but i had even then on a previous day as well as only halfanhour before caught at something that might stand for a vivid symbol of the general effect of it to come up from school street into beacon was to approach the athenaeum exquisite institution to fond memory joy of the aspiring prime yet to approach theathenaeumm only to find all disposition to enter it drop as dead as if from quick poison what did that denote but the dreadful chill of change and of the change in especial that was most completely dreadful for had not this honoured haunt of all the most civilized library gallery temple of culture the place that was to boston at large as boston at large was to the rest of new england had it not with peculiar intensity had a value the most charming of its kind no doubt in all the huge country and had not this value now evidently been brought so low that one shrank in delicacy from putting it to the test it was a case of the detestable tall building again and of its instant destruction of quality in everything it overtowers put completely out of countenance by the mere masses of brute ugliness beside it the temple of culture looked only rueful and snubbed hopelessly down in the world so that far from being moved to hover or to penetrate ones instinct was to pass by on the other side averting ones head from an humiliation one could do nothing to make less and this indeed though one would have liked to do something the brute masses above the comparatively small refined facade one saw how happy one had always thought it having for the inner ear the voice of a pair of schoolbullies who hustle and pummel some studious little boy exquisite was what they called you eh well teach you then little sneak to be exquisite we allow none of that rot round here it was heartbreaking this presentation of a boston practically void of an athenaeum though perhaps not without interest as showing how much ones own sense of the small city of the earlier time had been dependent on that institution i found it of no use at any rate to think for a compensatory sign of the new order of the present public library the present public library however remarkable in its pomp and circumstance and of which i had at that hour received my severe impression being neither exquisite nor on the way to become so a difficult an impassable way no doubt for public libraries nor did i cast about in fact very earnestly for consolation so much more was i held by the vision of the closed order which shaped itself continually in the light of the differing present an order gaining an interest for this backward view precisely as one felt that all the parts and tokens of it while it lasted had hung intimately together missing those parts and tokens or as many of them as one could became thus a constant slightly painful joy it made them fall so into their place as items of the old character or proofs positively as one might say of the old distinction it was impossible not to see park street itself for instance while i kept looking at the matter from my more swagger hilltop as violently vulgarized and it was incontestable that whatever might be said there had anciently not been on the whole continent taking everything together an equal animated space more exempt from vulgarity there had probably been comparable spaces impressions in new york in philadelphia in baltimore almost as good but only almost by reason of their lacking which was just the point the indefinable perfection of park street it seems odd to have to borrow from the french the right word in this association or would seem so rather had it been less often indicated that that people have better names than ours even for the qualities we are apt to suppose ourselves more in possession of than they park street in any case had been magnificently honnete the very type and model for a pleasant streetview of the character the aspects that might elsewhere have competed were honnetes and weak whereas park street was honnete and strong strong as founded on all the moral material social solidities instead of on some of them only which made again all the difference personal names as notes of that large emanation need scarcely be invoked they might even have a weakening effect the force of the statement was in its collective cumulative look as if each member of the row from the church at the tremont street angle to the amplest squarest most purple presence at the beacon street corner where it always had a little the air of a sturdy proprietor with back to the fire legs apart and thumbs in the armholes of an expanse of highcoloured plush waistcoat was but a syllable in the word respectable several times repeated one had somehow never heard it uttered with so convincing an emphasis but the shops up and down are making all this as if it had never been pleasant premises as they have themselves acquired and it was to strike me from city to city i fear that the american shop in general pleads but meagrely whether on its outer face or by any more intimate art for indulgence to its tendency to swarm to bristle to vociferate the shopfront observed at random produced on me from the first and almost everywhere alike a singular a sinister impression which left me uneasy till i had found a name for it the sense of an economic law of which one had not for years known the unholy rigour the vision of protected production and of commodities requiring certainly in many cases every advantage protection could give them they looked to me always these exhibitions consciously and defiantly protected insolently safe able to be with impunity anything they would and when once that lurid light had settled on them i could see them i confess in none other so that the objects composing them fell throughout into a vicious and villainous category quite as if audibly saying oh come dont look among us for what you wont for what you shant find the best quality attainable but only for that quite other matter the best value we allow you you must take us or go without and if you feel your nose thus held to the grindstone by the hard fiscal hand its no more than you deserve for harbouring treasonable thoughts so it was therefore that while the imagination and the memory strayed strayed away to other fiscal climates where the fruits of competition so engagingly ripen and flush the streets affected one at moments as a prolonged showcase for every arrayed vessel of humiliation the fact that several classes of the protected products appeared to consist of articles that one might really anywhere have preferred did little oddly enough to diminish the sense of severe discipline awaiting the restored absentee on contact with these occasions of traffic the discipline indeed is general proceeding as it does from so many sources but it earns its name in particular from the predicament of the ingenuous inquirer who asks himself if he can really bear the combination of such general manners and such general prices of such general prices and such general manners he has a helpless bewildered moment during which he wonders if he mightnt bear the prices a little better if he were a little better addressed or bear the usual form of address a little better if the prices were in themselves given the commodity offered a little less humiliating to the purchaser neither of these elements of his dilemma strikes him as likely to abate the general cost of the things to drop or the general grimness of the person he deals with over the counter to soften so that he reaches out again for balm to where he has had to seek it under other wounds falls back on the cultivation of patience and regret on large international comparison he is confronted too often to his sense with the question of what may be borne but what does he see about him if not a vast social order in which the parties to certain relations are all the while marvellously inscrutably desperately bearing each other he may wonder at his hours how under the strain social cohesion does not altogether give way but that is another question which belongs to a different plane of speculation for he asks himself quite as much as anything else how the shopman or the shoplady can bear to be barked at in the manner he constantly hears used to them by customers he recognizes that no agreeable form of intercourse could survive a day in such air so that what is the only relation finding ground there but a necessary vicious circle of gross mutual endurance these reflections connect themselves moreover with that most general of his restless hauntings in the united states not only with the lapse of all wonderment at the immense number of absentees unrestored and making their lives as they may in other countries but with the preliminary american postulate or basis for any successful accommodation of life this basis is that of active pecuniary gain and of active pecuniary gain only that of ones making the conditions so triumphantly pay that the prices the manners the other inconveniences take their place as a friction it is comparatively easy to salve wounds directly treatable with the wash of gold what prevails what sets the tune is the american scale of gain more magnificent than any other and the fact that the whole assumption the whole theory of life is that of the individuals participation in it that of his being more or less punctually and more or less effectually squared to make so much money that you wont that you dont mind dont mind anything that is absolutely i think the main american formula thus your making no money or so little that it passes there for none and being thereby distinctly reduced to minding amounts to your being reduced to the knowledge that america is no place for you to mind as one minds for instance in europe under provocation or occasion offered and yet to have to live under the effect of american pressure is speedily to perceive that the knot can be untied but by a definite pull of one or the other string the immense majority of people pull luckily for the existing order the string that consecrates their connection with it the minority small however only in comparison pull the string that loosens that connection the existing order is meanwhile safe inasmuch as the faculty of making money is in america the commonest of all and fairly runs the streets so simple a matter does it appear there among vast populations to make betimes enough not to mind yet the withdrawal of the considerable group of the pecuniarily disqualified seems no less for the present an assured movement there will always be scattered individuals condemned to mind on a scale beyond any scale of making the relation of this modest body to the country of their birth which asks so much on the whole so many surrenders and compromises and the possession above all of such a prodigious head for figures before it begins in its wonderful way to give or to pay would appear to us supremely touching i think as a case of communion baffled and blighted if we had time to work it out it would bathe in something of a tragic light the vivid truth that the great countries are all more and more happy lands so far as any can be called such for any for every sort of person rather than the middle sort the upper sort in the scale of wealth the only scale now can to their hearts content build their own castles and move by their own motors the lower sort masters of gain in their degree can profit also to their hearts content by the enormous extension of those material facilities which may be gregariously enjoyed they are able to rush about as never under the sun before in promiscuous packs and hustled herds while to the act of so rushing about all felicity and prosperity appear for them to have been comfortably reduced the frustrated american as i have hinted at him scraping for his poor practical solution in the depleted silvermine of history is the american who makes too little for the castle and yet minds too much for the hustled herd who can neither achieve such detachment nor surrender to such society and who most of all accordingly in the native order fails of a working basis the salve the pecuniary salve in europe is sensibly less but less on the other hand also the excoriation that makes it necessary whether from above or below ii let me at all events say for the park street church while i may still on my hilltop keep more or less in line with it that this edifice persistently holds the note as yet the note of the old felicity and remains by so doing a precious public servant strange enough doubtless to find ones self pleading sanctity for a theological structure sanctified only by such a name as which is exactly the state of the matter with the park street church this happy landmark is in strictness with its mild recall by its spire of wrens bold london examples the comparatively thin echo of a faraway song playing its part however for harmonious effect as perfectly as possible it is admirably placed quite peculiarly present on the boston scene and thus for one reason and another points its moral as not even the state house does so we see afresh under its admonition that charm is a flower of wild and windblown seed often not to be counted on when most anxiously planted but taking its own time and its own place both for enriching and for mocking us it mocks assuredly above all our money and our impatience elements addressed to buying or ordering it and only asks that when it does come we shall know it and love it when we fail of this intelligence it simply for its vengeance boycotts us makes us vulgar folk who have no concern with it then if we ever miss it we can never get it back though our deepest depth of punishment of course is to go on fatuously not missing it the joy of ourselves and of each other and the derision of those who know these reflections were virtually suggested to me on the eve of my leaving boston by ten words addressed to my dismay the effect of which was to make park street church for the hour the most interesting mass of brick and mortar and if i may risk the supposition timber in america the words had been spoken in the bright july air by a friend encountered in the very presence of the mild monument on the freshlyperceived value of which for its position for its civil function i had happened irrepressibly to exclaim thus i learned that its existence might be spoken of as gravely menaced menaced by a scheme for the erection of a business block a huge square of innumerable tiers and floors thousands of places of trade the trade that in such a position couldnt fail to be roaring in the eye of financial envy the church was but a cumberer of the ground and where about us had we seen financial envy fail when it had once really applied the push of its fat shoulder drunk as it was with power what was to be thought of as resisting it this was a question truly to frighten answers away until i presently felt the most pertinent of all return as if on tiptoe the perfect force of the case as a case as an example that was the answer of answers the quite ideal pitch of the opportunity for virtue ideal opportunities are rare and this occasion for not sacrificing the high ornament and cynosure of the town to the impudence of private greed just happens to be one and to have the finest marks of the character one had but to imagine a civilized community reading these marks feeling that character and then consciously and cynically falling below its admirable chance to take in the impossibility of any such blot on the page of honour any such keen appetite for the base alternative it would be verily the end the end of the old distinguished life of the common intelligence that had flowered formerly for attesting fame from so strong a sap and into so thick and rich a cluster one had thought of these things as one came and went so interesting today in boston are such informal consultations of the oracle that of the very air and tone such puttings to it of the question of what the old new england spirit may have still intellectually aesthetically or for that matter even morally to give of what may yet remain for productive scraping of the formula of the native puritanism educated the formula once capacious enough for the literary constellation of the age of emerson is that cornucopia empty or does some handful of strong or at least sound fruit lurk to this day a trifle congested by keeping up in the point of the horn what if so are in the ambient air the symptoms of this possibility what are the signs of intellectual promise poetic prosaic philosophic in the current generations those actually learning their principal lesson as one assumes from the great university hard by the old formula that of puritanism educated has it in fine except for business anything more to communicate or do we perhaps mistake the case in still speaking by reason of the projected shadow of harvard of education as at all involved oh for business for a commercial an organizing energy of the first order the indications would seem to abound the air being full of them as of one loud voice and nowhere so full perhaps as at that park street corner precisely where it was to be suggested to me that their meaning was capable on occasion of turning to the sinister the commercial energy at least was educated up to the eyes harvard was still caring for that more than for anything else but the wonderments or perhaps rather the positive impressions i have glanced at bore me constant company keeping the last word all emphasis of answer back as if for the creation of a dramatic suspense i liked the suspense none the less for what it had in common with intellectual curiosity and it gave me a light moreover which was highly convenient helping me to look at everything in some related state to this proposition of the value of the puritan residuum the question of whether value is expressed for instance by the little tales mostly by ladies and about and for children romping through the ruins of the language in the monthly magazines some of my perceptions of relation might seem forced for other minds but it sufficed me that they were straight and clear for myself straight and clear again for example when always on my hilltop and raking the prospect over for memories i quite assented to the tacit intimation that a long aesthetic period had closed with the disappearance of the old museum theatre this had been the theatre of the great period so far as such a description may fit an establishment that never produced during that term a play either by a bostonian or by any other american or it had at least with however unequal steps kept the great period company made the boston of those years quite complacently participate in its genial continuity this character of its being an institution its really being a theatre with a repertory and a family of congruous players not one of them the baleful actormanager head and front of all the so rank and so acclaimed vulgarities of our own day this nature in it of not being the mere empty shell the indifferent cave of the winds that yields a few nights lodging under stress to the passing caravan gave it a dignity of which i seemed to see the ancient city gratefully conscious fond and jealous and the thought of which invites me to fling over it now perhaps too free a fold of the mantle of romance and yet why too free is what i ask myself as i remember that the museum had for long years a repertory the repertory of its age a company and a cohesion theatrical trifles of the cultivation of which no present temple of the drama from end to end of the country appears to show a symptom therefore i spare a sigh to its memory and though i doubtless scarce think of it as the haunt of emerson of hawthorne or of mr ticknor the common conscience of the midcentury in the new england capital insists on showing at this distance of time as the richer for it that then was one of the missed elements but the consequent melancholy i ought promptly to add formed the most appropriate soil for stray sprouts of tenderness in respect to the few aspects that had not suffered the old charm of mount vernon street for instance wandering up the hill almost from the waterside to the rear of the state house and fairly hanging about there to rest like some good flushed lady of more than middle age a little spent and blown this ancient grace was not only still to be felt but was charged for depth of interest with intenser ghostly presences the rich growth of time which might have made the ample slope as one mounted appear as beautifully peopled as jacobs ladder that was exactly the kind of impression to be desired and welcomed since ghosts belong only to places and suffer and perish with them it was as if they themselves moreover were taking pleasure in this place fairly indeed commending to me the fine old style of the picture nothing less appeared to account for my not having in the other age done it as the phrase is full justice recognized in it so excellent a peace such a clear boston bravery all to the end that it should quite strike me on the whole as not only for the minor stretch and the domestic note the happiest streetscene the country could show but as pleasant on those respectable lines in a degree not surpassed even among outland pomps oh the wide benignity of brick the goodly friendly ruddy fronts the felicity of scale the solid seat of everything even to the handful of happy deviations from the regular produced we may fancy by one of those historic causes which so rarely complicate for humanization the blankness of the american streetpage and the occasional occurrence of which in general as i am perhaps too repeatedly noting excites on the part of the starved storyseeker a fantastic insistence i find myself willing after all to let my whole estimate of these mere mild monuments of private worth pass for extravagant if it but leave me a perch for musing on the oddity of our nature which makes us still like the places we have known or loved to grow old when we can scarcely bear it in the people to walk down mount vernon street to charles was to have a brush with that truth to recognize at least that we like the sense of age to come locally when it comes with the right accompaniments with the preservation of character and the continuity of tradition merits i had been admiring on the brow of the eminence from the other vision the sight of the decline in the social scale the lapse into shabbiness and into bad company we only suffer for the ghosts in that case either refuse to linger or linger at the most with faces ashamed and as if appealing against their association such was the condition of the charles street ghosts it seemed to me shades of a past that had once been so thick and warm and happy they moved dimly through a turbid medium in which the signs of their old life looked soiled and sordid each of them was there indeed from far far back they met me on the pavement yet it was as if we could pass but in conscious silence and nothing could have helped us for any courage of communion if we had not enjoyed the one merciful refuge that remained where indeed we could breathe again and with intensity our own liberal air here behind the effaced anonymous door was the little ark of the modern deluge here still the long drawingroom that looks over the water and toward the sunset with a seat for every visiting shade from faraway thackeray down and relics and tokens so thick on its walls as to make it positively in all the town the votive temple to memory ah if it hadnt been for that small patch of common ground with its kept echo of the very accent of the past the revisiting spirit at the bottom of the hill could but have muffled his head or but have stifled his heart and turned away for ever let me even say that always now at the bottom of the hill it was in this practical guise he afterwards at the best found himself roaming it is from about that point southward that the new splendours of boston spread and will clearly continue to spread but it opened out to me as a tract pompous and prosaic with which the little interesting city the city of character and genius exempt as yet from the irish yoke had had absolutely nothing to do this disconnection was complete and the southward the westward territory made up at the most a platform or stage from which the other the concentrated boston of history the boston of emerson thoreau hawthorne longfellow lowell holmes ticknor motley prescott parkman and the rest in the sense either of birthplace or of central or sacred city could be seen in as definite and indeed now in almost as picturesquely medieval a concretion appear to make as black and minute and composed a little pyramidal image as the finished background of a durer print it seemed to place itself there in the middle distance on the sharp salience of its commingled reforms and reserves reformers and reservists rubbing shoulders in the common distinctness of their detachment from an inexpressive generation and the composition rounding itself about as with the very last of its loose ends snipped off or tucked in iii there are neither loose ends nor stray flutters whether of the old prose or the old poetry to be encountered on the large lower level though there are performances of a different order in the shadow of which such matters tend to look merely and perhaps rather meagrely subjective it is all very rich and prosperous and monotonous the large lower level but oh so inexpressibly vacant where the new land corresponds most to its name rejoices most visibly and complacently in its newness its dumped and shovelled foundations the home till recently of a mere vague marine backwater there the long straight residential avenues vistas quite documentary as one finds ones self pronouncing them testify with a perfection all their own to a whole vast side of american life the winter winds and snows and the eternal dust run races in them over the clearest course anywhere provided for that grim competition the leaguelong brick pavements mirror the expansive void for many months of the year in their smooth tight icecoats and ice over brick can only be described as heels over head and the innumerable windows up and down watch each other all hopelessly as for revelations indiscretions audible resonant rebellious or explosive breakages of the pane from within that never disturb the peace no one will begin and the buried hatchet in spite of whatever wistful looks to where it lies is never dug up so it is that these sustained affirmations of one of the smoothest and the most settled social states going excite perversely on the part of the restless analyst questions that would seem logically the very last involved we call such aspects documentary because they strike us more than any others as speaking volumes for the possible serenity the common decency the quiet cohesion of a vast commercial and professional bourgeoisie left to itself here was such an order caught in the very fact the fact of its living maximum a bourgeoisie without an aristocracy to worry it is of course a very different thing from a bourgeoisie struggling in that shade and nothing could express more than these interminable perspectives of security the condition of a community leading its life in the social sun why accordingly of december afternoons did the restless analyst pausing at eastwardlooking corners find on his lips the vague refrain of tennysons long unlovely street why if harley street if wimpole is unlovely should marlborough street boston be so beyond the mere platitude of its motiveless name here is no monotony of black leasehold brick no patent disavowal in the interest of stale and strictly subordinate gentilities of expression animation variety curiosity here on the contrary is often the individual housefront in all its independence and sometimes in all its felicity this whole region being like so many such regions in the united states today the home of the free hand a field for the liveliest architectural experiment there are interesting admirable houses though always too much of the detestable vitreous bow and there is above all what there is everywhere in america for saving or at least for propping up the situation that particular look of the clear course and large opportunity ahead which when taken in conjunction with all the will to live all the money to spend all the knowledge to acquire and apply seems to marshal the material possibilities in glittering illimitable ranks beacon street moreover used to stretch back like a workable telescope for the focussing at its higher extremity in an air of which the positive defect is to be too seldom prejudicial of the gilded dome of the state house fresh as a christmas toy seen across the floor of a large salubrious nursery this made a civic vignette that furnished a little the desert of cheerful family life but marlborough street for imperturbable reasons of its own used periodically to break my heart it was of no use to make a vow of hanging about till i should have sounded my mystery learned to say why black stale harley street for instance in featureless row after row had character and depth while what was before me fell upon my sense with the thinness of tone of a precocious child and still more why this latter effect should have been as it were so insistently irritating if there be strange ways of producing an interest to the critical mind there are doubtless still stranger ways of not producing one and it was important to me no doubt to make my defunct and compact and expressive little boston appear to don all the signs of that character that the new land and what is built thereon miss how could one consider the place at all unless in a light so that one had to decide definitely on ones light this it was after all easy to do from the moment one had determined to concede to the new land the fact of possession of everything convenient and handsome under heaven peace could always come with this recognition of all the accessories and equipments a hundred costly things parks and palaces and institutions that the earlier community had lacked and there was an individual connection only one presently to be noted in which the actual city might seem for an hour to have no capacity for the uplifting idea no aptitude for the finer curiosity to envy the past but meanwhile it was strange that even so fine a conception finely embodied as the new public library magnificently superseding all others was committed to speak to ones inner perception still more of the power of the purse and of the higher turn for business than of the old intellectual or even of the old moral sensibility why else then should one have thought of some single some admirable hour of emerson in one of the dusky primitive lecturehalls that have ceased to be or of some large insuperable antislavery eloquence of wendell phillipss during the same term and especially during the war as breathing more of the consciousness of literature and of history than all the promiscuous bustle of the florentine palace by copley square not that this latter edifice the fruit of immense considerations has not its honourable interest too which it would have if only in the light of the constant truth that almost any american application or practice of a general thought puts on a new and original aspect public libraries are a thoroughly general thought and one has seen plenty of them one is seeing dreadfully many in these very days the world over yet to be confronted with an american example is to have sight straightway of more difference than community and to glean on the spot fresh evidence of that democratic way of dealing which it has been the american office to translate from an academic phrase into a bristling fact the notes of difference of the florentine palace by copley square more delicately elegant in truth if less sublimely rugged than most florentine palaces resolve themselves like so many such notes everywhere into our impression here once more that everyone is in everything whereas in europe so comparatively few persons are in anything even as yet in society more and more the common refuge or retreat of the masses the boston institution then is a great and complete institution with this reserve of its striking the restored absentee as practically without penetralia a library without penetralia may affect him but as a temple without altars it will at any rate exemplify the distinction between a benefit given and a benefit taken a borrowed a lent and an owned an appropriated convenience the british museum the louvre the bibliotheque nationale the treasures of south kensington are assuredly under forms at the disposal of the people but it is to be observed i think that the people walk there more or less under the shadow of the right waited for and conceded it remains as difficult as it is always interesting however to trace the detail much of it obvious enough but much more indefinable of the personal port of a democracy that unlike the english is social as well as political one of these denotements is that social democracies are unfriendly to the preservation of penetralia so that when penetralia are of the essence as in a place of study and meditation they inevitably go to the wall the main staircase in boston has with its amplitude of wing and its splendour of tawny marble a high and luxurious beauty bribing the restored absentee to emotion moreover by expanding monumentally at one of its rests into admirable commemoration of the civil war service of the two great massachusetts volunteer regiments of the elite such visions such felicities such couchant lions and recorded names and stirred memories as these encountered in the early autumn twilight colour an impression even though to say so be the limit of breach of the silence in which for persons of the generation of the author of these pages appreciation of them can best take refuge the refuge to which i felt myself anon reduced for instance opposite the state house in presence of saintgaudenss noble and exquisite monument to robert gould shaw and the fiftyfourth massachusetts there are works of memorial art that may suddenly place themselves by their operation in a given case outside articulate criticism which was what happened i found in respect to the main feature the rich staircase of the library another way in which the bribe as i have called it of that masterpiece worked on the spot was by prompting one to immediate charmed perception of the character of the deep court and inner arcade of the palace where a wealth of science and taste has gone to producing a sense when the afternoon light sadly slants of one of the myriad goldcoloured courts of the vatican these are the refinements of the present boston keeping company as they can with the healthy animation as it struck me of the rest of the building the multitudinous bustle the coming and going as in a railwaystation of persons with carpetbags and other luggage the simplicity of plan the open doors and immediate accesses admirable for a railwaystation the ubiquitous children most irrepressible little democrats of the democracy the vain quest above all of the deeper depths aforesaid some part that should be sufficiently within some other part sufficiently withdrawn arid consecrated not to constitute a thoroughfare perhaps i didnt adequately explore but there was always the visible scale and scheme of the building it was a shock to find the so brave decorative designs of puvis de chavannes of sargent and abbey and john elliott hanging over mere chambers of familiarity and resonance and then i must quickly add it was a shock still greater perhaps to find one had no good reason for defending them against such freedoms what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander had one not in other words in the public places and under the great loggias of italy acclaimed it as just the charm and dignity of these resorts that in their pictured and embroidered state they still serve for the graceful common life it was true that one had not been imprisoned in that consistency in the laurentian in the ambrosian library and at any rate one was here on the edge of abysses was it not splendid for example to see in boston such large provision made for the amusement of children on rainy afternoons so many little heads bent over their storybooks that the edifice took on at moments the appearance worn one was to observe later on by most other american edifices of the same character that of a lively distributinghouse of the new fiction for the young the note was bewildering yet would one snatching the breadandmolasses from their lips cruelly deprive the young of rights in which they have been installed with a majesty nowhere else approaching that of their american installation i am not wrong probably at all events in qualifying such a question as that as abysmal and i remember how more than once i took refuge from it in craven flight straight across the square to the already so interesting the so rapidlyexpanding art museum there for some reason questions exquisitely dropped perhaps only for the reason that things sifted and selected have very visibly the effect of challenging the confidence even of the rash it is of the nature of objects doomed to show distinction that they virtually make a desert round them and peace reigned unbroken i usually noted in the two or three museum rooms that harbour a small but deeplyinteresting and steadilygrowing collection of fragments of the antique here the restless analyst found work to his hand only too much and indeed in presence of the gem of the series of the perhaps just too conscious grace of a certain little wasted and dimeyed head of aphrodite he felt that his function should simply give way in common decency to that of the sonneteer for it is an impression by itself and i think quite worth the atlantic voyage to catch in the american light the very fact of the genius of greece there are things we dont know feelings not to be foretold till we have had that experience which i commend to the raffine of almost any other clime i should say to him that he has not seen a fine greek thing till he has seen it in america it is of course on the face of it the most merciless case of transplanting the mere moral of which none the less for application becomes by no means flagrant the little aphrodite with her connections her antecedents and references exhibiting the maximum of breakage is no doubt as lonely a jewel as ever strayed out of its setting yet what does one quickly recognize but that the intrinsic lustre will have so far as that may be possible doubled she has lost her background the divine creature has lost her company and is keeping in a manner the strangest but so far from having lost an iota of her power she has gained unspeakably more since what she essentially stands for she here stands for alone rising ineffably to the occasion she has in short by her single presence as yet annexed an empire and there are strange glimmers of moments when as i have spoken of her consciousness the very knowledge of this seems to lurk in the depth of her beauty where was she ever more where was she ever so much a goddess and who knows but that being thus divine she foresees the time when as she has moved over the place of her actual whereabouts will have become one of her shrines objects doomed to distinction make round them a desert i have said but that is only for any gross confidence in other matters for confidence in them they make a garden and that is why i felt this quarter of the boston art museum bloom under the indescribable dim eyes with delicate flowers the impression swallowed up every other the place whatever it was was supremely justified and i was left cold by learning that a much bigger and grander and richer place is presently to overtop it the present establishment dates back back almost to the good boston of the middle years and is full of all sorts of accumulated and concentrated pleasantness which fact precisely gives the signal by the terrible american law for its coming to an end and giving a chance to the untried it is a consistent application of the rotary system the untried always awaiting its turn and quite perceptibly stamping and snorting while it waits all heedless as it is poor innocent untried of the certain hour of the impatiences before which it too will have to retreat it is not indeed that the american laws so operating have not almost always their own queer interest founded as they are all together on one of the strongest of the native impulses we see this characteristic again and again at play see it in especial wherever we see which is more than frequently enough a university or a college started or amplified this process almost always takes the form primarily of more lands and houses and halls and rooms more swimmingbaths and footballfields and gymnasia a greater luxury of brick and mortar a greater ingenuity the most artful conceivable of accommodation and installation such is the magic such the presences that tend more than any other to figure as the institution thereby perverting not a little as need scarce be remarked the finer collegiate idea the theory being doubtless and again most characteristically that with all the wrought stone and oak and painted glass the immense provision the multiplied marbles and tiles and cloisters and acres people will come that is individuals of value will and in some manner work some miracle in the early american time doubtless individuals of value had to wait too much for things but that is now made up by the way things are waiting for individuals of value to which i must immediately add however and it is the ground of my allusion of a moment ago that no impression of the new boston can feel itself hang together without remembrance of what it owes to that rare exhibition of the living spirit lately achieved in the interest of the fine arts and of all that is noblest in them by the unaided and quite heroic genius of a private citizen to attempt to tell the story of the wonderfullygathered and splendidlylodged gardner collection would be to displace a little the line that separates private from public property and yet to find no discreet word for it is to appear to fail of feeling for the complexity of conditions amid which so undaunted a devotion to a great idea undaunted by the battle to fight losing alas with state protection of native art and with other scarce less uncanny things has been able consummately to flower it is in presence of the results magnificently attained the energy triumphant over everything that one feels the fine old disinterested tradition of boston least broken viii concord and salem i i felt myself on the spot cast about a little for the right expression of it and then lost any hesitation to say that putting the three or four biggest cities aside concord massachusetts had an identity more palpable to the mind had nestled in other words more successfully beneath her narrow fold of the mantle of history than any other american town compare me with places of my size you know one seemed to hear her plead with the modesty that under the mild autumn sun so well became her russet beauty and this exactly it was that prompted the emphasis of ones reply or as it may even be called of ones declaration ah my dear it isnt a question of places of your size since among places of your size youre too obviously and easily first its a question of places so many of them of fifty times your size and which yet dont begin to have a fraction of your weight or your character or your intensity of presence and sweetness of tone or your moral charm or your pleasant appreciability or in short of anything that is yours your size why youre the biggest little place in america with only new york and boston and chicago by what i make out to surpass you and the country is lucky indeed to have you in your sole and single felicity for if it hadnt where in the world should we go inane and unappeased for the particular communication of which you have the secret the country is colossal and you but a microscopic speck on the hem of its garment yet theres nothing else like you take you all round for we see you complacently with the naked eye whereas there are vast sprawling bristling areas great grey centres of population that spread on the map like irremediable greasespots which fail utterly of any appeal to our vision or any control of it leaving it to pass them by as if they were not if you are so thoroughly the opposite of one of these i dont say its all your superlative merit its rather as i have put it your felicity your good fortune the result of the halfdozen happy turns of the wheel in your favour halfadozen such turns you see are for any mortal career a handsome allowance and your merit is that recognizing this you have not fallen below your estate but its your fortune above all thats your charm one doesnt want to be patronizing but you didnt thank goodness make yours thats what the other places the big ones that are as nothing to you are trying to do the country over to make theirs and from the point of view of these remarks all in vain your luck is that you didnt have to yours had been just as it shows in you today made for you and you at the most but gratefully submitted to it it must be said for you however that you keep it and it isnt every place that would have been capable you keep the look you keep the feeling you keep the air your great trees arch over these possessions more protectingly covering them in as a cherished presence and you have settled to your tone and your type as to treasures that can now never be taken show me the other places in america of the few that have had anything from which the best hasnt mainly been taken or isnt in imminent danger of being there is old salem there is old newport which i am on my way to see again and which if you will are by what i hear still comparatively intact but their having was never a having like yours and they adorn precisely my little tale of your supremacy no i dont want to be patronizing but your only fault is your tendency to improve i mean just by your duration as you are which indeed is the only sort of improvement that is not questionable such was the drift of the warm flood of appreciation of reflection that concord revisited could set rolling over the field of a prepared sensibility and i feel as if i had quite made my point such as it is in asking what other american village could have done anything of the sort i should have been at fault perhaps only in speaking of the interest in question as visible on that large scale to the naked eye the truth being perhaps that one wouldnt have been so met halfway by ones impression unless one had rather particularly known and that knowledge in such a case amounts to a pair of magnifying spectacles i remember indeed putting it to myself on the november sunday morning tepid and bright and perfect for its use through which i walked from the station under the constant archway of the elms as yet but indulgently thinned would one know for ones self what had formerly been the matter here if one hadnt happened to be able to get round behind in the past as it were and more or less understand would the operative elements of the past little old concord fight essentially and emerson and hawthorne and thoreau with the rest of the historic animation and the rest of the figured and shifting transcendental company to its last and loosest ramifications would even these handsome quantities have so lingered to ones intelligent aftersense if one had not brought with one some sign by which they too would know dim shy spectralities as for themselves they must at the best have become idle however such questions when by the chance of the admirable day everything in its own way and order unmistakably came out every string sounded as if for all the world the loose new england town and i apply the expression but to the relations of objects and places were a lyre swept by the hand of apollo apollo was the spirit of antique piety looking about pausing remembering as he moved to his music and there were glimpses and reminders that of course kept him much longer than others seated there at its ease as if placidly familiar with pilgrims and quite taking their homage for granted the place had the very aspect of some grave refined new england matron of the old school the widow of a high celebrity living on and on in possession of all his relics and properties and though not personally addicted to gossip or to journalism having become where the great company kept by her in the past is concerned quite cheerful and modern and responsive from her position her highbacked chair by the window that commands most of the coming and going she looks up intelligently over her knitting with no vision of any limit on her part as yet to this attitude and with nothing indeed to suggest the possibility of a limit save a hint of that loss of temporal perspective in which we recognize the mental effect of a great weight of years i had formerly the acquaintance of a very interesting lady of extreme age whose early friends in literary circles are now regarded as classics and who toward the end of her life always said you know charles lamb has produced a play at drury lane or you know william hazlitt has fallen in love with such a very odd woman her facts were perfectly correct only death had beautifully passed out of her world since i dont remember her mentioning to me the demise which she might have made so contemporary either of byron or of scott when people were ill she admirably forebore to ask about them she disapproved wholly of such conditions and there were interesting invalids round about her near to her whose existence she for long years consummately ignored it is some such quiet backward stride as those of my friend that i seem to hear the voice of old concord take in reference to her annals and it is not too much to say that where her soil is most sacred i fairly caught on the breeze the mitigated perfect tense you know there has been a fight between our men and the kings one wouldnt have been surprised that crystalline sunday noon where so little had changed where the stream and the bridge and all nature and the feeling above all still so directly testify at any freshsounding form of such an announcement i had forgotten in all the years with what thrilling clearness that supreme site speaks though anciently while so much of the course of the century was still to run the distinctness might have seemed even greater but to stand there again was to take home this foreshortened view the gained nearness to ones sensibility to look straight over the heads of the american weimar company at the inestimable hour that had so handsomely set up for them their background the fight had been the hinge so one saw it on which the large revolving future was to turn or it had been better perhaps the large firm nail ringingly driven in from which the beautiful portraitgroup as we see it today was to hang beautiful exceedingly the local emerson and thoreau and hawthorne and in a fainter way tutti quanti but beautiful largely because the fine old incident down in the valley had so seriously prepared their effect that seriousness gave once for all the pitch and it was verily as if under such a value even with the seed of a literary circle so freely scattered by an intervening hand the vulgar note would in that air never be possible as i had inevitably in long absence let the value for immediate perception rather waste itself so on the spot it came back most instantly with the extraordinary sweetness of the river which under the autumn sun like all the american rivers one had seen or was to see straightway took the whole case straightway into its hands oh you shall tell me of your impression when you have felt what i can do for it so hang over me well thats what they all seem to say i hung over concord river then as long as i could and recalled how thoreau hawthorne emerson himself have expressed with due sympathy the sense of this full slow sleepy meadowy flood which sets its pace and takes its twists like some large obese benevolent person scarce so frankly unsociable as to pass you at all it had watched the fight it even now confesses without a quickening of its current and it draws along the woods and the orchards and the fields with the purr of a mild domesticated cat who rubs against the family and the furniture not to be recorded at best however i think never to emerge from the state of the inexpressible in respect to the spot by the bridge where one most lingers is the sharpest suggestion of the whole scene the power diffused in it which makes it after all these years or perhaps indeed by reason of their number so irresistibly touching all the commemorative objects the stone marking the burialplace of the three english soldiers the animated image of the young belted american yeoman by mr daniel french the intimately associated element in the presence not far off of the old manse interesting theme of hawthornes pen speak to the spirit no doubt in one of the subtlest tones of which official history is capable and yet somehow leave the exquisite melancholy of everything unuttered it lies too deep as it always so lies where the ground has borne the weight of the short simple act intense and unconscious that was to determine the event determine the future in the way we call immortally for we read into the scene too little of what we may unless this muffled touch in it somehow reaches us so that we feel the pity and the irony of the precluded relation on the part of the fallen defenders the sense that was theirs and that moved them we know but we seem to know better still the sense that wasnt and that couldnt and that forms our luxurious heritage as our eyes across the gulf seek to meet their eyes so that we are almost ashamed of taking so much such colossal quantity and value as the equivalent of their dimlyseeing offer the huge bargain they made for us in a word made by the gift of the little all they had to the modesty of which amount the homely rural facts grouped there together have appeared to go on testifying this brilliant advantage strikes the imagination that yearns over them as unfairly enjoyed at their cost was it delicate was it decent that is would it have been to ask the embattled farmers simpleminded unwitting folk to make us so inordinate a present with so little of the conscious credit of it which all comes indeed perhaps simply to the most poignant of all those effects of disinterested sacrifice that the toil and trouble of our forefathers produce for us the minutemen at the bridge were of course interested intensely as they believed but such too was the artful manner in which we see our latent lurking waiting interest like a jew in a dusky backshop providentially bait the trap beyond even such broodings as these and to another purpose moreover the communicated spell falls in its degree into that pathetic oddity of the small aspect and the rude and the lowly the reduced and humiliated above all that sits on so many nooks and corners objects and appurtenances old contemporary things contemporary with the doings of our race simplifying our antecedents our annals to within an inch of their life making us ask in presence of the rude relics even of greatness mean retreats and receptacles constructionally so poor from what barbarians or from what pigmies we have sprung there are certain rough black mementos of the early monarchy in england and scotland there are glimpses of the original humble homes of other greatness as well that strike in perfection this grim little note which has the interest of our being free to take it for curiosity for luxury of thought as that of the real or that of the romantic and with which again the deep concord rusticity momentary medium of our national drama essentially consorts we remember the small hard facts of the shakespeare house at stratford we remember the rude closet in edinburgh castle in which james vi of scotland was born or the other little black hole at holyrood in which mary stuart sat and in which rizzio was murdered these i confess are odd memories at concord although the manse near the spot where we last paused and against the edge of whose acre or two the loitering river seeks friction in the manner i have mentioned would now seem to have shaken itself a trifle disconcertingly free of the ornamental mosses scattered by hawthornes light hand it stands there beyond its gate with every due similitude to the shrunken historic site in general to which i must hasten to add however that i was much more struck with the way these particular places of visitation resist their pressure of reference than with their affecting us as below their fortune intrinsically they are as naught deeply depressing in fact to any impulse to reconstitute the house in which hawthorne spent what remained to him of life after his return from the italy of his donatello and his miriam yet in common with everything else this mild monument benefits by that something in the air which makes us tender keeps us respectful meets in the general interest waving it vaguely away any closer assault of criticism it is odd and it is also exquisite that these witnessing ways should be the last ground on which we feel moved to ponderation of the concord school to use i admit a futile expression or rather i should doubtless say it would be odd if there were not inevitably something absolute in the fact of emersons all but lifelong connection with them we may smile a little as we drag in weimar but i confess myself for my part much more satisfied than not by our happy equivalent in american money for goethe and schiller the money is a potful in the second case as in the first and if goethe in the one represents the gold and schiller the silver i find and quite putting aside any bimetallic prejudice the same good relation in the other between emerson and thoreau i open emerson for the same benefit for which i open goethe the sense of moving in large intellectual space and that of the gush here and there out of the rock of the crystalline cupful in wisdom and poetry in wahrheit and dichtung and whatever i open thoreau for i neednt take space here for the good reasons i open him oftener than i open schiller which comes back to our feeling that the rarity of emersons genius which has made him so for the attentive peoples the first and the one really rare american spirit in letters couldnt have spent his career in a charming woody watery place for so long socially and typically and above all interestingly homogeneous without an effect as of the communication to it of something ineffaceable it was during his long span his immediate concrete sufficient world it gave him his nearest vision of life and he drew half his images we recognize from the revolution of its seasons and the play of its manners i dont speak of the other half which he drew from elsewhere it is admirably today as if we were still seeing these things in those images which stir the air like birds dim in the eventide coming home to nest if one had reached a time of life one had thereby at least heard him lecture and not a russet leaf fell for me while i was there but fell with an emersonian drop ii it never failed that if in moving about i made under stress an inquiry i should prove to have made it of a flagrant foreigner it never happened that addressing a fellowcitizen in the street on one of those hazards of possible communion with the indigenous spirit i should not draw a blank so inevitably at salem when wandering perhaps astray i asked my way to the house of the seven gables the young man i had overtaken was true to his nature he stared at me as a remorseless italian as remorseless at least as six months of salem could leave him on that spot in that air i confess it was a particular shock to me to be once more with my so good general intention so put off though if my young man but glared frank ignorance of the monument i named he left me at least with the interest of wondering how the native estimate of it as a romantic ruin might strike a taste formed for such features by the landscape of italy i will not profess that by the vibration of this note the edifice of my fond fancy i mean hawthornes salem and the witches and that of other eminent historic figures was not rather essentially shaken since what had the intention of my pilgrimage been in all good faith in artless sympathy and piety but a search again precisely for the new england homogeneous for the renewal of that impression of it which had lingered with me from a vision snatched too briefly in a midsummer gloaming long years ago i had been staying near at that faraway time and the railroad helping had got myself dropped there for an hour at just the right moment of the waning day this memory had been from far back a kept felicity altogether a picture of goodly colonial habitations quite the highwater mark of that type of state and ancientry seen in the clear dusk and of almost nothing else but a pleasant harbourside vacancy the sense of dead marine industries that finally looked out at me for a climax over a grassgrown interval from the blank windows of the old customs house of the introduction to the scarlet letter i could on that occasion have seen with my eye on my returntrain nothing else but the image of these things i had not lost wrapped up as it even was for the fancy in some figment of the very patch of old embroidered cloth that hawthornes charming prefatory pages unfold for us pages in which the words are as finely taken as the silk and gold stitches of poor hester prynnes compunctious needle it had hung all the years closely together and had served oh so conveniently as the term of comparison the rather rich frame for any suggested vision of new england life unalloyed the case now was the more marked that already on emerging from the station and not knowing quite where to look again for my goodly georgian and neogeorgian houses i had had to permit myself to be directed to them by a civil englishman accosted by the way who all kindness and sympathy immediately mentioned that they formed the grosvenor square as might be said of salem we conversed for the moment and settled as he told me in the town he was most sustaining but when a little later on i stood there in admiration of the noble quarter i could only feel even while doing it every justice that the place was not quite what my imagination had counted on it was possibly even better for the famous houses almost without exception ample and charming seemed to me to show a grace even beyond my recollection the only thing was that i had never bargained for looking at them through a polyglot air look at them none the less and at the fine old liberal scale and felt symmetry and simple dignity and solid sincerity of them i gratefully did with due speculation as to their actual chances and changes as to what they represent today as social values and with a lively impression above all of their preserved and unsophisticated state that was a social value which i found myself comparing for instance with similar aspects frequent and excellent in old english towns the salem houses the best were all of the old english family and from picture to picture all the parts would have matched but the moral the social the political climate even more than the breath of nature had had in each case a different action had begotten on either side a different consciousness or was it nearer even to say that these things had on one side begotten a consciousness and had on the other begotten comparatively none the approximation would have been the more interesting as each arrayed group might pass for a supreme expression of respectability it would be the tone and weight the quantity and quality of the respectability that make the difference massive and squareshouldered yet rather battered and mottled chipped and frayed at last rather sceptical and cynical in fine in the english figure thin and clear consistently sharp boldly unspotted blankly serene in the american it was more amusing at any rate to spin such fancies in reaction from the alien snub than simply to see ones antitheses reduced to a mere question of the effect of climate there would be yet more to say for the salem picture many of the bits of which remain as ruskin might have put it entirely delightful but their desperate clean freshness was what was more to abide with me after the polyglot air had cleared a little the spacious courteous doorways of the houses expansively columned fluted framed their large honest windows in ample tiers only here and there dishonoured by the modern pane their high bland foreheads in short with no musty secrets in the eaves yes not one in spite of the speciality in this respect of the seven gables to which i am coming clarify too much perhaps the expressive mask the look of experience depress the balance toward the type of the expensive toy shown on its shelf but too good to be humanly used its as if the old witches had been suffered to live again penally as public housemaids using nocturnally for purposes of almost viciouslythorough purification the famous broomsticks they used wantonly to ride was it a sacred terror after this that stayed me from crossing the threshold of the witch house in spite of the quite definite sturdy stamp of this attraction i think it was an almost sacred tenderness rather the instinct of not pressing too hard on my privilege and of not draining the offered cup to the lees it is always interesting in america to see any object some builded thing in particular look as old as it possibly can for the sight of which effort we sometimes hold our breath as if to watch over the course of the backward years the straight track of the past the course of some hero of the footrace on whom we have staked our hopes how long will he hold out how far back will he run and where heroically blown will he have to drop our suspense is great in proportion to our hope and if we are nervously constituted we may very well at the last turn away for anxiety it was really in some such manner i was affected i think before the salem witch house in presence of the mystery of antiquity it is a modest wooden structure consciously primitive standing if i remember rightly in some effective relation to a streetcorner and putting no little purpose into its archaism the pity is however that unrelieved wooden houses never very curiously testify as i was presently to learn to my cost from the dreadful anticlimax of the seven gables they look brief and provisional at the best look above all incorrigibly and witlessly innocent the quite sufficiently sturdy little timbered mass by the salem street none the less with a sidelong crook or twist that we may take as symbolizing ancient perversity runs the backward race as longwindedly as we may anywhere over the land see it run had i gone in as a frank placard invited me i might have better measured the exploit yet on the other hand fearing frank placards in general in these cases fearing nothing so much as reconstituted antiquity i might have lost a part of my good little impression which otherwise as a small pale flower plucked from a withered tree i could fold away intact between the leaves of my romantic herbarium i wanted moreover to be honest not to fail within the hour of two other urgent matters my train away my sense of salem was too destined to be trainhaunted and a due visitation of the seven gables and of the birthhouse of their chronicler it was in the course of this errand that i was made to feel myself as i have mentioned living rather witlessly in a world unknown to the active salemite of today a world embodied i seemed to make out in the large untidy industrial quarter that had sprung up since my early visit did i quite escape from this impression before alighting at last happily upon the small stale structure that had sheltered the romancers entrance into life and that now appears according to the preference of fancy either a strange recipient of the romantic germ or the very spot to cause it in protest and desperation to develop i took the neighbourhood at all events for the small original hawthornesque world keeping the other the smoky modernism at a distance keeping everything in fact at a distance on so spare and bare and lean and mean a face did the bright hard sky strike me as looking down the way to think of it evidently was in some frank rural light of the past that of all the ancient new england simplicities with the lap of wide waters and the stillness of rocky pastures never far off they seem still indeed close at hand and with any number of our present worryings and pamperings of the literary temperament too little in question to be missed it kept at a distance in fact so far as my perception was concerned everything but a little boy a dear little harsh intelligent sympathetic american boy who dropped straight from the hard sky for my benefit i hadnt seen him emerge from elsewhere and turned up at my side with absolute confidence and with the most knowing tips he might have been a weimar tout or a stratford amateur only he so beautifully wasnt that is what i mean by my having alighted happily the little boy was so completely master of his subject and we formed on the spot so close an alliance he made up to me for my crude italian the way they become crude over here he made up to me a little even for my civil englishman he was exactly what i wanted a presence and he was the only thing far or near old enough native and intimate enough to reach back and to understand he showed me the window of the room in which hawthorne had been born wild horses as the phrase is wouldnt have dragged me into it but he might have done so if he hadnt as i say understood but he understood everything and knew when to insist and when not to knew for instance exactly why i said dear dear are you very sure after he had brought me to sight of an object at the end of a lane by a vague waterside i think and looking across to marblehead that he invited me to take if i could for the seven gables i couldnt take it in the least as happens and though he was perfectly sure our reasons on either side were equally clear to him so that in short i think of him as the very genius of the place feeding his small shrillness on the cold scraps of hawthornes leaving and with the making of his acquaintance alone worth the journey yet the fact that the seven gables being in question the shapeless object by the waterside wouldnt do at all not the least little bit troubled us only till we had thrown off together with a quick competent gesture and at the breaking of light the poor illusion of a necessity of relation between the accomplished thing for poetry for art and those other quite equivocal things that we inflate our ignorance with seeing it suggested by the weak vague domiciliary presence at the end of the lane may have been in our poor parlance the idea of the admirable book though even here we take a leap into dense darkness but the idea that is the inner force of the admirable book so vividly forgets before our eyes any such origin or reference cutting it dead as a low acquaintance and outsoaring the shadow of its night that the connection has turned a somersault into space repudiated like a ladder kicked back from the top of a wall hawthornes ladder at salem in fine has now quite gone and we but tread the air if we attempt to set our critical feet on its steps and its rounds learning thus as we do and with infinite interest as i think how merely subjective in us are our discoveries about genius endless are its ways of besetting and eluding of meeting and mocking us when there are appearances that might have nourished it we see it as swallowing them all yet we see it as equally gorged when there are no appearances at all then most of all sometimes quite insolently bloated and we recognize ruefully that we are forever condemned to know it only after the fact ix philadelphia i to be at all critically or as we have been fond of calling it analytically minded over and beyond an inherent love of the general manycoloured picture of things is to be subject to the superstition that objects and places coherently grouped disposed for human use and addressed to it must have a sense of their own a mystic meaning proper to themselves to give out to give out that is to the participant at once so interested and so detached as to be moved to a report of the matter that perverse person is obliged to take it for a working theory that the essence of almost any settled aspect of anything may be extracted by the chemistry of criticism and may give us its right name its formula for convenient use from the moment the critic finds himself sighing to save trouble in a difficult case that the cluster of appearances can have no sense from that moment he begins and quite consciously to go to pieces it being the prime business and the high honour of the painter of life always to make a sense and to make it most in proportion as the immediate aspects are loose or confused the last thing decently permitted him is to recognize incoherence to recognize it that is as baffling though of course he may present and portray it in all richness for incoherence that i think was what i had been mainly occupied with in new york and i quitted so qualified a joy under extreme stress of winter with a certain confidence that i should not have moved even a little of the way southward without practical relief relief which came in fact ever so promptly at philadelphia on my feeling unmistakably the change of half the furniture of consciousness this change put on immediately the friendliest the handsomest aspect supplied my intelligence on the spot with the clear the salient note i mean by this not that the happy definition or synthesis instantly came came with the perception that character and sense were there only waiting to be disengaged but that the note as i say was already within an hour the germ of these things and that the whole flower assuredly wouldnt fail to bloom i was in fact sniffing up its fragrance after i had looked out for three minutes from one of the windows of a particularly widefronted house and seen the large residential square that lay before me shine in its native light this light remarkably tender i thought for that of a winter afternoon matched with none other i had ever seen and announced straight off fifty new circumstances an enormous number in america for any prospect to promise you in contradistinction from any other it was not simply that beyond a doubt the outlook was more meridional a still deeper impression had begun to work and as i felt it more and more glimmer upon me i caught myself about to jump with a single leap to my synthesis i of course stayed myself in the act for there would be too much really yet to come but the perception left me i even then felt in possession of half the ground on which later experience would proceed it was not too much to say as i afterwards saw that i had in those few illumined moments put the gist of the matter into my pocket philadelphia incontestably then was the american city of the large type that didnt bristle just as i was afterwards to recognize in st louis the nearest approach to companionship with her in this respect and to recognize in chicago i may parenthetically add the most complete divergence it was not only moreover at the ample tranquil window there that philadelphia didnt bristle by the record of my moment but that she essentially couldnt and wouldnt ever that no movement or process could be thought of in fine as more foreign to her genius i do not just now go into the question of what the business of bristling in an american city may be estimated as consisting of so infallibly is one aware when the thousand possible quills are erect and when haply they are not such a test does the restored absentee find at least in his pricked sensibility a place may abound in its own sense as the phrase is without bristling in the least it is liable indeed to bristle most i think when not too securely possessed of any settled sense to abound in an imperfect grasp of such a luxury is not the weakness of philadelphia just as that admirable comprehensive flatness in her which precludes the image of the porcupine figured to me from the first precisely as her positive source of strength the absence of the note of the perpetual perpendicular the new york the chicago note and i allude here to the material the constructional exhibition of it seemed to symbolize exactly the principle of indefinite level extension and to offer refreshingly a challenge to horizontal to lateral to more or less tangental to rotary or better still to absolute centrifugal motion if it was to befall me during my brief but various acquaintance with the place not to find myself more than two or three times hoisted or lowered by machinery my prime illumination had been an absolute forecast of that immunity a virtue of general premonition in it at which i have already glanced i should in fact i repeat most truly or most artfully repaint my little picture by mixing my colours with the felt amenity of that small crisis and by showing how this that and the other impression to come had had while it lasted quite the definite prefigurement that the chapters of a book find in its table of contents the afternoon blandness for a fugitive from madison avenue in january snow didnt mean nothing the little marble steps and lintels and cornices and copings all the so clear so placed accents in the good prose text of the mildly purple houses across the square which seemed to wear them as all the others did up and down the streets in the manner of nice white stockings neckties collars cuffs didnt mean nothing and this was somehow an assurance that joined on to the vibration of the view produced a few hours before by so merely convenient a circumstance as my taking my place at jersey city in the pennsylvania train i had occasion repeatedly to find the pennsylvania railroad a beguiling and predisposing influence in relation to various objectives and indeed i quite lost myself in the singularity of this effect which existed for me certainly only in that connection touching me with a strange and most agreeable sense that the great line in question an institution with a style and allure of its own is not even the world over as other railroads are it absolutely with a little frequentation affected me as better and higher than its office or function and almost as supplying one with a mode of life intrinsically superior as if it ought really to be on its way to much grander and more charming places than any that happen to mark its course as if indeed should one persistently keep ones seat not getting out anywhere it would in the end carry one to some such ideal city one might under this extravagant spell which always began to work for me at twentythird street and on the constantlyadorable ferry have fancied the train disvulgarized of passengers steaming away in disinterested empty form to some terminus too noble to be marked in our poor schedules the consciousness of this devotion would have been thus like that of living all sublimely up in a balloon it was not however i recover myself that if i had been put off at philadelphia i was not for the hour contented finding so immediately as i have noted more interest to my hand than i knew at first what to do with there was the quick light of explanation following on everything else i have mentioned the light in which i had only to turn round again and see where i was and how it was in order to feel everything come out under the large friendliness the ordered charm and perfect peace of the club housing me with that whole protection the bestowal of which on occasion is the finest grace of the hospitality of american clubs philadelphia manifestly was beyond any other american city a society and was going to show as such as a thoroughly confirmed and settled one which fact became the key precisely to its extension on one plane and to its having no pretext for bristling human groups that discriminate in their own favour do one remembers in general bristle but that is only when they have not been really successful when they have not been able to discriminate enough when they are not like philadelphia settled and confirmed and content it would clearly be impossible not to regard the place before me as possessed of this secret of serenity to a degree elsewhere at least among ourselves unrivalled the basis of the advantage the terms of the secret would be still to make out which was precisely the high interest and i was afterwards to be justified of my conviction by the multiplication of my lights new york in that sense had appeared to me then not a society at all and it was rudimentary that chicago would be one still less neither of them as a human group having been able to discriminate in its own favour with anything like such success the proof of that would be obviously in ones so easily imputing to them alteration extension development a change somehow unimaginable in the case of philadelphia which was a fixed quantity and had filled to the brim one felt and wasnt that really to be part of the charm the measure of her possibility boston even was thinkable as subject to mutation had i not in fact just seemed to myself to catch her in the almost uncanny inconsequence of change there had been for boston the old epigram that she wasnt a place but a state of mind and that might remain since we know how frequently states of mind alter philadelphia then wasnt a place but a state of consanguinity which is an absolute final condition she had arrived at it with nothing in the world left to bristle for or against whereas new york and above all chicago were only and most precariously on the way to it and indeed having started too late would probably never arrive there were for them interferences and complications they knew and would yet know other conditions perhaps other beatitudes only the beatitude i speak of that of being in the composed sense a society was lost to them forever philadelphia without complications or interferences enjoyed it in particular through having begun to invoke it in time and now she had nothing more to invoke she had everything her cadres were all full her imagination was at peace this exactly again would be the reason of the bristling of the other places the cadres of new york chicago boston being as to a third of them empty and as to another third objectionably filled with much consequent straining reaching heaving both to attain and to eject what makes a society was thus more than anything else the number of organic social relations it represents by which logic philadelphia would represent nothing but organic social relations the degrees of consanguinity were the cadres every one of them was full it was a society in which every individual was as many times over cousin uncle aunt niece and so on through the list as poor human nature is susceptible of being these degrees are when one reflects the only really organic social relations and when they are all there for every one the scheme of security in a community has been worked out philadelphia in other words would not only be a family she would be a happy one and a probable proof that the happiness comes as a matter of course if the family but be large enough consanguinity provides the marks and features the type and tone and ease the common knowledge and the common consciousness but number would be required to make these things social number accordingly for her perfection was what philadelphia would have it having been clear to me still in my charming club and at my illuminating window that she couldnt not be perfect she would be of all goodly villages the very goodliest probably in the world the very largest and flattest and smoothest the most rounded and complete ii the simplest account of such success as i was to have in putting my vision to the test will be i think to say that the place never for a moment belied to me that forecast of its animated intimacy yet it might be just here that a report of my experience would find itself hampered this learning the lesson from one vivid page of the picturebook to another of how perfectly intimate philadelphia is such an exhibition would be prohibitively the exhibition of private things of private things only and of a charmed contact with them were it not for the great circumstance which when what i have said has been fully said remains to be taken into account the state of infinite cousinship colours the scene makes the predominant tone but you get a light upon it that is worth all others from the moment you see it as ever so savingly historic this perception moreover promptly operates i found it stirred as soon as i went out or began to circulate by all immediate aspects and signs the place went back or in other words the social equilibrium forestalling so that of the other cities had begun early had had plenty of time on its side and thus had its history behind it the past that looms through it not at all luridly but so squarely and substantially today and gives it by a mercy an extension other than the lateral this frankly was required it struck me for the full comfort of ones impression for a certain desirable and imputable richness the backward extension in short is the very making of philadelphia one is so uncertain of the value one would attach to her being as she is if she hadnt been so by prescription and for a couple of centuries this has established her right and her competence the fact is the parent so to speak of her consistency and serenity it has made the very law under which her parts and pieces have held so closely together to walk her streets is to note with all promptness that william penn must have laid them out no one else could possibly have done it so ill it was his best though with our larger sense for a street it is far from ours we at any rate no more complain of them nor suggest that they might have been more liberally conceived than we so express ourselves about the form of the chairs in sitting through a morning call i found myself liking them then as i moved among them just in proportion as they conformed in detail to the early pattern the figure for each house of the redfaced old gentleman whose thick eyebrows and moustache have turned to white and i found myself detesting them in any instance of a new front or a new fashion they were narrow with this aspect as of a double file of grizzled veterans or they were nothing the narrowness had been positively the channel or conduit of continuity of character it made the long pipe on which the tune of the place was played from the moment it was in any way corrected the special charm broke the charm a rare civic possession as of some immense old ruled and neatlyinked chart not less carefully than benightedly flattened out stretching its tough parchment under the very feet of all comings and goings this was an image with which as it furthermore seemed to me everything else consorted above all the soothing truth that philadelphia was yes beyond cavil solely and singly philadelphian there was an interference absent or one that i at least never met that sharp note of the outlandish in the strict sense of the word which i had already found almost everywhere so disconcerting i pretend here of course neither to estimate the numbers in which the grosser aliens may actually have settled on these bland banks of the delaware nor to put my finger on the principle of the shock i had felt it and was still to feel it in their general power to administer for i am not now concerned so much with the impression made by ones almost everywhere meeting them as with the impression made by ones here and there failing of it they may have been gathered in their hordes in some vast quarter unknown to me and of which i was to have no glimpse but what would this have denoted exactly but some virtue in the air for reducing their presence or their effect to naught there precisely was the difference from new york that they themselves had been in that place half the virtue or the vice of the air and that there were few of its agitations to which they had not something to say the logic of the case had been visible to me for that matter on my very first drive from the train from that precious pennsylvania station of philadelphia which was to strike me as making a nearer approach than elsewhere to the arts of ingratiation there was an object or two windowed and chimneyed in the central sky but nothing to speak of i then and there in a word took in the admirable flatness and if it seemed so spacious by the same token this was because it was neither eager nor grasping nor pushing it drew its breath at its ease clearly never sounding the charge the awful step lively of new york the fury of the pavement had dropped in fine as i was to see it drop later on between chicago and st louis this affected me on the spot of symbolic and i was to have no glimpse of anything that gainsaid the symbol it was somehow too the very note of the homogeneous though this indeed is not oddly enough the head under which at st louis my impression was to range itself i at all events here gave myself up to the vision that of the vast firm chessboard the immeasurable spread of little squares covered all over by perfect philadelphians it was an image in face of some of the other features of the view dissimilar to any by which one had ever in ones life been assaulted and this elimination of the foreign element has been what was required to make it consummate nothing is more notable through the states at large than that hazard of what one may happen or may not happen to see but the only use to be made of either accident is clearly to let it stand and to let it serve this intensity and ubiquity of the local tone that of the illimitable town serves so successfully for my sense of philadelphia that i should feel as if a little masterpiece of the creative imagination had been destroyed by the least correction and there is further the point to make that if i knew all the while that there was something more and different and less beatific under and behind the happy appearance i grasped i knew it by no glimmer of direct perception and should never in the world have guessed it if some sound of it had not by a discordant voice been all superfluously rather tactlessly dropped into my ear it was not however disconcerting at the time this presentation as in a flash of the other side of the medal the other side being in a word as was mentioned to me one of the most lurid pages in the annals of political corruption the place by this revelation was two distinct things a society from far back the society i had divined the most genial and delightful one could think of and then parallel to this and not within it nor quite altogether above it but beside it and beneath it behind it and before it enclosing it as in a frame of fire in which it still had the secret of keeping cool a proportionate city the most incredible that ever was organized all for plunder and rapine the gross satisfaction of official appetite organized for eternal iniquity and impunity such were the conditions it had been hinted to me from the moment the medal spun round but i even understate i think in speaking of the knowledge as only not disconcerting it was better than that for it positively added the last touch of colour to my framed and suspended picture here strikingly then was an american case and presumably one of the best one of the best that is for some study of the wondrous problem admiration and amazement of the nations who yearn over it from far off the way in which sane society and pestilent city in the united states successfully cohabit each keeping it up with so little of fear or flutter from the other the thing presents itself in its prime unlikelihood as a thorough good neighbouring of the happy family and the infernal machine the machine so rooted as to continue to defy removal and the family still so indifferent while it carries on the family business of buying and selling of chattering and dancing to the danger of being blown up it is all puzzled out from afar as a matter of the exchange and in a large decree of the observance from side to side of guarantees and the interesting thing to get at for the student of manners will ever be just this mystery of the terms of the bargain i must add none the less that though one was ones self inevitably and always and everywhere that student my attention happened to be or rather was obliged to be confined to one view of the agreement the arrangement is obviously between the great municipalities and the great populations on the grand scale and i lacked opportunity to look at it all round i had but my glimpse of the apparently wide social acceptance of it that is i saw but the face of the medal most directly turned to the light of day and could note that nowhere so much as in philadelphia was any carking care in the social mind any uncomfortable consciousness as of a skeleton at the banquet of life so gracefully veiled this struck me on my looking back afterwards with more knowledge as admirable as heroic in its way and as falling in altogether with inherent habits of sociability gaiety gallantry with that felt presence of a temperament with which the original quaker drab seems to flush giving it as one might say for the sake of the figure something of the iridescence of the breast of a wellfed dove the original quaker drab is still there and ideally for the picture up and down the uniform streets one should see a bland broadbrimmed squaretoed gentleman or a bonneted kerchiefed mittened lady on every little flight of white steps but the very note of the place has been the worldly overscoring for most of the senses of the primitive monotone the bestitching of the drab with pink and green and silver the mixture has been for a social effect admirably successful thanks one seems to see to the subtle the charming absence of pedantry in the quaker purity it flushes gracefully that temperate prejudice with its predisposition to the universal tutoiement turning first but to the prettiest pink so that we never quite know where the drab has ended and the colour of the world has begun the disfrocked catholic is too strange the paganized puritan too angular it is the accommodating friend who has most the secret of a modus vivendi and if it be asked i may add whether in this case of social philadelphia the genius for life and what i have called the gallantry of it above all wouldnt have been better shown by a scorn of any compromise to which the nefarious city could invite it i can only reply that as a lover always of romantic phenomena and an inveterate seeker for them i should have been deprived by the action of that particular virtue of the thrilled sense of a society dancing all consciously on the thin crust of a volcano it is the thinness of the crust that makes in such examples the wild fantasy the gay bravery of the dance just as i admit that a preliminary an original extinction of the volcano would have illustrated another kind of virtue the crust for the social tread would in this case have been firm but the spectators imagination would have responded less freely i think to the appeal of the scene if i may indeed speak my whole thought for him he would so have had to drop again to his regret the treasure of a small analogy picked up on its very threshold how shall he confess at once boldly and shyly enough that the situation had at the end of a very short time begun to strike him for all its immeasurably reduced and simplified form as a much nearer approach to the representation of an old order an ancien regime socially speaking than any the field of american manners had seemed likely to regale him with grotesque the comparison if pushed yet how had he encountered the similitude if it hadnt been hanging about from the moment he adopted it at any rate he found it taking on touch after touch the essence of old orders as history lights them is just that innocent beatitude of consanguinity of the multiplication of the assured felicities to which i have already alluded from this in philadelphia didnt the rest follow the sense for every one of being in the same boat with every one else a closed circle that would find itself happy enough if only it could remain closed enough the boat might considerably pitch but its occupants would either float merrily together or almost as merrily go down together and meanwhile the risk the vague danger the jokes to be made about it the general quickened sociability and intimacy were the very music of the excursion there are even yet to be observed about the world fragments and ghosts of old social orders thin survivals of final cataclysms and it was not less positive than beguiling that the common marks by which these companies are known and which we still distinguish through their bedimmed condition cropped up for me in the high american light making good my odd parallel at almost every point yet if these signs of a slightly congested but still practically selfsufficing little world were all there they were perhaps there most to my ear in the fact of the little worlds proper intimate idiom and accent a dialect as much its very own even in drawingrooms and libraries as the venetian is that of venice or the neapolitan is that of naples representing the common things of association the things easily understood and felt and charged as no other vehicle could be with the fund of local reference there is always the difference of course that at venice and at naples in society an alternative either that of french or of the classic the more or less academic italian is offered to the uninitiated stranger whereas in philadelphia he is candidly consistently sometimes almost contagiously entertained in the free vernacular the latter may easily become in fact under its wealth of idiosyncrasy and if he have the favouring turn of mind a tempting object of linguistic study with the bridge built for him moreover that unlike the venetian the neapolitan and most other local languages it contains itself colloquially a notable element of the academic and the classic it struck me even truly as with a certain hardness in it constituting the society that employed it very much as the egg is made oval by its shell and really if i may say all as taking its stand a bit consciously sometimes if not a bit defiantly on its own proved genius i remember the visible dismay of a gentleman a pilgrim from afar in a drawingroom at the comment of a lady a lady of one of the new generations indeed and mistress of the tone by which i had here and there occasion to observe that such ornaments of the new generation might be known listen to the creature he speaks english it was the very opposite of the indulgence or encouragement with which in a venetian drawingroom i catch my analogies as i can the sound of french or of italian might have been greeted the poor creatures dismay was so visible clearly for the reason that such things have only to be said with a certain confidence to create a certain confusion the momentary consciousness of some such misdeed from the point of view of manners as the speaking of russian at warsaw i have said that philadelphia didnt bristle but the heroine of my anecdote caused the so genial city to resemble for the minute linguistically an unreconciled poland iii but why do i talk of the new generations or at any rate of the abyss in them that may seem here and there beyond ones shallow sounding when all the while at the back of my head hovers the image in the guise of which antiquity in philadelphia looks most seated and most interesting nowhere throughout the country i think unless it be perchance at mount vernon does our historic past so enjoy the felicity of an important concrete illustration it survives there in visible form as it nowhere else survives and one can doubtless scarce think too largely of what its mere felicity of presence in these conditions has done and continues and will continue to do for the place at large it may seem witless enough at this time of day to arrive from pennsylvania with news of the old state house and my news i can only recognize began but with being news for myself in which character it quite shamelessly pretended both to freshness and to brilliancy why shouldnt it have been charming the high roof under which the declaration of independence had been signed that was of course a question that might from the first have been asked of me and with no better answer in wait for it than that after all it might just have happened in the particular conditions not to be or else that in general one is allowed a margin on the spot for the direct sense of consecrated air for that communication of its spirit which in proportion as the spirit has been great withholds itself shyly and nobly from any mere forecast this it is exactly that by good fortune keeps up the sanctity of shrines and the lessons of history to say nothing of the freshness of individual sensibility and the general continuity of things there is positively nothing of independence hall of its fine old georgian amplitude and decency its large serenity and symmetry of pink and drab and its actual emphasis of detachment from the vulgar brush of things that is not charming and there is nothing the city through that doesnt receive a mild sidelight that of a reflected interest from its neighbourhood this element of the reflected interest and more particularly of the reflected distinction is for the most part on the american scene the missed interest despite the ingenuities of wealth and industry and energy that strain so touchingly often and even to grimace and contortion somehow to supply it one finds ones self when it has happened to intervene weighing its action to the last grain of gold one even puts to ones self fantastic cases such as the question for instance of what might what might not have happened if poor dear reckless new york had been so distinguished or so blest with the bad conscience she is too intelligent not to have her power to be now and then ashamed of her form lodged after all somewhere in her interminable boots one has of course to suppress there the prompt conviction that the blessing that of the possession of an historical monument of the first order would long since have been replaced by the higher advantage of a row of skyscrapers yielding rents yet the imagination none the less dallies with the fond vision of some respect somehow instilled some deference somehow suggested some revelation of the possibilities of a public tenue somehow effected fascinating in fact to speculate a little as to what a new york held in respect by something or other some power not of the purse might have become it is bad ever for lusty youth especially with a command of means to grow up without knowing at least one nice family if the family be not priggish and this is the danger that the young philadelphia with its eyes on the superior connection i am speaking of was enabled to escape the charming old pink and drab heritage of the great time was to be the superior connection playing for the education of the place the part of the nice family socially morally even aesthetically the place was to be thus more or less inevitably built round it but for which good fortune who knows if even philadelphia too might have not been vulgar one meets throughout the land enough instances of the opposite luck the situation of immense and successful communities that have lacked originally anything firstrate as they might themselves put it to be built round anything better that is than some profitable hole in the earth some confluence of rivers or command of lakes or railroads and one sees how though this deficiency may not have made itself felt at first it has inexorably loomed larger and larger the drawback of it growing all the while with the growth of the place our sense of such predicaments for the gatherings of men comes back i think and with an intensity of interest to our sense of the way the human imagination absolutely declines everywhere to go to sleep without some apology at least for a supper the collective consciousness in however empty an air gasps for a relation as intimate as possible to something superior something as central as possible from which it may more or less have proceeded and round which its life may revolve and its dim desire is always i think to do it justice that this object or presence shall have had as much as possible an heroic or romantic association but the difficulty is that in these later times among such aggregations the heroic and romantic elements even under the earliest rude stress have been all too tragically obscure belonged to smothered unwritten almost unconscious private history so that the central something the social point de repere has had to be extemporized rather pitifully after the fact and made to consist of the biggest hotel or the biggest common school the biggest factory the biggest newspaper office or for climax of desperation the house of the biggest billionaire these are the values resorted to in default of higher for with some coloured rag or other the general imagination snatching its chance must dress its doll as a real a moral value to the general mind at all events and not as a trumpedup one i saw the lucky legacy of the past at philadelphia operate though i admit that these are at best for the mooning observer matters of appreciation mysteries of his own sensibility such an observer has early to perceive and to conclude on it once for all that there will be little for him in the american scene unless he be ready anywhere everywhere to read into it as much as he reads out it is at its best for him when most open to that friendly penetration and not at its best i judge when practically most closed to it and yet how can i pretend to be able to say under this discrimination what was better and what was worse in independence hall to say how far the charming facts struck me as going of themselves or where the imagination perhaps on this sole patch of ground by exception a meddler not wanted anyhow took them up to carry them further i am reduced doubtless to the comparative sophism of making my better sense here consist but of my sense of the fine interior of the building one sees them immediately as good delightfully good on architectural and scenic lines these large high wainscoted chambers as good as any could thinkably have been at the time embracing what was to be done in them with such a noble congruity which in all the conditions they might readily have failed of though they were no mere tent pitched for the purpose that the historic imagination reascending the centuries almost catches them in the act of directly suggesting the celebrated coup one fancies under the high spring of the ceiling and before the great embrasured windowsashes of the principal room some clever man of the period after a long look round taking the hint what an admirable place for a declaration of something what could one here what couldnt one really declare and then after a moment i say why not our independence capital thing always to declare and before any one gets in with anything tactless youll see that the fortune of the place will be made it really takes some such frivolous fancy as that to represent with proper extravagance the reflection irresistibly rising there and that it yet would seem pedantic to express with solemnity the sense namely of our beautiful escape in not having had to declare in any way meanly of our good fortune in having found half the occasion made to our hand high occasions consist of many things and it was extraordinary luck for our great date that not one of these even as to surface and appearance should have been wanting there might easily have been traps laid for us by some of the inferior places but i am convinced and more completely than of anything else in the whole connection that the genius of historic decency would have kept us enslaved rather than have seen us committed to one of those in that light for the intelligent pilgrim the philadelphia monument becomes under his tread under the touch of his hand and the echo of his voice the very prize the sacred thing itself contended for and gained so that its quality in fine is irresistible and its dignity not to be uttered i was so conscious for myself i confess of the intensity of this perception that i dip deep into the whole remembrance without touching bottom by which i mean that i grope reminiscentially in the full basin of the general experience of the spot without bringing up a detail distinct to me only the way its character so clear yet so ample everywhere hangs together and keeps itself up distinct to me only the large sense in halls and spreading staircase and longdrawn upper gallery of one of those rare precincts of the past against which the present has kept beating in vain the present comes in and stamps about and very stertorously breathes but its sounds are as naught the next moment it is as if one felt there that the grandparent reserved irresponsive now and having spoken his word in his finest manner once for all must have long ago had enough of the exuberance of the young grandsons modernity but of course the great impression is that of the persistent actuality of the so auspicious room in which the signers saw their tossing ship into port the lapse of time here extraordinarily has sprung no leak in the effect it remains so robust that everything lives again the interval drops out and we mingle in the business the old ghosts to our inward sensibility still make the benches creak as they free their full coatskirts for sitting down still make the temperature rise the pens scratch the papers flutter the dust float in the large sunshafts we place them as they sit watch them as they move hear them as they speak pity them as they ponder know them in fine from the arch of their eyebrows to the shuffle of their shoes i am not sure indeed that for mere archaic insolence the little old hall of the guild of carpenters my vision of which jostles my memory of the state house does not carry it even with a higher hand in spite of a bedizenment of restoration within which leads us to rejoice that the retouchings of the greater monument expose themselves comparatively so little the situation of this elegant structure of dimensions and form that scarce differ as i recall them from those of delicate little holden chapel of the so floridlyoverlaid gable most articulate single word in college yard of the small builded sense of old harvard comes nearer to representing an odd townnook than any other corner of american life that i remember american life having been organized ab ovo with an hostility to the townnook which has left no scrap of provision for eyes needing on occasion a refuge from the general glare the general glare seemed to me at the end of something like a passage in the shade of something like a court and in the presence of something like a relic to have mercifully intermitted on that fine philadelphia morning i wont answer for the exact correspondence of the conditions with my figure of them since the shade i speak of may have been but the shade of tall buildings the vulgarest of new accidents yet i let my impression stand if only as a note of the relief certain always to lurk at any turn of the american scene in the appearance of any individual thing within or behind or at the end or in the depth of any other individual thing it makes for the sense of complexity relieves the eternal impression of things all in a row and of a single thickness an impression which the usual unprecedented length of the american alignment always its source of pride does by itself little to mitigate nothing in the array is behind anything else an odd result i admit of the fact that so many things affirm themselves as preponderantly before little carpenters hall was delightfully somewhere behind so much behind as i perhaps thus fantastically see it that i dare say i should not be able to find my way to it again if i were to try nothing for that matter would induce me to revisit in fact i feel the object i so fondly evoke it might have been for this beautiful posteriority somewhere in the city of london iv i can but continue to lose myself for these connections in my whole sense of the intermission as i have called it of the glare the mellower light prevailed somehow all that fine philadelphia morning as well as on two or three other occasions and i cannot after all pretend i dont now see why it was because ones experience of the place had become immediately an intimate thing intimate with that intimacy that i had tasted from the first in the local air so that inevitably thus there was no keeping of distinct accounts for public and private items an ancient church or two of aspect as anglican still as you please and taking for another case from the indifferent bustle round it quite the look of wrens mere steepled survivals in the backwaters of london churchyards franklins grave itself in its own backwater of muffled undulations close to the indifferent bustle franklins admirable portrait by duplessis in the councilroom of an ancient opulent trust a conservative company vague and awful to my shy sense that was housed after the fashion of some exclusive madeiradrinking old gentleman with obsequious heirs these and other matters wholly thrilling at the time float back to me as on the current of talk and as in the flood so to speak of hospitality if philadelphia had in opposition to so many other matters struck me as coherent there would be surely no point of ones contact at which this might so have come home as in those mysterious chambers and before the most interesting of the many farscattered portraits of franklin the portrait working as some sudden glimpse of the fine old incised seal kept in its glass cabinet that had originally stamped all over for identification the comparatively soft local wax one thinks of franklins reputation of his authority and however much they may have been locally contested at the time as marking the material about him much as his name might have marked his underclothing or his pocketbooks small surprise one had the impression of a society with such a figure as that to start conversation he seemed to preside over it all while one lingered there as if he had been seated at the mahogany relentingly enough near his glass of madeira seemed to be in it even more freely than by the so interesting fact of his still having in philadelphia in new york in boston through his daughter so numerous a posterity the sense of life life the most positive most human and most miscellaneous expressed in his aged crumpled canny face where the smile wittily profits for fineness by the comparative collapse of the mouth represents a suggestion which succeeding generations may well have found it all they could do to work out it is impossible in the place after seeing that portrait not to feel him still with them with the genial generations even though today in the larger more mixed cup the force of his example may have suffered some dilution it was a savour of which at any rate for ones own draught one could but make the most and i went so far on this occasion as fairly to taste it there in the very quality of my company in that of the distinguished guidance and protection i was enjoying which could only make me ask myself in what finer modern form one would have wished to see franklins humanity and sagacity his variety and ingenuity his wealth of ideas and his tireless application of them embodied there was verily nothing to do after this but to play over the general picture that light of his assumption of the general ease of things of things at any rate thereabouts so that i now see each reminiscence whatever the time or the place happily governed and coloured by it times and places in such an experience ranged themselves after a space like valued objects in one of the assorted rooms of a collection keep them a little tenderly handled wrapped up stowed away and they then come forth into the room swept and garnished susceptible of almost any pleasing arrangement the only thing is that you shall scarce know at a given moment amid your abundance which of them to take up first there being always in them moreover at best the drawback of value from mere association that keepsake element of objects in a reliquary is not this however the drawback for exhibition of almost any item of american experience that may not pretend to deal with the mere monstrosities the immensities of size and space of trade and traffic of organisation political educational economic from the moment ones record is not in fine a loud statistical shout it falls into the order of those shy things that speak at the most when one is ones self incapable even of the merest statistical whisper but of the personal adventure in other words but of ones luck and of ones sensibility there are incidents there are passages that flush in this fashion to the backward eye under the torch but what solemn statement is one to make of the importance for example of such a matter as the academy soiree as they say in london of the philadelphia winter the festive commemoration of some long span of life achieved by the pennsylvania academy of fine arts we may have been thrilled positively by the occasion by the interesting encounters and discoveries artistic and personal to which it ministered we may have moved from one charmed recognition to another noting sargents and whistlers by the dozen and old forgotten french friends foreign friends in general older and younger noting young native upstarts creatures of yesterday and tomorrow who invite with all success a stand and a stare but no aftersense of such vibrations however lively presumes to take itself as communicable one would regret on the other hand failing to sound some echo of a message everywhere in the united states so audible that of the clamorous signs of a hungry social growth the very pulses making all their noise of the engine that works night and day for a theory of civilization there are moments at which it may well seem that putting the sense of the spectacle even at its lowest there is no such amusement as this anywhere supplied the air through which everything shows is so transparent with steps and stages and processes as distinct in it as the appearance from a streetcorner of a crowd rushing on an alarm to a fire the gregarious crowd tells in the street and the indications i speak of tell like chalkmarks on the demonstrative american blackboard an impression perhaps never so much brought home to me as by a wondrous sunday morning at the edge of a vast vacant philadelphia street a street not of penns creation and vacant of everything but an immeasurable bourgeois blankness i had turned from that scene into a friendly house that was given over from top to toe to a dazzling collection of pictures amid which i felt myself catch in the very act one of the great ingurgitations of the hungry machine and recognize as well how perfect were all the conditions for making it a case what could have testified less on the face of it than the candour of the streets insignificance a pair of huge parted lips protesting almost to pathos their innocence of anything to say which was exactly none the less where appetite had broken out and was feeding itself to satiety large and liberal the hospitality remarkably rich the store of acquisition in the light of which the whole energy of the keen collector showed the knowledge the acuteness the audacity the incessant watch for opportunity these abrupt and multiplied encounters intensities ever so various of individual curiosity sound the aesthetic note sometimes with unprecedented shrillness and then again with the most muffled discretion was the note muffled or shrill meanwhile as i listened to it under a fascination i fully recognized during an hour spent in the clustered palaestra of the university of pennsylvania here the winter afternoon seemed to throw itself artfully back across the centuries the climates the seasons the very faiths and codes into the air of old greece and the age of gymnastic glory artfully i rather insist because i scarce know what fine emphasis of modernism hung about it too i put that question however only to deny myself the present luxury of answering it so thickly do the visitors university impressions over the land tend to gather and so markedly they suggest their being reported of together i note my palaestral hour therefore but because it fell through what it seemed to show me straight into what i had conceived of the philadelphia scheme the happy family given up though quite on family lines to all the immediate beguilements and activities the art in particular of cultivating with such gaiety as might be a brave civic blindness i became conscious of but one excrescence on this large smooth surface it is true indeed that the excrescence was huge and affected me as demanding in some way to be dealt with the pennsylvania penitentiary rears its ancient grimness its grey towers and defensive moats masses at least that uncertain memory so figures for me in an outlying quarter which struck me as borrowing from them a vague likeness to some more or less blighted minor city of italy or france black angers or dead ferrara yet seated on its basis of renown and wrapped in its legend of having as the first flourishing example of the strictly cellular system the complete sequestration of the individual prisoner thought wonderful in its day moved charles dickens to the passionate protest recorded in his american notes of such substance was the story of these battlements yet it was unmistakable that when one had crossed the drawbridge and passed under the portcullis the air seemed thick enough with the breath of the generations a prison has at the worst the massive majesty the sinister peace of a prison but this huge house of sorrow affected me as uncannily of the city itself the city of all the cynicisms and impunities against which my friends had from far back kept plating as with the old silver of their sideboards the armour of their social consciousness it made the whole place with some of its oddly antique aspects and its oddly modern freedoms look doubly cut off from the world of light and ease the suggestions here were vast however too many of them swarm and my imagination must defend itself as it can what i was most concerned to note was the complete turn of the wheel of fortune in respect to the measure of mere incarceration suffered from which the worst of the rigour had visibly been drawn parts of the place suggested a sunny club at a languid hour with members vaguely lounging and chatting with open doors and comparatively cheerful vistas and plenty of rockingchairs and magazines the only thing was that under this analogy one found ones self speculating much on the implied requisites for membership it was impossible not to wonder from face to face what these would have been and not to ask what one would have taken them to be if the appearance of a club had been a little more complete i almost blush i fear for the crude comfort of my prompt conclusion one would have taken them to consist without exception of fullblown basenesses one couldnt from member to member from type to type from one pair of eyes to another take them for anything less where was the victim of circumstances where the creature merely misled or betrayed he fitted no type he suffered in no face he yearned in no history and one felt the more one took in his absence that the numerous substitutes for him were good enough for each other the great interest was in this sight of the number and variety of ways of looking morally mean and perhaps also in the question of how much the effect came from its being proved upon them of how little it might have come if they had still been out in the world considered as criminals the moral meanness here was their explication considered as morally mean therefore would possible criminality out in the world have been in the same degree their sole sense was the fact of prison all the mere fact of opportunity and the fact of freedom all the mere fact of the absence of it one inclined to believe that the simplification was at any rate so great for ones feeling the cases presented became thus consistently cases of the vocation and from the moment this was clear the place took on in its way almost the harmony of a convent i talked for a long time with a charming reprieved murderer whom i half expected at any moment to see ring for coffee and cigars he explained with all urbanity and with perfect lucidity the real sense of the appearance against him but i none the less felt sure that his merit was largely in the refinement wrought in him by so many years of easy club life he was as natural a subject for commutation as for conviction and had had to have the latter in order to have the former in the enjoyment and indeed in the subtle criticism of which as simple commutation he was at his best they were there all those of his companions i was able to note unmistakably at their best one could as i say sufficiently rest in it and to do that kept in a manner the excrescence as i have called it on the general scene within bounds i was moreover luckily to see the general scene definitely cleared again cleared of everything save its own social character and its practical philosophy and at no moment with these features so brightly presented as during a few days rage of winter round an old countryhouse the house was virtually distant from town and the conditions could but strike any visitor who stood whenever he might with his back to the fire where the logs were piled high as made to press on all the reserves and traditions of the general temperament those of gallantry hilarity social disposability crowned with the grace of the sporting instinct what was it confusedly almost romantically like what old order commemorated in fiction and anecdote i had groped for this as i have shown before but i found myself at it again wasnt it for freedom of movement for jingle of sleighbells for breasting of the elements for crosscountry drives in the small hours for cranerie of fine young men and high wintry colour of muffled nymphs wasnt it brogue and all like some audible echo of closepacking chancing irish society of the classic time seen and heard through a roaring blizzard that at least with his back to the fire was where the restless analyst was landed x baltimore i it had doubtless not been merely absurd as the wild winter proceeded to find ones self so enamoured of the very name of the south that one was ready to take it in any small atmospheric instalment and to feel the echo of its voice in the yell of any engine that happened not to drag one either directly north or directly west one tended at least on these terms in some degree toward the land where the citron blooms and that was something to go on with a handful of small change accepted for the time as a pledge of great gold pieces to come it is astonishing along the atlantic coast how from the moment the north ceases to insist the south may begin to presume ever so little no doubt at first yet with protrusive feelers that tell how she only wants the right sensibility the true waiting victim to play upon it is a question certainly of where on the so frequently torpid stretch of shore i speak of the north does cease to insist or perhaps i should more correctly say a question of when it does it appeared incapable of this fine tact almost anywhere i confess at the season the first supposedly relenting weeks of my facing in earnest to florida and the interest indeed of that slightly grim adventure was to be in the way it ministered to the coincidence for me of two quite opposed strains of reflection on the one hand nothing could say more to the subject long expatriated condemned by the terms of his exile to a chronic consciousness of grey northern seas than to feel how from new york or even from boston he had but to sit still in his portentous car had but to exercise a due concentrated patience in order to become aware without personal effort or suffered transfer of that most charming of all watchable processes the gradual soft the distinctively demoralized conversion of the soul of nature this conversion if i may so put it without profanity has always struck me on any southward course as a return on the part of that soul from a comparatively grim theistic faith to the ineradicable principle of paganism a conscious castingoff of the dread theological abstraction an abstraction still even with all puritan stiffening in the interest of multiplied lurking familiar powers divinities graces presences as unseen but as inherent as the scents clinging to the folds of natures robe it would be on such occasions the fault of the divine familiars themselves if their haunts and shrines were empty for earth and air and day and night as we go still affect us as moods of their sympathy still vibrate to the breath of their passage so that our progress under the expanding sun resembles a little less a journey through space than a retracing of the course of the ages these are fine fancies however and what is more to my point is that the theory so agreeable to entertain at jersey city of a direct connection between the snowbanks and the orangegroves is a thing of sweetness only so long as practically unshaken there is continuity goodness knows always in america it is the last thing that is ever broken the question for the particular case is but continuity of what the basis of my individual hope had been that of the reign of the orangegrove but what it proved at the crisis i name was positively that of the usurpation of the snowbank it was possible indubitably in such conditions to go to charleston on sledges which made in fact after all for directness of connection it made moreover by the same token for a certain sinister light on the general truth of our grand territorial unity it was as if the winter at the end of february abroad for a walk had marched as promptly and inevitably from the arctic circle to the gulf as it might have proceeded with pride in its huge clear course from the top of broadway to the battery this brought home again as i myself went i remember one of those three or four main ideas suggested by the recurrent conditions which become as obsessions for the traveller in the states if he have a mind that is so indecently exposed to ideas the sense constantly fed and from a hundred sources that as nature abhors a vacuum so it is of the genius of the american land and the american people to abhor whenever may be a discrimination they are reduced together under stress to making discriminations but they make them i think as lightly and scantily as possible with the lively insistence of that impression even though it quite undermined my fond view of a loose and overreaching citronic belt i found my actually monotonous way beguiled practically till i reached charleston this way disclaiming every invidious intent refused to be dissociated from anything else in the world it was only another case of the painting with a big brush a brush steeped in crude universal white and of the colossal size this implement was capable of assuming gradations transitions differences of any sort temporal material social whether in man or in his environment shrank somehow under its sweep to negligible items and one had perhaps never yet seemed so to move through a vast simplified scheme the illustration was once more in fine of the small inherent the small accumulated resistance in american air to any force that does simplify one found the signs of such resistance as little in the prospect enjoyed from the carwindow as one distinguished them in the vain images of the interior those human documents deciphered from ones seat in the pullman which yet do always in their way for the traveller constitute precious evidence the spread of this single great wash of winter from latitude to latitude struck me in fact as having its analogy in the vast vogue of some infinitelyselling novel one of those happy volumes of which the circulation roars periodically from atlantic to pacific and from great windy state to state in the manner as i have heard it vividly put of a blazing prairie fire with as little possibility of arrest from criticism in the one case as from the bleating of lost sheep in the other everything so to speak was monotonized and the whole social order might have had its nose for the time buried by one levelling doom in the pages that after the break of the spell it would never know itself to mention again of course one remembered meanwhile there were spells and spells and the free field the particular freedom of which is the point of my remark would on occasion be just as open to the farexhaled breath of the south that in fact is what i was to find it though i thought all delightfully later in the season when the freedom of the field struck me as pure benefit i was not at the end of february really to meet it as i had looked for it before crossing the florida line but toward the middle of june i was to meet it enchantingly at baltimore and this then as i had not stopped there in my previous course was even beyond the wondrous february florida to reveal to me grateful for any such favour the south in her freshness the freshness was in part no doubt and even perhaps to extravagance mine i testify at all events first for baltimore it would probably be again the freshness of this confessedly subjective sort it would probably be again the state of alert response to any favour of the class just hinted at but the immediate effect of the maryland capital was to place it to my troubled vision and quite at the head of its group in a category of images and memories small at the best and the charm of which casts a shadow none the less even as the rose wears a thorn i refer indeed in this slightly portentous figure to the mere familiar truth that if representative values and the traceable or the imaginable connections of things happen to have on occasion for your eyes and your intelligence an existence of any intensity your case as a traveller an observer a reporter is bound from the first under the stirred impression to loom for you in some distressful shape these representative values and constructive connections the whole of the latent vividness of things not only remain under expression subject to no definite chemical test no mathematical proof whatever but almost turn their charming backs and toss their wilful heads at ones poor little array of terms and equivalents there thus immediately rises for the lone visionary betrayed and arrested in the very act of vision that spectre of impotence which dogs the footsteps of perception and whose presence is like some poisondrop in the silver cup baltimore put on for me from the first glance the form of the silver cup filled with the mildest sweetest decoction but i had no sooner begun to taste of it than i began to taste also of the infused bitter it had in its way during that first early hour or two of the summer evening a perfect felicity which meant for the touched intelligence that it was full of pleasantlyplaying reference and reflection that it exhaled on the spot as the word goes an atmosphere that it wore to contemplation in fine a character as marked with mild accents as some faded old uniform is marked with tarnished buttons and braid albeit these sources of interest were too closely of the texture to be snipped off in the guise of patterns or relics by any mere sharp shears of journalism i arrived late in the day and the day had been lovely i alighted at a large fresh peaceful hostelry imposingly modern yet quietly affable and having recognized the deep soft general note even from my windows as that of a kind of mollified vivacity i sought the streets with as many tacit questions as i judged they would tolerate or as the waning day would allow me to put it took but that hour as i strolled in the early eventide to give me the sense of the predicament i have glanced at that of finding myself committed to the view of baltimore as quite insidiously sympathetic quite inordinately amiable which amounted in other words to the momentous proposition that she was interesting and still of wondering by the same stroke how i was to make any such statement plausible character is founded on elements and features so many particular parts which conduce to an expression so i walked about the dear little city looking for the particular parts all with the singular effect of rather failing to find them and with my impression of felicity at the same time persistently growing the felicity was certainly not that of a mere blank there must accordingly have been items and objects signs and tokens there must have been causes of so charming a consequence there must have been the little numbers not necessarily big if only a tall enough column for the careful sum on my slate what happened then remarkably was that while i mechanically so argued my impression was fixing itself by a wild logic of its own and that i was presently to see how it would when once settled to a certain intensity snap its fingers at warrants and documents if it was a question of a slate the slate was used at school i remembered for more than one purpose so that mine by my walks end instead of a show of neat ciphering exhibited simply a bold drawn image which had the merit moreover of not being in the least a caricature the moral of this was precious that of the fine impunity with which if one but had sensibility the ciphering could be neglected and in fact almost contemned always that is and only with ones finer wits about one without them one was at best really nowhere even with items by the thousand so that the place became quite adorably a lesson in the use of that resource it would be no good to a journalist for he is nowhere ever without his items but it would be everything always to the mere restless analyst he might by its aid stand against all corners and this alike in pleasure and in pain in the bruised or in the soothed condition that was the real way to work things out and to feel it so brought home would by itself sufficiently crown this particular small pilgrimage ii if my sensibility yielded so completely to baltimore however i should add this was no doubt partly because the air seemed from the first to breathe upon it a pledge of no bruises i mounted in the golden june light the neatest amplest emptiest streetvista the builded side of a steepish hill and having come in due course to a spacious summit laid out with monumental elegance and completely void for the time of the human footstep i saw that to suffer in any fibre i should have positively somewhere to hurl myself upon the spears not a point protruded then or afterwards and the cunning of the restless analyst is essentially such that with friction long enough in abeyance to leave him a start he is already astride of his happier thesis seated firm having elected to be undismountable and riding it as hard as it will go the absence of friction on my monumental hilltop and in the prospects it overhung constituted i was to find an absolute circusring for this exercise and it is much to be able to say while performing in the circus even if but mainly to the public of ones own conscience that one has never had the sense of a safer hour the safety of baltimore i should indeed mention consisted perhaps a little overmuch during that first flush in its apparently vacant condition it affected me as a sort of perversely cheerful little city of the dead and from the dead naturally comes no friction was it cheerful that is or was it only resigned and discreet with the manner of the good breeding that doesnt publicly prate of family troubles i found myself handling in imagination these large quantities only because as i suppose it was impossible not to remember on that spot of what native generation one had come it took no greater intensity of the south than baltimore could easily give to figure again however fadedly and all as a ghostly presence the huge shadow of the war and to reproduce that particular bloodstained patch of it which in the very first days the now so irresponsible and absent community about me had flung across the path of the north this one echo of old time made the connections for the instant all vibrate and the scene before me somehow as it stood had to account for the great revolution it was as if that for the restless analyst had to be disposed of before anything else whereby precisely didnt the amenity of his impression partly spring from the descent there on the spot in a quick white flash of the most august of the muses it was history in person that hovered just long enough for me to recognize her and to read in her strange deep eyes her intelligence at least of everything it might have been there fairly as reassurance yes they have lived with me and it has done them good and we have buried together all their past about which wise creature as i am i allow them of course all piety but this what you make out around us is their real collective self which i am delighted to commend to you ive found baltimore a charming patient that was in ten minutes what it had come to as if the brush of the sublime garment had by itself cleared the air if there was a fine warm hush everywhere it was indeed partly that of this historic peace but for the rest it only meant that the world was at such a season out of town houses were everywhere closed and the neat perspectives all domiciliary and all as i have hinted tending mildly to a vague elegance were the more neat and more elegant though doubtless also the more mild and the more vague for their being so inanimate a certain vividness of high decency seemed in spite of it to possess them and this suggestion of the real southern glow yet with no southern looseness was clearly something by itself all special and local and all or almost all expressed in repeated vistas of little brickfaced and protrusively doorstepped houses which overhung by tall regular umbrage suggested rows of quiet old ladies seated with their toes tuckedup on uniform footstools under the shaded candlesticks of oldfashioned teaparties the little ladylike squares though below any tidemark of fashion were particularly frequent in which case it was as if the virtuous dames had drawn together round a large green table albeit to no more riotous end than that each should sit before her individual game of patience one sounds inevitably the note of the virtue so little in general can any picture of american townappearance hang together without it it amounts everywhere to something intenser than the implied absence of vice it amounts to a sort of registered absence of the conception or the imagination of it and still more of the provision for it though all the while as one goes and comes one feels that no community can really be as purged of peccant humours as the typical american has for the most part found itself foredoomed to look it has been caught in the mechanism of that consistency to an effect of convenience doubtless much more than to any other and has thus in the whole vast connection a relation to appearances that is all its own the european scene at a thousand points looks all its sophistications straight out at us or looks in other words at least as perverse as it practically is the american on the other hand expressing physiognomically no sophistications at all though plenty of quite common candours crudities and vulgarities makes one ask if the cashregister the icecream freezer the lightningelevator the boys paper and other such overflows do truly represent the sum of its passions incontestably at all events this immensely ingenuous aspect counts for any country and any scheme of life as a great force just as the appearance of the stale and the congested residing in the comparatively battered mask of experience counts as a weakness to conceive which the minds eye has only to fix a little the colossal american face grimacing with anything of a subtler consciousness that image if actually presented would become as we feel appalling the inexorable fate of the countenance in question may be so to learn to grimace in time but though few processes are slow in the united states and few exhibitions not contagious any such transition assuredly will not be rapid any more than any such tendency will easily predominate all of which would have carried me far from the simple sweetness of baltimore were it not that for the restless analyst there is no such thing as an unrelated fact no such thing as a break in the chain of relations many a perceived american aspect for that matter would by itself have little to give the student of manners in other words to make it presentable by which i understand to make it sufficiently interesting must first discover connections for it and then borrow from these if possible the elements of a wardrobe and though it should sound a little monstrous moreover one had somehow not been prepared for so delicate an effect of propriety since there are cases too indubitably in which propriety can show for almost as coarse as anything else it couldnt have been either that one had expected any positive air of licence but the fact was i suppose that for a constitutional storyseeker a certain still small shock a prompt need of readjustment of view was involved in ones finding the element of the bourgeois crop up so inveterately in latitudes generally associated so far as one knew them elsewhere with some perceptible sacrifice to the sway of the senses i had already at this date as i have noted dipped deep into our own uttermost south and had there had to reckon with that first slight disconcertment awaiting the observer whose southern categories happen to have been wholly european his simplest expression for the anomaly he meets is that he sees the citronic belt all incongruously protestantized that big word for so small a bewilderment perhaps sticks to him and worries him almost as absurdly i grant as if he had expected charleston and savannah to betray the moral accent of naples or seville he had not assuredly done this but he had as little allowed in imagination for the hyperborean note a south without churchfronts and churchinteriors had been superficially as strange in its way as a methodism of the subtropic night a methodism of the orange and the palm such were the treacheries of association though what indeed would observation be for interest if it were not just by these armed surprises constantly touched with adventure the beauty of baltimore was all this time that one could feel it as potentially harmonizing the citronic belt would not embrace here more methodism than might consort with it nor the methodism pretend to cultivate with any success the hibiscus and the pomegranate that i could entertain so many incoherent ideas in halfanhour was in any case a proof that i felt for the occasion left in possession quite as the visitor as yet unintroduced may feel during some long preliminary wait in a drawingroom he looks at the furniture pictures books he studies in these objects the character of the house and of his hosts and if there be some domestic treasure visibly more important and conspicuous than the others it engages his attention as either with a fatal or an engaging force the top of the central eminence with its air of an ample plan and of sweeping the rest of the circle figured the documentary parlour and my enjoyed leave to touch and examine so that when it was a question in particular of the monument to washington the high column in the middle with its surmounting figure and its spreading architectural base this presence was for all the world like that of some vast and stately oldfashioned clock a decorative piece an heirloom from generations now respectably remote occupying an inordinate space in proportion to the other conveniences the ornamental the important clock is apt to be in especial at such a crisis a telltale object its range of testimony of possible treachery is immense and cases are not unknown i gather in which it has put the doubting visitor to flight the greater the felicity thereby for the overtopping baltimore timepiece which hung about in mild reassurance promptly aware that it wasnt a bit vulgar but on the contrary of a pleasant jejune academic pomp that suggested to the fancy some melancholy some spectral manatarms mounting guard at the angles in due military form over suspected treasures of style one could imagine somehow under the summer stars the mystic vigil of these mild heroes and one could above all catch again the interesting hint of the terms on which in the united states the consecration of time may be found operating it has a trick there all of its own thanks to which the effect of duration is produced very much as before the footlights the prestidigitator produces the effect of extracting a live fowl from a hat this is a law under which the material permitting the decades count as centuries and the centuries as aeons the misfortune is that too often the material futile and treacherous doesnt permit yet the law is in the happiest cases none the less strikingly vindicated there for instance to pursue undiscouraged my figure of the guest in the empty parlour were the best houses the older the ampler the more blandly quadrilateral which in spite of their still faces met ones arrest at their commodious corners and other places of vantage with an unmistakable manner the quiet assurance of a position in the world the world the only one with which they were concerned testified again in an interesting way to the simple source of their impressiveness showing how almost any modern interval could have been long enough to make them nobly antique if such interval might only have been vulgar enough the age of brown stone was to have found no difficulty in that the prolongation of its rage for a quarter of a century amply sufficed to dignify every antecedent thing it had spared as the survivors of reigns of terror grow by mere survival distinguished while steeped in dishonour up to the eyebrows that is up to its false cornices of painted and sanded wood and iron it was never to enjoy for itself the advantage it elsewhere conferred nothing has ever been vulgar enough to rehabilitate the odd ugliness so distinct yet after all so undemonstrable of this luckless material the way one shuddered in particular at the touch on balustrade and elsewhere of the sanded iron it has been followed by other rages and other errors but even the grace of the american timemeasure can do nothing for it iii it was of course the fact that the values here were all such and such alone as might be reflected from the social conditions and the state of manners even if reflected for the hour almost into empty space it was this that gave weight to each perceived appearance and permitted none to show as trivial enough to project me in reaction or in inanition upon the comparative obviousness of the burnt district there is almost always a burnt district to eke out the interest of an american city it is the pride of the citizen and the resource of the visitor when all else fails and i can scarce i think praise baltimore so liberally as to note that this was the last of her beauties i was conscious of she had lost by fire a few months before the greater part of her business quarter which she was now rapidly and artfully calling back to existence but the entertainment she offered me was guiltless ever so gracefully and gallantly guiltless as it struck me of reference even indirect to the majesty either of ruin or of remedy one was on further acquaintance thoroughly beguiled but the burnt district had so little to do with it that the days came and went without my so much as discovering its whereabouts wonderful little baltimore in which whether when perched on a noble eminence or passing from one seat of the humanities one seat of hospitality to another a process mainly consisting indeed as it seemed to me of prompt drives through romantic parks and woodlands that were all suburban yet all arcadian i caught no glimpse of traffic however mild nor spied anything tall at the end of any vista this was in itself really a benediction since i had nowhere from the first been infatuated with tallness i was infatuated only with the question of manners in their largest sense to the finer essence of which tallness had already defined itself to me as positively abhorrent what occurred betimes and ever so happily was simply that the delicate blank of those first hours flushed into animation and that with this indeed the embroidery of the fine canvas turned thick and rich it came back again no doubt in the inveterate way to the university presence and to the eagerness with which on the american scene as i tire not you see of repeating the visiting spirit on such occasions throws itself straight into sanctuary it breaks in at any cost this distracted appetite and recomposing the elements to their greater distinction if need be and with a high imaginative hand makes of the combination obtained the only firm standpoint for the rest of the view it has even in this connection an occasional sharp chill airborne rumours reach it of perversities and treacheries conspiracies possibly hatching in the very bosom of the temple and against its very faith one hears of the university idea threatened in more than one of the great institutions reduced to some pettifogging conception of a short brisk term and a simplified culture a lively thrifty training for businesscompetition this is a blow to the collective fond fancies set humming at once in almost any scholastic shade under the effect of which one can but give ones own scant scholars hood while one winces a further protesting pull over abashed brows it would have been a question very much of what i call breakingin into the johns hopkins at this moment had i not here been indulged in all liberality with an impression the more charming in a manner for the fact of halls and courts brooding in vacation stillness perversely adorable always and i scarce know why the late afternoon light in deserted haunts of study with the secret of supreme dignity lurking above all in high dusky wainscoted chambers where the sound of ones footfall lingers to ones pleasure like a caress and where portraits of the appurtenant worthies the heroes and patrons grow vague in the twilight it is a tribute to the forces of idealism lurking again and again over the country in the amenity of the general collegiate appearance that the last thing these conditions overtly suggest or seem to accept as their imputed virtue is this precipitation of the young intelligence into the mere vociferous market i scarcely know why however i should have appeared even by waving it away to make room at our banquet for the possible skeleton of the false the barbarizing note since the natural pitch of baltimore the pictorial so to speak as well as the social struck me once a certain contact established as that of disinterested sensibility the passion of which her university is the highest and clearest example there was on the splendid sunday in particular a warm soft fusion of aspects a confusion in fact while i now gather it in which seems to defy though all unconsciously the sharper edge of discrimination and to offer itself insistently as a general wash of brave southern shade the play of a liquid brush of which the north knows nothing the episodes melt together yet they also under a little pressure come happily apart and over the large sunchequered picture the generous boughs hang heavy admirable i found them the maryland boughs and so immediately disposed about the fortunate town by parkside and lonely lane by trackless hillside and tangled copse that the depth of rural effect becomes at once bewildering you wonder at the absent transitions you look in vain for the shabby fringes or at least under my spell i did you have never seen on the lap of nature so large a burden so neatly accommodated baltimore sits there as some quite robust but almost unnaturally good child might sit on the green apron of its nurse with no concomitant crease or crumple no uncontrollable mess by the nursery term to betray its temper it was with something like that figure before me that i kept communing as i say with the bland presence even a morning hour or two at the great university hospital for ones experience of the higher tone ones irrepressible pursuit of charm in america has to its great enrichment these odd sequences even that beginning of the day did nothing to obtrude the ugly or to overemphasize the real it simply contributed under some perversion that i can neither explain nor defend to the general grace of the picture why should the great hospital with its endless chambers of woe its whole air as of most directly and advisedly facing as the hospitals of the world go the question of the immensities of pain why should such an impression actually have turned under the spell to fine poetry to a mere shining vision of the conditions the high beauty of applied science the conditions positively as i think of them after the interval make the poetry the large art above all by which in a place bristling with its terrible tale everything was made to seem fair and fairest even while it most intimately concurred in the work in short if the hospital was fundamentally universitarian as of the domain of the great medical faculty so it partook for me in its own way of the university glamour and so the tempered morning and the shaded splendour and the passive rows the grim human alignments that became in their cool vistas delicate symphonies in white and more even than anything else the pair of gallant young doctors who ruled for me so gently the whole still concert abide with me collectively as agents of the higher tone no example could speak more of that enlargement of function for constituting some picture of life which many an american element or object many an institution has to be felt as practising usually with high success it comes back one notes for the thousandth time to that redistribution and reconsecration of values of representative weight which it is the interesting thing over the land to see take effect to see in special take all the effect of which it is capable there are a thousand european values that are absent and whether as a consequence or not of that there are innumerable felt solutions of the social continuity the instinct of missing by which i mean not at all either the consciousness or the confession of lacking keeps up however its own activity for the theory at least of the native spirit is to consent wittingly to no privation it has a genius the native spirit for desiring things of the existence and even of the possibility of which it is actually unaware and it views the totality of nature and the general life of man i think as more than anything else commissioned and privileged to wait on these awakenings thus new values arise as expansion proceeds the marked character of which for comparative sociology is that they are not at all as other values what they count for is the particular required american quantity and we see again and again how large a quantity symbol and figure have to represent the interesting thing is that on the spot the representation does practically cover the ground it covers elements that in communities employing a different scale require for their expression and perhaps sometimes to an effect of waste a much greater number of terms hence the constant impression of elasticity and that of those pressures of necessity under which value and virtue character and quantity greatness and glory even to a considerable extent are imputed and projected there has to be a facility for the working of any social form facility of comparison and selection in some communities facility of rapid conversion in others that is where the american material is elastic where it affects one as a whole in the manner of some huge indiarubber cloth fashioned for field use and warranted to bear inordinate stretching one becomes aware thus wherever one turns both of the tension and of the resistance everything and everyone all objects and elements all systems arrangements institutions functions persons reputations give the sense of their pulling hard at the indiarubber almost always wonderfully without breaking it off yet never quite with the effect of causing it to lie thick the matter of interest however is just this fact that its thinness should so generally in some cases to all intents and purposes so richly suffice suffice that is for producing unaided impressions of a sort that make their way to us in europe through superimposed densities a thousand thicknesses of tradition which is what one means again by the differing values the thinness doing perforce on the one side much of the work done by the thickness on the other the work in particular of the appeal to the fond observer he is by his very nature committed everywhere to his impression which means essentially i think that he is foredoomed in one place as in another to put in a certain quantity of emotion and reflection the turn his sensibility takes depends of course on what is before him but when is it ever not in some manner exposed and alert if it be anything really of a touchstone it is more disposed i hold to easy bargains than to hard ones it only wants to be somehow interested and is not without the knowledge that an emotion is after all at the best or the worst but an emotion all of which is a voluminous commentary i admit on the modest text that i perhaps made the university hospital stand for too many things that establishes at all events my contention that the living fact in the united states will stand other facts not preventing for almost anything you may ask of it other facts at baltimore didnt prevent there being none outside the university circle of any perceptibly public any majestic or impressive or competitive order so it was as if this particular experience had been as the visitation of cities goes that of all present art and organization that of all antiquity history piety sociability that of the rich real and the rich romantic in fine at a stroke had there been more to see and to feel i should possibly have seen and felt more yet what was absent with this sense of feeling and seeing so much iv there were other facts in abundance i hasten to add only they were not as i say competitive not of the public or majestic order so that they the less imposed for appreciation any rearrangement of values they were a matter still of the famous the felicitous sunday into which as into an armful of the biggest and bravest june roses i seemed to find my perceptions cluster foremost among these meanwhile was that of the plentiful presence freshly recognized of absolute values too which offer themselves in the midst of the others with a sharpness of their own and which owe nothing for interest to any question of the general scale the country club for instance as i have already had occasion to note is everywhere a clear american felicity a complete product of the social soil and air which alone have made it possible and wearing whenever met that assured face of the fullblown flower and the proved proposition these institutions speak so of american life as a success that they affected me at moments as crying aloud to be commemorated since it is on american life only that they are founded and since they render it to my mind the good office of making it keep all its graces and of having caused it to shed by the same stroke the elements that are contrary to these nothing is more suggestive than to recognize each time on the premises the thing that wouldnt do in europe for a judgment of the reasons of its doing so well in the one hemisphere and so ill in the other promptly becomes illuminating the illumination is one at which had i space i should have liked to light here a candle or two partaking indeed by that character of a like baffled virtue in many another group of social phenomena the country club testifies in short and gives its evidence from the box with the inimitable invaluable accent of american authority it becomes for the restless analyst one of the great gardenlamps in which the flame of democracy burns whitest and steadiest and most floods the subject taking its place thus on the positive side of a line which has its other side overscored with negatives i may seem too much to brood upon it but the interest of the american scene being beyond any other the show on so immense a scale of what democracy pushing and breaking the ice like an arctic explorer is making of things any scrap that contributes to it wears a part of its dignity to have been beforehand with the experiments with several rather risky ones at least and to have got on with these so beautifully while other rueful nations prowl in the dusk inquisitive but apprehensive round the red windows of the laboratory peeping for the last news between each others shoulders all this is for the democratic force to have stolen a march over no little of the ground and to have gained time on such a scale as perhaps to make the belated of the earth the critical group at the windows still live to think of themselves as having too much wasted it there had been one i mean a blest country club in the neighbourhood of boston where indeed i believe there were a dozen at least as exemplary out of my range there had been another quite marvellous on the hudson one of a numerous array probably within an hours run of new york there had been a supreme specimen supreme for a documentary worth even at charleston i reserve to myself to explain in due course and ah in such an exquisite sense my even this had made for me if you will a short list but it had made a long admonition to which the embowered institution near baltimore was to add a wonderful emphasis an admonition of what it will meanwhile be asked to which the answer may perhaps for the moment not be more precipitate than by ones saying that with any feeling for american life you soon enough see you see its most complete attestation of its believing in itself unlimitedly and also of its being right about itself at more points than it is wrong you see it apply its general theory of its nature and strength much of this doubtless quite an unconscious one with a completeness and a consistency that will strike you also or that ought to as constituting an unconscious heroism you will see it accept in detail with a sublime serenity certain large social consequences the consequences of the straight application in the most delicate conditions of the prime democratic idea as this idea is that of an universal eligibility so you see it under the application beautifully resist the strain so you see in a word everything staked on the conception of the young family as a clear social unit which when all is said and done remains roundabout you the ubiquitous fact the conception of the family is goodness knows european enough but the difference resides in its working on one side of the world in the vertical and on the other in the horizontal sense if its identity in europe that is resides more especially in its perpendicular its backward and forward extension its ascent and descent of the long ladder of time so it develops in the united states mainly by its lateral spread as one may say expressing itself thus rather by number than by name and yet taking itself for granted when one comes to compare with an intensity to which mere virtue of name elsewhere scarce helps it american manners as they stand register therefore the apotheosis of the family a truth for which they have by no means received due credit and it is in the light of country clubs that all this becomes vivid these organizations accept the family as the social unit accept its extension its whole extension through social space and accept it as many times over as the question comes up which is what one means by their sublime and successful consistency no if i may still insist nothing anywhere accepts anything as the american country club accepts these whole extensions that is why i speak of it as accepting the universal eligibility with no palpable result does the democratic idea in the states more bristle than with the view that the younger are as good as the elder family life is in fact as from child to parent from sister to brother from wife to husband from employed to employer the eminent field of the democratic demonstration this then is the unit that with its latent multiplications the country club takes over and it is easy to see how such units must multiply this is the material to which it addresses with such effect the secret of its power i may of course be asked what i mean by an eligibility that is universal but it seems needless to remark that even the most inclusive social scheme must in a large community always stop somewhere distinctly diverting often to americans the bewilderment of the european mind on the subject of differences and of the practicability of precautions for maintaining these so beset is that mind to the american view with this theory this habit or need of precautions and so disposed apparently to fear in its anxiety that without the precautions the differences dreadful thought may cease the american theory is i think but vague and the inevitable consciousness of differences reduced to a matter of practice a matter which on the whole very much takes care of itself glimpses and revelations come to it across the sea on the great wave of modern publicity images of a social order in which the precautions as from above to below are more striking than the differences and thereby out of proportion to them an appearance that reads a lesson of a sort as to leaving precautions alone it is true at any rate that no application of the aristocratic none of the democratic idea is ever practically complete discriminations are produced by the mere working of the machine and they so engage alike almost every ones interest meet alike almost every ones convenience nature and industry keep producing differences as fast as constitutions keep proclaiming equality and there are always at the best in any really liberal scheme or human view more conscious inaptitudes to convince of their privilege than conscious possibilities to remind of their limits all of which reflections however i agree would probably have remained a little dim even for the restless analyst had not the most shining of his examples bathed the subject to his eyes in radiance this could only be as i have intimated that of the bright institution on the hudson as halfanhours vision of it one splendid sunday of the maytime put it before me all in terms so eloquent that i would fain have translated them on the spot for there to every appearance was the high perfection of the type the ample spreading galleried house hanging over the great river with its beautiful largeness of provision for associated pleasures the american note was there in the intensity and continuity of the association and the interest of the case was in its thus enjoying for the effect all the advantages that experience chastening experience and taste real taste could heap upon it somewhere in ones mind doubtless lurked the apprehension that such a proposition might in that emphatic form have betrayed a thousand flaws whereas all one could say face to face with it treading its great verandahs and conversationrooms its halls of refreshment repose and exercise its kitchens and its courts and its baths and its gardens its wondrous inside and outside palaestra was that it positively revealed new forms of felicity it was thus a new and original thing rare phenomenon and actually an important one for what did it represent all discriminations made and recognized but the active family as a final social fact or in other words the sovereign people as a pervasive and penetrative mass doing themselves on unprecedented lines they had invoked certainly high and congruous countenance but vain i thought the objection made when i exclaimed to a friend on these marvels it depends upon whom i call the people of course it depends so i call them exactly the groups and figures we see here before us enjoying and enjoying both so expertly and so discreetly these conveniences and luxuries thats their interest that they are the people for what interest under the sun would they have if they werent they are the people arrived and what is more disembarked thats all the difference it seems a difference because elsewhere in europe say again though we see them begin at the very most to arrive socially we yet practically see them still on the ship we have never yet seen them disembark thus en masse this is the effect they have when all impediments and objections on the dock removed they do that and later on at the afternoons end on the platform of the large agreeable riverside station which spread there close at hand as the appanage of the club itself i could but call attention to the manner in which every impression reinforced my moral the families the parties the groups and couples the element of the individual as distinguished from that of the family being remarkably absent had gathered in the soft eventide for the return to new york and it was impossible not to read each sign of the show in the vivid popular light only one did so and this was the great point with a positive uplifting of the spirit everything hung together and every one was charming it was my explanatory word therefore to my companion thats what the people are when theyve disembarked having said so much and with the sense strange as it may appear that there would still be much to say i must add that i suddenly seem to see consternation in the charming face of the establishment deep in the baltimore countryside my impression of which was to lay a train for these reflections so that with a conscience less clear i might take the image as a warning against the vice of reading too much meaning into simple intentions therefore let me admit that the conscious purpose of this house of hospitality didnt look beyond the immediate effect of luncheon or dinner on one of its deep southern verandahs with great trees close at hand flinging their shade with the old garden of the old country home that the club had inherited forming one prospect and with a deep woodland valley streamhaunted if i am not mistaken giving breadth of style to another the maryland boughs for that matter creating in the upper air great classic serenities of shade give breadth of style and the restless analyst all grateful and truly for the nonce at rest could but ruefully note how little they had borrowed from any northern and least of all from any new england model their almost academic grace they might have borrowed it straight from faraway claudes and turners yet one made no point of that either their interest was so sufficiently their own distances of view have often in the north the large elegance but nearnesses almost never these are at their worst constitutionally coarse and at their best merely wellmeaning i was to find food all day for that observation i was to remain under a charm of which breadth of style was the key earth and air between them had taken it in hand so that one was always moving somehow under arches that were triumphal or sitting in bowers that made one think of temples it was not that man or that art had done much though indeed they had incurred no shame and had even been capable of a masterpiece seen in the waning light of which i shall presently speak it was the diffused mitigated glow the happy medium itself that continued to be meanwhile half the picture i wandered through it from one impression to another and i keep with intensity that of the admirable outlying park treasure of the town through which i had already three or four times driven but the holiday life of which on the warm sunday night humming languidly under the stars as with spent voices of the homewardbound attested more than ever its valuable function that must have been in the whole pleasant incoherence on my way back from the sweet old carroll house climax of an afternoon drive yet before another an ultimate visit which was the climax of everything i have sufficiently noted already the charming law under which in the states any approach to really ripe architectural charm for the real ripeness is indispensable enjoys advantages those of mystery and sanctity that are achieved in europe but on greatly harder terms the observed practice of this art at times singularly subtle is in fact half the reward of ones attention puzzled though the latter may none the less be to see how the trick is played so much at any rate one remembers yet where after all would the sweet old carroll house nestling under its wood in the late june afternoon and with something vaguely haunted in its lonely refinement not have made an insidious appeal there are sweet old carroll houses i believe on several other sites the luckiest form perhaps in which a flourishing family may have been moved to write its annals the intimation of annals hangs about the place and again we try to capture under the charming pillared portico before the mild red brick and the pale pediment and facings in the series of high chambers quite instinct with style small faroff cousins of such apartments say as those of kensington palace though they cover bungalowfashion scarce more than one floor some lingering living accents of such a profession of history we capture verily i think nothing we merely project a little from one room and from one mild aspect of the void to another our old habit of suppositions bred of other historic contacts it instinctively puts forth feelers but the feelers drop after a little like hands that meet nothing our suppositions themselves as i have called them and which but return to us like toy ships that wont sail are all they find tangible there is satisfaction of a sort however even in such arrested questions when as before this delicate faintlyresonant shell each other element also helping they have been vividly enough suggested later on for the real crown of my day no wonderments were checked and no satisfactions imperfect attained for the high finish of the evening by another plunge behind vaguelyplaying carriagelamps into the bosky odorous quite ridiculouslyromantic suburban night this was the case of an ancient home without lapses or breaks where the past and the present were in friendliest fusion so that the waiting future evidently slumbered with confidence and where above the easy openair southern hospitality an impression now of shafts of mild candlelight across overlaced outer galleries and of throbs of natures voice in the dark vaster circle the maryland boughs at their best presided in the unforgettable grand manner xi washington i i was twice in washington the first time for a winter visit the second to meet the wonderful advance of summer to which in that climate of many charms the first days of may open wide the gates this latter impression was perforce much the more briefly taken yet though i had gathered also from other past occasions faraway years now something of the sense of the place at the earlier season i find everything washed over at the mention of the name by the rare light half green half golden of the lovely leafy moment i see all the rest till i make the effort to break the spell through that voluminous veil which operates for memory quite as the explosion of spring works even to the near vision in respect to the american scene at large dressing it up as if for company preparing it for social for human intercourse making it in fine publicly presentable with an energy of renewal and an effect of redemption not often to be noted i imagine on other continents nowhere truly can summer have such work cut out for it as here nowhere has it to take upon itself to repaint the picture so completely in the european landscape in general some at least of the elements and objects remain upon the canvas here on the other hand one seems to see intending nature the great artist of the season decline to touch that surface unless it be first swept clean decline at any rate to deal with it save by ignoring all its perceived pretensions vernal nature in england in france in italy has still a use often a charmed or amused indulgence for the material in hand the furniture of the foreground the near and middle distances the heterogeneous human features of the face of the land she looks at her subject much as the portraitpainter looks at the personal properties this or that household object the official uniform the badges and ornaments the favourite dress of his sitter with an oh yes i can bring them in theyre just what i want and i see how they will help me out but i try in vain to recall a case in which either during the new england may and june or during those of the middle states since these groups of weeks have in the two regions a differing identity and value the genius in question struck me as adopting with any frankness as doing more than passively helplessly accept the supplied paraphernalia the signs of existing life the business is clearly to get rid of them as far as may be to cover and smother them dissimulating with the biggest freest brush their impertinence and their ugliness i must ask myself i meanwhile recognize none the less why i should have found mount vernon exquisite the first of may if the interest had all to be accounted for in the light of nature the light of nature was there splendid and serene the potomac opened out in its grandest manner the bluff above the river before the sweep of its horizon raised its head for the historic crown but it was not for a moment to be said that this was the whole story the human interest and the human charm lay in wait and held one fast so that if one had been making light elsewhere of their suggestion and office one had at least this case seriously to reckon with i speak straightway thus of mount vernon though it be but an outlying feature of washington and at the best a minor impression the image of the particular occasion is seated so softly in my path there was a glamour in fine for the excursion that of an extraordinarily gracious hospitality and the glamour would still have been great even if i had not on my return to the shadow of the capitol found the whole place transfigured the season was over the president away the two houses up the shutters closed the visitor rare and one lost ones way in the great green vistas of the avenues quite as one might have lost it in a sylvan solitude that is in the empty alleys of a park the emptiness was qualified at the most here and there by some encounter with a stray diplomatic agent wreathed for the most part in sincerer smiles than we are wont to attribute to his class this it was the meaning of these inflections was the real washington a place of enchantment so that if the enchantment were never less who could ever bring himself to go away the enchantment had been so much less in january one could easily understand yet the recognition seemed truly the voice of the hour and one picked it up with a patriotic flutter not diminished by the fact that the speaker would probably be going away and with delight on the morrow the memory of some of the smiles and inflections comes back in that light washington being the one place in america i think where those qualities are the values and vehicles the medium of exchange no small part of the interest of the social scene there consists inevitably for any restless analyst in wonder about the real sentiments of appointed foreign participants the delegates of powers and pledged alike to penetration and to discretion before phenomena which whatever they may be differ more from the phenomena of other capitals and other societies than they resemble them this interest is susceptible on occasion of becoming intense all the more that curiosity must for the most part pursue its object that of truly looking over the alien shoulder and of seeing judging building fearing reporting with the alien sense by subtle and tortuous ways this represents first and last even for a watcher abjectly irresponsible a good deal of speculative tension so that ones case is refreshing in presence of the clear candour of such a proposition as that the national capital is charming in proportion as you dont see it for that is what it came to in the bowery condition the as yet unsurmounted bourgeois character of the whole was screened and disguised the dressingup in other words was complete and the great parkaspect gained and became nobly artificial by the very complexity of the plan of the place the perpetual perspectives the converging radiating avenues the frequent circles and crossways where all that was wanted for full illusion was that the bronze generals and admirals on their named pedestals should have been great gardengods mossy mythological marble this would have been the perfect note the long vistas yearned for it and the golden chequers scattered through the gaps of the high arches waited for some bending nymph or some armless hermes to pick them up the power of the scene to evoke such visions sufficiently shows i think what had become under the mercy of nature of the hard facts as one must everywhere call them and yet though i could diplomatically patriotically pretend at the right moment that such a washington was the real one my assent had all the while a still finer meaning for myself i am hanging back however as with a sacred terror from mount vernon where indeed i may not much linger or only enough to appear not to have shirked the responsibility incurred at the opening of these remarks there in ample possession was masking dissimulating summer the envelope and disguise to which i have hinted that the american picture owes on its human side all its best presentability and at the same time unmistakably there was the spell as quite a distinct matter of the hard little facts in themselves how came it that if they could throw a spell they were yet so abject and so negligible how came it that if they had no intrinsic sweetness no visible dignity they could yet play their part in so unforgettable an impression the answer to this can only be i think that we happen here to strike as they say one of the rarest of cases a spot on which all sorts of sensibilities are touched and on which a lively emotion and one yet other than the aesthetic makes us its prey the old highplaced house unquestionably is charming and the felicity of the whole scene on such a day as that of my impression scarce to be uttered the little hard facts facts of form of substance of scale facts of essential humility and exiguity none the less look us straight in the face present themselves literally to be counted over and reduce us thereby to the recognition of our supreme example of the rich interference of association association does at mount vernon simply what it likes with us it is of so beautiful and noble a sort and to this end it begins by making us unfit to say whether or no we would in its absence have noticed the house for any material grace at all we scarce care more for its being proved picturesque the house than for its being proved plain its architectural interest and architectural nullity become one and the same thing for us if asked what we should think of it if it hadnt been or if we hadnt known it for washingtons we retort that the inquiry is inane since it is not the possessive case but the straight serene nominative that we are dealing with the whole thing is washington not his invention and his property but his presence and his person with discriminations as distinguished from enthusiasms as invidious and unthinkable as if they were addressed to his very ears the great soft fact as opposed to the little hard ones is the beauty of the site itself that is definitely if ever so delicately sublime but it fails to rank among the artificial items that i began by speaking of those of so generally compromising an effect in the american picture everything else is communicated importance and the magic so wrought for the american sensibility by which i mean the degree of the importance and the sustained high pitch of the charm place it doubtless the world over among the few supreme triumphs of such communication the beauty of the site meanwhile as we stand there becomes but the final aspect of the man under which everything conduces to a single great representative image under which every feature of the scene every object in the house however trivial borrows from it and profits by it the image is the largest clearest possible of the resting as distinguished from the restless consciousness of public service consummately rendered the terms we commonly use for that condition peace with honour wellearned repose enjoyment of homage recognition of facts render but dimly the luminous stillness in which on its commanding eminence we see our image bathed it hangs together with the whole bright immensity of air and view it becomes truly the great white decent page on which the whole sense of the place is written it does more things even besides attends us while we move about and goes with us from room to room mounts with us the narrow stairs to stand with us in these small chambers and look out of the low windows takes up for us to turn them over with spiritual hands the objects from which we respectfully forbear and places an accent in short through the rambling old phrase wherever an accent is required thus we arrive at the full meaning as it were thus we know at least why we are so moved it is for the same reason for which we are always inordinately moved on american ground i think when the unconscious minor scale of the little old demonstrations to which we owe everything is made visible to us when their disproportionate modesty is proved upon them the reason worked at mount vernon for the restless analyst quite as it had worked a few months before on the small and simple scene of concord fight the slight pale bleeding past in a patched homespun suit stands there taking the thanks of the bloated present having woundedly rescued from thieves and brought to his door the fat locked pocketbook of which that personage appears the owner the pocketbook contains unbeknown to the honest youth banknotes of incredible figure and what breaks our heart if we be cursed with the historic imagination is the grateful wan smile with which the great guerdon of sixpence is received i risk floridly the assertion that half the intensity of the impression of mount vernon for many a visitor will ever be in this vision there of washington only so far as consciously so rewarded such fantastications i indeed admit are refinements of response to any impression but the ground had been cleared for them and it ministered to luxury of thought for instance that we were a small party at our ease there with no other circulation with the prowling ghosts of fellowpilgrims too harshly present on my previous occasion all conveniently laid this alone represented privilege and power and they in turn with their pomp and circumstance of a charming government launch under official attendance at the navyyard steps amid those large clean protecting and protected properties of the state which always make one think much of the state whatever its actual infirmities these things to say nothing of other rich enhancements above all those that i may least specify flung over the day i scarce know what iridescent reflection of the starspangled banner itself in the folds of which i had never come so near the sense of being positively wrapped that consciousness so unfamiliar was under the test irresistible it pressed the spring absolutely of intellectual exaltation with the consequent loud resonance that my account of my impressions doubtless sufficiently translates ii washington itself meanwhile the washington always i premise of the rank outsider had struck me from the first as presenting two distinct faces the more obvious of which was the public and official the monumental with features all more or less majestically playing the great administrative or as we nowadays put it imperial part this clustered yet at the same time oddly scattered city a general impression of high granite steps of light grey corniced colonnades rather harmoniously low contending for effect with slaty mansard roofs and masses of iron excrescence a general impression of somewhat vague empty sketchy fundamentals however expectant however spacious overweighted by a single dome and overaccented by a single shaft this loose congregation of values seemed strangely a matter disconnected and remote though remaining in its way portentous and bristling all incoherently at the back of the scene the back of the scene indeed to ones quite primary sense might have been but an immense painted yet unfinished cloth hung there to a confessedly provisional end and marked with the queerness among many queernesses of looking always the same painted once for all in clear bright fresh tones but never emerging from its flatness after the fashion of other capitals into the truly the variously modelled and rounded state it appeared provisional therefore because looking as if it might have been unhooked and removed as a whole because any one object in it so treated would have made the rest also come off the foreground was a different thing a thing that ever so quaintly seemed to represent the force really in possession though consisting but of a small company of people engaged perpetually in conversation and always i repeat for the rank outsider singularly destitute of conspicuous marks or badges this little society easily became for the detached visitor the city itself the national capital and the greater part of the story and that ever in spite of the comparatively scant intensity of its political permeation the political echo was of course to be heard in it and the public character in his higher forms to be encountered though only in single spies not in battalions but there was something that made it much more individual than any mere predominance of political or administrative colour would have made it leaving it in that case to do no more than resemble the best society in london or that in best possession of the field in paris two sharp signs my remoter remembrance had shown me the then washington world and the first met as putting forth one of these the fact of its being extraordinarily easy and pleasant and the other that of ones appearing to make out in it not more than halfadozen members of the lower house and not more than a dozen of the upper this kept down the political permeation and was bewildering if one was able to compare in the light of the different london condition the fact of the social ubiquity there of the acceptable mp and that of the social frequency even of his more equivocal hereditary colleague a london nestling under the towers of westminster yet practically void of members of the house of commons and with the note of official life far from exclusively sounding that might have been in those days the odd image of washington had not the picture been stamped with other variations still these were a whole cluster not instantly to be made out but constituting the unity of the place as soon as perceived representing that finer extract or essence which the selfrespecting observer is never easy till he be able to shake up and down in bottled form the charming company of the foreground then which referred itself so little to the sketchy backscene the monstrous dome and shaft figments of the upper air the pale colonnades and mere myriadwindowed buildings was the second of the two faces and the more one lived with it the more up to a certain point one lived away from the first in time and after perceiving how it was what it so agreeably was came the recognition of common ground the recognition that in spite of strange passages of the national life liable possibly to recur during which the president himself was scarce thought to be in society the particular precious character that one had apprehended could never have ripened without a general consensus one had put ones finger on it when one had seen disengage itself from many anomalies from not a few drolleries the superior the quite majestic fact of the city of conversation pure and simple and positively of the only specimen of any such intensity in the world that had remained for me from the other time the properest name of washington and nothing could so interest me on a renewal of acquaintance too long postponed and then too woefully brief as to find my description wholly justified if the emphasis added by pure and simple be invariably retained the description will continue i think to embrace and exhaust the spectacle while yet leaving it every inch of its value clearly quite immeasurable on american ground the value of such an assertion of a towntype directly opposed to the unvarying american and quite unique on any ground so organized a social indifference to the vulgar vociferous market washington may of course know more than she confesses no community could perhaps really be as ignorant as washington used at any rate to look and to like to look of this particular thing of goods and shares and rises and falls and all such sordidities but she knows assuredly still the very least she can get off with and nothing even yet pleases her more than to forget what she does know she unlearns she turns her back while london paris berlin rome in their character of political centres strike us as on the contrary feverishly learning trying more and more to do the exact opposite i speak naturally as to washington of knowing actively and interestedly in the spirit of gain not merely of the enjoyed lights of political and administrative science doubtless as abundant there as anywhere else it might fairly have been i used to think that the charming place charming in the particular connection i speak of had on its conscience to make one forget for an hour the colossal greed of new york nothing in fact added more to its charm than its appearing virtually to invite one to impute to it some such vicarious compunction if i be reminded indeed that the distinction i here glance at is negative and be asked what then if she knew nothing of the great american interest washington did socially know my answer i recognize has at once to narrow itself and becomes perhaps truly the least bit difficult to utter it none the less remains distinct enough that the city of conversation being only in question and a general subject of all the conversation having thereby to be predicated our responsibility is met as soon as we are able to say what washington mainly talks and appears always to go mainly talking about washington talks about herself and about almost nothing else falling superficially indeed on that ground but into line with the other capitals london paris berlin rome goodness knows talk about themselves that is each member of this sisterhood talks sufficiently or inordinately of the great number of divided and differing selves that form together her controlling identity london for instance talks of everything in the world without thereby for a moment as it were ceasing to be egotistical it has taken everything in the world to make london up so that she is in consequence simply doomed never to get away from herself her conversation is largely i think the very effort to do that but she inevitably figures in it but as some big buzzing insect which keeps bumping against a treacherous mirror it is in positive quest of an identity of some sort much rather an identity other than merely functional and technical that washington goes forth encumbered with no ideal of avoidance or escape it is about herself as the city of conversation precisely that she incessantly converses adorning the topic moreover with endless ingenuity and humour but that absolutely remains the case which thus becomes one of the most thorough even if probably one of the most natural and of the happiest cases of collective selfconsciousness that one knows the spectacle as it at first met my senses was that of a numerous community in ardent pursuit of some workable conception of its social self and trying meanwhile intelligently to talk itself and even this very embarrassment into a subject for conversation such a picture might not seem purely pleasing on the side of variety of appeal and i admit one may have had ones reserves about it reserves sometimes reflected for example in dim inward speculation one of the effects of the washington air i have already glanced at as to the amount of response it might evoke in the diplomatic body it may have been on my part a morbid obsession but the diplomatic body was liable to strike one there as more characteristically abysmal than elsewhere more impenetrably bland and inscrutably blank and it was obvious certainly that their concern to help the place intellectually to find itself was not to be expected to approach in intensity the concern even of a repatriated absentee you were concerned only if you had by your sensibility a stake in the game which was the last thing a foreign representative would wish to confess to this being directly opposed to all his enjoined duties it is no part of the office of such personages to assist the societies to which they are accredited to find themselves it is much more their mission to leave all such vaguely and so far as may he grotesquely groping so apt are societies in finding themselves to find other things too this detachment from the whole mild convulsion of effort the considerate pretence of not being too aware of it combined with latent probabilities of alarm about it no less than of amusement represented to the unquiet fancy much more the spirit of the oldtime legations what was at all events better fun of the finer sort than having ones self a stake in the outcome what helped the time so much of it as there was more to pass than just to join in the so fresh experiment of constitutive creative talk the boon it should always be mentioned meanwhile went on not in the least in the tone of solemnity that would have been fatal because probably irritating and it was where the good star of washington intervened the tone was so to speak of conscious selfconsciousness and the highest genius for conversation doubtless dwelt in the fact that the ironic spirit was ready always to give its very self away fifty times over for the love or for any quickening of the theme the foundation for the whole happy predicament remained moreover of the firmest and the essence of the case was to be as easily stated as the great social fact is in america whether through exceptions or aggravations everywhere to be stated nobody was in business that was the sum and substance of it and for the one large human assemblage on the continent of which this was true the difference made was huge nothing could strike one more than that it was the only way in which over the land a difference could be made and than how in our vast commercial democracy almost any difference by which i mean almost any exception promptly acquires prodigious relief the value here was at once that the place could offer to view a society the only one in the country in which men existed and that that rich little fact became the key to everything superficially taken i recognize the circumstance fails to look portentous but it looms large immediately gains the widest bearing in the light of any direct or extended acquaintance with american conditions from the moment it is adequately borne in mind that the businessman in the united states may with no matter what dim struggles gropings yearnings never hope to be anything but a businessman the size of the field he so abdicates is measured as well as the fact of the other care to which his abdication hands it over it lies there waiting pleading from all its pores to be occupied the lonely waste the boundless gaping void of society which is but a rough name for all the other so numerous relations with the world he lives in that are imputable to the civilized being here it is then that the world he lives in accepts its doom and becomes by his default subject and plastic to his mate his default having made all around him the unexampled opportunity of the woman which she would have been an incredible fool not to pounce upon it needs little contact with american life to perceive how she has pounced and how outside business she has made it over in her image she has been up to now on the vast residual tract in peerless possession and is occupied in developing and extending her wonderful conquest which she appreciates to the last inch of its extent iii she has meanwhile probably her hours of amazement at the size of her windfall she cannot quite live without wonder at the oddity of her so sleeping partner the strange creature by her side with his values and his voids but who is best known to her as having yielded what she would have clutched to the death yet these are mere mystic inscrutable possibilities dreams for us of her hushed shrouded hours the face she shows on all the facts is that of mere unwinking tribute to the matter of course the effect of these high signs of assurance in her has been and it is really her masterstroke to represent the situation as perfectly normal her companions attitude totally destitute of high signs does everything it can to further this feat so that as disposed together in the american picture they testify extraordinarily to the successful rupture of a universal law the sight is at first for observation most mystifying then the impunity of the whole thing gains upon us the equilibrium strikes us however strangely as at least provisionally stable we see that a society in many respects workable would seem to have been arrived at and that we shall in any case have time to study it the phenomenon may easily become for a spectator the sentence written largest in the american sky when he is in search of the characteristic what else so plays the part the woman is twothirds of the apparent life which means that she is absolutely all of the social and as this is nowhere else the case the occasion is unique for seeing what such a situation may make of her the result elsewhere in europe generally of conditions in which men have actively participated and to which throughout they personally contribute she has only the old story to tell and keeps telling it after her fashion the woman produced by a womenmade society alone has obviously quite a new story to which it is not for a moment to be gainsaid that the world at large has for the last thirty years in particular found itself lending an attentive at times even a charmed ear the extent and variety of this attention have been the specious measure of the personal success of the type in question and are always referred to when its value happens to be challenged the american woman why she has beguiled she has conquered the globe look at her fortune everywhere and fail to accept her if you can she has been accordingly about the globe beyond all doubt a huge success of curiosity she has at her best and far beyond any consciousness and intention of her own lively as these for the most part usually are infinitely amused the nations it has been found among them that for more reasons than we can now go into her manner of embodying and representing her sex has fairly made of her a new human convenience not unlike fifty of the others of a slightly different order the ingenious mechanical appliances stoves refrigerators sewingmachines typewriters cashregisters that have done so much in the household and the place of business for the american name by which i am of course far from meaning that the revelation has been of her utility as a domestic drudge it has been much rather in the fact that the advantages attached to her being a woman at all have been so happily combined with the absence of the drawbacks for persons intimately dealing with her traditionally suggested by that condition the corresponding advantages in the light of almost any old order have always seemed inevitably paid for by the drawbacks but here unmistakably was a case in which as at first appeared certainly they were to be enjoyed very nearly for nothing what it came to evidently was that she had been grown in an air in which a hundred of the european complications and dangers didnt exist and in which also she had had to take upon herself a certain training for freedom it was not that she had had in the vulgar sense to look out for herself inasmuch as it was of the very essence of her position not to be threatened or waylaid but that she could develop her audacity on the basis of her security just as she could develop her powers in a medium from which criticism was consistently absent thus she arrived fullblown on the general scene the least criticized object in proportion to her importance that had ever adorned it it would take long to say why her situation under this retrospect may affect the inner fibre of the critic himself as one of the most touching on record he may merely note his perception that she was to have been after all but the sport of fate for why need she originally he wonders have embraced so confidently so gleefully yet so unguardedly the terms offered her to an end practically so perfidious why need she unless in the interest of her eventual discipline have turned away with so light a heart after watching the man the deep american man retire into his tent and let down the flap she had her paper from him their agreement signed and sealed but would she not in some other air and under some other sky have been visited by a saving instinct would she not have said no this is too unnatural there must be a trap in it somewhere its addressed really in the long run to making a fool of me it is impossible of course to tell and her case as it stands for us at any rate is that she showed no doubts it is not on the american scene and in the presence of mere american phenomena that she is even yet to be observed as showing them but does not my digression find itself meanwhile justified by the almost clear certainty that the first symptoms of the revulsion of the convulsion i am tempted to say must break out in washington for here and it is what i have been so long in coming to here alone in the american world do we catch the other sex not observing the agreement i have described this anomaly at washington as that of mans socially existing since we have seen that his fidelity to his compact throughout the country in general has involved his not doing so what has happened obviously has been that his reasons at a stroke have dropped and that he finds himself without them a different creature he has discovered that he can exist in other connections than that of the market and that all he has therefore to settle is the question of whether he may the most delicate interest of washington is the fact that it is quite practically being settled there in the practical way which is yet also the dramatic solvitur ambulando it is being settled that is the charm as it goes settled without discussion it would be awkward and gross to say that man has dealt any conscious blow at the monopoly of his companion or that her prestige as mistress of the situation has suffered in any manner a noted abatement yet none the less as he has there in a degree socially found himself and allured by the new sense is evidently destined to seek much further still the sensible effect the change of impression on ones coming from other places is of the most marked man is solidly vividly present and the presence of woman has consequently for the proposed intensity to reckon with it the omens on behalf of the former appearance are just now strikingly enhanced as happens by the accident of the rare quality as it were of the particular male presence supremely presiding there and it would certainly be strange that this idea of the recommittal to masculine hands of some share at least in the interests of civilization some part of the social property and social office should not from so high an example have received a new impulse and a new consecration easily enough if we had space here to consider it might come up the whole picture of the new indications thus afforded the question of the degree in which a sex capable in the american air of having so despoiled itself may really be capable of retracing its steps and repairing its mistake it would appear inevitable to ask whether such a mistake on such a scale can prove effectively reparable whether ground so lost can be effectively recovered has not the american woman with such a start gained such an irreducible advance on the whole high plane of the amenities that her companion will never catch up with her this last is an inquiry that i must alas brush aside though feeling it as i have already noted the most oddly interesting that the american spectacle proposes to us only saying provisionally that the aspect of manners through the nation at large offers no warrant whatever for any prompt no to it it is not however of the nation at large i here speak the case is of the extremely small though important and significant fraction of the whole represented by the washington group which thus shows us the expropriated half in the very act of itself pondering that issue is the man up to it up to the major heritage the man who could originally so inconceivably and for a mere mess of pottage if there ever was one let it go are we up to it really at this time of day and what on earth will awfully become of us if the question once put to the test shall have to be decided against us i think it not merely fanciful to say that some dim distressful interrogative sound of that sort frequently reached in the washington air the restless analyst though not to any quickening of his own fear with a perfect consciousness that it was still early to say that the data are as yet insufficient and that the missing quantity must absolutely be found before it can be weighed and valued he was none the less struck with the felicity of many symptoms and would fairly have been able to believe at moments that the character hitherto so effaced has but to show the confidence of taking itself for granted that act of itself reveals restores reinstates and completes this character is it not for that matter essentially implied in our recognition of the place as the city of conversation the victim of effacement the outcast at the door has all the while we have been talking of him talked himself back and if anything could add to this happy portent it would be another that had scarcely less bearing nowhere more than in washington positively were the women to have struck me as naturally and harmoniously in the social picture as happily soothingly proportionately and no more than proportionately participant and ministrant hence the irresistible conclusion that with the way really shown them they would only ask to take it the way being their assent to the truth that the abdication of the man proves ever after the first flush of their triumph as bad really for their function as for his hence in fine the appearance that with the proportions reestablished they will come to recognize their past world as a fools paradise and their present and still more their future as much more made to endure they could not one reasoned have been in general so perfectly agreeable unless they had been pleased and they could not have been pleased without the prospect of gaining by the readjusted relation more on the whole than they were to lose without the prospect even again perhaps of truly and insidiously gaining more than the other beneficiary that would be i think the feminine conception of a readministered justice washington at such a rate in any case might become to them as good as europe and a europe of their own would obviously be better than a europe of other peoples there are after all other women on the other continents iv one might have been sure in advance that the character of a democracy would nowhere more sharply mark itself than in the democratic substitute for a court city and washington is cast in the mould that expresses most the absence of salient social landmarks and constituted features here it is that conversation as the only invoked presence betrays a little its inadequacy to the furnishing forth all by itself of an outward view it tells us it must be there since in all the wide empty vistas nothing else is and the general elimination can but have left it a pleading touching effect indeed lurks in this sense of it as seated at receipt of custom by any decent door of any decent domicile and watching the vacancy for reminder and appeal it is left to conversation alone to people the scene with accents putting aside two or three objects to be specified there is never an accent in it up and down far and wide save such as fall rather on the ear of the mind those projected by the social spirit starved for the sense of an occasional emphasis the white house is an accent one of the lightest sharpest possible and the capitol of course immensely another though the latter falls on the exclusively political page as to which i have been waiting to say a word it should meanwhile be mentioned that we are promised these enhancements these illustrations of the great general text on the most magnificent scale a splendid projected and announced washington of the future with approaches even now grandly outlined and massively marked in face of which one should perhaps confess to the futility of any current estimate if i speak thus of the capitol however let me not merely brush past the white house to get to it any more than feel free to pass into it without some preliminary stare at that wondrous library of congress which glitters in fresh and almost unmannerly emulation almost frivolous irrelevance of form in the neighbourhood of the greater building about the ingenuities and splendours of this last costly structure a riot of rare material and rich ornament there would doubtless be much to say did not one everywhere on all such ground meet the open eye of criticism simply to establish with it a private intelligence simply to respond to it by a deprecating wink the guardian of that altar i think is but too willing on such a hint to let one pass without the sacrifice it is a case again here as on fifty other occasions of the tribute instantly paid by the revisiting spirit but paid all without question to the general kind of presence for which the noisy air over the land feels so sensibly an inward ache the presence that corresponds there no matter how loosely to that of the housing and harbouring european church in the ages of great disorder the universities and the greater libraries the smaller for a hundred good democratic reasons are another question repeat in their manner to the imagination east and west the note of the old thickwalled convents and quiet cloisters they are large and charitable they are sturdy often proud and often rich and they have the incalculable value that they represent the only intermission to inordinate rapacious traffic that the scene offers to view with this suggestion of sacred ground they play even upon the most restless of analysts as they will making him face about with ecstasy any way they seem to point so that he feels it his business much less to count over their shortcomings than to proclaim them places of enchantment they are better at their worst than anything else at its best and the comparatively sweet sounds that stir their theoretic stillness are for him as echoes of the lyre of apollo the congressional library is magnificent and would become thus a supreme sanctuary even were it ten times more so there would seem to be nothing then but to pronounce it a delight and have done with it or let the appalled imagination in other words slink into it and stay there but here is pressed precisely with particular force the spring of the question that takes but a touch to sound is the case of this remarkable creation by exception a case in which the violent waving of the pecuniary wand has incontinently produced interest the answer can only be i feel a shy assent though shy indeed only till the logic of the matter is apparent this logic is that though money alone can gather in on such a scale the treasures of knowledge these treasures in the form of books and documents themselves organize and furnish their world they appoint and settle the proportions they thicken the air they people the space they create and consecrate all their relations and no one shall say that where they scatter life which they themselves in fact are history does not promptly attend emphatically yes therefore the great domed and tiered galleried and statued central hall of the congressional the last word of current constructional science and artistic resource already crowns itself with that grace the graceful thing in washington beyond any other none the less is the so happily placed and featured white house the late excellent extensions and embellishments of which have of course represented expenditure but only of the refined sort imposed by some mature portionless gentlewoman on relatives who have accepted the principle of making her at a time of life more honourably comfortable the whole ample precinct and margin formed by the virtual continuity of its grounds with those expanses in which the effect of the fine washington obelisk rather spends or wastes itself not a little as if some loud monosyllable had been uttered in a preoccupied company without a due production of sympathy or sense the fortunate isolation of the white house i say intensifies its power to appeal to that musing and mooning visitor whose perceptions alone in all the conditions i hold worthy of account hereabouts beyond doubt history had from of old seemed to me insistently seated and i remember a short springtime of years ago when lafayette square itself contiguous to the executive mansion could create a rich sense of the past by the use of scarce other witchcraft than its command of that pleasant perspective and its possession of the most prodigious of all presidential effigies andrew jackson as archaic as a ninevite king prancing and rocking through the ages if that atmosphere moreover in the fragrance of the washington april was even a quarter of a century since as a liquor of bittersweet taste overflowing its cup what was the ineffable mixture now with all the elements further distilled all the life further sacrificed to make it potent one circled about the place as for meeting the ghosts and one paused under the same impulse before the high palings of the white house drive as if wondering at haunted ground there the ghosts stood in their public array spectral enough and clarified yet scarce making it easier to place the strange incongruous blooddrops as one looked through the rails on that revised and freshened page but one fortunately has ones choice in all these connections as one turns away the mixture as i have called it is really here so fine general jackson in the centre of the square still rocks his hobby and the earth but the fruit of the interval to my actual eyes hangs nowhere brighter than in the brilliant memorials lately erected to lafayette and to rochambeau artful genial expressive the tribute of french talent these happy images supply on the spot the note without which even the most fantasticating sense of our national past would feel itself rub forever against mere brown homespun everything else gives way for me i confess as i again stand before them everything whether as historic fact or present agrement or future possibility yields to this one high luxury of our old friendship with france the artistic federal city already announced spreads itself then before us in plans elaborated even to the finer details a city of palaces and monuments and gardens symmetries and circles and far radiations with the big potomac for waterpower and watereffect and the recurrent maryland spring so prompt and so fullhanded for a perpetual benediction this imagery has above all the value for the considering mind that it presents itself as under the widespread wings of the general government which fairly make it figure to the rapt vision as the object caught up in eagle claws and lifted into fields of air that even the high brows of the municipal boss fail to sweep the widespread wings affect us in the prospect as great fans that by their mere tremor will blow the work at all steps and stages clean and clear disinfect it quite ideally of any germ of the job and prepare thereby for the american voter on the spot and in the pride of possession quite a new kind of civic consciousness the scheme looms largest surely as a demonstration of the possibilities of that service to him and nothing about it will be more interesting than to measure though this may take time the nature and degree of his alleviation will the new pride i speak of sufficiently inflame him will the taste of the new consciousness finding him so fresh to it prove the right medicine one can only regret that we must still rather indefinitely wait to see and regret it all the more that there is always in america yet another lively source of interest involved in the execution of such designs and closely involved just in proportion as the high intention the formal majesty of the thing seems assured it comes back to what we constantly feel throughout the country to what the american scene everywhere depends on for half its appeal or its effect to the fact that the social conditions the material pressing and pervasive make the particular experiment or demonstration whatever it may pretend to practically a new and incalculable thing this general americanism is often the one tag of character attaching to the case after every other appears to have abandoned it the thing is happening or will have to happen in the american way that american way which is more different from all other native ways taking country with country than any of these latter are different from each other and the question is of how each time the american way will see it through the element of suspense beguilement ever of the sincere observer is provided for by the fact that though this american way never fails to come up he has to recognize as by no means equally true that it never fails to succeed it is inveterately applied but with consequences bewilderingly various which means however for our present moral but that the certainty of the determined american effect is an element to attend quite especially such a case as the employment of the arts of design on an unprecedented scale for public uses the adoption on this scale of the whole aesthetic law encountered in america phenomena of this order strike us mostly as occurring in the historic void as having to present themselves in the hard light of that desert and as needing to extort from it so far as they can something of the shading of their interest encountered in older countries they show on the contrary as taking up the references as consenting perforce to the relations of which the air is already full and as having thereby much rather to get themselves expressive by charm than to get themselves expressive by weight the danger in europe is of their having too many things to say and too many others to distinguish these from the danger in the states is of their not having things enough with enough tone and resonance furthermore to give them what therefore will the multitudinous and elaborate forms of the washington to come have to say and what above all besides gold and silver stone and marble and trees and flowers will they be able to say it with that is one of the questions in the mere phrasing of which the restless analyst finds a thrill there is a thing called interest that has to be produced for him positively as if he were a rabid usurer with a clutch of his imperilled bond he has seen again and again how the most expensive effort often fails to lead up to interest and he has seen how it may bloom in soil of no more worth than so many layers of dust and ashes he has learnt in fact he learns greatly in america to mistrust any plea for it directly made by money which operates too often as the great puffing motorcar framed for whirling him in his dismay quite away from it and he has inevitably noted at the same time from how comparatively few other sources this rewarding dividend on his invested attention may be drawn he thinks of these sources as few that is because he sees the same ones which are the references by which interest is fed used again and again with a desperate economy sees the same ones even as the human heroes celebrities extemporized lions or scapegoats required social and educational figureheads and values having to serve in all the connections and adorn all the tales that is one of the liveliest of his american impressions he has at moments his sense that in presence of such vast populations and instilled emulous demands there is not outside the mere economic enough native history recorded or current to go round v it seemed to me on the spot moreover that such reflections were rather more than less pertinent in face of the fact that i was again to find the capitol whenever i approached and above all whenever i entered it a vast and manyvoiced creation the thing depends of course somewhat on the visitor who will be the more responsive i think the further back into the origins of the whole american spectacle his personal vision shall carry him but this hugest as i suppose it of all the homes of debate only asks to put forth on opportunity an incongruous a various an inexhaustible charm i may as well say at once that i had found myself from the first adoring the capitol though i may not pretend here to dot all the is of all my reasons since some of these might appear below the dignity of the subject and others alien to its simplicity the ark of the american covenant may strike one thus at any rate as a compendium of all the national ideals a museum crammed full even to overflowing of all the national terms and standards weights and measures and emblems of greatness and glory and indeed as a builded record of half the collective vibrations of a people their conscious spirit their public faith their bewildered taste their ceaseless curiosity their arduous and interrupted education such were to my vision at least some of its aspects but the place had a hundred sides and if i had had time to look for others still i felt i should have found them what it comes to whereby the pull in america is of the greatest is that association really reigns there and in the richest and even again and again in the drollest forms it is thick and vivid and almost gross it assaults the wondering mind the labyrinthine pile becomes thus inordinately amusing taking the term in its finer modern sense the analogy may seem forced but it affected me as playing in washington life very much the part that st peters of old had seemed to me to play in roman it offered afternoon entertainment at the end of a longish walk to any spirit in the humour for the uplifted and flattered vision and this without suggesting that the sublimities in the two cases even as measured by the profanest mind tend at all to be equal the washington dome is indeed capable in the washington air of admirable of sublime effects and there are cases in which seen at a distance above its yellow potomac it varies but by a shade from the sense yes absolutely the divine campagnasense of st peters and the likecoloured tiber but the question is positively of the impressiveness of the great terraced capitol hill with its stages and slopes staircases and fountains its general presentation of its charge and if the whole mass and prospect amuse as i say from the moment they are embraced the visitor curious of the democratic assimilation of the greater dignities and majesties will least miss the general logic that is the light in which the whole thing is supremely interesting the light of the fact illustrated at every turn that the populations maintaining it deal with it so directly and intimately so sociably and humorously we promptly take in that if ever we are to commune in a concentrated way with the sovereign people and see their exercised power raise a sidewind of irony for forms and arrangements other than theirs the occasion here will amply serve indubitably moreover at a hundred points the irony operates and all the more markedly under such possible interference the interference of the monumental spittoons that of the immense amount of vulgar of barbaric decoration that of the terrible artistic tributes from and scarce less to the different states the unassorted marble mannikins in particular each a portrayal by one of the commonwealths of her highest worthy which make the great rotunda the intended valhalla resemble a stonecutters collection of priced sorts and sizes discretion exists throughout only as a flower of the very first or of these very latest years the large middle time corresponding and even that unequally with the english victorian of sinister memory was unacquainted with the name and waits there now in its fruits but for a huge sacrificial fire some farflaring actoffaith of the future a tribute to the aesthetic law which one already feels stirring the air so that it may arrive i think with an unexampled stride nothing will have been more interesting surely than so public a wipingover of the aesthetic slate with all the involved collective compunctions and repudiations the general exhibition of a colossal conscience a conscience proportionate to the size and wealth of the country to such grand gestures does the american scene lend itself the elements in question are meanwhile there in any case just as the sovereign people are there going over their property but we are aware none the less of impressions that of the ponderous proud senate for instance so sensibly massive that of the supreme court so simply one almost says so chastely yet while it breathes supremacy so elegantly so all intellectually in session under which the view taking one extravagance with another recurs rather ruefully to glimpses elsewhere caught glimpses of authority emblazoned bewigged bemantled bemarshalled in almost direct defeat of its intention of gravity for the reinstated absentee in these presences the mere recovery of native privilege was at all events a balm after too many challenged appeals and abused patiences too many hushed circuitous creepings among the downtrodden in other and more bristling halls of state the sense of a certain large final benignity in the capitol comes then i think from this impression that the national relation to it is that of a huge flourishing family to the place of business the estateoffice where in a myriad open ledgers which offer no obscurity to the hereditary head for figures the account of their colossal revenue is kept they meet there in safe sociability as all equally initiated and interested not as in a temple or a citadel but by the warm domestic hearth of columbia herself a motherly chatty clearspectacled columbia who reads all the newspapers knows to the last man every one of her sons by name and to the last boy even her grandsons and is fenced off at the worst but by concentric circles of rockingchairs it is impossible as i say not to be fondly conscious of her welcome unless again and yet again i read into the general air confusedly too much of the happy accident of the basis of my introduction but if my sensibility responds with intensity to this so much the better for what were such felt personal aids and influences after all but cases and examples embodied expressions of character type distinction products of the working of the whole thing specimens indeed highly concentrated and refined and made thereby i admit more charming and insidious it must also be admitted that to exchange the inner aspects of the vast monument for the outer is to be reminded with some sharpness of a washington in which half the sides that have held our attention drop as if rather abashed out of sight not its pleasant brightness as of a winter wateringplace not its connections however indirect with the older but those with the newer the newest civilization seem matter of recognition for its various marble fronts it rakes the prospect it rakes the continent to a much more sweeping purpose and is visibly concerned but in immeasurable schemes of which it can consciously remain the centre here in the vast spaces mere empty light and air though such pleasant air and such pretty light as yet the great federal future seems under vague bright forms to hover and to stalk making the horizon recede to take it in making the terraces too below the long colonnades the admirable standpoints the sheltering porches of political philosophy the comparatively new wings of the building filled me whenever i walked here with thanksgiving for their large and perfect elegance so in paris might the wide mated fronts that are of such a noble effect on either side of the rue royale shine in multiplied majesty and recovered youth over an infinite place de la concorde these parts of the capitol on their acropolis height are ideally constructed for raking and for this suggestion of their dominating the american scene in playhouse gallery fashion you are somehow possessed of it all while you tread them their marble embrace appears so the complement of the vast democratic lap though i had them in general for contemplation quite to myself i met one morning a trio of indian braves braves dispossessed of forest and prairie but as free of the builded labyrinth as they had ever been of these also arrayed in neat pothats shoddy suits and light overcoats with their pockets i am sure full of photographs and cigarettes circumstances all that quickened their resemblance on the much bigger scale to japanese celebrities or to specimens on show of what the government can do with people with whom it is supposed able to do nothing they seemed just then and there for a mind fed betimes on the leatherstocking tales to project as in a flash an image in itself immense but foreshortened and simplified reducing to a single smooth stride the bloody footsteps of time one rubbed ones eyes but there at its highest polish shining in the beautiful day was the brazen face of history and there all about one immaculate the printless pavements of the state xii richmond i it was toward the end of the winter fairly romantic to feel ones self going south in verification of the pleasant probability that since ones mild adventure had appeared beforehand and as a whole to promise that complexion there would now he aspects and occasions more particularly and deeply dyed with it the inevitability of his being romantically affected being so more often than not had been taken for granted by the restless analyst from the first his feeling that he might count upon it having indeed in respect to his visit the force of a strong appeal the case had come to strike him as perfectly clear the case for the singular history the odd evolution of this confidence which might appear superficially to take some explaining it was europe that had in very ancient days held out to the yearning young american some likelihood of impressions more numerous and various and of a higher intensity than those he might gather on the native scene and it was doubtless in conformity with some such desire more finely and more frequently to vibrate that he had originally begun to consult the european oracle this had led in the event to his settling to live for long years in the very precincts as it were of the temple so that the voice of the divinity was finally to become in his ears of all sounds the most familiar it was quite to lose its primal note of mystery to cease little by little to be strange impressive and august in the degree at any rate in which it had once enjoyed that character the consultation of the oracle in a word the invocation of the possible thrill was gradually to feel its romantic essence enfeebled shrunken and spent the european complexity working clearer to ones vision had grown usual and calculable presenting itself to the discouragement of wasteful emotion and of intensity in general as the very stuff the common texture of the real world romance and mystery in other words the amusement of interest would have therefore at last to provide for themselves elsewhere and what curiously befell in time was that the native the forsaken scene now passing as continual rumour had it through a thousand stages and changes and offering a perfect iridescence of fresh aspects seemed more and more to appeal to the faculty of wonder it was american civilization that had begun to spread itself thick and pile itself high in short in proportion as the other the foreign exhibition had taken to writing itself plain and to a world so amended and enriched accordingly the expatriated observer with his relaxed curiosity reviving and his limp imagination once more on the stretch couldnt fail again to address himself nothing could be of a simpler and straighter logic europe had been romantic years before because she was different from america wherefore america would now be romantic because she was different from europe it was for this small syllogism then to meet practically the test of ones repatriation and as the palpitating pilgrim disembarked in truth he had felt it like the rifle of a keen sportsman carried across his shoulder and ready for instant use what employment it was thus to find what game it was actually to bring down this directed and aimed appetite for sharp impressions is a question to which these pages may appear in a manner to testify constituting to that extent the proof of my fond calculation it was in respect to the south meanwhile at any rate that the calculation had really been fondest on such a stored such a waiting provision of vivid images mainly beautiful and sad might one surely there depend the sense of these things would represent for the restless analyst more than that of any others intensity of impression so that his only prime discomfiture was in his having had helplessly to see his allowance of time cut short reduced to the smallest compass in which the establishment of a relation to any group of aspects might be held conceivable this last soreness however and the point is one to be made was not slow i noted to find itself healingly breathed upon more promptly in america than elsewhere does the relation to the group of aspects begin to work whatever the group and i think i may add whatever the relation may be few elements of the picture are shy or lurking elements tangled among others or hidden behind them packed close by time and taking time to come out they stand there in their row like the letters of an alphabet and this is why in spite of the vast surface exposed any item encountered or selected contributes to the spelling of the word becomes on the spot generally informing and characteristic the word so recognized stands thus immediately for a multitude of others and constitutes to expert observation an allsufficient specimen here evidently more quickly than in europe the visitor says to himself one knows what there is and what there isnt whence there is the less need for ones impression of a multiplication of cases a single case speaks for many since it is again and again as he catches himself repeating a question not of clustered meanings that fall like overripe fruit into his lap but of the picking out of the few formed features signs of character mature enough and firm enough to promise a savour or to suffer handling these scant handfuls illustrate and typify and luckily they are as the evidence of manners and conditions over the world goes quickly gathered so that an impression founded on them is not an undue simplification and i make out i think the reflection with which our anxious explorer tacitly concludes its a bad country to be stupid in none on the whole so bad if one doesnt know how to look and to see one should keep out of it altogether but if one does if one can see straight one takes in the whole piece at a series of points that are after all comparatively few one may neglect by interspacing the points a little of the accessory matter but one neglects none of the essential and if one has not at last learned to separate with due sharpness pen in hand the essential from the accessory one has only at best to muffle ones head for shame and await deserved extinction ii it was in conformity with some such induction as the foregoing that i had to feel myself at richmond in the midst of abnormal wintry rigours take in at every pore a southern impression just as it was also there before a picture charmless at the best i seemed to apprehend and not redeemed now by mistimed snow and ice that i was to recognize how much i had staked on my theory of the latent poetry of the south this theory during a couple of rather dark vain days constituted my one solace or support and i was most of all occupied with my sense of the importance of carrying it off again unimpaired i remember asking myself at the end of an hour or two what i had then expected expected of the interesting richmond and thereupon whether or no i mustered on this first challenge an adequate answer trying to supply the original basis of expectation by that effort as happened my dim perambulation was lighted and i hasten to add that i felt the second branch of my question easy enough to meet how was the sight of richmond not to be a potent idea how was the place not presumably to be interesting to a restless analyst who had become conscious of the charge involved in that title as long ago as at the outbreak of the civil war if not even still more promptly and to whose young imagination the confederate capital had grown lurid fuliginous vividly tragic especially under the process through which its fate was to close round it and overwhelm it invest it with one of the great reverberating historic names they hang together on the dreadful page the cities of the supreme holocaust the final massacres the blood the flames the tears they are chalked with the sinister red mark at sight of which the sensitive nerve of association forever winces if the mere shadow had that penetrative power what affecting virtue might accordingly not reside in the substances the place itself the haunted scene as one might figure it of the old the vast intensity of drama one thing at least was certain that however the sense of actual aspects was to disengage itself i could not possibly have drawn near with an intelligence more respectfully and liberally prepared for hospitality to it so conformably with all this how could it further not strike me in presence of the presented appearances that the needful perceptions were in fact at play i recall the shock of that question after a single interrogative stroll a mere vague mile of which had thrown me back wondering and a trifle mystified one had had brutally to put it to ones self after a conscientious stare about this then the tragic ghosthaunted city this the centre of the vast blooddrenched circle one of the most blooddrenched for miles and miles around in the dire catalogue aforesaid one had counted on a sort of registered consciousness of the past and the truth was that there appeared for the moment on the face of the scene no discernible consciousness registered or unregistered of anything richmond in a word looked to me simply blank and void whereby it was precisely however that the great emotion was to come one could never consent merely to taking it for that intolerable the discredit so cast on ones perceptive resources the great modern hotel superfluously vast was excellent but it enjoyed as a feature as a value an uncontested priority it was a huge wellpitched tent the latest thing in tents proclaiming in the desert the name of a new industry the desert i have mentioned was more or less muffled in snow that furthered i admit the blankness the wind was harsh the sky sullen the houses scarce emphasized at all as houses the southern character in fine was nowhere i should doubtless have been embarrassed to say in what specific items i had imagined it would naturally reside save in so far as i had attached some mystic virtue to the very name of virginia this instinctive imputation constituting by itself for that matter a symptom of a certain significance i watched and waited giving the virtue a chance to come out i wandered far and wide as far that is as weather and season permitted they quite forbade to my regret the long drives involved in a visitation of the old battlefields the shallow vistas the loose perspectives were as sadly simple as the faces of the blind was it practically but a question then deplorable thought of a poor northern city with the bare difference that a northern city of such extent would however stricken have succeeded by some northern art in pretending to resources where otherwise were the old southern mansions on the wide verandahs and in the rank sweet gardens of which northern resources had once been held so cheap well i scarce remember at what point of my peregrination at what quite vague senseless streetcorner it was that i felt my inquiry up to that moment rather embarrassing turn to clearness and the whole picture place itself in a light in which contemplation might for the time find a warrant and a clue i at any rate almost like to live over the few minutes in question for the sake of their relief and their felicity so retracing them i see that the spring had been pressed for them by the positive force of ones first dismay a sort of intellectual bankruptcy this latter that one felt one really couldnt afford there were no references that had been the trouble but the reaction came with the sense that the large sad poorness was in itself a reference and one by which a hundred grand historic connections were on the spot and quite thrillingly reestablished what was i tasting of at that time of day and with intensity but the far consequences of things made absolutely majestic by their weight and duration i was tasting mystically of the very essence of the old southern idea the hugest fallacy as it hovered there to ones backward ones ranging vision for which hundreds of thousands of men had ever laid down their lives i was tasting of the very bitterness of the immense grotesque defeated project the project extravagant fantastic and today pathetic in its folly of a vast slave state as the old term ran artfully savingly isolated in the world that was to contain it and trade with it this was what everything round me meant that that absurdity had once flourished there and nothing immediately could have been more interesting than the lesson that such may remain for long years the telltale face of things where such absurdities have flourished thus by a turn of my hand or of my head interest was evoked so that from this moment i had never to let go of it it was to serve again it was to serve elsewhere and in much the same manner all aspects straightway were altered by it and the pious pilgrim came round again into his own he had wanted his scheme had fairly required this particular part of the country to be beautiful he had really needed it to be he couldnt afford in due deference to the intellectual economy imposed on him its not being when things were grandly sad accordingly sad on the great scale and with a certain nobleness of ruin an element of beauty seemed always secured even if one could scarce say why which truth clearly would operate fortunately for the compromised south it came back again it was always after this fashion coming back as if to make me extravagantly repeat myself to the quantity to be read into the american view in general before it gives out an interest the observer like a fond investor must spend on it boldly ingeniously to make it pay and it may often thus remind one of the wonderful soil of california which is nothing when left to itself and the fine weather but becomes everything conceivable under the rainfall what would many an american prospect be for him the visitor bent on appreciation frequently wonders without his preliminary discharge upon it of some brisk shower of general ideas the arid sand has in a remarkable degree the fine property of absorbing these latter and then giving them back to the air in proportionate signs of life there be blooming gardens on the other hand i take it where the foliage of time is positively too dense for the general idea to penetrate or to perch as if too many ideas had already been concerned and involved and there were nothing to do but to accept the complete demonstration it was not to this order at any rate that my decipherable south was to belong but richmond at least began to repay my outlay from point to point as soon as the outlay had been made the place was weak adorably weak that was the word into which the whole impression flowered that was the idea evidently that all the rest of the way as well would be most brought home that was the form in short that the interest would take the charm immense almost august being in the long unbroken connections of the case here obviously would be the prime source of the beauty since if to be sad was to be the reverse of blatant what was the sadness taken all round but the incurable aftertaste of the original vanity and fatuity with the memories and penalties of which the very air seemed still charged i had recently been studying a little the record reading with other things the volume of his admirable history in which mr james ford rhoades recounts the long preliminaries of the war and shows us all lucidly and humanely the southern mind of the midcentury in the very convulsions of its perversity the conception that almost comic in itself was yet so tragically to fail to work that of a world rearranged a state solidly and comfortably seated and tuckedin in the interest of slaveproduced cotton the solidity and the comfort were to involve not only the wide extension but the complete intellectual moral and economic reconsecration of slavery an enlarged and glorified quite beatified application of its principle the light of experience round about and every fingerpost of history of political and spiritual science with which the scene of civilization seemed to bristle had when questioned but one warning to give and appeared to give it with an effect of huge derision whereby was laid on the southern genius the necessity of getting rid of these discords and substituting for the ironic face of the world an entirely new harmony or in other words a different scheme of criticism since nothing in the slavescheme could be said to conform conform that is to the reality of things it was the plan of christendom and the wisdom of the ages that would have to be altered history the history of everything would be rewritten ad usum delphini the dauphin being in this case the budding southern mind this meant a general and a permanent quarantine meant the eternal bowdlerization of books and journals meant in fine all literature and all art on an expurgatory index it meant still further an active and ardent propaganda the reorganization of the school the college the university in the interest of the new criticism the testimony to that thesis offered by the documents of the time by state legislation local eloquence political speeches the tone of the press strikes us today as beyond measure queer and quaint and benighted innocent above all stamped with the inalienable southern sign the inimitable rococo note we talk of the provincial but the provinciality projected by the confederate dream and in which it proposed to steep the whole helpless social mass looks to our present eyes as artlessly perverse as untouched by any intellectual tradition of beauty or wit as some exhibited array of the odd utensils or divinities of lone and primitive islanders it came over one that they were there in the air they had breathed precisely lone even the very best of the old southerners and looking at them over the threshold of approach that poor richmond seemed to form the real key to ones sense of their native scene was in that very idea of their solitude and their isolation thus they affected one as such passive such pathetic victims of fate as so played upon and betrayed so beaten and bruised by the old burden of their condition that i found myself conscious on their behalf of a sort of ingenuity of tenderness their condition was to have waked up from far back to this thumping legacy of the intimate presence of the negro and one saw them not much less imprisoned in it and overdarkened by it today than they had been in the time of their so fallacious presumption the haunting consciousness thus produced is the prison of the southern spirit and how was one to say as a pilgrim from afar that with an equal exposure to the embarrassing fact one would have been more at ones ease i had found my own threatened i remember my ease of contemplation of the subject which was all there could be question of during some ten minutes spent a few days before in consideration of an african type or two encountered in washington i was waiting in a cab at the railwaystation for the delivery of my luggage after my arrival while a group of tatterdemalion darkies lounged and sunned themselves within range to take in with any attention two or three of these figures had surely been to feel ones self introduced at a bound to the formidable question which rose suddenly like some beast that had sprung from the jungle these were its far outposts they represented the southern black as we knew him not and had not within the memory of man known him at the north and to see him there ragged and rudimentary yet all portentous and in possession of his rights as a man was to be not a little discomposed was to be in fact very much admonished one understood at a glance how he must loom how he must count in a community in which in spite of the ground it might cover there were comparatively so few other things the admonition accordingly remained and no further appeal was required i felt to disabuse a tactful mind of the urgency of preaching southward a sweet reasonableness about him nothing was less contestable of course than that such a sweet reasonableness might play in the whole situation a beautiful part but nothing also was on reflection more obvious than that the counsel of perfection in such a case would never prove oil upon the waters the lips of the nonresident were at all events not the lips to utter this wisdom the nonresident might well feel themselves indeed after a little appointed to silence and with any delicacy see their duty quite elsewhere it came to one soon enough by all the voices of the air that the negro had always been and could absolutely not fail to be intensely on the nerves of the south and that as in the other time the observer from without had always as a tribute to this truth to tread the scene on tiptoe so even yet in presence of the immitigable fact a like discretion is imposed on him he might depart from the discretion of old if he were so moved intrusively fanatically even heroically and he would depart from it today one quite recognized with the same effect of importunity but not with the same effect of gallantry the moral of all of which fairly became to my sense a soft inward dirge over the eternal false position of the afflicted south condemned as she was to institutions condemned to a state of temper of exasperation and depression a horrid heritage she had never consciously invited that bound up her life with a hundred mistakes and makebelieves suppressions and prevarications things that really all named themselves in the noted provincialism none of them would have lived in the air of the greater world which was the world that the north with whatever abatements had comparatively been and had conquered by being so that if the actual visitor was conscious now as i say of the appeal to his tenderness it was by this sight of a society still shut up in a world smaller than what one might suppose its true desire to say nothing of its true desert i can doubtless not sufficiently tell why but there was something in my whole sense of the south that projected at moments a vivid and painful image that of a figure somehow blighted or stricken discomfortably impossibly seated in an invalidchair and yet fixing one with strange eyes that were half a defiance and half a deprecation of ones noticing and much more of ones referring to any abnormal sign the deprecation in the southern eyes is much greater today i think than the old lurid challenge but my haunting similitude was an image of the keepingup of appearances and above all of the maintenance of a tone the historic high tone in an excruciating posture there was food for sympathy and the restless analyst must repeat that when he had but tasted of it he could but make of it his full meal which brings him back by a long way round to the grim streetcorner at richmond where he last left himself iii he could look down from it i remember over roofs and chimneys through some sordid gap at an abased prospect that quite failed to beckon that of the james river embanked in snow and attended by waterside industries that in the brown haze of the weather were dingy and vague there had been an indistinct sign for him somewhere there had stood the libby prison an indication that flung over the long years ever so dreary a bridge he lingered to take it in from so far away it came the strange apparition in the dress of another day and with the interest of noting at the same time how little it mattered for any sort of intensity whether of regret or of relief that the structure itself so sinister to the minds eye should have materially vanished it was still there enough to parade its poor ghosts but the value of the ghosts precisely was that they consented all alike on either side to the grand epic dimness i recognize moreover with the lapse of time the positive felicity of my not having to connect them with the ruin of a particular squalid tobaccohouse the concrete none the less did in the name of history await me and i indeed recollect pursuing it with pertinacity for conscience sake all the way down a wide steep street a place of traffic of shops and offices and altogether shabby virginia vehicles these last in charge of black teamsters who now emphasized for me with every degree of violence that alreadyapprehended note of the negro really at home it fades it melts away with a promptitude of its own almost any random reflection of the american picture and though the restless analyst has arts of his own for fixing and saving it as he at least on occasion fondly flatters himself he is too often reduced to wondering what it can have consisted of in a given case save exactly that projected light of his conscience richmond there at least was a definite fact is a city of more or less noblyprecipitous hills and he recalls of his visit to the avenue aforesaid no intellectual consequence whatever but the aftersense of having remounted it again on the opposite side it was in succession to this doubtless that he found himself consulting the obscure oracle of the old state house or capitol seat of the confederate legislature strange intellectual centre of the general enterprise i scarce know in what manner i had expected it to regale either my outward or my inward sense one had vaguely heard that it was fine and at the height or in the key of the old virginian dignity the approach to it had been adorned from far back moreover as one remembered with crawfords celebrated monument to washington attended by famous virginians which work indeed i promptly perceived answered to its reputation with a high elegance that was quite of the midcentury and yet that indescribably archaic made the midcentury seem remote and quaint and queer as disconnected from us as the prolific age of cyprus or of crete it is positive that of the old american sculpture about the union a rich study might be made what shall i say of this spot at large and of the objects it presented to view if not that here where all the elements of life had been most in fiery fusion everything was somehow almost abjectly frigid and thin the small shapeless square ancient acropolitan seat ill placed on its eminence showed i recollect but a single figure in motion that of a gentleman to whom i presently put a question and who explained to me that the capitol masked all round in dense scaffolding though without a labourer visible had been very bad a mere breakable shell and was now from top to bottom in course of reconstruction the shell one could see was empty and work suspended and i had never truly it seemed to me seen a human institution so coldly and logically brought low as this memorial mass anything rewritten so mercilessly small as this poor passage of a great historic text the effect was as of a page of some dishonoured author printed on grey paper with blunt type and when i had learned from my informant that a fairly ample white house a pleasant honest structure in the taste of sixty or eighty years since had been jefferson daviss official residence during part of the war every source of interest had been invoked and had in its measure responded the impression obeys i repeat a rigorous law it irremediably fades it melts away but was there not further as a feature of the scene one of those decent and dumb american churches which are so strangely possessed of the secret of minimizing to the casual eye the general pretension of churches the extent to which the american air affects one as a nonconductor of such pretensions is in the presence of these heterogeneous objects a constant lively lesson looking for the most part no more established or seated than a stopped omnibus they are reduced to the inveterate bourgeois level that of private accommodated pretensions merely and fatally despoiled of the fine old ecclesiastical arrogance this the richest attribute they elsewhere enjoy keeps clear of them only to betray them so that they remind one everywhere of organisms trying to breathe in the void or of those creatures of the deep sea who change colour and shrink as one has heard when astray in fresh water the fresh water makes them indeed pullulate but to the loss of importance and nothing could more have fallen in with that generalization for the restless analyst than the very moral of the matter as he judged lately put before him at the national capital washington already bristles for the considering eye with national affirmations big builded forms of confidence and energy but when you have embraced them all with the implication of all the others still to come you will find yourself wondering what it is you so oddly miss numberless things are represented and one interest after the other counts itself in the great congressional library crowns the hill beside the capitol the departments and institutes cover their acres and square their shoulders the obelisk to the memory of washington climbs still higher but something is absent more even than these masses are present till it at last occurs to you that the existence of a religious faith on the part of the people is not even remotely suggested not a federal dome not a spire nor a cornice pretends to any such symbolism and though your attention is thus concerned with a mere negative the negative presently becomes its sharp obsession you reach out perhaps in vain for something to which you may familiarly compare your unsatisfied sense you liken it perhaps not so much to a meal made savourless by the failure of some usual some central dish as to a picture nominally finished say where the canvas shows in the very middle with all originality a fine blank space for it is most doubtless the aesthetic appetite in you long richly fed elsewhere that goes unassuaged it is your sense of the comprehensive picture as a comprehensive picture that winces for recognition of loss like a touched nerve what is the picture collectively seen you ask but the portrait more or less elaborated of a multitudinous people of a social and political order so that the effect is for all the world as if with the body and the limbs the hands and feet and coat and trousers all the accessories of the figure showily painted the neat white oval of the face itself were innocent of the brush you marvel at the personage you admire even the painting which you are largely reduced however to admiring in the hands and the boots in the texture of accompanying tablecloth inkstand newspaper introduced with a careless grace and other paraphernalia you wonder how he would look if the face had been done though you have compensation meanwhile i must certainly add in your consciousness of assisting as you apprehensively stand there at something new under the sun the size of the gap the intensity of the omission in the washington prospect where so much else is representative dots with the last sharpness the distinct i as it were of one of the promptest generalizations of the repatriated absentee the field of american life is as bare of the church as a billiardtable of a centrepiece a truth that the myriad little structures attended on sundays and on the off evenings of their sociables proclaim as with the audible sound of the roaring of a million mice or that analogy reinsists of the difference between the deep sea of the older sphere of spiritual passion and the shallow tide in which the inhabiting particles float perforce near the surface and however one indicates ones impression of the clearance the clearance itself in its completeness with the innumerable odd connected circumstances that bring it home represents in the history of manners and morals a deviation in the mere measurement of which hereafter may well reside a certain critical thrill i say hereafter because it is a question of one of those many measurements that would as yet in the united states be premature of all the solemn conclusions one feels as barred the list is quite headed in the states i think by this particular abeyance of judgment when an ancient treasure of precious vessels overscored with glowing gems and wrought artistically into wondrous shapes has by a prodigious process been converted through a vast community into the small change the simple circulating medium of dollars and nickels we can only say that the consequent permeation will be of values of a new order of what order we must wait to see all of which remarks would constitute a long excursion i admit from the sacred edifice by the richmond street were it not for that saving law the enrichment of each hour on the american scene that wings almost any observed object with a power to suggest a possible social portee soaring superior to its plain face and i seem to recover the sense of a pretext for incurable mooning then and there in my introduction but little delayed to the next in the scant group of local lions the usual place of worship as i understood of the confederate leader from his proper pew in which jefferson davis was called on that fine sunday morning of the springtime of by the news of lees surrender the news had been big but the place of worship was small and linger in it as one would fraternize as one would with the mild old confederate soldier survivor of the epic age who made by his account so lean a living of his office of sexton one could but moodily resent again its trivialization of history a process one scarce knows how to name its inaccessibility to legend perhaps after all it represented in its comfortable denominational commonness the right scene of concentration for the promoters of so barren a polity that idea of the perpetual southern quarantine but no leaders of a great movement a movement acclaimed by a whole nation and paid for with every sacrifice ever took such pains alas to make themselves not interesting it was positively as if legend would have nothing to say to them as if on the spot there i had seen it turn its back on them and walk out of the place this is the horse ever that one may take to the water but that drinks not against his will that was at least what it came back to for the musing moralist if the question is of legend we dig for it in the deposit of history but the deposit must be thick to have given it a cover and let it accumulate it was on the battlefields and in all the blooddrenched radius that it would be thick here decidedly in the streets of melancholy richmond it was thin just so since it was the planners and plotters who had bidden unsuccessfully for our interest it was for the sacrificed multitude the unsophisticated irresponsible agents the obscure and the eminent alike that distinction might be pleaded they were buried if one would in the deposit where the restless analyst might scratch all tenderly to find them he had fortunately at this moment his impression as to where under such an impulse he had best look and he turned his steps as with an appetite for some savour in his repast still too much withheld to that museum of the relics of the confederacy installed some years since in the eventual white house of richmond the executive mansion of the latter half of the war here positively the spirit descended and yet all the more directly it seemed to me strange to say by reason of the very nudity and crudity the historic the pathetic poverty of the exhibition it fills the whole large house each of the leagued states enjoying an allotted space and one assuredly feels in passing from room to room that up and down the south no equal area can so offer itself as sacred ground tragically indescribably sanctified these documentary chambers that contained so far as i remember not a single object of beauty scarce one in fact that was not altogether ugly so void they were of intrinsic charm and that spoke only of the absence of means and of taste of communication and resource in these rude accents they phrased their interest which the unappeased visitor from the moment of his crossing the general threshold had recognized in fact as intense he was at his old trick he had made out on the spot in other words that here was a pale page into which he might read what he liked he had not exchanged ten words of civility with a little old lady a person softvoiced gracious mellifluous perfect for her function who seated by her fire in a sort of official anteroom received him as at the gate of some grandly bankrupt plantation he had not surrendered to this exquisite contact before he felt himself up to his neck in a delightful soothing tepid medium the social tone of the south that had been it was but the matter of a step over he was afloat on other waters and had remounted the stream of time i said just now that nothing in the museum had beauty but the little old lady had it with her thoroughly sectional good manners and that punctuality and felicity that inimitability one must again say of the south in her in the patriotic unction of her reference to the sorry objects about which transported me as no enchanted carpet could have done no little old lady of the north could for the high tone and the right manner have touched her and poor benumbed richmond might now be as dreary as it liked with that small observation made my pilgrimage couldnt be a failure the sorry objects about were old confederate documents already sallow with time framed letters orders autographs extracts tatters of a papercurrency in the last stages of vitiation together with faded portraits of faded worthies primitive products of the camera the crayon the brush of all of which she did the honours with a gentle florid reverence that opened wide for the musing visitor as he lingered and strolled the portals as it were of a singularly interesting case it was the case of the beautiful the attaching oddity of the general southern state of mind or stage of feeling in relation to that heritage of woe and of glory of which the mementos surrounded me these mementos were the sorry objects and as i pursued them from one ugly room to another the whole place wearing the air thus cumulatively of some dim dusty collection of specimens prehistoric paleolithic scientific and making one grope for some verbal rendering of the grey effect the queer elements at play wrote themselves as large as i could have desired on every side i imagine from virginia to texas the visitor must become aware of them the visitor that is who by exception becomes aware of anything was i not for instance presently to recognize them at their finest for an almost comic ambiguity in the passionate flare of the little frontal inscription behind which the daughters of the confederacy of the charleston section nurse the old wrongs and the old wounds these afflictions are still thus admirably ventilated and what is wonderful in the air today is the comfort and cheer of this theory of an undying rancour every facility is enjoyed for the publication of it but as the generation that immediately suffered and paid has almost wholly passed away the flamecoloured idea has flowered out of the fact and the interest the psychologic interest is to see it so disengage itself as legend as valuable enriching inspiring romantic legend and settle down to play its permanent part practically and most conveniently one feels the south is reconciled but theoretically ideally and above all for the new generation and the amiable ladies the ladies amiable like the charming curatrix of the richmond museum it burns with a smothered flame as we meanwhile look about us there over a scene as sad throughout as some raw spring eventide we feel how something of the sort must in all the blankness respond morally and socially to a want the collapse of the old order the humiliation of defeat the bereavement and bankruptcy involved represented with its obscure miseries and tragedies the social revolution the most unrecorded and undepicted in proportion to its magnitude that ever was so that this reversion of the starved spirit to the things of the heroic age the four epic years is a definite soothing salve a sentiment which has moreover in the south to cultivate itself intellectually from season to season the field over which it ranges and to sow with its own hands such crops as it may harvest the sorry objects at richmond brought it home so low the aesthetic level it was impossible from room to room to imagine a community of equal size more disinherited of art or of letters these about one were the only echoes daubs of portraiture scrawls of memoranda old vulgar newspapers old rude uniforms old unutterable midvictorian odds and ends of furniture all ghosts as of things noted at a country fair the illiteracy seemed to hover like a queer smell the social revolution had begotten neither song nor story only for literature two or three biographies of soldiers written in other countries and only for music the weird chants of the emancipated blacks only for art i was an hour later to add the monument to general lee by m merci of paris but to that in its suburban corner and to the strange eloquence of its isolation i shall presently come the moral of the show seemed to me meanwhile the touching inevitability in such conditions of what i have called the nursing attitude what on earth nurse of a rich heroic past nurse of a fierce avenging future nurse of any connection that would make for any brood of visions about ones knee wouldnt one have to become i found myself inwardly exclaiming if one had this great melancholy void to garnish and to people it was not under this reflection the actual innocent flare of the altar of memory that was matter for surprise but that such altars should strike one rather as few and faint they would have been none too many for countenance and cheer had they blazed on every hilltop the richmond halls at any rate appeared through the chill of the season scantly trodden and i met in them no fellowvisitor but a young man of stalwart and ingenuous aspect who struck me so forcibly after a little as exhaling a natural piety that as we happened at last to be rapt in contemplation of the same sad glass case i took advantage of the occasion to ask him if he were a southerner his affirmative was almost eager and he proved for all the world like the hero of a famous novel a gallant and nameless as well as a very handsome young virginian a farmer by occupation he had come up on business from the interior to the capital and having a part of his morning on his hands was spending it in this visitation made as i gathered by no means for the first time but which he still found absorbing as a son of the new south he presented a lively interest of type linguistically not least since where doesnt the restless analyst grope for light and this interest the ground of my here recalling him was promptly to arrive at a climax he pointed out to me amid an array of antique regimentals certain objects identical with relics preserved in his own family and that had belonged to his father who enrolled at the earliest age had fought to the end of the war the old implements before us bore the number of the virginia regiment in which this veteran had first seen service and a question or two showed me how well my friend was acquainted with his parents exploits enjoying apparently for he was intelligent and humorous and highly conversable the opportunity to talk of such things they being as it were so advantageously present there with a vague northerner he related felicitously some paternal adventure of which i have forgotten the particulars but which comprised a desperate evasion of capture or worse by the lucky smashing of the skull of a union soldier i complimented him on his exact knowledge of these old unhappy faroff things and it was his candid response that was charmingly suggestive oh i should be ready to do them all over again myself and then smiling serenely but as if it behoved even the least blatant of northerners to understand thats the kind of southerner i am i allowed that he was a capital kind of southerner and we afterwards walked together to the public library where on our finally parting i could but thank him again for being so much the kind of southerner i had wanted he was a fine contemporary young american incapable so to speak of hurting a northern fly as northern but whose consciousness would have been poor and unfurnished without this cool platonic passion with what other pattern personal views apart could he have adorned its bare walls so i wondered till it came to me that though he wouldnt have hurt a northern fly there were things ah we had touched on some of these that all fair engaging smiling as he stood there he would have done to a southern negro iv the public libraries in the united states are like the universities a challenge to fond fancy by which i mean that if taken together they bathe the scene with a strange hard light of their own the individual institution may often affect the strained pilgrim as a blessedly restful perch it constitutes in its degree wherever met a more explicit pica for the amenities or at least a fuller exhibition of them than the place is otherwise likely to contain and i remember comparing them inwardly after periods of stress and dearth after long vacant stretches to the mastheads on which spent birds sometimes alight in the expanses of ocean their function for the student of manners is by no means exhausted with that attribute they project through the use made of them twenty interesting sidelights but it was by that especial restorative that almost romantic character i have just glanced at that i found myself most solicited it is to the inordinate value in the picture of the noncommercial nonindustrial nonfinancial note that they owe their rich relief being with the universities as one never wearied of noting charged with the whole expression of that part of the national energy that is not calculable in terms of mere arithmetic they appeared to express it at times i admit the strange national energy in terms of mere subjection to the spell of the last seller the new novel epidemically swift the ubiquity of which so mirrors the great continental conditions of unity equality and prosperity but this view itself was compatible with ones sense of their practical bid for the effect of distinction there are a hundred applications of the idea of civilization which in a given place outside its library would be all wrong if conceivably attempted and yet that immediately become right incur in fact the highest sanction on passing that threshold they often more or less fail of course they sometimes completely fail to assert themselves even within the precinct but one at least feels that the precinct attends on them waits and confessedly yearns for them consents indeed to be a precinct only on the understanding that they shall not be forever delayed i wondered everywhere under stress of this perception at the general associations of the word that best describes them and that remains so quaintly and admirably their word even when their supreme right in it is most vulgarly and loudly disputed they are the rich presences even in the rich places among the skyscrapers the newspaperoffices the highlyrented pews and the billionaires and they assert with a blest imperturbable serenity not only that everything would be poor without them but that even with them much is as yet deplorably poor they in fact so inexorably establish this truth that when they are in question they leave little to choose i think round about them between the seats of wealth and the seats of comparative penury they are intrinsically so much more interesting than either was it then because richmond at large the old richmond seemed to lie there in its icy shroud with the very dim smile of modesty the invalid gentleness of a patient who has been freely bled was it through profit of this impression that the town library struck me as flushing with colour and resource with confidence and temperament the beauty of the matter is that these penetralia to carry it off as they do call to their aid of necessity no great store of possessions play their trick if they must with the mildest rarities it sufficed really at richmond that the solid structure ample and detached indeed and keeping where it stood the best company the place could afford should make the affirmation furthest removed from the vain vaunt of the other time the pretence of a social order founded on delusions and exclusions everything else was somehow however indirectly the bequest of that sad age and partook more or less of its nature this thing alone either had nothing to do with it or had to do with it by an appealing a quite affecting lapse of logic his halfhours appreciation of which had for the restless analyst a positive melancholy sweetness the place had of course to be in its way a temple to the confederate cause but the charm in the spacious handsome convenient upper room among books of value and pictures of innocence and glass cases of memorabilia more refined than those of the collection i had previously visited among gentle readers transported and oblivious and the still gentler specimens if i rightly recollect of the pale sisterhood of the appointed and attendant fair who predominantly throughout the states minister to intellectual appetite and perform the intellectual service directing and controlling them and as would appear triumphantly minimizing their scope feminizing their too possible male grossnesses the charm i say was now in the beautiful openness to the worldrelation in the felt balm really of the disprovincializing breath once such a summer air as that had begun softly to stir even the drearier little documents might flutter in it as confederately as they liked the terrible framed canvases portraits of soldiers and statesmen strange images on the whole of the sectional great might seem to shake faintly on the wall as in vague protest at a possible doom disinherited of art one could indeed in presence of such objects but feel that the old south had been and might not this thin tremor on the part of several of those who had had so little care for it represent some sense of what the more liberal day so announced there on the spot might mean for their meagre memories this was a question however that it naturally concerned me not to put to the old mutilated confederate soldier who trafficking in photographs in a corner of the room rejoiced to proclaim the originals of the portraits nothing could have been a happier link than the old confederate soldier a link as from past to present and future i mean even when individually addicted to voicing some of the more questionable claims of the past what will they be at all events the southern shrines of memory on the day the last old confederate soldier shall have been gathered to his fate never thanks to a low horizon had the human figure endowed with almost anything at all in the nature of a presence or a silhouette such a chance to stand out never had the pictorial accident on a vast grey canvas such a chance to tell but a different matter from these at richmond in fact the greatest matter of all is the statue of general lee which stands high aloft and extraordinarily by itself at the far end of the main residential street a street with no imputable character but that of leading to it faithful experimentally to a desperate practice i yet had to renounce here in the main residential street the subtle effort to read a sense into the senseless appearances about me this ranked i scarce know why as a disappointment i had presumed with a fond extravagance i have hinted that they would give out here and there some unmistakable backward reference show from the old overclambered but dispeopled double galleries that i might liken to desecrated cloisters some wan faded face of shrunken gentility frankly however with the best will in the world really too good a will which found itself again and again quite grimly snubbed frankly i could do nothing everything was there but the material the disposition had been a tribute to old virginia but old virginia quite unceremoniously washed her hands of me i have spoken of scratching scratching for romance and all tenderly in the deposit of history but plainly no deposit would show and i tried to remember for fairness that richmond had been after all but a modern and upstart capital indistinct there below the hill was the james river and away in the mists of time romantic jamestown the creation of a stuart king that would have to do though it also in its way was nothing for meanwhile in truth just here here above all and in presence of the monument completing the vista were other things to remember provoked reflections that took on their own intensity the equestrian statue of the southern hero made to order in faraway uninterested paris is the work of a master and has an artistic interest a refinement of style in fact under the impression of which we seem to see it in its situation as some precious pearl of ocean washed up on a rude bare strand the very high florid pedestal is of the last french elegance and the great soldier sitting his horse with a kind of melancholy nobleness raises his handsome head as he looks off into desolate space he does well we feel to sit as high as he may and to appear in his lone survival to see as far and to overlook as many things for the irony of fate crowning the picture is surely stamped in all sharpness on the scene about him the place is the mere vague centre of two or three crossways without form and void with a circle half sketched by three or four groups of small new mean houses it is somehow empty in spite of being ugly and yet expressive in spite of being empty desolate one has called the air and the effect is strangely of some smug uptodate specimen or pattern of desolation so long as one stands there the high figure which ends for all the world by suggesting to the admirer a quite conscious subjective even a quite sublime effort to ignore to sit as it were superior and indifferent enjoys the fact of company and thereby in a manner of sympathy so that the vast association of the futile for the moment drops away from it but to turn ones back one feels is to leave it again alone communing at its altitude which represents thus some prodigious exemplary perched position some everlasting high stool of penitence with the very heaven of futility so at least i felt brought round again to meeting my first surprise to solving the riddle of the historic poverty of richmond it is the poverty that is exactly historic once take it for that and it puts on vividness the condition attested is the condition or as may be one of the later fainter weaker stages of having worshipped false gods as i looked back before leaving it at lees stranded bereft image which time and fortune have so cheated of half the significance and so i think of half the dignity of great memorials i recognized something more than the melancholy of a lost cause the whole infelicity speaks of a cause that could never have been gained xiii charleston i to arrive at charleston early in the chill morning was to appear to have come quite adventurously far and yet to be not quite clear about the grounds of the appearance did it rest on impressions gathered by the way on the number of things one had been since leaving richmond aware of or was it rather explained by the long succession of hours the nights and days consumed as mere tasteless time and without the attending relish of excited interest what definitely could i say i had seen that my journey should already presume to give itself airs to seat itself there as a chapter of experience to consider of this question was really i think after a little to renew ones appreciation of the mystery and the marvel of experience that accretion may amount to an enormous sum often when the figures on the slate are too few and too paltry to mention it may count for enrichment without ones knowing why and so again on occasion with a long column of items it may count for nothing at all i reached charleston ever so much as it seemed to me the wiser the wiser that is for the impression of scarce distinguishable things one made them out with no great brilliancy as just southern but one would have missed the point i hasten to add in failing to see what an application and what a value they derived from that name one was already beginning that was the truth ones convenient induction as to the nature of the south and once that account was opened how could everything great or small positive or negative not become straightway a contribution to it the large negatives in america have as well as other matters their meaning and their truth so what if my charged consciousness of the long way from richmond were that of a negative modified by small discomforts the discomforts indeed were as nothing for importance compared candidly with the importance of the rest of the impression the process certainly however one qualified it had been interrupted by one of the most positive passages of ones life which may not figure here alas unfortunately as of the essence of my journey vast brackets applied as it were to the very face of nature enclosed and rounded this felicity which was no more of the texture of the general southern stuff than a patch of old brocade would be of the woof of the native homespun i had by a deviation spent a week in a castle of enchantment but if this modern miracle of which the mountains of north carolina happened to be the scene would have been almost anywhere miraculous i could at least take it as testifying all relevantly all directly for the presence as distinguished from the absence of feature one felt how in this light the extent and the splendour of such a place was but a detail these things were accidents without which the great effect the element that in the beautiful empty air made all the difference would still have prevailed what was this element but just the affirmation of resources made with great emphasis indeed but in a clear and exemplary way so that if large wealth represented some of them an idea a fine cluster of ideas a will a purpose a patience an intelligence a store of knowledge immediately workable things represented the others what it thus came to on behalf of this vast parenthetic carolinian demonstration was that somebody had cared enough and that happily there had been somebody to care which struck me at once as marking the difference for the rest of the text my view of the melancholy of it had been conveniently expressed from hour to hour by the fond reflection through the dreary land that nobody cared cared really for it or for anything that fairly made it dreary as the crazy timber viaducts where the train crawled and sometimes nervously stopped spanned the deep gorges and the admirable nameless and more or less torrential streams as the sense of landscape in mere quantity became once more the vehicle of effect and as we pulled up at the small stations where the social scene might be sufficiently penetrated no doubt from the car window the social scene shabby and sordid and lost in the scale of space as the quotable line is lost in a dull epic or the needed name in an ageing memory would have been as interesting probably as a short story in one of the slangy dialects promoted by the illustrated monthly magazines but it affected me above all and almost each time i seem to remember as speaking of the number of things not cared for there were some presumably though not at all discernibly that were enough to beget the loose human cohesion the scant consistency of parts and pieces to which the array by the railway platform testified but questions came up plentifully in respect to the whole picture and if the mass of interests that were absent was so remarkably large this would be certainly because such interests were ruled out the grimness with which as by a hard inexorable fate so many things were ruled out fixed itself most perhaps as the impression of the spectator enjoying from his supreme seat of ease his extraordinary his awful modern privilege of this detached yet concentrated stare at the misery of subject populations subject i mean to this superiority of his bought convenience subject even as never of old to the sway of satraps or proconsuls if the subject populations on the road to charleston seemingly weak indeed in numbers and in energy had to be viewed at all events so vividly as not caring one made out quite with eagerness that it was because they naturally couldnt the negroes were more numerous than the whites but still there were whites of aspect so forlorn and depressed for the most part as to deprecate though not cynically only quite tragically any imputation of value it was a monstrous thing doubtless to sit there in a cushioned and kitchened pullman and deny to so many groups of ones fellowcreatures any claim to a personality but this was in truth what one was perpetually doing the negroes though superficially and doubtless not at all intendingly sinister were the lustier race but how could they care to insist on my point for such equivocal embodiments of the right complexion yet these were practically within the picture the only affirmations of life except themselves and they obviously they notoriously didnt care for themselves the moral of all of which was that really through the more and more southward hours the wondering stops and the blank renewals it was only the restless analyst himself who cared and enough after all he finally felt to make up for other deficiencies he cared even when in the watches of the night he was roused under the bewilderment that was rarely to leave him in america at any stage of any transaction to which the cars and their sparse stern functionaries formed a party for unpremeditated transfer to a dark and friendless void where with what grace he could he awaited the february dawn the general american theory is that railwaytravel within the confines of the republic is a matter of majestic simplicity and facility qualified at the worst by inordinate luxury i should need therefore an excursion here forbidden me to present another and perhaps a too highly subjective view of it there are lights in which the majesty if the question be of that may strike the freshly repatriated or in other words the unwarned and inexpert as quite grimly formidable lights however that must be left to shine for us in some other connection let it none the less glimmer out of them for the moment that this implication of the penalty of imperfect expertness is really a clue to the essence of the matter a core packed in relation to the whole subject of expertness with fruitful suggestion no single admonition in the states i think is more constant and vivid than the general mass of intimation of what may happen to you in transit unless you have had special and confirmed practice you may have been without it in europe for moving about and yet not perish but to be inexpert in the american battle would be it struck me much more quickly to go down your luggage in america is looked after but you are not save so far as you receive on occasion a sharp order or a sharper shove by sufferance of which discipline moreover you by no means always purchase a prompt delivery of your effects this indeed is but a translation of the general truth that it is the country in the world in which you must do most things for yourself it may be better for you to have thus to do for yourself the secondary as well as the primary things but that is not here the question it begins to strike you at all events as soon as you begin to circulate that your fellowtravellers are for the most part as to the complex act itself professional whereas you may perform it all in europe successfully enough as an amateur whether to your glory or your shame you must of course yourself decide but impunity nay more success may at least attend your empiricism if it was not success however for the strayed amateur to have found himself stranded in the small hours of morning by the vast vague wayside he still nevertheless remembers how quickly even this interlude took on an interest the gloom was scarce penetrable but a light glimmered here and there and formless sheds and shanties dim discomfortable things straggled about and lost themselves indistinguishable engines hooted before and behind where red fires also flared and vanished indistinguishable too from each other while one sought a place of temporary deposit for the impedimenta that attested ones absurd want of rehearsal were the cold steel of the rails the vague composition of the platform and the kinder the safer breast of earth the place was apparently a junction and it was but a question of waiting of selecting as the wisest course among the hoots and the flares to stand huddled just where one was that almost completely unservanted state which is so the mark in general of the american station was here the sole distinctness i had succeeded in artlessly becoming a perfectly isolated traveller with nobody to warn or comfort me with nobody even to command but it was precisely in this situation that i felt again as by the click of a spring that my adventure had in spite of everything or perhaps indeed just because of everything a charm all is own and a charm moreover which i was to have from that moment for any connection no difficulty whatever in recognizing it must have broken out more particularly then and there in the breath of the night which was verily now the bland air of the south mild benignant a benediction in itself as it hung about me and with that blest quality in it of its appearing a medium through which almost any good might come it was the air of the open gates not like that of the north of the closed and one inhaled it in short on the spot as the very boon of ones quest a couple of hours later in the right train which had at last arrived i had so settled to submission to this spell that it had wrought for me i think all its magic ministered absolutely to the maximum of suggestion which became thus for my introduction to charleston the presiding influence what had happened may doubtless show for no great matter in a bare verbal statement yet it was to make all the difference i felt for impressions happy and harsh alike still to come it couldnt have happened without ones beginning to wander but the lively interest was that the further one wandered the more the suggestion spoke the sense of the size of the margin that was the name of it the margin by which the total of american life huge as it already appears is still so surrounded as to represent for the minds eye on a general view but a scant central flotilla huddled as for very fear of the fathomless depth of water the too formidable future on the so much vaster lake of the materially possible once that torch is at all vividly lighted it flares for any pair of open eyes over every scene and with a presence that helps to explain their owners inevitable failure to conclude he feels it in all his uncertainties and he never just escapes concluding without the sense that this so fallacious neatness would more or less absurdly have neglected or sacrificed it not by any means that the margin always affects him as standing for the vision of a possible greater good than what he sees in the given case any more than as standing for a possible greater evil these differences are submerged in the immense fluidity they lurk confused disengaged in the mere looming mass of the more the more and more to come and as yet nothing makes definite the probable preponderance of particular forms of the more the one all positive appearance is of the perpetual increase of everything the growth of the immeasurable muchness that shall constitute the deep sea into which the seeker for conclusions must cast his nets the fact that with so many things present so few of them are not on the way to become quite other and possibly altogether different things conduces to the peculiar interest and one often feels tempted to add to the peculiar irritation of the country ii charleston early in the morning on my driving from the station was it had to be admitted no very finished picture but at least already it was different ever so different in aspect and feeling and above all for intimation and suggestion from any passage of the american scene as yet deciphered and such became on the spot ones appetite for local colour that one was fairly grateful to a friend who by having promised to arrive from the interior of the state the night before gave one a pretext for seeking him up and down my quest for the moment proved vain but the intimations and suggestions while i proceeded from door to door in the sweet blank freshness of the day of the climate of the streets began to swarm at such a rate that i had the sense of gathering my harvest with almost too eager a thrift it was like standing steeped at the bookstall itself in the volume picked up and opened though i may add that when i had presently retreated upon the hotel to which i should in the first instance have addressed myself it was quite for a turning of pages as if i had gone on with the set thus before breakfast i entered upon my brief residence with the right vibrations already determined and unable really to say which of a couple of contacts just enjoyed would have most ministered to them i had roused guilelessly through an easy misunderstanding two more or less sleeping households but if i had still missed my clue to my friend i had yet put myself into possession of much of whatever else i had wanted what had i most wanted i could easily ask myself but some small inkling a mere specimenscrap would do of the sense as i have to keep forever calling my wanton synthesis of the south before the war an airbubble only to be blown in any case through some odd fragment of a pipe my pair of early charleston impressions were thus a pair of thin prismatic bubbles which could have floated before me moreover but for a few seconds collapsing even while i stood there prismatically none the less they had shown me the old south in one case by the mere magic of the manner in which a small scared starved person of colour of very light colour an elderly mulattress in an improvised wrapper just barely held open for me a door through which i felt i might have looked straight and far back into the past the past that of the vanished order was hanging on there behind her as much of it as the scant place would accommodate and she knew this and that i had so quickly guessed it which led her in fine before i could see more and that i might not sound the secret of shy misfortune of faded pretension to shut the door in my face so it seemed to me had i been confronted in italy under quite such a morning air and light quite the same touch of a tepid odorous medium with the ancient sallow crones who guard the locked portals and the fallen pride of provincial palazzini that was all in the one instance there had been no more of it than of the little flare of a struck match which lasted long enough however to light the sedative cigarette smoked and thrown away that renews itself forever between the pictureseekers lips the small historic whiff i had momentarily inhaled required the correction i should add of the sweeter breath of my commentary fresh altogether was the air behind the garden wall that next gave way to my pursuit there being a thrill for that matter in the fact that here at last again if nowhere else over the land rose the real walls that alone make real gardens and that admit to the same by real doors close such a door behind you and you are at once within a local relation a possibility of retreat in favour of which the custom of the north has so completely ceased to discriminate one sacrificed the north with its mere hard conceit of virtuously meeting exhibition much as if a house were just a metallic machine number soandso in a catalogue one sacrificed it on the spot to this finer feeling for the enclosure that had really sufficed no doubt for my second initiation since i remember withdrawing after my fruitless question as on the completion of a mystic process initiation into what i perhaps couldnt have said only at the most into the knowledge that what such southern walls generally shut in proves exactly what one would have wished i was to see this loose quantity afterwards in greater profusion but for the moment the effect was as right as that of privacy for the habit of the siesta the details escape me or rather i tenderly withhold them for the siesta there what would it have been most like but some deep doze or call it frankly some final sleep of the idea of success and how could one better have described the privacy with the mild street shut off and with the deep gallery where resignation might sit in the shade or swing without motion in a hammock shut in than as some dim dream that things were still as they had been still pleasant behind garden walls before the great folly i was to find myself liking in the south and in the most monstrous fashion it appeared those aspects in which the consequences of the great folly were for extent and gravity still traceable i was coldbloodedly to prefer them that is to the aspects occasionally to be met from which the traces had been removed and this i need hardly say from a point of view having so little in common with the vindictive as to be quite directly opposed to it for what in the world was one candidly to do it is the manner of the purged and renovated the disconnected element anywhere after great trials to express itself in forms comparatively vulgar whereas those parts of the organism that having been through the fire still have kept the scorches and scars resemble for tone for colour and value the products of the potters oven when the potter i mean or when in other words history has been the right great artist they at least are not cheerful rawnesses they have been baked beautiful and hard i even tried i fear when once installed there to look at my hotel in that light availing myself to this end of its appearance of dating with its fine old neoclassic front and of a certain romantic grandeur of scale the scale positively of latin construction in my vast saloonlike apartment which opened to a high colonnade the great canopied and curtained bed was really in the grand manner and the ghost of a rococo tradition the tradition of the transatlantic south memory of other lands glimmered generally in the decoration when once i had though almost exclusively under the charm of these particular faded graces i admit again privately protested that the place might have been a palace my peace was made with charleston i was ripe for the last platitude of appreciation let me say indeed that this consciousness had from the first to struggle with another the immediate sense of the degree in which the american scene is lighted on occasion to the critical eye by the testimony of the hotel as had been the case for me already at richmond so here again the note of that truth was sounded the visitor interested in manners was too clearly not to escape it and i scarce know under what slightly sinister warning he braced himself to the fact he had not as yet for repatriation been thrown much upon the hotel but this was the high sense of looking further and seeing more this present promise of that adventure one is thrown upon it in america as straight upon the general painted scene over which the footlights of publicity play with their large crudity and against the freelybrushed texture and grain of which you thus rub your nose more directly and with less of ceremony than elsewhere there are endless things in europe to your vision behind and beyond the hotel a multitudinous complicated life in the states on the other hand you see the hotel as itself that life as constituting for vast numbers of people the richest form of existence you have to go no distance for this to come over you twenty appearances so vividly speak of it it is not so much no doubt that everyone lives at hotels according to the witless belief of europe but that you so quickly seem to measure the very limited extent to which those who people them the populations they appeal to in general may be conceived as living out of them i remember how often in moving about the observation that most remained with me appeared to be this note of the hotel and of the hotellike chain of pullman cars as the supreme social expression for the pullmans too in their way were eloquent they affected me ever by the end of twentyfour hours as carrying if not caesar and his fortune at least almost all the facts of american life there were some of course that didnt fit into them but so many others did and these fitted somehow so perfectly and with such a congruity what it comes back to is that in such conditions the elements of the situation show with all possible though quite unnoted intensity they tell you all about it about the situation in a few remarkably plain and distinct words they make you feel in short how its significance is written upon it it is as if the figures before you and all round you less different from each other less different too i think from the objects about them whatever these in any case may be than any equal mass of appearances under the sun it is as if every one and everything said to you straight yes this is how we are this is what it is to enjoy our advantages this moreover is all there is of us we give it all out make what you can of it the restless analyst would have had indeed an unusual fit of languor if he had not begun from the first to make of it what he could divided even though he was between his sense of this largelywritten significance and his wonderment none the less as to its value and bearing which constituted after all a shade of perplexity as to its meaning yes i see how you are god knows he was ready with his reply for nothing in the world is easier to see even in all the particulars but what does it mean to be as you are since i suppose it means something something more than your mere one universal type with its small deflections but never a departure something more than your way of sitting in silence together at table than your extraordinary your enormous passivity than your apparent absence of criticism or judgment of anything that is put before you or that happens to you beyond occasionally remarking that its fine than in a word the fact of what you eat and the fact of how you eat it you are not final complacently as you appear so much of the time to assume it your mere inevitable shaking about in the margin must more or less take care of that since you cant be so inordinately passive everywhere one infers but in your particular wary niche of your businessblock without being in some degree plastic distinct as you are you are not even definite and it would be terrible not to be able to suppose that you are as yet but an instalment a current number like that of the morning paper a specimen of a type in course of serialization like the hero of the magazine novel by the highlysuccessful author the climax of which is still far off thus as you are perpetually provisional the hotels and the pullmans the pullmans that are like rushing hotels and the hotels that are like stationary pullmans represent the stages and forms of your evolution and are not a bit in themselves more final than you are the particulars still to be added either to you or to them form an insoluble question and meanwhile clearly your actual stage will not be short so much as that i recall had hummed about my ears at richmond where the strong vertical light of a fine domed and glazed cortile the spacious and agreeable dininghall of the inn had rested on the human scene as with an effect of mechanical pressure if the scene constituted evidence the evidence might have been in course of being pressed out in this shining form by the application of a weight and the turn of a screw there it was accordingly there was the social the readable page with its more or less complete report of the conditions the report was to be fuller as to some of these at charleston but i had at least grasped its general value and i shall come back to the charleston report it would have been a sorry business here however if this had been mainly the source of my impressions which was so far from the case that i had but to go forth after breakfast to find insidious charm the appeal of the outer the larger aspect await me at every turn the day announced itself as warm and radiant and keeping its promise to the end squared itself there as the golden frame of an interesting picture interesting above all from the moment one desired with any intensity to find it so the vision persists with its charming touching features yet when i look back and ask myself what can have made my impression all round so positive i am at a loss for elements to refer it to elements there were certainly in especial the fact that during these first bland hours charged with the splendour of spring i caught the wideeyed smile of the south that expression of a temperamental felicity in which shades of character questions of real feature other marks and meanings tend always to lose themselves but a deficiency was clear which was neither more nor less than the deficiency of life without life all gracefully the picture managed to compose itself even while one felt it do so one missed the precious presence so that there at least was food for wonderment for admiration of the art at play to what all the while as one went could one compare the mystification to what if not to the image of some handsome pale person a beauty to call her so of other days who besides confessing to the inanimate state from closed eyes and motionless lips from the arrest of respiration and gesture was to leave one by the days end with the sense of a figure prepared for romantic interment stretched in a fair windingsheet covered with admirable flowers surrounded with shining tapers that one reasoned would be something to have seen and yet ones interest was not so limited ruins to be interesting have to be massive and poor bittersweet charleston suffered for the observer by the merciless law of the thinness making too much for transparency for the effect of paucity still inherent in american groupings a law under which the attempt to subject them to portraiture to see them as composing resembles the attempt to play whist with an imperfect pack of cards if one had already at the north divined the general complexion as probably thin in this sense everywhere thin that is for all notetaking but the statistical under which it might of course show as portentously thick it wouldnt turn dense or rich of a sudden even in an air that could so drench it with benignity therefore if the scene as one might say was but the historic desert without the historic mausoleum how was ones impression to give out as it clearly would the aftertaste of experience to let this small problem worry me no longer than it might i sought an answer and quickly found one in the fortunate fact of my not having failed after all of the admirably suggestive society of my distinguished and competent friend he had arrived overnight according to my hope and had only happened to lodge himself momentarily out of my ken so that as soon as i had his company to profit by i felt the analytic burden of my own blessedly lifted i took over his analysis infinitely better adjusted to the case and which clearly would suffice for everything if only it should itself escape disintegration let me say at once that it quite averted whether consciously or unconsciously whether as too formidably bristling or as too perfectly pacific that menace which success was to provide for us both i think a rounded felicity my companion a northerner of southern descent as well as still more immediately on another side of english knew his south in general and his carolina of that ilk in particular with an intimacy that was like a grabbag into which for illustration he might always dip his hand a movement that had the grabbag been european i should describe rather as a plunge of his arm so that it comes back again to the shallowness of the american grabbag as yet for illustrations other than the statistical he held up for me his bright critical candle which even in the intrinsic charleston vividness made its gay flicker and it was under this aid that to my extreme convenience i was able to feel the place my fortune had indeed an odd sequel which i mention for its appreciatory value the mishaps and accidents of appreciation being ever in their way i think as contributive to judgment as the felicities i was to challenge too recklessly the chances of a second day having by the end of the first and by the taking of example quite learned to treat the scene as a grabbag for my own hand i went over it again in an evil hour whereupon i met afresh the admonition already repeatedly received that where in the states the interest where the pleasure of contemplation is concerned discretion is the better part of valour and insistence too often a betrayal it is not so much that the hostile fact crops up as that the friendly fact breaks down if you have luckily seen you have seen carry off your prize in this case instantly and at any risk try it again and you dont you wont see for there is in all contemplation there is even in any clear appreciation an element of the cruel these things demand that your exposed object shall first of all exist and to exist for exposure is to be at the best impaled on the naturalists pin it takes superpositions at any rate to defy sufficiently this sort of attention it takes either the stoutnesses of history or the rarest rarities of nature to resist fatal penetration that was to come home to me presently in florida through the touched sense of the truth that florida ever so amiably is weak you may live there serenely no doubt as in a void furnished at the most with velvet air you may in fact live there with an idea if you are content that your idea shall consist of grapefruit and oranges oranges grapefruit and velvet air constitute in a manner i admit a feast but press upon the board with any greater weight and it quite gives way its three or four props treacherously forsake it that is what i mean by the impression in the great empty peninsula of weakness which i was to feel still clearer about on being able to compare it afterwards with the impression of california california was to have if i may decently be premature about it her own treachery but she was to wind one up much higher before she let one down i was to find her especially at the first flush unlike sweet frustrated florida ever so amiably strong which came from the art with which she makes the stoutnesses as i have called them of natural beauty stand you in temporary stead of the leannesses of everything else everything that might be of an order equally interesting this she is on a short acquaintance quite insolently able to do thanks to her belonging so completely to the handsome side of the continent of which she is the finest expression the aspect of natural objects up and down the pacific coast is as aristocratic as the comprehensive american condition permits anything to be it indeed appears to the ingenious mind to represent an instinct on the part of nature a sort of shuddering bristling need to brace herself in advance against the assault of a society so much less marked with distinction than herself if i was to conceive therefore under these later lights that her spirit had put forth nowhere on the subtropical atlantic shore anything to approach this conscious pride so doubtless the carolinian effect even at its sweetest was to strike me as related to it very much as a tinkle is related to a boom iii to stray but for an instant into such an outoftheway corner of ones notes however is to give the lie to the tenderness that asserted itself so promptly as the very medium of ones perception there was literally no single object that from morn to nightfall it was not more possible to consider with tenderness a rich consistency of tenderness than to consider without it such was the subtle trick that charleston could still play there echoed for me as i looked out from the battery the recent speech of a friend which had had at the time a depressing weight the battery of the long curved seafront of the waterside public garden furnished with sad old historic guns with liveoaks draped in trailing moss with palmettos that as if still mindful of their state symbolism seem to try everywhere though with a melancholy sceptical droop to repeat the old escutcheon with its large thrilling view in particular thrilling to a northerner who stands there for the first time filled as i am in general while there my friend had said with the sadness and sorrow of the south i never at charleston look out to the old betrayed forts without feeling my heart harden again to steel one remembered that on the spot and one waited a little to see what was happening to ones heart i found this to take time indeed everything differed somehow from ones old conceived image or if i had anciently grasped the remoteness of fort sumter near the mouth of the bay and of its companion at the point of the shore forming the other side of the passage this lucidity had so left me in the course of the years that the faraway dimness of the consecrated objects was almost a shock it was a blow even to ones faded vision of charleston viciously firing on the flag the flag would have been from the battery such a mere speck in space that the vice of the act lost somehow with the distance to say nothing of the forty years a part of its grossness the smitten face however flushed and scarred was out of sight though the intention of smiting and the force of the insult were of course still the same this reflection one made but the old fancied perspective and proportions were altered and then the whole picture at that hour exhaled an innocence it was as blank as the face of a child under mention of his naughtiness and his punishment of week before last the forts faintly blue on the twinkling sea looked like vague marine flowers innocence pleasantness ruled the prospect it was as if the compromised slate sponged clean of all the wicked words and hung up on the wall for better use dangled there so vacantly as almost to look foolish ah there again was the word the air still just tasted of the antique folly so that in presence of a lesson so sharp and so prolonged of the general sterilized state of the brightlylighted delicate dreariness recording the folly harshness was conjured away there was that in the impression which affected me after a little as one of those refinements of irony that wait on deep expiations one could scarce conceive at this time of day that such a place had ever been dangerously moved it was the bled condition and mostly the depleted cerebral condition that was thus attested as i had recognized it at richmond and i asked myself on the battery what more ones sternest justice could have desired if my heart wasnt to harden to steel in short access to it by the right influence had found perhaps too many other forms of sensibility in ambush to justify hardness moreover one would have had to meet something hard and if my peregrination after this had been a search for such an element i should have to describe it as made all in vain up and down and in and out with my companion i strolled from hour to hour but more and more under the impression of the consistency of softness one could have expressed the softness in a word and the picture so offered would be infinitely touching it was a city of gardens and absolutely of no men or of so few that save for the general sweetness the war might still have been raging and all the manhood at the front the gardens were matter for the women though even of the women there were few and that small company rare discreet flitting figures that brushed the garden walls with noiseless skirts in the little melancholy streets of interspaced overtangled abodes were clad in a rigour of mourning that was like the garb of a conspiracy the effect was superficially prim but so far as it savoured of malice prepense of the southern the sentimental partipris it was delightful what was it all most like the incoherent jumble of suggestions the suggestion of a social shrinkage and an economic blight unrepaired irreparable the suggestion of byways of some odd far east infected with triumphant womens rights some perspective of builded plastered lanes over the enclosures of which the flowering almond drops its petals into sharp deep bands of shade or of sun it is not the muffled ladies who walk about predominantly in the east but that is a detail the likeness was perhaps greater to some little oldworld quarter of quiet convents where only priests and nuns steal forth the priests mistakable at a distance say for the nuns it was indeed thoroughly mystifying the whole picture since i was to get in the freshness of that morning from the very background of the scene my quite triumphant little impression of the old south i remember feeling with intensity at two or three points in particular that i should never get a better one that even this was precarious might melt at any moment by a wrong touch or a false note in my grasp and that i must therefore make the most of it the rest of my time i may profess was spent in so doing i made the most of it in several successive spots under the south wall of st michaels church the sweetest corner of charleston and of which there is more to say out in the old cemetery on the edge of the lagoon where the distillation of the past was perhaps clearest and the bribe to tenderness most effective and even not a little on ground thereunto almost adjacent that of a kindly countryclub installed in a fine old semisinister mansion and holding an afternoon revel at which i was privileged briefly to assist the wrong touch and the false note were doubtless just sensible in this last connection where the question probed a little would apparently have been of some new south that has not yet quite found the effective way romantically or at least insidiously to appeal the south that is cultivating countryclubs is a south presumably in many connections quite in the right whereas the one we were invidiously after was the one that had been so utterly in the wrong even there none the less in presence of more than a single marked sign of the rude northern contagion i disengaged socially speaking a faint residuum which i mention for proof of the intensity of my quest and of my appreciation there were two other places i may add where one could but work the impression for all it was in the modern phrase worth and where i had i may venture to say the sense of making as much of it as was likely ever to be made again meanings without end were to be read under tuition into one of these which was neither more nor less than a slightly shy yet after all quite serene place of refection a luncheonroom or teahouse denominated for quaint reasons an exchange the very exchange in fact lately commemorated in a penetrating study already much known to fame of the little that is left of the local society my tuition at the hands of my ingenious comrade was the very best it was possible to have nothing usually is more wonderful than the quantity of significant character that with such an example set the imagination may recognize in the scantest group of features objects persons i fantastically feasted here at my luncheontable not only as the genius of the place demanded on hot chocolate sandwiches and lady baltimore cake this last a most delectable compound but on the exact nuance of oddity of bravery of reduced gentility of irreducible superiority to which the opening of such an establishment without derogation by the proud daughters of warwasted families could exquisitely testify they hovered the proud impoverished daughters singly or in couples behind the counter a counter again delectably charged they waited inscrutably irreproachably yet with all that peculiarly chaste bonhomie of the southern tone on the customers wants even coming to ascertain these at the little thrifty tables and if the drama and its adjusted theatre really contained all the elements of history tragedy comedy irony that a pair of expert romancers closely associated for the hour were eager to evoke the scene would have been i can only say supreme of its kind that desire of the artist to linger where the breath of a subject faintly stirring the air reaches his vigilant sense would here stay my steps as this very influence was in fact to his great good fortune to stay those of my companion the charm i speak of the charm to cherish however was most exhaled for me in other conditions conditions that scarce permit of any direct reference to their full suggestiveness if i alluded above to the vivid charleston background where its mystification most scenically persists the image is all rounded and complete for memory in this connection at which as the case is of an admirably mature and preserved interior i can only glance as i pass the puzzlement elsewhere is in the sense that though the elements of earth and air the colour the tone the light the sweetness in fine linger on the old south could have had no such unmitigated mildness could never have seen itself as subject to such strange feminization the feminization is there just to promote for us some eloquent antithesis just to make us say that whereas the ancient order was masculine fierce and moustachioed the present is at the most a sort of sick lioness who has so visibly parted with her teeth and claws that we may patronizingly walk all round her this image really gives us the best word for the general effect of charleston that of the practically vacant cage which used in the other time to emit sounds even to those of the portentous shaking of bars audible as far away as in the listening north it is the vacancy that is a thing by itself a thing that makes us endlessly wonder how in an at all complex a great political society can everything so have gone assuming indeed that under this aegis very much ever had come how can everything so have gone that the only southern book of any distinction published for many a year is the souls of black folk by that most accomplished of members of the negro race mr web du bois had the only focus of life then been slavery from the point onward that slavery had reached a quarter of a century before the war so that with the extinction of that interest none other of any sort was left to say yes seems the only way to account for the degree of the vacancy and yet even as i form that word i meet as a reproach the face of the beautiful old house i just mentioned whose ample spaces had so unmistakably echoed to the higher amenities that one seemed to feel the accumulated traces and tokens gradually come out of their corners like blest objects taken one by one from a reliquary worn with much handling the note of such haunted chambers as these haunted structurally above all quite as by the ghost of the grand style was not certainly a thinness of reverberation so that i had to take refuge here in the fact that everything appeared thoroughly to antedate to refer itself to the larger the less vitiated past that had closed a quarter of a century or so before the war before the fatal time when the south monomaniacal at the parting of the ways elected for extension and conquest the admirable old house of the stately hall and staircase of the charming coved and vaulted drawingroom of the precious mahogany doors the tall unsophisticated portraits the delicate dignity of welcome owed nothing of its noble identity nothing at all appreciable to the monomania however that might be moreover i kept finding the mere melancholy charm reassert itself where it could the charm i mean of the flowercrowned waste that was by my measure what the monomania had most prepared itself to bequeathe in the old cemetery by the lagoon to which i have already alluded this influence distils an irresistible poetry as one has courage to say even in remembering how disproportionately almost anywhere on the american scene the general place of interment is apt to be invited to testify for the presence of charm the golden afternoon the low silvery seaward horizon as of wide sleepy gamehaunted inlets and reedsmothered banks possible site of some venice that had never mustered the luxury in the mild air of shrub and plant and blossom that the pale north can but distantly envy something that i scarce know how to express but as the proud humility of the whole idle easy loveliness made even the restless analyst for the hour among the pious inscriptions that scarce ever belie the magniloquent clime or the inimitable tradition feel himself really capable of the highest carolinian pitch to what height did he rise on the other hand on being introduced another day at no great distance from this point and where the silvery seaward outlook still prevails to the lapsed and readministered residence also already named that was to give him his one glimpse of any local modernism this was the nearest approach for him to any reanimation of the flowercrowned waste and he has still in memory for symbol of the modernism a vision of the great living blazing fire of logs round which as the afternoon had turned wet and chill this contribution to his view of a possible new society a possible youthful tone a possible southern future in short had disposed itself there were men here in the picture a few and young ones that odd other sense as of a becraped feminized world was accordingly for the moment in abeyance for the moment i say advisedly for the moment only since what aspect of the social scene anywhere in the states strikes any second glance as exempt from that condition it is overwhelmingly feminized or it is not that is the formula with which its claim to existence pierces the ear lest however the recognition again of this truth should lead me too far i content myself with noting a matter perhaps more relevant just here ones inevitable consciousness in presence of the new manifestations that the south is in the predicament of having to be tragic as it were in order to beguile it was very hard i said to myself and very cruel and very perverse and above all very strange but what use had the restless analyst here for a lively and oblivious type was there not something in the lively and oblivious that given the materials employed for it and the effect produced by it threw one back with renewed relish on the unforgetting and the devoted on the resentful and even if need might be the vindictive these things would represent certainly a bad etat dame and was one thus coldbloodedly critically to wish such a condition perpetuated the answer to that seemed to be monstrously enough well yes for these people since it appears the only way by which they can be interesting see when they try other ways their sadness and sorrow as my friend called it has at least for it that it has been expensively produced everything else on the other hand anything that may pretend to be better oh so cheaply one had already in moving about winced often enough at sight of where one was intellectually to land under these last consistencies of observation and reflection so i may put it here that i didnt after all land but recoiled rather and forbore making my skiff fast to no conclusion whatever only pushing out again and letting it for a supreme impression and to prepare in the aftertime the best remembrance drift where it would so accordingly the aftertime having a little arrived it touches now once more of its own motion carries me back and puts me ashore on the one spot where the impression had been perfectly felicitous i have already named the place under the mild the bright south wall of st michaels church where the whole precinct offered the fullblown southern spring that morning the finest of all canvases to embroider the canvas here yes was of the best not only did charleston show me none other so good but i was doubtless to have met south or north none of an equal happy grain and form the high complicated inflated spire of the church has the sincerity approved of time that is so rare over the land in the work of mans hands laden though these be with the millions he offers as a vain bribe to it and in the sweet old churchyard ancient authority seemed to me on the occasion of my visit to sit among the sunwarmed tombs and the interrelated slabs and the extravagant flowers as on the sole cushion the general american bareness in such connections had left it there was more still of association and impression i found under this charm i confess character in every feature even in the muchmaintained interior revolutions and renovations have respected its sturdy rather sombre essence the place feels itself in the fine old dusky archaic way the constituted temple of a faith achieves in a word the air of reality that one had seen in every other such case from town to town and from village to village missed with an unconsciousness that had to do duty for success xiv florida i it is the penalty of the state of receiving too many impressions of too many things that when the question arises of giving some account of these a small sharp anguish attends the act of selection and the necessity of omission they have so hung together have so almost equally contributed for the fond critic to the total image the chapter of experience whatever such may have been that to detach and reject is like mutilation or falsification the history of any given impression residing often largely in others that have led to it or accompanied it this i find the case again and again with my american memories there was something of a hundred of those i may not note in each of those i may and i feel myself amid the swarm pluck but a fruit or two from any branch when i think of florida for instance i think of twenty matters involved in the start and the approach i think of the moist the slightly harsh sunday morning under the portico of the charleston hotel i think of the inauspicious drizzle about the yellow omnibus archaic and provincial that awaited the departing guests remembering how these antique vehicles repudiated rickety stages of the age ignorant of trolleys affected me here and there as the quaintest most immemorial of american things the persistent use of which surely represented the very superstition of the past i think of the gentleman in the watchful knot who while our luggage emerged was moved to say to me for some reason i guess we manage our travelling here better than in your country whereby he so easily triumphed blank as i had to remain as to the country he imputed to me i think of the inimitable detachment with which at the very moment he spoke the negro porter engaged at the door of the conveyance put straight down into the mud of the road the dressingbag i was obliged a few minutes later in our closepressed company to nurse on my knees and i go so far even as almost to lose myself in the sense of other occasions evoked by that reminiscence this marked anomaly the apparently deepseated inaptitude of the negro race at large for any alertness of personal service having been throughout a lively surprise one had counted with some eagerness in moving southward on the virtual opposite on finding this deficiency encountered right and left at the north beautifully corrected one had remembered the old southern tradition the house alive with the scramble of young darkies for the honour of fetching and carrying and one was to recognize no doubt at the worst its melancholy ghost its very ghost however by my impression had ceased to walk or if this be not the case the old planters the cotton gentry were the people in the world the worst ministered to i could have shed tears for them at moments reflecting that it was for this they had fought and fallen the negro waiter at the hotel is in general by an oddity of his disposition so zealous to break for you two or three eggs into a tumbler or to drop for you three or four lumps of sugar into a coffeecup that he scarce waits in either case for your leave but these struck me everywhere as the limit of his accomplishment he lends himself sufficiently to the rough gregarious bustle of crowded feedingplaces but seemed to fall below the occasion on any appeal to his individual promptitude which reflections doubtless exactly illustrate my profession of a moment ago as to the insidious continuity the close interrelation of observed phenomena i might with a little audacity insist still further on that which was in fact what i had originally quite promised myself to do i certainly should have been half heartbroken at the hour itself for example had i then had to estimate as pure waste my state of sensibility to the style and stamp of my companions aspects and sounds burned into my memory as i find but none the less overstraining i am obliged to feel the frame of these remarks so vivid on the spot was the sense of these particular human and sectional appearances and of certain others of the same cluster that they remained for me afterwards beautifully placed placed in this connection of the pilgrimage to palm beach and not the less relevant for being incidental i was to find the obvious bagman the lusty drummer of the southern trains and inns if there be not as yet unrevealed to me some later fond diminutive of designation for the ubiquitous commercial traveller i was to find i say this personage promptly insist on a category of his own a category which at the moments i here recall loomed so large as to threaten to block out of view almost every other object was i the victim of grave mischance was my infelicity exceptional or was the type with which the scene so abounded were the specimens i was thus to treasure all of the common class and the usual frequency i was to treasure them as specimens of something i had surely never yet so undisputedly encountered they went all by themselves as it were so far were as to facial character vocal tone primal rawness of speech general accent and attitude extraordinarily base and vulgar and it was interesting to make out why this fact took on for my edification so unwonted an intensity the fact of the influence on the whole man of a sordid and ravenous habit was naturally no new thing one had met him enough about the world the brawny peddler more or less gorged with the fruits of misrepresentation and blatant and brazen in the key of his special line of goods and the measure of his need but if the figure was immemorial why did it now usurp a value out of proportion to other values what for instance were its remorseless reasons for treating the restless analyst at the breakfasthour perhaps above all to so lurid a vision of its triumph he had positively come to associate the breakfasthour from hotel to diningcar and from diningcar to hotel with the perfect security of this exhibition the sight of the type in completely unchallenged possession i scarce know why my sensibility at the juncture in question so utterly gave way to it why i appealed in vain from one of these so solemnlyfeeding presences to another they refused to the wondering mind any form of relief they insisted as i say with the strange crudity of their air of commercial truculence on being exactly as low as they liked and the affirmation was made in the setting of the great greasy inelegant room as quietly as possible and without the least intention of offence there were ladies and children all about though indeed there may have been sometimes but the lone breakfasting child to reckon with the little pale carnivorous coffeedrinking ogre or ogress who prowls down in advance of its elders engages a table dread vision and has the run of the bill of fare the great blank decency at all events was no more broken than on the general american scene it ever is yet the apprehension of marks and signs the trick of speculation declined none the less to drop whom were they constructed such specimens to talk with to talk over or to talk under and what form of address or of intercourse what uttered what intelligible terms of introduction of persuasion of menace what developed what specific human process of any sort was it possible to impute to them what reciprocities did they imply what presumptions did they could they create what happened inconceivably when such greeks met such greeks such faces looked into such faces and such sounds in especial were exchanged with such sounds what women did they live with what women living with them could yet leave them as they were what wives daughters sisters did they in fine make credible and what in especial was the speech what the manners what the general dietary what most the monstrous morning meal of ladies receiving at such hands the law or the licence of life questions these latter some of which all the while were not imperceptibly answered save that the vainest no doubt was that baffled inquiry as to the thinkable ground amid such relations of preliminary confidence what was preliminary confidence where it had to reckon so with the minimum of any finished appearance how when people were like that did any one trust any one enough to begin or understand any one enough to go on or keep the peace with any one enough to survive wasnt it however at last none the less the sign of a fallacy somewhere in my impression that the peace was kept precisely while i so luxuriously wondered the consciousness of which presently led me round to something that was at the least a temporary a working answer my friends the drummers bore me company thus in the smokingcar through the deepening sweetening south where the rain soon gave way to a refinement of mildness all the way to savannah at the end of which time under the enchantment of the spreading scene i had more or less issued from my maze it was not probably that inflated though they might be after early refreshment with the inward conflict of a greater number of strange sacrifices to appetite than i had ever before seen perpetrated at once they were really more gruesome examples of a class at best disquieting than might elsewhere have been discovered it was only that by so sad a law of their situation they were at once more exposed and less susceptible of bearing exposure they so became to my imagination and by a mere turn of the hand of that precious faculty something like victims and martyrs creatures touchingly tragically doomed for they hadnt asked when one reflected to be almost the only figures in the social landscape hadnt wanted the fierce light to beat all on themselves they hadnt actively usurped the appearance of carrying on life without aid of any sort from other kinds of persons other types presences classes if these others were absent it wasnt their fault and though they devoured at a matutinal sitting thirty little saucers of insane of delirious food this was yet a law which over much of the land appeared to recognize no difference of application for age sex condition or constitution and it had not in short been their pretension to take over the whole social case it would have been so different this case and the general effect for the human scene would have been so different with a due proportion of other presences other figures and characters members of other professions representatives of other interests exemplars of other possibilities in man than the mere possibility of getting the better of his fellowman over a trade wondrous always to note is this sterility of aspect and this blight of vulgarity humanly speaking where a single type has had the game as one may say all in its hands character is developed to visible fineness only by friction and discipline on a large scale only by its having to reckon with a complexity of forces a process which results at the worst in a certain amount of social training no kind of person that was the admonition is a very good kind and still less a very pleasing kind when its education has not been made to some extent by contact with other kinds by a sense of the existence of other kinds and to that degree by a certain relation with them this education may easily at a hundred points transcend the teaching of the big brick schoolhouse for all the latters claim to universality the last dose ever administered by the great wooden spoon so actively plied there is the precious bittersweet of a sense of proportion yet to miss that taste ever at the table of civilization is to feel ourselves seated surely too much below the salt we miss it when the social effect of it fails when all so dismally or so monstrously every one strikes its as after but one thing and as thus not only unaware of the absent importances and values but condemned and restricted as a direct consequence of it to the mere raw stage of their own particular connection i so worked out in a word that what was the matter with my friends was not at all that they were viciously fullblown as one might say were the ultimate sort of monstrosity they had at first appeared but that they were on the contrary just unformed undeveloped unrelated above all unrelated to any merciful modifying terms of the great social proposition they were not in their place not relegated shaded embowered protected and dreadful though this might be to a stray observer of the fact it was much more dreadful for themselves they had the helpless weakness and i think even somewhere in dim depths deeper down still than the awful breakfasthabit the vaguely troubled sense of it they would fall into their place at a touch were the social proposition as i have called it completed they would then help quite subordinately assist the long sentence to read relieved of their ridiculous charge of supplying all its clauses i positively at last thought of them as appealing from this embarrassment in which sublime patience i was floated as i say to savannah ii after that it was plain sailing in the sense i mean of the respite temporary at least of speculation of feeling impressions file in and seat themselves as quietly as decorous worshippers say mild old ladies with neat prayerbooks taking possession of some longdrawn family pew it was absurd what i made of savannah which consisted for me but of a quarter of an hours pause of the train under the wide arch of the station where in the now quite confirmed blandness of the sunday noon a bright brief morning party appeared of a sudden to have organized itself where was the charm if it wasnt already supremely in the air the latitude the season as well as in the imagination of the pilgrim capable not only of squeezing a sense from the important city on these easy terms and with that desperate economy but of reading heaven knows what instalment of romance into a mere railroad matter it is a mere railroad matter in the states that a station should appear at a given moment to yield to the invasion of a dozen or so of bareheaded and vociferous young women in the company of young men to match and that they should all treat the place in the public eye that of the crowded contemplative cars quite as familiar domestic intimate ground set apart it might be for the discussion and regulation of their little interests and affairs and for that so oddly so innocently immodest ventilation of their puerile privacies at which the moralizing visitor so frequently gasps i recall my fleeting instants of savannah as the taste of a cup charged to the brim i recall the swarming the hatless pretty girls with their bigbowed cues their romping swains their inveterate suggestion of their having more to say about american manners than any other single class i recall the thrill produced by the hawkers of scented southern things sprigs and specimens of flower and fruit that mightnt as yet be of the last exoticism but that were native and fresh and overpriced and so all that the traveller could ask but most of all i think i recall the quite lively resolve not to give way under the assault of the beribboned and shirtwaisted fair to the provocation of their suggestiveness even as i had fallen reflectively speaking straight into the trap set for me by the charleston bagmen a resolve taken i blush to say as a base economic precaution only and not because the spectacle before me failed to make reflections swarm they fairly hummed my suppressed reflections in the manner of bees about a flowerbed and burying their noses as deep in the corollae of the subject had i allowed myself time before the train resumed its direction i should have thus found myself regarding the youths and the maidens but especially for many reasons the maidens quite in the light of my so earnestlyconsidered drummers quite as creatures extraordinarily disconcerting at first as to the whole matter of their public behaviour but covered a little by the mantle of charity as soon as it became clear that what like the poor drummers they suffer from is the tragedy of their social their cruel exposure that treachery of fate which has kept them so out of their place it was a case i more than ever saw like the case of the bagmen the case of the bagmen lighted it here in the most interesting way by propinquity and coincidence if the bagmen had seemed monstrous in their occupancy of the scene by their disproportioned possession of it so was not the hint sufficient that this also explains much of the effect of the american girl as encountered in the great glare of her publicity her uncorrected unrelated state there had been moments as i moved about the country when she had seemed to me for affirmation of presence for immunity from competition fairly to share the field but with the bagman and fairly to speak as my inward ear had at last heard him speak ah once place me and youll see i shall be different i shall be better for since i am with my preposterous position falsely beguiled pitilessly forsaken thrust forth in my ignorance and folly what do i know helpless chit as i can but be about manners or tone about proportion or perspective about modesty or mystery about a condition of things that involves for the interest and the grace of life other forms of existence than this poor little mine pathetically broken reed as it is just to find itself waving all alone in the wind how can i do all the grace all the interest as im expected to yes literally all the interest that isnt the mere interest on the money im expected to supply it all while i wander and stray in the desert was there ever such a conspiracy on the part of a whole social order toward the exposure of incompetence were ever crude youth and crude presumption left so unadmonished as to their danger of giving themselves away who at any turn for an hour ever pityingly overshadows or dispossesses me by what combination of other presences ever am i disburdened ever relegated and reduced ever restored in a word to my right relation to the whole all i want that is all i need for there is perhaps a difference is to put it simply that my parents and my brothers and my male cousins should consent to exist otherwise than occultly undiscoverably or as i suppose youd call it irresponsibly thats a trouble yes but we take it so why shouldnt they the rest dont you make it out for me would come of itself havent i however as it is been too long abandoned and too much betrayed isnt it too late and am i not dont you think practically lost faintly and from far away as through dense interpositions this questioning wail of the maidens ultimate distressed consciousness seemed to reach me but i had steeled my sense as i have said against taking it in and i did no more at the moment than all pensively suffer it again to show me the american social order in the guise of a great blank unnatural mother a compound of all the recreant individuals misfitted with the name whose ear the mystic plaint seemed never to penetrate and whose large unseeing complacency suggested some massive monument covered still with the thick cloth that precedes a public unveiling we wonder at the hidden marble or bronze we suppose under the cloth some attitude or expression appropriate to the image but as the removal of the cloth is perpetually postponed the character never emerges the american mother enshrouded in her brown holland has by this analogy never emerged only the daughter is meanwhile seated for the inspection of the world at the base of the pedestal hypothetically supporting some weight some mass or other and we may each impute to her for this posture the aspect we judge best to beseem her my point here at any rate is that i had quite forgotten her by the time i was seated after dinner that evening on a bench in the small public garden that formed a prospect for my hotel at jacksonville the air was divinely soft it was such a southern night as i had dreamed of and the only oddity was that we had come to it by so simple a process we had travelled indeed all day but the process seemed simple when there was nothing of it nothing to speak of to remember nothing that succeeded in getting over the footlights as the phrase goes of the great moving proscenium of the pullman i seemed to think of it the wayside imagery as something that had been there no doubt as the action or the dialogue are presumably there in some untoward drama that spends itself at the back of the stage that goes off in a passion at side doors and perhaps even bursts back incoherently through windows but that doesnt reach the stall in which you sit never quickens to acuteness your sense of what is going on so as if the chair in the pullman had been my stall my sense had been all day but of intervening heads and tuning fiddles of queer refreshments such as only the theatre and the pullman know offered with vociferation straight through the performance i was a little uncertain afterwards as to when i had become distinctively aware of florida but the scenery of the state up to the point of my first pause for the night had not got over the footlights i was promptly however to make good this loss i felt myself doing so quite with intensity under the hotlooking stars at jacksonville i had come out to smoke for the evenings end and it mattered not a scrap that the public garden was new and scant and crude and that jacksonville is not a name to conjure with i still could sit there quite in the spirit for the hour of byrons immortal question as to the verity of his italian whereabouts was this the mincio were those the distant turrets of verona and should i sup well if the train to palm beach arriving there on the morrow in time should happen to permit me at jacksonville i had as i say already supped but i projected myself for the time after byrons manner into the exquisite sense of the dream come true i was not to sup at all as it proved at palm beach by the operation of one of those odd anomalous rigours that crop up even by the more flowery paths of american travel but i was meanwhile able i found to be quite byronically foolish about the st johns river and the various structures looming now through the darkness that more or less adorned its banks the river served for my mincio which it moreover so greatly surpassed in extent and beauty while the remoter buildings figured sufficiently any old city of the south for that was the charm that so preposterously with the essential notes of the impression so happily struck the velvet air the extravagant plants the palms the oranges the cacti the architectural fountain the florid local monument the cheap and easy exoticism the sense as of people feeding off in the background very much al fresco that is on queer things and with flaring lights one might almost have been in a corner of naples or of genoa everything is relative this illuminating commonplace the clue to any just perception of effects anywhere came up for the thousandth time by the aid of which i easily made out that absolute and impeccable poetry of site and circumstance is far to seek but that i was now immeasurably nearer to some poetic or say even to some romantic effect in things than i had hitherto been and i had tried to think washington relaxed and richmond itself romantic and charleston secretly ardent there always comes to any traveller who doesnt depart and arrive with the mere security and punctuality of a registered letter some moment for his beginning to feel within him it happens under some particular touch the finer vibration of a sense of the real thing he thus knows it when it comes and it has the great value that it never need fail there is no situation wherever he may turn in which the note of that especial reality the note of character for bliss or bale may not insist on emerging the note of florida emerged for me then on the vulgar little dusky and dusty jacksonville piazzetta where other vague persons sat about amid those spikey subtropical things that show how the south can be stiff as nothing else is stiff while my rich sense of it incited me to resent the fact that my visit had been denounced in advance as of an ungenerous brevity i had few days deplorably few no doubt to spend but it was afterwards positive to me that with my image as regards the essence of the matter richly completed i had virtually foretasted it all on my dusky jacksonville bench and in my tepid jacksonville stroll such reserves in a complex of few interweavings must impose themselves i think even upon foolish fondness and florida was quite remorselessly to appear to me a complex of few interweavings iii the next day for instance was all occupied with but one of these the railway run from jacksonville to palm beach begins early and ends late yet i waited the livelong time for any other factor than that of the dense cypress swamp to show so much as the tip of an ear i had quite counted on being thrilled by this very intensity and monotony of the characteristic note and i doubtless was thrilled i invoked i cultivated the thrill as we went by every itinerant art that experience had long since taught me yet with a presentiment all the while of the large field in the whole impression that this simplicity would cover possible diversions doubtless occurred had the attuned spirit been moved to avail itself ormond for instance off to our right put in toward the dim centre of the stretch a claim as large as a hard white racingbeach an expanse of firm sand thirty miles long could make it this i recognized might well be an appeal of the grand and simple order the huge band of shining silver beside the huge band of sapphire sea and i inquired a little as to what filled in the picture oh the motorcars the bicycles and the trottingwaggons tearing up and down and then as one seemed perhaps to yearn for another touch ah the hotels of course plenty of them plenty of people very popular resort it sounded charming with its hint again of two or three great facts of composition so definite that their paucity constituted somehow a mild majesty but it ministered none the less to a reflection i had already on occasion found myself perhaps a little perversely making one was liable in the states on many a scene to react as it were from the people and to throw ones self passionately on the bosom of contiguous nature whatever surface it might happen to offer one was apt to be moved in possibly almost invidious preference or in deeper and sweeter confidence to try what might be made of that yet all unreasonably when any source of interest did express itself in these mere rigorous terms in these only terms all of elimination just of sea and sky and riverbreast and forest and beach the beaches in especial were to acquire a trick of getting on ones nerves that produced in turn a wanton wonder about the human side and a due recurrence to the fact that the human side had been from the first ones affair so therefore one seemed destined a bit incoherently to proceed asking ones self again and again what the play would have been without the scenery sometimes even such scenery and then once more not quite seeing why such scenery in especial should propose to put one off with so little of a play the thing absolutely everywhere was to provide ones own play anything everything made scenery for that and the recurrence of such questions made scenery most of all i remember no moment over the land when the mere pullman itself didnt overarch my observations as a positive temple of the drama and when the comedy and the tragedy of manners didnt under its dome hold me raptly attent with which there were other resources a rising tide that before we got to palm beach floated me back into remembered depths of youth why shouldnt i hold it not trivial that as the day waned and the evening gathered and the heat increased and my companions removed one after the other the articles of clothing that had consorted with our early start i felt myself again beneath the spell of mayne reid captain of the treasureship of romance and idol of my childhood i might again have held in my very hand the war trail a work that had seemed matchless to my fourteenth year for was not the train itself rumbling straight into that fantastic florida with its rank vegetation and its warm heroic amorous air the florida of the seminoles and the everglades of the high old spanish dons and the passionate creole beauties gracing the primal society of isolina de vargas whose voluptuous form was lashed mazeppalike at the climax of her fortunes to the fiery mustang of the wilderness and so let loose adown the endless vista of our young suspense we had thus food for the mind i recall if we were reduced to that and i remember that as my buffetcar there was none other was hours late the fond vision of the meal crown of the endless day awaiting me ultimately at the famous hotel yielded all the inspiration necessary for not appealing again great though the stress and strain to the indescribable charity of the buffet the produce of the buffet the procedure of the buffet were alike wherever resorted to a sordid mockery of desire so i but suffered desire to accumulate till the final charming arrest the platform of the famous hotel amid generous lights and greetings and excellent arrangements and balmy southern airs and the breath of the near sea and the vague crests of great palms announced the fulfilment of every hope the question of whether ones hope was really fulfilled or of whether one had among all those items of ease to go supperless to bed would doubtless appear beneath the dignity of even such history as this were it not for a single fact which then and there looming large to me blocked out on the spot all others it is difficult to render the intensity with which one felt the great sphere of the hotel close round one covering one in as with high shining crystal walls stretching beneath ones feet an immeasurable polished level revealing itself in short as for the time for the place the very order of nature and the very form the only one of the habitable world the effect was like nothing else of the sort one had ever known and of surpassing interest truly as any supreme illustration of manners any complete and organic projection of a social case is apt to be the whole picture presented itself as fresh and luminous as was natural to phenomena shown in the splendid florida light and off there at the end of a huge peninsula especially appointed to them and kept clear in their interest as it struck me of any shadow of anything but themselves one had been aware enough certainly for long years of that range of american aspects that diffusion of the american example to which one had given from far back for convenience the name of hotelcivilization why accordingly was this renewed impression so hugely to impose itself why was it to the eye of the restless analyst to stand for so much more than ever yet why was it above all so to succeed in making with insistence its appeal an appeal if not to the finer essence of interest yet to several of the fond critics livelier sensibilities wasnt for that matter his asking of such questions as these the very state of being interested and all the more that the general reply to them was not easy to throw off the vision framed the reflections suggested corresponded closely with those to which in new york some weeks before on its harsh winter afternoon the waldorfastoria had prescribed such a revel but it was wondrous that if i had there supposed the apogee of the impression or better still of the expression reached i was here to see the whole effect written lucidly larger the difference was doubtless that of the crowded air and encumbered ground in the great northern city in the fact that the demonstration is made in florida as in a vast clean void expressly prepared for it it has nothing either in nature or in man to reckon with it carries everything before it meaning when i say it in this momentarily indefinite way the perfect the exquisite adjustability of the national life to the sublime hotelspirit the whole appearance operates as by an economy so thorough that no element of either party to the arrangement is discoverably sacrificed neither is mutilated docked in any degree of its identity its amplitude of type nothing is left unexpressed in either through its relation with the other the relation would in fact seem to stimulate each to a view of the highest expression as yet open to it the advantage in the sense of the upper hand may indeed be at a few points most with the hotelspirit as the more concentrated of the two there being so much that is comparatively undeveloped and passive in the social organism to which it looks for response and the former agency by its very nature fullblown and expert trying it on the latter much more than the latter is ever perceptibly moved to try it on the former the hotelspirit is an omniscient genius while the character of the tributary nation is still but struggling into relatively dim selfknowledge an illustration of this met me precisely at the very hour of my alighting one had entered toward ten oclock in the evening the hotelworld it had become the all in all and made and imposed its law this took the form for me at that hungry climax at the end of the long ordeal of the buffetcar of a refusal of all food that night a rigour so inexorable that had it not been for the charity of admirable friends able to provide me from a private store i should have had to go amid all the suggestions of everything fasting and faint to bed there one seemed to get the hotelspirit taking the advantage taking it unfairly for whereas it struck me in general as educative distinctly in respect to the society it deals with keeping for the most part well in advance of it and leading it on to a larger view of the social interest and opportunity than might otherwise accrue here surely it was false to its mission it fell behind its pretension its general pretension not only of meeting all american ideals but of creating the waldorfastoria being in this sense for example a perfect riot of creation new and superior ones its basis in those high developments is not that it merely gratifies them as soon as they peep out but that it lies in wait for them anticipates and plucks them forth even before they dawn setting them up almost prematurely and turning their face in the right direction thus the great national ignorance of many things is artfully and benevolently practised upon thus it is converted into extraordinary appetites such as can be but expensively sated the belated travellers appetite for the longdeferred bite could scarce be described as too extraordinary but the great collective plastic public so vague yet about many things didnt know that it couldnt didnt know that in communities more knowing the great glittering costly caravansery where the scale of charges is an implication of a high refinement of service grave lapses are not condoned one appears ridiculously to be regretting that unsupplied mouthful but the restless analyst had in truth quickly enough left it behind feeling in his hand already as a clue the long concatenation of interlinked appearances things short in themselves might yet have such large dimensions of meaning the revelation practically dazzling to the uninformed many was constantly proving right and left if one gave it time a trick played on the informed few and there was no quarter of the field either the material or the social in which that didnt sooner or later come out the fact that the individual with his preferences differences habits accidents might still fare imperfectly even where the crowd could be noted as rejoicing before the lord more ingenuously than on any other human scene added but another touch to ones impression already so strong of the success with which throughout the land even in conditions which might appear likely on certain sides to beget reserves about it the allgregarious and generalized life suffices to every need i by no means say that it is not touching the so largely witless confidence with which the universal impulse hurls its victims into the abyss of the hotelspirit trusting it so blandly and inviting it to throw up round and about them and far and wide the habitable the practicable the agreeable sphere toward which other arts of construction fail there were lights in which this was to strike me as one of the most affecting of all social exhibitions lights positively in which i seemed to see again as once more at the universal waldorfastoria the whole housed populace move as in mild and consenting suspicion of its captured and governed state its having to consent to inordinate fusion as the price of what it seemed pleased to regard as inordinate luxury beguiled and caged positively thankful in its vast vacancy for the sense and the definite horizon of a cage were there yet not moments were there yet not cases and connections in which it still dimly made out that its condition was the result of a compromise into the detail of which there might some day be an alarm in entering the detail of the compromise exacted of the individual throughout american life affects the observer as a great cumulative sum growing and growing while he awaits time and opportunity to go into it and i asked myself again and again if i couldnt imagine the shadow of that quantity by no means oppressively felt yet already vaguely perceived and reflected a bit portentously in certain aspects of the native consciousness the jealous cultivation of the common mean the common mean only the reduction of everything to an average of decent suitability the gospel of precaution against the dangerous tendency latent in many things to become too good for their context so that persons partaking of them may become too good for their company the idealized form of all this glimmered for me as an admonition or a betrayal through the charming florida radiance constituting really the greatest interest of the lesson one had travelled so far to learn it might superficially seem absurd it might savour almost of blasphemy to put upon the romantic peninsula the affront of that particular prosaic meaning but i profess that none of its so sensibly thin sources of romance thin because everywhere asking more of the imagination than they could be detected in giving it appealed to me with any such force or testified in any such quantity definitely one had made ones pilgrimage but to find the hotelspirit in sole articulate possession and call this truth for the mind an anticlimax if one would none of the various climaxes the minor effects those of nature for instance since thereabouts far and wide was no hinted history struck me as for a moment dispossessing it of supremacy so little availed comparatively those of the jungle the air the sea the sky the sunset the orange the pineapple the palm so little such a one amid all the garden climaxes as that of the divine bougainvillaea which here and there at palm beach smothers whole homes in its purple splendour for the light of the hotelspirit really beat upon everything it was the only torch held up for the view or the sense of anything else the case therefore was perfect for what did this mean but that its conscience so to speak its view of its responsibility would be of the highest and that given the whole golden frame of the picture the appearances could be nowhere else so grandly in its favour that prevision was to be in fact afterwards confirmed to me iv on a strip of sand between the sea and the jungle in one quarter between the sea and the lake in another the clustered hotels the superior pair in especial stand and exhale their genius one of them the larger the more portentously brave of the pair is a marvel indeed proclaiming itself of course with all the eloquence of an interminable towered and pinnacled and gabled and bannered skyline the biggest thing of its sort in the world such is the responsive geniality begotten by its apparently perfect adequacy to this pretension or to any other it might care to put forth that one took it easily as leaving far behind mere figures of speech and forms of advertisement to stand off and see it rear its incoherent crest above its gardens was to remember and quite with relief nothing but the processional outline of windsor castle that could appear to march with it i say with relief because the value of the whole affirmation which was but the scale otherwise expressed seemed thereby assured no world but an hotelworld could flourish in such a shadow every step for a mile or two round conduced but to show how it did flourish every aspect of everything for which our reclaimed patch our liberal square between sea and jungle yielded space was a demonstration of that the gardens and groves the vistas and avenues between the alignments of palms the fostered insolence of flamecoloured flower and golden fruit were perhaps the rarest attestation of all so recent a conquest did this seem to me of ground formerly abandoned in the states to the general indifference there came back to me from other years a vision of the rude and sordid margins the untended approaches surrounding at resorts the crowded caravansery of the earlier time and marking even now i inferred those of the type that still survive and i caught verily at play that best virtue of the potent presence the hotel was leading again not following imposing the standard not submitting to it teaching the affluent class how to garden how in fact to tidy up its yard since affluence alone was supposable there not receiving at other hands the lesson it was doing more than this discriminating in favour of the beautiful and above all in favour of the refined with an energy that again in the most interesting way seemed to cause the general question of the future of beauty in america to heave in its unrest fifty times already i had felt myself catching this vibration received some vivid impression of the growing quantity of force available for that conquest of all the latent powers of freedom of space of wealth of faith and knowledge and curiosity verily perhaps even of sustained passion potentially at its service these possibilities glimmer before one at times in presence of some artistic effect expensively yet intelligently yet even charmingly produced with the result of your earnestly saying why not more and more then why not an immense exploration an immense exhibition of such possibilities what is wanting for it after all in the way of just there it is indeed that you pull yourself up ah in the way of what you are conscious that what you recognize in especial is not so much the positive as the negative strength of the case what you see is the space and the freedom which at every turn in america make one yearn to take other things for granted the ground is so clear of preoccupation the air so clear of prejudgment and doubt that you wonder why the chance shouldnt be as great for the aesthetic revel as for the political and economic why some great undaunted adventure of the arts meeting in its path none of the aged lions of prescription of proscription of merely jealous tradition should not take place in conditions unexampled from the moment it is but a question of some ones of every ones caring where was the conceivable quantity of care where were the means and chances of application ever so great and the precedent the analogy of the universal organizing passion the native aptitude for putting affairs through indubitably haunts you you are so aware of the acuteness and the courage that you fall but a little short of figuring them as aesthetically contributive but you do fall short you remember in time that great creations of taste and faith never express themselves primarily in terms of mere convenience and zeal and that all the waiting money and all the general fury have at the most the sole value of being destined to be good for beauty when it shall appear they have it in them so little by themselves to make it appear that your unfinished question arrives easily enough in that light at its end what is wanting in the way of taste is the right form of the inquiry that small circumstance alone being positively contributive the others the boundless field the endless gold the habit of great enterprises are you feel at most simple negations of difficulty they affect you none the less however as a rank of stalwart soldiers and servants who as they stand at attention plead from wistful eyes to be enrolled and used so that before any embodied symptom of the precious principle they are there in the background of your thought these lingering instants spent in the presence of such symptoms these brief moments of aesthetic arrest liable to occur in the most diverse connections have an interest that quite picks them i think from the heap of ones american hours and the interest is always fine throwing one back as by a further turn it usually does on the question of the trick possibly played for your appreciation by mere negation of difficulty to what extent may the absence of difficulty to what extent may not facility of purchase and sweet simplicity of pride surprise you into taking them momentarily for a demonstration of taste you remain on your guard very properly but the interest as i have called it doesnt flag none the less since there is one mistake into which you never need fall and one charming one touching appearance that you may take as representing wherever you meet it a reality when once you have interpreted the admonitory sign i have just named as the inordinate desire for taste a desire breaking into a greater number of quaint and candid forms probably than have ever been known upon earth the air is in a manner clearer and you know sufficiently where you are isnt it cleared moreover beyond doubt to the positive increase of the interest and doesnt the question then become almost thrillingly that of the degree to which this pathos of desire may be condemned to remain a mere heartbreak to the historic muse is that to be possibly the american future so far as over such a mystery of mysteries glibness may be permitted the fascination grows while you wonder as from the moment you have begun to go into the matter at all wonder you certainly must if with difficulties so conjured away by power the clear vision the creative freshness the real thing in a word shall have to continue to be represented indefinitely but by a gilded yearning the inference is then irresistible that these blessings are indeed of their essence a sovereign rarity if with so many of the conditions they yet hang back on what particular occult furtherance must they not incorruptibly depend what are the other elements that make for them and in what manner and at what points does the wrong combination of such elements on the american scene work for frustration entrancing speculation which has brought me back by a long circuit to the shining marble villa on the edge of lake worth i was about to allude to this wondrous creation as the supreme instance of missionary effort on the part of the hotelspirit by which i mean of the effort to illustrate and embody a group of its ideals to give a splendid concrete example of its ability to flower at will into concentration into conspicuous privacy into a care for all the refinements the palace rears itself behind its own high gates and gilded transparent barriers at a few minutes walk from the great caravanseries it sits there in its admirable garden amid its statues and fountains the hugeness of its more or less antique vases and sarcophagi costliest reproductions all as if to put to shame those remembered villas of the lake of como of the borromean islands the type the climate the horticultural elegance the contained curiosities luxuries treasures of which it invokes only to surpass them at every point new with that consistency of newness which one sees only in the states it seems to say somehow that to some such heaven some such public exaltation of the blest those who have conformed with due earnestness to the hotelspirit and for a sufficiently long probation may hope eventually to penetrate or perhaps actually retire it has sprung from the genius of the divine pair the dioscuri themselves as castor and pollux were the sons of zeus and has this above all of exemplary that whereas one had in other climes and countries often seen the proprietor of estates construct an hotel or hotels on a piece of his property and even when rigid need was in proximity to his home one had not elsewhere seen the home adjoined to the hotel and placed with such magnificence under its protection and as one might say its star in the former case it was easy to reflect there had been ever at best an effect of incoherence while the beauty of logic of the strictly consequent was all on the side of the latter so much as that one may say but i should find it hard to express without some air of extravagance my sense of the beauty of the lesson read to the general palm beach consciousness from behind the gilded gates and between the large interstices of the enclosure it had the immense merit that it was suited admirably to the boarders it preached them the gospel of civilization all in their own terms and without the waste of an accent it was in short the apotheosis the ideal form of the final home that may pretend to crown a career of sufficiently expensive boarding anything less gorgeous wouldnt have been proportioned to so much expense nor anything more sequestered in the key of such a mode of life but i detach myself with reluctance from the view of this interesting creation interesting in its sense of bathing the whole question of manners in a light anything that does that is a boon to the restless analyst and i remember rejoicing that he should have been introduced promptly to the marble palace which struck him as rewarding attention the more attention was privileged and the further it might penetrate such an experience was all properly preliminary to a view of the rest of the scene since otherwise frankly in relation to what at all represented ideal were the boarders in their vast multitude to be viewed for the boarders verily were the great indicated show as i had gathered in advance at palm beach it had been promised one on all sides that there as nowhere else in america one would find vanity fair in full blast and vanity fair not scattered not discriminated and parcelled out as among the comparative privacies and ancientries of newport but compressed under one vast cover enclosed in a single huge vitrine which there would be nothing to prevent ones flattening ones nose against for days of delight it was into vanity fair accordingly that one embraced every opportunity to press it was the boarders frankly who engaged ones attention in default of any great array of other elements the other elements it must be confessed strike the visitor as few he has soon come to the end of them even though they consist of the greater part of the rest of the sense of florida and he seems to himself to pursue them mainly at the tail and in the constant track of the boarders these latter are so numerous and the clearing in the jungle so comparatively minute that there is scant occasion for the wandering apart which always forms under the law of the herd the intenser joy the velvet air the colour of the sea the royal palms clustered here and there and in their nobleness of beauty their single sublime distinction putting every other mark and sign to the blush these are the principal figures of the sum these with the custom of the short dip into the jungle at two or three points of which approached by charming winding woodways the small but genial fruitfarm offers hospitality offers it in all the succulence of the admirable paleskinned orange and the huge sunwarmed grapefruit plucked from the low bough where it fairly bumps your cheek for solicitation and partaken of on the spot as the immortal ladies of cranford partook of dessert with a few steps aside the back turned and a betrayed ingurgitation it is by means of a light perambulator of adult size but constructed of wickerwork and pendent from a bicycle propelled by a robust negro that the jungle is thus visited the bicycle follows the serpentine track the secluded ranch is swiftly reached the peaceful retirement of the cultivators multitudinously admired the perambulator promptly reentered the darkey restored to the saddle and his charge again to the hotel v it is all most agreeable and diverting it is almost the boarders apart romantic but it is soon over and there is not much more of it the uncanny conception the rank eccentricity of a walk encounters neither favour nor facility but on the subject of the inveteracy with which the conditions over the land conspire against that sweet subterfuge there would be more to say than i may here deal with one of these gentle ranches was approached by water as palm beach has a front on its vast fresh lake as well as seaward a steamlaunch puts you down at the garden foot and the place is less infested by the boarders less confessedly undefended less artlessly ignorant in fine thanks perhaps to the mere interposing water of any possible right to occultation the general absence of conception of that right nowhere asserted nowhere embodied everywhere in fact quite sacrificially abrogated qualifying at last your very sense of the american character qualifying it very much as a pervading unsaltedness qualifies the taste of a dinner this brief excursion remains with me at any rate as a delicate and exquisite impression the neck of land that stretched from the languid lake to the anxious sea the approach to real detachment the gracious northern hostess just veiled for the right felicity in a thin nostalgic sadness the precious recall in particular of having succeeded in straying a little through groves of the pensive palm down to the sandy the vaguelytroubled shore there was a certain concentration in the hour a certain intensity in the note a certain intimacy in the whole communion i found myself loving quite fraternally the palms which had struck me at first for all their humanheaded gravity as merely dry and taciturn but which became finally as sympathetic as so many rows of puzzled philosophers dishevelled shockpated with the riddle of the universe this scantness and sweetness and sadness this strange peninsular spell this i said was subtropical florida and doubtless as permitted a glimpse as i should ever have of any such effect the softness was divine like something mixed in a huge silver crucible as an elixir and then liquidly scattered but the refinement of the experience would be the summer noon or the summer night it would be then the breast of nature would open save only that so lost in it and with such lubrication of surrender how should one ever come back as it was one came back soon enough back to ones proper business which appeared to be urgently strictly severely the pursuit of the boarders up and down the long corridors and round about the wide verandahs of their crowded career i had been admirably provided for at the less egregious of the two hotels which was vast and cool and fair friendly breezy shiny swabbed and burnished like a royal yacht really immaculate and delightful full of interesting lights and yet standing but on the edge of the whirlpool the centre of which formed the heart of the adjacent colossus one could plunge by a short walk through a luxuriance of garden into the deeper depths one could lose ones self if so minded in the labyrinth of the other show there if vanity fair was not encamped it was not for want of booths the long corridors were streets of shops dealing naturally in commodities almost beyond price not the cheap gimcracks of the usual wateringplace barrack but solid when not elaborately ethereal formidable incalculable values of which it was of an admonitory economic interest to observe the triumphant appeal they hadnt terrors apparently for the clustered boarders these idols and monsters of the market neither the wild fantastications of the milliner the uncovered fires disclosed secrets of the gemmerchant the errant tapestries and bahuts of the antiquarian nor what i found most impressive and what has everywhere its picturemaking force those ordered dispositions and stretched lengths of old point in the midst of which a quiet lady in black occupied with some small stitch of her own is apt to raise at you with expensive deliberation a grave white flemish face the interest of the general spectacle was supposed to be i had gathered that people from all parts of the country contributed to it and the value of the testimony as to manners was that it brought to a focus so many elements of difference the elements of difference whatever they might latently have been struck me as throughout forcibly simplified by the conditions of the place this prompt reducibility of a thousand figures to a common denominator having been in fact to my sense the very moral of the picture individuality and variety is attributed to types in america on easy terms and the reputation for it enjoyed on terms not more difficult so that what i was most conscious of from aspect to aspect from group to group from sex to sex from one presented boarder to another was the continuity of the fusion the dimness of the distinctions the distinction that was least absent however would have been i judge that of the comparative ability to spend and purchase the ability to spend with freedom being as one made out a positive consistent with all sorts of negatives that helped to make the whole thing documentary that you had to be financially more or less at your ease to enjoy the privileges of the royal poinciana at all enjoy them through their extended range of saloons and galleries fields of high publicity all pursue them from dininghalls to musicrooms to ballrooms to cardrooms to writingrooms to a succession of places of convenience and refreshment not the least characteristic of which no doubt was the terrace appointed to midmorning and midafternoon drinks drinks at the latter hour that appeared oddly never to comprise tea the only one appreciated in europe at that time of day the quest of tea indeed especially at the hour when it is most a blessing struck me as attended throughout the country with difficulties even with dangers over ground where ones steps are beset everywhere with an infinite number of strange sweet iced liquidities many of these i hasten to add charmingly congruous in their nonalcoholic ingenuity with the heats of summer a circumstance that doesnt prevent their flourishing equally in the rigour of cold the implication of ease was thus a light to assist inquiry it is always a gained fact about people as to where they are if not as to who or what that they are either in confirmed or in casual possession of money and thereby presumably of all that money may in this negotiable world represent add to this that the company came in its provided state by common report from all over that it converged upon palm beach from every prosperous corner of the land and the case was clear for a compendious view of american society in the largest sense of the term society as we loosely use the word is made up of the fortunate few and if that number be everywhere small at the best it was yet the fortunate who after their fashion filled the frame every obligation lay upon me to study them as so gathered in and i did my utmost i remember to render them that respect yet when i now after an interval consult my notes i find the page a blank and when i knock at the door of memory i find it perversely closed if it consents a little to open rather a countenance looks out that of the inscrutable warden of the precinct and seems to show me the ambiguous smile that accompanies on occasion the plea to be excused from which i infer that the form and pressure of the boarders for all i had expected of the promised picture failed somehow to affect me as a discussable quantity it is of the nature of many american impressions accepted at the time as a whole of the particular story simply to cease to be as soon as your back is turned to fade to pass away to leave not a wreck sic behind this happens not least when the image whatever it may have been has exacted the tribute of wonder or pleasure it has displayed every virtue but the virtue of being able to remain with you its pressure and power have failed of some weight some element of density or intensity some property or quality in short that makes for the authority of a figure for the complexity of a scene the european vision in general of whatever consisting and even when making less of an explicit appeal has behind it a driving force derived from sources into which i wont pretend here to enter that make it comparatively bite as the plate of the etcher is bitten by aquafortis that doubtless is the matter in the states with the vast peaceful and prosperous human show in conditions especially in which its peace and prosperity most shine out it registers itself on the plate with an incision too vague and above all too uniform the paucity of ones notes is in itself no doubt a report of the consulted oracle it describes and reconstitutes for me the array of the boarders this circumstance that i only grope for their features and seek in vain to discriminate between sorts and conditions there were the two sexes i think and the range of age but once the one comprehensive type was embraced no other signs of differentiation how should there have been when the men were consistently in all cases thoroughly obvious products of the businessblock the businessblock unmitigated by any other influence definite enough to name and the women were under the same strictness the indulged ladies of such lords the businessblock has perhaps from the northeast to the southwest its fine diversities but any variety so introduced eluded even the most brooding of analysts and it was not of course that the marks of uniformity among so many persons were not on their side perfectly appreciable it was only that when one had noted them as marks of success no doubt primarily and then as those of great gregarious decency and sociability and goodhumour one had exhausted the list it was the scant diversity of type that left me short as a storyseeker or picturemaker contributive as this very fact might be to admiration of the costly processes as they thus appear that ensure and that alone ensure in other societies the opposite of that scantness with this as the foredoomed observer may never escape from the dreadful faculty that rides him the very simplifications had in the highest degree their illustrative value they gave all opportunity to anything or any one that might be salient they gave it to the positive bourgeois propriety serenely imperturbably massively seated and against which any experimental deviation from the bourgeois would have dashed itself in vain this neutrality of respectability might have been figured by a great grey wash of some charged moist brush causing colour and outline on the pictured paper effectually to run together what resisted it best was the look of business success in some of the men when that success had been very great and there were indicated cases of its prodigious greatness the look was in its turn very great when it had been small on the other hand there was doubtless no look at all since there were no other conceivable sources of appearance the people had not and the women least of all one felt in general been transferred from other backgrounds the scene around them and behind them constituted as replete a medium as they could ever have been conscious of the women in particular failed in an extraordinary degree to engage the imagination to offer it so to speak references or openings it faltered doubtless respectfully enough where they for the most part so substantially and prosaically sat failing of any warrant to go an inch further as for the younger persons of whom there were many as for the young girls in especial they were as perfectly in their element as goldfish in a crystal jar a form of exhibition suggesting but one question or mystery was it they who had invented it or had it inscrutably invented them vi the case of st augustine afterwards struck me as presenting on another side its analogy with the case at palm beach if the social interest had in the latter place appeared but of a weak constitution so the historic at the former was to work a spell of a simpler sort than one had been brought up as it were to look to hadnt one been brought up from far back on the article of that faith in st augustine by periodical papers in the magazines fond elucidations of its romantic character accompanied by drawings that gave one quite proudly quite patriotically to think that filled the cup of curiosity and yearning the old town for the essence of the faith had been that there was an old town receded into an all but untraceable past it had been of all american towns the earliest planted and it bristled still with every evidence of its spanish antiquity the illustrations in the magazines wondrous vignettes of old street vistas old architectural treasures gateways and ramparts odds and ends nooks and corners crowned with the sweetness of slow decay conveyed the sense of these delights and renewed at frequent intervals their appeal but oh as i was to observe the school of black and white trained up by the magazines has much in the american air to answer for it points so vividly the homely moral that when you havent what you like you must perforce like and above all misrepresent what you have its translation of these perfunctory passions into pictorial terms saddles it with a weight of responsibility that would be greater one can only say if there ever were a critic some guardian of real values to bring it to book the guardians of real values struck me as up and down far to seek the whole matter indeed would seem to come back interestingly enough to the general truth of the aesthetic need in the country for much greater values of certain sorts than the country and its manners its aspects and arrangements its past and present and perhaps even future really supply whereby as the aesthetic need is also intermixed with a patriotic yearning a supply has somehow to be extemporized by any pardonable form of pictorial hankeypankey has to be as the expression goes cleverly faked but it takes an inordinate amount of faking to meet the supposed intensity of appetite of a body of readers at once more numerous and less critical than any other in the world so that frankly the desperate expedient is written large in much of the artistic activity of the country the results are of the oddest they hang all traceably together wonderful in short the general spectacle and lesson of the scale and variety of the faking they renew again the frequent admonition that the pabulum provided for a great thriving democracy may derive most of its interest from the nature of its testimony to the thriving democratic demand no long time is required in the states to make vivid for the visitor the truth that the nation is almost feverishly engaged in producing with the greatest possible activity and expedition an intellectual pabulum after its own heart and that not only the arts and ingenuities of the draftsman called upon to furnish the picturesque background and people it with the aristocratic figure where neither of these revelations ever meets his eye pay their extravagant tribute but that those of the journalist the novelist the dramatist the genealogist the historian are pressed as well for dear life into the service the illustrators of the magazines improvise largely that is when not labouring in the cause of the rural dialects improvise the field of action full of features at any price and the characters who figure upon it young gods and goddesses mostly of superhuman stature and towering pride the novelists improvise with the aid of the historians a romantic local past of costume and compliment and swordplay and gallantry and passion the dramatists build up of a thousand pieces the airy fiction that the life of the people in the world among whom the elements of clash and contrast are simplest and most superficial abounds in the subjects and situations and effects of the theatre while the genealogists touch up the picture with their pleasant hint of the number over the land of families of royal blood all this constitutes a vast homegrown provision for entertainment rapidly superseding any that may be borrowed or imported and that indeed already begins not invisibly to press for exportation as to quantity it looms immense and resounds in proportion yet with the property all its own of ceasing to be of fading like the mist of dawn that is of giving no account of itself whatever as soon as one turns on it any intending eye of appreciation or of inquiry it is the public these appearances collectively refer us to that becomes thus again the more attaching subject the public so placidly uncritical that the whitest thread of the deceptive stitch never makes it blink and sentimental at once with such inveteracy and such simplicity that finding everything everywhere perfectly splendid it fairly goes upon its knees to be humbuggingly humbugged it proves ever by the ironic measure quite incalculably young that perhaps was all that had been the matter with it in presence of the immemorial legend of st augustine as a mine of romance st augustine proving primarily and of course quite legitimately but an hotel of the first magnitude an hotel indeed so remarkable and so pleasant that i wondered what call there need ever have been upon it to prove anything else the ponce de leon for that matter comes as near producing all by itself the illusion of romance as a highly modern a most cleverlyconstructed and smoothlyadministered great modern caravansery can come it is largely in the moorish style as the cities of spain preserve the record of that manner it breaks out on every pretext into circular arches and embroidered screens into courts and cloisters arcades and fountains fantastic projections and lordly towers and is in all sorts of ways and in the highest sense of the word the most amusing of hotels it did for me at st augustine i was well aware everything that an hotel could do after which i could but appeal for further service to the old spanish fort the empty sunny grassy shell by the low pale shore the mild timesilvered quadrilateral that under the care of a single exhibitory veteran and with the still milder remnant of a towngate near it preserves alone to any effect of appreciable emphasis the memory of the spanish occupation one wandered there for meditation it is not congruous with the genius of florida i gathered to permit you to wander very far and it was there perhaps that as nothing prompted on the whole to intenser musings i suffered myself to be set moralizing in the manner of which i have just given an example over the too thin projection of legend the too dry response of association the spanish occupation shortest of ineffectual chapters seemed the ghost of a ghost and the burntout fire but such a pinch of ashes as one might properly fold between the leaves of ones baedeker yet if i made this remark i made it without bitterness since there was no doubt under the influence of this last look that florida still had in her ingenuous not at all insidious way the secret of pleasing and that even round about me the vagueness was still an appeal the vagueness was warm the vagueness was bright the vagueness was sweet being scented and flowered and fruited above all the vagueness was somehow consciously and confessedly weak i made out in it something of the look of the charming shy face that desires to communicate and that yet has just too little expression what it would fain say was that it really knew itself unequal to any extravagance of demand upon it but that if it might so plead to ones tenderness it would always do its gentle best i found the plea for myself i may declare exquisite and irresistible the florida of that particular tone was a florida adorable vii this last impression had indeed everything to gain from the sad rigour of steps retraced an inevitable return to the north in the interest of a directly subsequent and thereby gracelessly roundabout move westward and i confess to having felt on that occasion before the dire backwardness of the northern spring as if i had while travelling in the other sense but blasphemed against the want of forwardness of the southern every breath that one might still have drawn in the south might if twenty other matters had been different haunted me as the thought of a lost treasure and i settled at the eternal car window to the mere sightless contemplation the forlorn view of an ugly ah such an ugly wintering waiting world my eye had perhaps been jaundiced by the breach of a happy spell inasmuch as on thus leaving the sad fragments there where they had fallen i tasted again the quite saccharine sweetness of my last experience of palm beach and knew how i should wish to note for remembrance the passage supremely charged with that quality in which it had culminated i asked myself what other expression i should find for the incident the afternoon before i left the place of one of those mild progresses to the head of lake worth which distil for the good children of the pair the purest poetry of their cup the poetic effect had braved the compromising aid of the highlydeveloped electric launch in which the pilgrim embarks and braved as well the immitigable fact that his shrine at the end of a couple of hours is in the vast and exquisite void but an institution of yesterday a wondrous floating teahouse or restaurant inflated again with the hotelspirit and exhaling modernity at every pore these associations are so far as association goes the only ones but the whole impression for simply sitting there in the softest lap the whole south had to offer seemed to me to dispense with any aid but that of its own absolute felicity it was for the late return at least the return in the divine dusk with the flushed west at ones right a concert of but two or three notes the alignment against the golden sky of the individual black palms a frieze of chiselled ebony and the texture for faintlybrushed cheek and brow of an air of such silkiness of velvet the very thronerobe of the starcrowned night as one can scarce commemorate but in the language of the loom the shore of the sunset and the palms what was that meanwhile like and yet with what did it at the moment one asked the question refuse to have anything to do it was like a myriad pictures of the nile with much of the modern life of which it suggested more than one analogy these indeed all dropped i found before i had done it would have been a nile so simplified out of the various fine senses attachable one had to put the case i mean to make a fine sense that here surely then was the greater antiquity of the two the antiquity of the infinite previous of the time before pharaohs and pyramids when everything was still to come it was a nile in short without the least little implication of a sphinx or still more if possible of a cleopatra i had the foretaste of what i was presently to feel in california when the general aspect of that wondrous realm kept suggesting to me a sort of prepared but unconscious and inexperienced italy the primitive plate in perfect condition but with the impression of history all yet to be made of how grimly meanwhile under the annual rigour the world for the most part waits to be less ugly again less despoiled of interest less abandoned to monotony less forsaken of the presence that forms its only resource of the one friend to whom it owes all it ever gets of the pitying season that shall save it from its huge insignificance of so much as this no doubt i sufficiently renewed my vision and with plenty of the reviving ache of a question already familiar to what extent was hugeness to what extent could it be a ground for complacency of view in any country not visited for the very love of wildness for positive joy in barbarism where was the charm of boundless immensity as overlooked from a carwindow with the general pretension to charm the general conquest of nature and space affirmed immediately round about you by the general pretension of the pullman the great monotonous rumble of which seems forever to say to you see what im making of all this see what im making what im making i was to become later on still more intimately aware of the spirit of ones possible reply to that but even then my consciousness served and the eloquence of my exasperation seems in its rude accents to come back to me i see what you are not making oh what you are ever so vividly not and how can i help it if i am subject to that lucidity which appears never so welcome to you for its measure of truth as it ought to be how can i not be so subject from the moment i dont just irreflectively gape if i were one of the painted savages you have dispossessed or even some tough reactionary trying to emulate him what you are making would doubtless impress me more than what you are leaving unmade for in that case it wouldnt be to you i should be looking in any degree for beauty or for charm beauty and charm would be for me in the solitude you have ravaged and i should owe you my grudge for every disfigurement and every violence for every wound with which you have caused the face of the land to bleed no since i accept your ravage what strikes me is the long list of the arrears of your undone and so constantly right and left that your pretended message of civilization is but a colossal recipe for the creation of arrears and of such as can but remain forever out of hand you touch the great lonely land as one feels it still to be only to plant upon it some ugliness about which never dreaming of the grace of apology or contrition you then proceed to brag with a cynicism all your own you convert the large and noble sanities that i see around me you convert them one after the other to crudities to invalidities hideous and unashamed and you so leave them to add to the number of the myriad aspects you simply spoil of the myriad unanswerable questions that you scatter about as some monstrous unnatural mother might leave a family of unfathered infants on doorsteps or in waitingrooms this is the meaning surely of the inveterate rule that you shall multiply the perpetrations you call places by the sign of some name as senseless mostly as themselves to the sole end of multiplying to the eye as one approaches every possible source of displeasure when nobody cares or notices or suffers by all one makes out when no displeasure by what one can see is ever felt or ever registered why shouldnt you you may indeed ask be as much in your right as you need but in that fact itself that fact of the vast general unconsciousness and indifference looms for any restless analyst who may come along the accumulation on your hands of the unretrieved and the irretrievable i remember how it was to come to me elsewhere in such hours as those that south of pennsylvania for instance or beyond the radius of washington i had caught no glimpse of anything that was to be called for more than a few miles and by a stretch of courtesy the honour the decency or dignity of a road that most exemplary of all civil creations and greater even as a note of morality one often thinks than as a note of facility and yet had nowhere heard these particular arrears spoken of as matters ever conceivably to be made up i was doubtless aware that if i had been a beautiful red man with a tomahawk i should of course have rejoiced in the occasional sandy track or in the occasional mudchannel just in proportion as they fell so short of the type only in that case i shouldnt have been seated by the great square of plateglass through which the missionary pullman appeared to invite me to admire the achievements it proclaimed it was in this respect the great symbolic agent it seemed to stand for all the irresponsibility behind it and i am not sure that i didnt continue so long as i was in it to slang it for relief of the oerfraught heart you deal your wounds that is the trouble as you say in numbers so out of proportion to any hint of responsibility for them that you seem ever moved to take which is the devils dance precisely that your vast expanse of level floor leads you to caper through with more kinds of outward clumsiness even if also with more kinds of inward impatience and avidity more leaps and bounds of the spirit at any cost to grace than have ever before been collectively displayed the expanse of the floor the material opportunity itself has elsewhere failed so that what is the positive effect of their inordinate presence but to make the lone observer here and there but measure with dismay the trap laid by the scale if he be not tempted even to say by the superstition of continuity is the germ of anything finely human of anything agreeably or successfully social supposably planted in conditions of such endless stretching and such boundless spreading as shall appear finally to minister but to the triumph of the superficial and the apotheosis of the raw oh for a split or a chasm one groans beside your plateglass oh for an unbridgeable abyss or an insuperable mountain and i could so indulge myself though still ignorant of how one was to groan later on in particular after taking yet further home the portentous truth that this same criminal continuity scorning its grandest chance to break down makes but a mouthful of the mighty mississippi that was to be in fact my very next big impression
