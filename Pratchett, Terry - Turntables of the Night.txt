turntables of the night by terry pratchett look constable what i dont understand is surely he wouldnt be into blues because that was waynes life for you a blues single i mean if people were music wayne would be like one of those scratchy old numbers you know rerecorded about a hundred times from the original phonograph cylinder or whatever with some old guy with a name like deaf orange robinson standing kneedeep in the mississippi and moaning through his nose youd think hed be more into heavy metal or meatloaf or someone but i suppose hes into everyone eventually what yeah thats my van with hellfire disco painted on it wayne cant drive you see hes just not interested in anything like that i remember when i got my first car and we went on holiday and i did the driving and okay also the repairing and wayne worked the radio trying to keep the pirate stations tuned in he didnt really care where we went as long as it was on high ground and he could get caroline or london or whatever i didnt care where we went so long as we went i was always more into cars than music until now i think i dont think i want to drive a car again id keep wondering whod suddenly turn up in the passenger seat sorry so yeah the disco well the deal was that i supplied the van we split the cost of the gear and wayne supplied the records it was really my idea i mean it seemed a pretty good bet wayne lives with his mum but theyre down to two rooms now because of his record collection lots of people collect records but i reckon wayne really wants wanted to own every one that was ever made his idea of a fun outing was going to some old store in some old town and rummaging through the stock and coming out with something by someone with a name like sid sputnik and the spacemen but the thing was the funny thing was youd get back to his room and hed go to a shelf and push all the record aside and thered be this neat brown envelope with the name and date on it and everything waiting or hed get me to drive him all the way to preston or somewhere to find some guy whos a selfemployed plumber now but maybe back in called himself ronnie sequin and made it to number in the charts just to see if hed got a spare copy of his one record which was really so naff you couldnt even find it in the specialist stores wayne was the kind of collector who couldnt bear a hole in his collection it was almost religious really he could outtalk john peel in any case but the records he really knew about were the ones he hadnt got hed wait years to get some practically demo disc from a punk group who probably died of safetypin tetanus but by the time he got his hands on it hed be able to recite everything down to the name of the cleaning lady who scrubbed out the studio afterwards like i said a collector so i thought what more do you need to run a disco well basically just about everything which wayne hadnt got looks clothes common sense some kind of idea about electric wiring and the ability to rabbit on like a prat but at the time we didnt look at it like that so i flogged the capri and bought the van and got it nearly professionally resprayed you can only see the words midland electricity board on it if you know where to look i wanted it to look like the van in the ateam except where theirs can jump four cars and still hare off down the road mine has trouble with drain covers yes ive talked to the other officer about the tax and insurance and mot sorry sergeant dont worry about it i wont be driving a car ever again never we bought a load of amplifiers and stuff off ian curtis over in wyrecliff because he was getting married and tracey wanted him at home of a night bunged some cards in newsagents windows and waited well people didnt exactly fall over themselves to give us gigs on account of people not really catching on to waynes style you dont have to be a verbal genius to be a jock people just expect you to say hey and wow and get down and boogie and stuff it doesnt actually matter if you sound like a pillock it helps them feel superior what they dont want when theyre all getting drunk after the wedding or whatever is for someone to stand there with his eyes flashing worse than the lights saying things like theres a rather interesting story attached to this record funny thing though is that after a while we started to get popular in a weird wordofmouth kind of way what started it i reckon was my sister beryls wedding anniversary shes older than me you understand it turned out that wayne had brought along just about every record ever pressed for about a year before they got married not just the top ten either the guests were all around the same age and pretty soon the room was so full of nostalgia you could hardly move wayne just hotwired all their ignitions and took them for a joyride down memory motorway after that we started getting dates from what you might call the more older types you know not exactly kids but bits havent started falling off yet we were a sort of speciality disco at the breaks people would come up to him to chat about this great number they recalled from way back or whenever and it would turn out that wayne would always have it in the van if theyd heard of it hed have it chances are hed have it even if they hadnt heard of it because you could say this about wayne he was a true collector he didnt worry whether the stuff was actually good or not it just had to exist he didnt put it like that of course hed say there was always something unique about every record you might think that this is a lot of crap but here was a man whod got just about everything ever made over the last forty years and he really believed there was something special about each one he loved them he sat up there all through the night in his room lined with brown envelopes and played them one by one records that had been forgotten even by the people who made them ill swear he loved them all yes all right but youve got to know about him to understand what happened next we were booked for this halloween dance you could tell it was halloween because of all the little bastards running around the streets shouting trickle treat and threatening you with milk bottles hed sorted out lots of monster mash type records he looked pretty awful but i didnt think much of it at the time i mean he always looked awful it was his normal look it came from spending years indoors listening to records plus he had this bad heart and asthma and everything the dance was at okay you know all that a halloween dance to raise money for a church hall wayne said that was a big joke but he didnt say why i expect it was some clever reason he was always good at that sort of thing you know knowing little details that other people didnt know it used to get him hit a lot at school except when i was around he was the kind of skinny boy who had his glasses held together with elastoplast i dont think i ever saw him raise a finger to anybody only that time when greebo greaves broke a record wayne had brought to some school disco and four of us had to pull wayne off him and prise the iron bar out of his fingers and there was the police and an ambulance and everything anyway i let wayne set everything up which was one big mistake but he wanted to do it and i went and sat down by what they called the bar ie a couple of trestle tables with a cloth on it no i didnt drink anything well maybe one cup of the punch and that was all fruit juice all right two cups but i know what i heard and im absolutely certain about what i saw i think you get the same old bunch at these kinds of gigs theres the organiser and a few members of the committee some lads from the village whod sort of drifted in because there wasnt much on the box except snooker everyone wore a mask but hadnt made an effort with the rest of the clothes so it looked as though frankenstein and co had all gone shopping in marks and sparks there were scouts posters on the wall and those special kinds of village hall radiators that suck the heat in it smelled of tennis shoes just to sort of set the seal on it as one of the hotspots of the world there was a little mirror ball spinning up the rafters half the little mirrors had fallen off all right maybe three cups but it had bits of apple floating in it nothing serious has bits of apple floating in it wayne started with a few hot numbers to get them stomping im speaking metaphorically here you understand none of this boogie on down stuff all you could hear was people not being as young as they used to be now ive already said wayne wasnt exactly cut out for the business and that night last night he was worse than usual he kept mumbling and staring at the dancers he mixed the records up he even scratched one accidentally i mean the only time ive ever seen wayne really angry apart from the greebo business was when scratch music came in it would have been very bad manners to cut in so at the first break i went up to him and let me tell you he was sweating so much it was dropping on to the mixer its that bloke on the floor he said the one in the flares methuselah i said dont muck about the black silk suit with the rhinestones hes been doing john travolta impersonations all night come on you must have noticed platform soles got a silver medallion as big as a plate skull mask he was over by the door i hadnt seen anyone like that well youd remember wouldnt you waynes face was frozen with fear you must have so what anyway he keeps staring at me i patted his arm impressed by your technique old son i said i took a look around the hall most people were milling around the punch now the rascals wayne grabbed my arm dont go away i was just going out for some fresh air dont he pulled himself together dont go hang around please whats up with you please john he keeps looking at me in a funny way he looked really frightened i gave in okay but point him out next time i let him get on with things while i tied to neaten up the towering mess of plugs and adapters that was waynes usual contribution to electrical safety if youve got the kind of gear weve got okay had you can spend hours working on it i mean do you know how many different kinds of connectors all right in the middle of the next number wayne hauled me back to the decks there see him right in the middle well there wasnt there were a couple of girls dancing with each other and everyone else were just couples who were trying to pretend the seventies hadnt happened any rhinestone cowboys in that lot would have stood out like a strawberry in an irish stew i could see that some tact and diplomacy were called for at this point wayne i said i reckon youre several coupons short of a toaster you cant see him can you well no but since he mentioned it i could see the space there was this patch of floor around the middle of the hall which everyone was keeping clear of except that they werent avoiding it you see they just didnt happen to be moving into it it was just sort of accidentally there and it stayed there it moved around a bit but it never disappeared all right i know a patch of floor cant move around just take my word for it this one did the record was ending but wayne was still in control enough to have another one spinning he faded it up a bit of an oldie that theyd all know is it still there he said staring down at the desk its a bit closer i said perhaps its after a spot prize i wanna live forever thats right be a great help people will see me and cry there were quite a few more people down there now but the empty patch was still moving around all right was being avoided among the dancers i went and stood in it it was cold it said good evening the voice came from all around me and everything seemed to slow down the dancers were just statues in a kind of black fog the music a low rumble where are you behind you now at a time like this the impulse is to turn around but youd be amazed at how good i was at resisting it youve been frightening my friend i said i did not intend to push off that doesnt work i am afraid i did turn around then he was about seven feet tall in his yes his platform soles and yes he wore flares but somehow youd expect that wayne had said they were black but that wasnt true they werent any colour at all they were simply clothesshaped holes into somewhere else black would have looked blinding white by comparison he did look a bit like john travolta from the waist down but only if you buried john travolta for about three months it really was a skull mask you could see the sting come here often do you i am always around cant say ive noticed you and i would have done you dont meet many sevenfoot sevenstone people every day especially ones that walked as though they had to think about every muscle movement in advance and acted as though they were alive and dead at the same time like cliff richard your friend has an interesting choice of music yes hes a collector you know i know could you please introduce me to him could i stop you i doubt it all right perhaps four cups but the lady serving said there was hardly anything in it at all except orange squash and homemade wine and she looked a dear old soul apart from the wolfman mask that is but i know all the dancers were standing like statues and the music was just a faint buzz and there were these all these blue and purple shadows around everything i mean drink doesnt do that wayne wasnt affected he stood with his mouth open watching us wayne i said this is a friend whose i said and you could tell i didnt take to the person because his flares were huge and he wore one of those silver identity bracelets on his wrist the sort you could moor a battleship with and they look so posey the fact that his wrist was solid bone wasnt doing anything to help either i kept thinking there was a conclusion i ought to be jumping to but i couldnt quite get a running start my head seemed to be full of wool everyones he said sooner or later i understand youre something of a collector well in a small said wayne i gather youre almost as keen as i am wayne waynes face lit up that was wayne all right ill swear if you shot him hed come alive again if it meant a chance to talk about his hobby sorry his lifetimes work gosh he said are you a collector absolutely wayne peered at him we havent met before have we he said i go to most of the collectors meetings were you at the blenheim record fest and auction i dont recall i go to so many things that was the one where the auctioneer had a heart attack oh yes i seem to remember popping in just for a few minutes very few bargains there i thought oh i dont know he was only fortythree all right inspector maybe six drinks or maybe it wasnt the drinks at all but sometimes you get the feeling dont you that you can see a little way into the future oh you dont well anyway i might not have been entirely in my right mind but i was beginning to feel pretty uncomfortable about all this well anyone would even you wayne i said stop right now if you concentrate hell go away settle down a bit please take a deep breath this is all wrong the brick wall on the other side of me paid more attention i know wayne when he meets fellow collectors they have these weekend rallies you see them in shops strange people but none of them as strange as this one he was dead strange wayne they both ignored me and inside my mind bits of my brain were jumping up and down shouting and pointing and i couldnt let myself believe what they were saying oh ive got them all he said turning back to wayne elvis presley buddy holly jim morrison jimi hendrix john lennon fairly wide spread musically said wayne have you got the complete beatles not yet and i swear they started to talk records i remember mr friend saying hed got the complete seventeenth eighteenth and nineteenthcentury composers well he would wouldnt he ive always had to do waynes fighting for him ever since we were at primary school and this had gone far enough and i grabbed mr friends shoulder and went to lay a punch right in the middle of that grinning mask and he raised his hand and i felt my fist hit an invisible wall which yielded like treacle and he took off his mask and he said two words to me and then he reached across and took waynes hand very gently and then the power amp exploded because like i said wayne wasnt very good with connectors and the church hall had electrical wiring that dated back practically to or something and then what with the decorations catching fire and everyone screaming and rushing about i didnt really know much about anything until they brought me round in the car park with half my hair burned off and the hall going up like a firework no i dont know why they havent found him either not so much as a tooth no i dont know where he is no i dont think he owed anyone any money but i think hes got a new job theres a collector whos got them all presley hendrix lennon holly and hes the only collector wholl ever get a complete collection anywhere and wayne wouldnt pass up a chance like that wherever he is now hes taking them out of their jackets with incredible care and spinning them with love on the turntables of the night sorry talking to myself there im just puzzled about one thing well millions of things actually but just one thing right at the moment i cant imagine why mr friend bothered to wear a mask because he looked just the same underneath idio officer what did he say well i daresay he comes to everyone in some sort of familiar way perhaps he just wanted to give me a hint he said drive safely no no really ill walk home thanks yes ill mind how i go
