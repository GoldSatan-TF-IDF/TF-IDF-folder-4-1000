music of kellers american hymn songs of many seasons opening the window thus i lift the sash so long shut against the flight of song all too late for vain excuse lo my captive rhymes are loose rhymes that flitting through my brain beat against my windowpane some with gayly colored wings some alas with venomed stings shall they bask in sunny rays shall they feed on sugared praise shall they stick with tangled feet on the critics poisoned sheet are the outside winds too rough is the world not wide enough go my winged verse and try go like uncle tobys fly programme reader gentle if so be such still live and live for me will it please you to be told what my tenscore pages hold here are verses that in spite of myself i needs must write like the wine that oozes first when the unsqueezed grapes have burst here are angry lines too hard says the soldier battlescarred could i smile his scars away i would blot the bitter lay written with a knitted brow read with placid wonder now throbbed such passion in my heart did his wounds once really smart here are varied strains that sing all the changes life can bring songs when joyous friends have met songs the mourners tears have wet see the banquets dead bouquet fair and fragrant in its day do they read the selfsame lines he that fasts and he that dines year by year like milestones placed mark the record friendship traced prisoned in the walls of time life has notched itself in rhyme as its seasons slid along every year a notch of song from the june of long ago when the rose was full in blow till the scarlet sage has come and the cold chrysanthemum read but not to praise or blame are not all our hearts the same for the rest they take their chance some may pay a passing glance others well they served a turn wherefore written would you learn not for glory not for pelf not be sure to please myself not for any meaner ends always by request of friends heres the cousin of a king would i do the civil thing here s the firstborn of a queen here s a slanteyed mandarin would i polish off japan would i greet this famous man prince or prelate sheik or shah figaro gi and figaro la would i just this once comply so they teased and teased till i be the truth at once confessed wavered yielded did my best turn my pages never mind if you like not all you find think not all the grains are gold sacramentos sandbanks hold every kernel has its shell every chime its harshest bell every face its weariest look every shelf its emptiest book every field its leanest sheaf every book its dullest leaf every leaf its weakest line shall it not be so with mine best for worst shall make amends find us keep us leave us friends till perchance we meet again benedicite amen october in the quiet days an oldyear song as through the forest disarrayed by chill november late i strayed a lonely minstrel of the wood was singing to the solitude i loved thy music thus i said when oer thy perch the leaves were spread sweet was thy song but sweeter now thy carol on the leafless bough sing little bird thy note shall cheer the sadness of the dying year when violets pranked the turf with blue and morning filled their cups with dew thy slender voice with rippling trill the budding april bowers would fill nor passed its joyous tones away when april rounded into may thy life shall hail no second dawn sing little bird the spring is gone and i remember welladay thy fullblown summer roundelay as when behind a broidered screen some holy maiden sings unseen with answering notes the woodland rung and every treetop found a tongue how deep the shade the groves how fair sing little bird the woods are bare the summers throbbing chant is done and mute the choral antiphon the birds have left the shivering pines to flit among the trellised vines or fan the air with scented plumes amid the lovesick orangeblooms and thou art here alone alone sing little bird the rest have flown the snow has capped yon distant hill at morn the running brook was still from driven herds the clouds that rise are like the smoke of sacrifice erelong the frozen sod shall mock the ploughshare changed to stubborn rock the brawling streams shall soon be dumb sing little bird the frosts have come fast fast the lengthening shadows creep the songless fowls are half asleep the air grows chill the setting sun may leave thee ere thy song is done the pulse that warms thy breast grow cold thy secret die with thee untold the lingering sunset still is bright sing little bird t will soon be night dorothy q a family portrait i cannot tell the story of dorothy q more simply in prose than i have told it in verse but i can add something to it dorothy was the daughter of judge edmund quincy and the niece of josiah quincy junior the young patriot and orator who died just before the american revolution of which he was one of the most eloquent and effective promoters the son of the latter josiah quincy the first mayor of boston bearing that name lived to a great age one of the most useful and honored citizens of his time the canvas of the painting was so much decayed that it had to be replaced by a new one in doing which the rapier thrust was of course filled up grandmothers mother her age i guess thirteen summers or something less girlish bust but womanly air smooth square forehead with uprolled hair lips that lover has never kissed taper fingers and slender wrist hanging sleeves of stiff brocade so they painted the little maid on her hand a parrot green sits unmoving and broods serene hold up the canvas full in view look theres a rent the light shines through dark with a centurys fringe of dust that was a redcoats rapierthrust such is the tale the lady old dorothys daughters daughter told who the painter was none may tell one whose best was not over well hard and dry it must be confessed flat as a rose that has long been pressed yet in her cheek the hues are bright dainty colors of red and white and in her slender shape are seen hint and promise of stately mien look not on her with eyes of scorn dorothy q was a lady born ay since the galloping normans came englands annals have known her name and still to the threebilled rebel town dear is that ancient names renown for many a civic wreath they won the youthful sire and the grayhaired son o damsel dorothy dorothy q strange is the gift that i owe to you such a gift as never a king save to daughter or son might bring all my tenure of heart and hand all my title to house and land mother and sister and child and wife and joy and sorrow and death and life what if a hundred years ago those closeshut lips had answered no when forth the tremulous question came that cost the maiden her norman name and under the folds that look so still the bodice swelled with the bosoms thrill should i be i or would it be one tenth another to nine tenths me soft is the breath of a maidens yes not the light gossamer stirs with less but never a cable that holds so fast through all the battles of wave and blast and never an echo of speech or song that lives in the babbling air so long there were tones in the voice that whispered then you may hear today in a hundred men o lady and lover how faint and far your images hover and here we are solid and stirring in flesh and bone edwards and dorothys all their own a goodly record for time to show of a syllable spoken so long ago shall i bless you dorothy or forgive for the tender whisper that bade me live it shall be a blessing my little maid i will heal the stab of the redcoats blade and freshen the gold of the tarnished frame and gild with a rhyme your household name so you shall smile on us brave and bright as first you greeted the mornings light and live untroubled by woes and fears through a second youth of a hundred years the organblower devoutest of my sunday friends the patient organblower bends i see his figure sink and rise forgive me heaven my wandering eyes a moment lost the next half seen his head above the scanty screen still measuring out his deep salaams through quavering hymns and panting psalms no priest that prays in gilded stole to save a rich mans mortgaged soul no sister fresh from holy vows so humbly stoops so meekly bows his large obeisance puts to shame the proudest genuflecting dame whose easter bonnet low descends with all the grace devotion lends o brother with the supple spine how much we owe those bows of thine without thine arm to lend the breeze how vain the finger on the keys though all unmatched the players skill those thousand throats were dumb and still anothers art may shape the tone the breath that fills it is thine own six days the silent memnon waits behind his temples folded gates but when the seventh days sunshine falls through rainbowed windows on the walls he breathes he sings he shouts he fills the quivering air with rapturous thrills the roof resounds the pillars shake and all the slumbering echoes wake the preacher from the bibletext with weary words my soul has vexed some stranger fumbling far astray to find the lesson for the day he tells us truths too plainly true and reads the service all askew why why the mischief cant he look beforehand in the servicebook but thou with decent mien and face art always ready in thy place thy strenuous blast whateer the tune as steady as the strong monsoon thy only dread a leathery creak or small residual extra squeak to send along the shadowy aisles a sunlit wave of dimpled smiles not all the preaching o my friend comes from the churchs pulpit end not all that bend the knee and bow yield service half so true as thou one simple task performed aright with slender skill but all thy might where honest labor does its best and leaves the player all the rest this manydiapasoned maze through which the breath of being strays whose music makes our earth divine has work for mortal hands like mine my duty lies before me lo the lever there take hold and blow and he whose hand is on the keys will play the tune as he shall please at the pantomime the house was crammed from roof to floor heads piled on heads at every door half dead with augusts seething heat i crowded on and found my seat my patience slightly out of joint my temper short of boilingpoint not quite at hate mankind as such nor yet at love them overmuch amidst the throng the pageant drew were gathered hebrews not a few blackbearded swarthy at their side dark jewelled women orienteyed if scarce a christian hopes for grace who crowds one in his narrow place what will the savage victim do whose ribs are kneaded by a jew next on my left a breathing form wedged up against me close and warm the beak that crowned the bistred face betrayed the mould of abrahams race that coalblack hair that smokebrown hue ah cursed unbelieving jew i started shuddering to the right and squeezed a second israelite then woke the evil brood of rage that slumber tongueless in their cage i stabbed in turn with silent oaths the hooknosed kite of carrion clothes the snaky usurer him that crawls and cheats beneath the golden balls moses and levi all the horde spawn of the race that slew its lord up came their murderous deeds of old the grisly story chaucer told and many an ugly tale beside of children caught and crucified i heard the ducatsweating thieves beneath the ghettos slouching eaves and thrust beyond the tented green the lepers cry unclean unclean the show went on but ill at ease my sullen eye it could not please in vain my conscience whispered shame who but their maker is to blame i thought of judas and his bribe and steeled my soul against their tribe my neighbors stirred i looked again full on the younger of the twain a fresh young cheek whose olive hue the mantling blood shows faintly through locks dark as midnight that divide and shade the neck on either side soft gentle loving eyes that gleam clear as a starlit mountain stream so looked that other child of shem the maidens boy of bethlehem and thou couldst scorn the peerless blood that flows immingled from the flood thy scutcheon spotted with the stains of norman thieves and pirate danes the new worlds foundling in thy pride scowl on the hebrew at thy side and lo the very semblance there the lord of glory deigned to wear i see that radiant image rise the flowing hair the pitying eyes the faintly crimsoned cheek that shows the blush of sharons opening rose thy hands would clasp his hallowed feet whose brethren soil thy christian seat thy lips would press his garments hem that curl in wrathful scorn for them a sudden mist a watery screen dropped like a veil before the scene the shadow floated from my soul and to my lips a whisper stole thy prophets caught the spirits flame from thee the son of mary came with thee the father deigned to dwell peace be upon thee israel rewritten after the fire while far along the eastern sky i saw the flags of havoc fly as if his forces would assault the sovereign of the starry vault and hurl him back the burning rain that seared the cities of the plain i read as on a crimson page the words of israels sceptred sage for riches make them wings and they do as an eagle fly away o vision of that sleepless night what hue shall paint the mocking light that burned and stained the orient skies where peaceful morning loves to rise as if the sun had lost his way and dawned to make a second day above how red with fiery glow how dark to those it woke below on roof and wall on dome and spire flashed the false jewels of the fire girt with her belt of glittering panes and crowned with starrygleaming vanes our northern queen in glory shone with newborn splendors not her own and stood transfigured in our eyes a victim decked for sacrifice the cloud still hovers overhead and still the midnight sky is red as the lost wanderer strays alone to seek the place he called his own his devious footprints sadly tell how changed the pathways known so well the scene how new the tale how old ere yet the ashes have grown cold again i read the words that came writ in the rubric of the flame hower we trust to mortal things each hath its pair of folded wings though long their terrors rest unspread their fatal plumes are never shed at last at last they spread in flight and blot the day and blast then night hope only hope of all that clings around us never spreads her wings love though he break his earthly chain still whispers he will come again but faith that soars to seek the sky shall teach our halffledged souls to fly and find beyond the smoke and flame the cloudless azure whence they came a ballad of the boston teaparty read at a meeting of the massachusetts historical society no never such a draught was poured since hebe served with nectar the bright olympians and their lord her overkind protector since father noah squeezed the grape and took to such behaving as would have shamed our grandsire ape before the days of shaving no neer was mingled such a draught in palace hall or arbor as freemen brewed and tyrants quaffed that night in boston harbor the western warclouds crimson stained the thames the clyde the shannon full many a sixfoot grenadier the flattened grass had measured and many a mother many a year her tearful memories treasured fast spread the tempests darkening pall the mighty realms were troubled the storm broke loose but first of all the boston teapot bubbled an evening party only that no formal invitation no goldlaced coat no stiff cravat no feast in contemplation no silkrobed dames no fiddling band no flowers no songs no dancing a tribe of red men axe in hand behold the guests advancing how fast the stragglers join the throng from stall and workshop gathered the lively barber skips along and leaves a chin halflathered the smith has flung his hammer down the horseshoe still is glowing the truant tapster at the crown has left a beercask flowing the coopers boys have dropped the adze and trot behind their master up run the tarry shipyard lads the crowd is hurrying faster out from the millponds purlieus gush the streams of whitefaced millers and down their slippery alleys rush the lusty young forthillers the ropewalk lends its prentice crew the tories seize the omen ay boys youll soon have work to do for englands rebel foemen king hancock adams and their gang that fire the mob with treason when these we shoot and those we hang the town will come to reason on on to where the teaships ride and now their ranks are forming a rush and up the dartmouths side the mohawk band is swarming see the fierce natives what a glimpse of paint and fur and feather as all at once the fullgrown imps light on the deck together a scarf the pigtails secret keeps a blanket hides the breeches and out the cursed cargo leaps and overboard it pitches o woman at the evening board so gracious sweet and purring so happy while the tea is poured so blest while spoons are stirring what martyr can compare with thee the mother wife or daughter that night instead of best bohea condemned to milk and water ah little dreams the quiet dame who plies with rock and spindle the patient flax how great a flame yon little spark shall kindle the lurid morning shall reveal a fire no king can smother where british flint and boston steel have clashed against each other old charters shrivel in its track his worships bench has crumbled it climbs and clasps the unionjack its blazoned pomp is humbled the flags go down on land and sea like corn before the reapers so burned the fire that brewed the tea that boston served her keepers the waves that wrought a centurys wreck have rolled oer whig and tory the mohawks on the dartmouths deck still live in song and story the waters in the rebel bay have kept the tealeaf savor our old northenders in their spray still taste a hyson flavor and freedoms teacup still oerflows with ever fresh libations to cheat of slumber all her foes and cheer the wakening nations nearing the snowline slow toiling upward from the misty vale i leave the bright enamelled zones below no more for me their beauteous bloom shall glow their lingering sweetness load the morning gale few are the slender flowerets scentless pale that on their iceclad stems all trembling blow along the margin of unmelting snow yet with unsaddened voice thy verge i hail white realm of peace above the flowering line welcome thy frozen domes thy rocky spires oer thee undimmed the moongirt planets shine on thy majestic altars fade the fires that filled the air with smoke of vain desires and all the unclouded blue of heaven is thine in wartime to canaan a puritan war song this poem published anonymously in the boston evening transcript was claimed by several persons three if i remember correctly whose names i have or have had but never thought it worth while to publish where are you going soldiers with banner gun and sword we re marching south to canaan to battle for the lord what captain leads your armies along the rebel coasts the mighty one of israel his name is lord of hosts to canaan to canaan the lord has led us forth to blow before the heathen walls the trumpets of the north what flag is this you carry along the sea and shore the same our grandsires lifted up the same our fathers bore in many a battles tempest it shed the crimson rain what god has woven in his loom let no man rend in twain to canaan to canaan the lord has led us forth to plant upon the rebel towers the banners of the north what troop is this that follows all armed with picks and spades these are the swarthy bondsmen the ironskin brigades theyll pile up freedoms breastwork they ll scoop out rebels graves who then will be their owner and march them off for slaves to canaan to canaan the lord has led us forth to strike upon the captives chain the hammers of the north what song is this youre singing the same that israel sung when moses led the mighty choir and miriams timbrel rung to canaan to canaan the priests and maidens cried to canaan to canaan the peoples voice replied to canaan to canaan the lord has led us forth to thunder through its adder dens the anthems of the north when canaans hosts are scattered and all her walls lie flat what follows next in order the lord will see to that well break the tyrants sceptre we ll build the peoples throne when half the world is freedoms then all the worlds our own to canaan to canaan the lord has led us forth to sweep the rebel threshingfloors a whirlwind from the north august thus saith the lord i offer thee three things in poisonous dens where traitors hide like bats that fear the day while all the land our charters claim is sweating blood and breathing flame dead to their countrys woe and shame the recreants whisper stay in peaceful homes where patriot fires on loves own altars glow the mother hides her trembling fear the wife the sister checks a tear to breathe the parting word of cheer soldier of freedom go in halls where luxury lies at ease and mammon keeps his state where flatterers fawn and menials crouch the dreamer startled from his couch wrings a few counters from his pouch and murmurs faintly wait in weary camps on trampled plains that ring with fife and drum the battling host whose harness gleams along the crimsonflowing streams calls like a warning voice in dreams we want you brother come choose ye whose bidding ye will do to go to wait to stay sons of the freedomloving town heirs of the fathers old renown the servile yoke the civic crown await your choice today the stake is laid o gallant youth with yet unsilvered brow if heaven should lose and hell should win on whom shall lie the mortal sin that cries aloud it might have been god calls you answer now never or now an appeal listen young heroes your country is calling time strikes the hour for the brave and the true now while the foremost are fighting and falling fill up the ranks that have opened for you you whom the fathers made free and defended stain not the scroll that emblazons their fame you whose fair heritage spotless descended leave not your children a birthright of shame stay not for questions while freedom stands gasping wait not till honor lies wrapped in his pall brief the lips meeting be swift the hands clasping off for the wars is enough for them all break from the arms that would fondly caress you hark t is the bugleblast sabres are drawn mothers shall pray for you fathers shall bless you maidens shall weep for you when you are gone never or now cries the blood of a nation poured on the turf where the red rose should bloom now is the day and the hour of salvation never or now peals the trumpet of doom never or now roars the hoarsethroated cannon through the black canopy blotting the skies never or now flaps the shellblasted pennon oer the deep ooze where the cumberland lies from the foul dens where our brothers are dying aliens and foes in the land of their birth from the rank swamps where our martyrs are lying pleading in vain for a handful of earth from the hot plains where they perish outnumbered furrowed and ridged by the battlefields plough comes the loud summons too long you have slumbered hear the last angeltrump never or now one country one country treasons writhing asp struck madly at her girdles clasp and hatred wrenched with might and main to rend its welded links in twain while mammon hugged his golden calf content to take one broken half while thankless churls stood idly by and heard unmoved a nations cry one country nay the tyrant crew shrieked from their dens it shall be two ill bodes to us this monstrous birth that scowls on all the thrones of earth too broad yon starry cluster shines too proudly tower the newworld pines tear down the banner of the free and cleave their land from sea to sea one country still though foe and friend our seamless empire strove to rend safe safe though all the fiends of hell join the red murderers battleyell what though the lifted sabres gleam the cannons frown by shore and stream the sabres clash the cannons thrill in wild accord one country still one country in her stress and strain we heard the breaking of a chain look where the conquering nation swings her iron flail its shivered rings forged by the rebels crimson hand that bolt of wrath shall scourge the land till peace proclaims on sea and shore one country now and evermore god save the flag washed in the blood of the brave and the blooming snatched from the altars of insolent foes burning with starfires but never consuming flash its broad ribbons of lily and rose vainly the prophets of baal would rend it vainly his worshippers pray for its fall thousands have died for it millions defend it emblem of justice and mercy to all justice that reddens the sky with her terrors mercy that comes with her whitehanded train soothing all passions redeeming all errors sheathing the sabre and breaking the chain borne on the deluge of old usurpations drifted our ark oer the desolate seas

seasons that remain strike not the level of the golden grain but heap it high with years that earth may gain what heaven can lose for heaven is rich in song do not all poets dying still prolong their broken chants amid the seraph throng where blind no more ionias bard is seen and englands heavenly minstrel sits between the mantuan and the wancheeked florentine this was the first sweet singer in the cage of our closewoven life a newborn age claims in his vesper song its heritage spare us oh spare us long our hearts desire moloch who calls our children through the fire leaves us the gentle master of the lyre we count not on the dial of the sun the hours the minutes that his sands have run rather as on those flowers that one by one from earliest dawn their ordered bloom display till evenings planet with her guiding ray leads in the blind old mother of the day we reckon by his songs each song a flower the long long daylight numbering hour by hour each breathing sweetness like a bridal bower his morning glory shall we eer forget his noontides fullblown lily coronet his evening primrose has not opened yet nay even if creeping time should hide the skies in midnight from his centuryladen eyes darkened like his who sang of paradise would not some hidden songbud open bright as the resplendent cactus of the night that floods the gloom with fragrance and with light how can we praise the verse whose music flows with solemn cadence and majestic close pure as the dew that filters through the rose how shall we thank him that in evil days he faltered never nor for blame nor praise nor hire nor party shamed his earlier lays but as his boyhood was of manliest hue so to his youth his manly years were true all dyed in royal purple through and through he for whose touch the lyre of heaven is strung needs not the flattering toil of mortal tongue let not the singer grieve to die unsung marbles forget their message to mankind in his own verse the poet still we find in his own page his memory lives enshrined as in their amber sweets the smothered bees as the fair cedar fallen before the breeze lies selfembalmed amidst the mouldering trees poets like youngest children never grow out of their mothers fondness nature so holds their soft hands and will not let them go till at the last they track with even feet her rhythmic footsteps and their pulses beat twinned with her pulses and their lips repeat the secrets she has told them as their own thus is the inmost soul of nature known and the rapt minstrel shares her awful throne o lover of her mountains and her woods her bridal chambers leafy solitudes where love himself with tremulous step intrudes her snows fall harmless on thy sacred fire far be the day that claims thy sounding lyre to join the music of the angel choir yet since lifes amplest measure must be filled since throbbing hearts must be forever stilled and all must fade that evening sunsets gild grant father ere he close the mortal eyes that see

though on his turf we tread green is the wreath their brows so long have worn the minstrels of the morn who while the orient burned with newborn flame caught that celestial fire and struck a nations lyre these taught the western winds the poets name theirs the first opening buds the maiden flowers of fame count not our poet dead the stars shall watch his bed the rose of june its fragrant life renew his blushing mound to strew and all the tuneful throats of summer swell with trills as crystalclear as when he wooed the ear of the young muse that haunts each wooded dell with songs of that rough land he loved so long and well he sleeps he cannot die as evenings longdrawn sigh lifting the roseleaves on his peaceful mound spreads all their sweets around so laden with his song the breezes blow from where the rustling sedge frets our rude oceans edge to the smooth sea beyond the peaks of snow his soul the air enshrines and leaves but dust below hymn for the celebration at the laying of

wallowing beast the sea has sucked between his sharp thin lips the wedgy waves what heaps of diamonds rubies emeralds pearls what piles of shekels talents ducats crowns what bales of tyrian mantles indian shawls of laces that have blanked the weavers eyes of silken tissues wrought by worm and man the halfstarved workman and the wellfed worm what marbles bronzes pictures parchments books what

rebuke our babbling peace they say mortal be still my noisy tongue is hushed and with my trembling finger on my lips my soul exclaims in ecstasy man at wheel belay cabin passenger ah yes delay it calls nor haste to break the charm of stillness with an idle word o mariner i love thee for thy thought strides even with my own nay flies before thou art a brother to the wind and wave have they not music for thine ear as mine when the wild tempest makes thy ship his lyre smiting a cavernous basso from the shrouds and climbing up his gamut through the stays through buntlines bowlines ratlines till it shrills an alto keener than the locust sings and all the great a olian orchestra storms out its mad sonata in the gale is not the scene a wondrous and man at wheel a vast cabin passenger ah yes a vast a vast and wondrous scene i see thy soul is open as the day that holds the sunshine in its azure bowl to all the solemn glories of the deep tell me o mariner dost thou never feel the grandeur of thine office to control the keel that cuts the ocean like a knife and leaves a wake behind it like a seam in the great shining garment of the world man at wheel belay yr jaw y swab y

blossom of song while i turn my fond glance on the monarch of piers whose throne has stood firm through his eightscore of years my thought travels backward and reaches the day when they drove the first pile on the edge of the bay see the joiner the shipwright the smith from his forge the redcoat who shoulders his gun for king george the shopman the prentice the boys from the lane the parson the doctor with goldheaded cane come trooping down king street where now may be seen the pulleys and ropes of a mighty machine the weight rises slowly it drops with a thud and to the great timber sinks deep in the mud they are gone the stout craftsmen that hammered the piles and the squaretoed old boys in the threecornered tiles the breeches the buckles have faded from view and the parsons white wig and the ribbontied queue the redcoats have vanished the last grenadier stepped into the boat from the end of our pier they found that our hills were not easy to climb and the order came

like the waves of the sea a poem served to order phi beta kappa june the caliph ordered up his cook and scowling with a fearful look that meant we stand no gammon tomorrow just at two he said hassan our cook will lose his head or serve us up a salmon great sire the trembling chef replied lord of the earth and all beside sun moon and stars and so on look in eothen there youll find a list of titles never mind i have nt time to go on great sire and so forth thus he spoke your highness must intend a joke it doesnt stand to reason for one to order salmon brought unless that fish is sometimes caught and also is in season our luck of late is shocking bad in fact the latest catch we had we kept the matter shady but hauling in our nets alack we found no salmon but a sack that held your honored lady allah is great the caliph said my poor zuleika you are dead i once took interest in you perhaps my lord youd like to know we cut the lines and let her go allah be praised continue it is nt hard ones hook to bait and squatting down to watch and wait to see the cork go under at last suppose youve got your bite you twitch away with all your might youve hooked an eel by thunder the caliph patted hassans head slave thou hast spoken well he said and won thy masters favor yes since what happened t other morn the salmon of the golden horn might have a doubtful flavor that last remark about the eel has also justice that we feel quite to our satisfaction tomorrow we dispense with fish and for the present if you wish youll keep your bulbous fraction thanks thanks the grateful chef replied his nutrient feature showing wide the gleam of arches dental to cut my head off wouldnt pay i find it useful every day as well as ornamental brothers i hope you will not fail to see the moral of my tale and kindly to receive it you know your anniversary pie must have its crust though hard and dry and some prefer to leave it how oft before these youths were born ive fished in fancys golden horn for what the muse might send me how gayly then i cast the line when all the morning sky was mine and hope her flies would lend me and now i hear our despots call and come like hassan to the hall if theres a slave i am one my bait no longer flies but worms i ve caught lord bless me how he squirms an eel and not a salmon the fountain of youth read at the meeting of the harvard alumni association june the fount the spaniard sought in vain through all the land of flowers leaps glittering from the sandy plain our classic grove embowers here youth unchanging blooms and smiles here dwells eternal spring and warm from hopes elysian isles the winds their perfume bring here every leaf is in the bud each singing throat in tune and bright oer evenings silver flood shines the young crescent moon what wonder age forgets his staff and lays his glasses down and grayhaired grandsires look and laugh as when their locks were brown with ears grown dull and eyes grown dim they greet the joyous day that calls them to the fountains brim to wash their years away what change has clothed the ancient sire in sudden youth for to the judge the doctor and the squire are jack and bill and joe and be his titles what they will in spite of manhoods claim the graybeard is a schoolboy still and loves his schoolboy name it calms the rulers stormy breast whom hurrying care pursues and brings a sense of peace and rest like slippers after shoes and what are all the prizes won to youths enchanted view and what is all the man has done to what the boy may do o blessed fount whose waters flow alike for sire and son that melts our winters frost and snow and makes all ages one i pledge the sparkling fountains tide that flings its golden shower with age to fill and youth to guide still fresh in morning flower flow on with everwidening stream in everbrightening morn our storys pride our futures dream the hope of times unborn no time like the old time there is no time like the old time when you and i were young when the buds of april blossomed and the birds of springtime sung the gardens brightest glories by summer suns are nursed but oh the sweet sweet violets the flowers that opened first there is no place like the old place where you and i were born where we lifted first our eyelids on the splendors of the morn from the milkwhite breast that warmed us from the clinging arms that bore where the dear eyes glistened oer us that will look on us no more there is no friend like the old friend who has shared our morning days no greeting like his welcome no homage like his praise fame is the scentless sunflower with gaudy crown of gold but friendship is the breathing rose with sweets in every fold there is no love like the old love that we courted in our pride though our leaves are falling falling and were fading side by side there are blossoms all around us with the colors of our dawn and we live in borrowed sunshine when the daystar is withdrawn there are no times like the old times they shall never be forgot there is no place like the old place keep green the dear old spot there are no friends like our old friends may heaven prolong their lives there are no loves like our old loves god bless our loving wives a hymn of peace sung at the jubilee june to the music of sellers american hymn angel of peace thou hast wandered too long spread thy white wings to the sunshine of
