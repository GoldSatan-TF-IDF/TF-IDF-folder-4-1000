the trials and tribulations of myron blumberg dragon by mike resnick sylvias always after me its a skin condition she says its a wart i say its a skin condition and youre going to the doctor and dont touch me until he gives you something for it so i go to the doctor and he gives me something for it and she makes me sleep in the guest room anyway myron youre green she says you mean like i dont know the ropes or you mean like i got ptomaine poisoning from your tuna salad i ask i mean like youre the same color as the grass she says maybe its the lotion the doctor gave me i say it doesnt come off on your shirts she says so maybe it all dried up i say maybe she says but stay in your room when i have the girls over for mah jong i told you not to smoke in bed she says i know i says well then she says well then what i say well then why are you smoking in bed she says im not i say then how did your pillow get scorched she says not from the passion of your lovemaking thats for sure i say dont be disgusting she says then i belch and out comes all this smoke and fire and she says if i ever lie to her again shes going to give me a rolling pin upside my head and then she walks out of the house before i can tell her i havent lit up a cigarette in four days it looks like a cancerous growth she says its just a swelling i say there must be a busted spring in the chair you should see a doctor she says last time you sent me to a doctor i turned green i say this time youll see a specialist she says a specialist in swellings i ask a specialist in tails she says well she asks well what what did he say he says it looks like a tail i say hah she says i knew it i wonder if our insurance covers tails i say is he going to amputate it she asks i dont think so i say why because even if our insurance covers getting rid of tails it doesnt cover growing them she says what am i going to do with you myron weve got a bar mitzvah to attend this saturday and youre green and all covered with scales and you keep belching smoke and fire and now youre growing a tail what would people say theyd say there goes a wellmatched couple i answer that is not funny she says what am i going to do with you i mean it was bad enough when you just sat around the house watching football and reading playboy you might fix some dinner while youre thinking about it i say what do you want she asks saint george i am about to lose my temper and tell her to stop teasing me about my condition when it occurs to me that saint george would go very well with pickles and relish between a couple of pieces of rye bread it is when my arms turn into an extra set of legs that she really hits the roof this is just too much she says its bad enough that i cant let any of my friends see you and that we had to redecorate the house with asbestos wallpaper its mauve and she hates mauve but now you cant even button your own shirts or tie your shoes they dont fit anyway i point out see she says and then repeats it see now well have to get you a whole new wardrobe why are you doing this to me myron to you i say god hates me she says i could have married nate sobel the banker or harold yingleman whos become a wall street big shot and instead i married you and now god is punishing me as if watching you spill gravy onto your shirt for years wasnt punishment enough you act like youre the one whos turning into a dragon i complain oh shut up and stop feeling sorry for yourself she says she holds out the roast its a bit rare blow on it and make yourself useful she pauses and if you breathe on me ill give you such a slap thats my sylvia one little cockroach can send her screaming from the house she sees a spider she calls five different exterminators god forbid a mouse should come into the garage looking for a snack but show her a dragon and suddenly shes joan of arc and wonder woman and golda meier all rolled into one steeleyed yenta with blue hair and a double chin where are you going she says out i say out where she says just out i say i have been cooped up in this house for almost two months and i have to get some fresh air so you think youre just going to walk down the street like any normal person she says that maybe youll trade jokes with bernie goldberg and flirt with mrs noodleman like you always do why not i say well i wont hear of it she says im not going to have the whole neighborhood talking about how sylvia blumberg married a dragon for gods sakes i figure it is time to make a stand so i say i am going out and thats that dont you speak to me in that tone of voice myron she says and i stop just before she reaches for the rolling pin she pauses for a moment then looks up if you absolutely must go for a walk she says i will put a leash on you and tell everyone you are my new dog i dont look very much like a dog i say you look even less like myron blumberg she answers just dont talk to anyone while were out i couldnt bear the humiliation so we go out and when mrs noodleman passes by sylvia tells me to hold my breath and not exhale any fire and then we come to bernie goldberg who is just coming home from shopping at the delicatessan and sylvia tells him i am her new dog and he asks what breed i am and she says shes not sure and he says he thinks maybe i am imported from ireland and then sylvia yanks on the leash and we walk to the corner hes still looking at you she whispers so i say i dont think he believes youre a dog theres nothing we can do about that i say yes there is she says leading me over to a fire hydrant lift your leg on this that will convince him i dont think dragons lift their legs sylvia i say why do you persist in embarrassing me she says lift your leg i cant i say whoever heard of a dragon that couldnt lift its leg she insists you dont have to do anything disgusting its just to show that knowitall bernie goldberg i try and i fall over on my side what good are you demands sylvia as bernie stares at me blinking his eyes furiously behind his thick bifocals help me up i says im not used to having all these legs myron she says as she drags me to my feet the situation is becoming intolerable somethings got to be done before you make me the laughingstock of the entire neighborhood this is the last straw she says ripping open the envelope what is i ask the state has refused to extend your unemployment benefits they dont care that youre a dragon as long as youre an able bodied one she glares at me and youre going through twenty pounds of meat a day do you know how much that costs i shrug what can i say dragons get hungry why are you always so selfish myron she says why cant you graze in the back yard like a horse or something i dont think dragons like grass i say and thats it she demands you wont even try ill try ill try i say with a sigh and go out to the back yard it doesnt look like caesar salad but i close my eyes lean down and open my mouth sylvia hides me in the basement just before the fire department comes to save whats left of the garage you did that on purpose she says accusingly after the firemen have left i didnt i say its just that my flame seems to be getting bigger every day while our bank account is getting smaller she says either you get a job or youll have ask your brother sidney for a loan it is an easy choice because when sidney dies they will need a crowbar to pry his fingers off the first dollar he ever made and every subsequent one as well so i go out to look for work you would be surprised at how difficult it is for an honest industrious dragon to find work in our neighborhood stuart kominsky puts me on as a sandblaster but when i melt the stone he fires me after only half a day on the job herbert baumann says maybe i could give kids rides on my back when he reopens the carnival but it is closed until next spring phil rosenheim who has never struck me as a bigot before says he wont hire anyone with green skin muriel weinstein tells me shed be happy to take me on just in case some outoftown dragons come by to look at some of her real estate listings and shell call me the moment that happens but somehow i know that she wont finally i latch on with milt feins heating company winters coming on and hes shorthanded and when a furnace goes out he pays me seventeen dollars an hour to go to the scene and breathe into the vents and keep the building warm until he can get there and solve the problem the first week i make which is more than i have ever made in my life and the second week we are so busy i get timeandahalf on the weekend and take home almost seven hundred dollars and sylvia is so happy that she buys a new dress and dyes her hair bright red and just when i am thinking that things are too good to last it turns out that things are too good to last one day i start breathing into the ventillation shaft in an office building and nothing happens except that milt fein lays me off two days later i wake up and i have hands again and the next morning most of my scales are gone i knew it screams sylvia you finally find something youre good at and then you decide not to be a dragon any longer i didnt exactly decide i say it just kind of happened why are you doing this to me myron she demands im not doing anything i say i seem to be un doing this is terrible she says look at you youre hardly green at all why does god hate me so four days later i am the old myron blumberg again which as you can imagine is quite a relief to me two weeks after that sylvia packs up her clothes and the portable tv and the cuisinart and leaves without so much as a goodbye note the divorce papers arrive six weeks later i still get cards from her every yom kippur and chanukah the last time i hear from her she has married a gryphon sylvia who hates snakes and cant stand to be stared at boy do i not envy him the end
