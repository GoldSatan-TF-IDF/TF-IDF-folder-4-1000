the adventure of the pearly gates by mike resnick it was most disconcerting one moment i was tumbling over the falls at reichenbach my arms locked around professor moriarty and the next moment i seemed to be standing by myself in a bleak gray featureless landscape i was completely dry which seemed not at all surprising though there was no reason why it should not have been also i had felt my leg shatter against the rocks as we began our plunge and yet i felt no pain whatsoever suddenly i remembered moriarty i looked around for him but he was nowhere to be seen there was an incredibly bright light up ahead and i found myself drawn to it what happened next i can remember but hazily the gist of it is that i found myself in of all places heaven how long i remained there i do not know for there is no means by which one can measure duration there i only know that i felt i might as well have been in the other place so bored was i with the eternal peace and perfection of my surroundings it is an admission that would certainly offend all churchmen but if there is one place in all the cosmos for which i am uniquely unsuited it is heaven in fact i soon began to suspect that i was indeed in hell for if each of us makes his own heaven and his own hell then my hell must surely be a place where all my training and all my powers are of no use whatsoever a place where the game is never afoot indeed where there is no game at all cannot possibly qualify as a paradise for a man such as myself when i was bored beyond endurance back on earth i had discovered a method of relief but this was denied me in my current circumstances still it was a craving for cerebral stimulation not for a seven percent solution of coccaine that consumed me and then when i was sure that i was facing an eternity of boredom and was regretting all the chances i had foresaken to commit such sins as might have placed me in a situation where at least i would have had the challenge of escaping i found myself confronted by a glowing entity that soon manifested itself in the outward form of a man with pale blue eyes and a massive white beard he wore a robe of white and above his head floated a golden halo suddenly i too took on human shape and i was amazed to discover that i had not until this very moment realized that i had no longer possessed a body hello mr holmes said my visitor welcome saint peter i replied with my newfound voice you know who i am he said surprised your indoctrination period is supposed to be instantly forgotten i remember nothing of my indoctrination period i assured him then how could you possibly know who i am observation analysis and deduction i explained you have obviously sought me out for you addressed me by my name and since i have evidently been a discorporate being one of many billions i assume you have the ability to distinguish between us all that implies a certain authority you have taken the body you used when you were alive and i perceive that the slight indentations on the fingers of your right hand were made by a crude fishing line you possess a halo while i do not which therefore implies that you are a saint now who among the many saints was a fisherman and would have some authority in heaven saint peter smiled you are quite amazing mr holmes i am quite bored saint peter i know he said and for this i am sorry you are unique among all the souls in heaven in your discontent that is no longer true i said for do i not perceive a certain lack of content upon your own features that is correct mr holmes he agreed we have a problem here a problem of my own making and i have elected to solicit your aid in solving it it seems the very least i can do to make your stay here more tolerable to you he paused awkwardly also it may well be that you are the one soul in my domain who is capable of solving it cannot god instantly solve any problem that arises i asked he can and eventually he will but since i have created this problem i requested that i be allowed to solve it or attempt to solve it first how much time has he given you time has no meaning here mr holmes if he determines that i will fail he will correct the problem himself he paused again i hope you will be able to assist me to redeem myself in his eyes i shall certainly do my best i assured him please state the nature of the problem it is most humiliating mr holmes he began for time beyond memory i have been the keeper of the pearly gates no one can enter heaven without my approval and until recently i had never made a mistake and now you have he nodded his head wearily now i have a huge mistake cant you simply seek out the soul as you have sought me out and cast it out i wish it were that simple mr holmes he replied a caligula a tamerlaine an attila i could find with no difficulty but this soul though it is blackened beyond belief has thus far managed to elude me i see i said i am surprised that five such hideous murders do not make it instantly discernable then you know he exclaimed that you seek jack the ripper i replied elementary all of the others you mentioned were identified with their crimes but the rippers identity was never discovered further since the man was mentally unbalanced it seems possible to me based on my admittedly limited knowledge of heaven that if he feels no guilt his soul displays no guilt you are everything i had hoped you would be mr holmes said saint peter not quite everything i said for i do not understand your concern if the rippers soul displays no taint why bother seeking him out after all the man was obviously insane and not responsible for his actions on earth yes i would not hesitate to lock him away where he could do no further damage but here in heaven what possible harm can he do things are not as simple as you believe them to be mr holmes replied saint peter here we exist on a spiritual plane but the same is not true of purgatory or hell recently an unseen soul has been attempting to open the pearly gates from this side he frowned they were made to withstand efforts from without but not within another attempt or two and the soul may actually succeed once possessed of ectoplasmic attributes there is no limit to the damage he could do in purgatory then why not simply let him out if i leave the gates open for him we could be overwhelmed by even more unfit souls attempting to enter i see i said what leads you to believe that it is the ripper just as there is no duration in heaven neither is there location the pearly gates though quite small themselves exist in all locations ah i said finally comprehending the nature of the problem would i be correct in assuming that the attempt to break out was made in the vicinity of the souls of elizabeth stride annie chapman catherine eddowes mary kelly and mary ann nicholls his five victims said saint peter nodding actually two of them are beyond even his reach but stride chapman and kelly are in purgatory can you bring those three to heaven i asked as bait asked saint peter i am afraid not no one may enter heaven before his or her time besides he added there is nothing he can do to them in spiritual form as you yourself know one cannot even communicate with other souls here one spends all eternity reveling in the glory of god so that is what one does here i said wryly please mr holmes he said severely i apologize i said well it seems we must set a trap for the ripper on his next escape attempt can we be sure he will continue his attempts to escape he is perhaps the one soul less suited to heaven that i myself i assured him it seems an impossible undertaking said saint peter morosely he could try to leave at any point he will attempt to leave in the vicinity of his victims i answered how can you be certain of that asked saint peter because those slayings were without motive i do not understand where there is no motive i explained there is no reason to stop you may rest assured that he will attempt to reach them again even so how am i to apprehend him or even identify him asked saint peter is location necessarily meaningless in heaven i asked he stared at me uncomprehendingly let me restate that i said can you direct the pearly gates to remain in the vicinity of the souls in question he shook his head you do not comprehend mr holmes they exist in all times and places at once i see i said wishing i had my pipe to draw upon now that i was in human form can you create a second gate it would not be the same said saint peter it neednt be the same as long as it similar to the perception of a soul he would know instantly i shook my head he is quite insane his thought processes such as they are are aberrant if you do as i suggest and place a false gate near the souls of his victims my guess is that he will not pause to notice the difference he is somehow drawn to them and this will be a barrier to his desires he will be more interested in attacking it than in analyzing it even if he were capable of the latter which i am inclined to doubt youre quite sure asked saint peter doubtfully he is compelled to perform his carnage upon prostitutes for whatever reason these seem to be the only souls he can identify as prostitutes therefore it is these that he wishes to attack i paused again create the false gates the soul that goes through them will be the one you seek i hope you are correct mr holmes he said pride is a sin but even i have a modicum of it and i should hate to be shamed before my lord and with that he was gone he returned after an indeterminate length of time a triumphant smile upon his face i assume that our little ruse worked i said exactly as you said it would replied saint peter jack the ripper is now where he belongs and shall never desecrate heaven with his presence again he stared at me you should be thrilled mr holmes and yet you look unhappy i envy him in a way i said for at least he now has a challenge do not envy him said saint peter far from having a challenge he can look forward to nothing but eternal suffering i have that in common with him i replied bitterly perhaps not said saint peter i was instantly alert oh you have saved me from shame and embarrassment he said the very least i can do is reward you how i rather thought you might have a suggestion this may be heaven to you i said but it is hell to me if you truly wish to reward me send me to where i can put my abilities to use there is evil abroad in the world i am uniquely qualified to combat it you would really turn your back on heaven to continue your pursuit of injustice to put yourself at risk on almost a daily basis asked saint peter i would even knowing that should you fall from the path of righteousness and it is a trickier path than your churches would have you believe this might not be your ultimate destination even so and privately i thought especially so then i see no reason why i should not grant your request said saint peter thank god i muttered saint peter smiled again thank him yourself when you think of it he does listen you know suddenly i found myself back in that infinite gray landscape i had encountered after going over the falls at reichenbach only this time instead of a shining light i thought i could see a city in the distance
