frankie the spook drawing her close to him while breathing heavily with unspent passion he slid his hand down the small of her back around to her rib cage up under her the image of sir francis bacon stopped reading and winced this is really quite dreadful he announced firmly really asked marvin piltch bacon nodded even worse than the last batch you have set a new standard of ineptitude marvin sighed i was afraid of that and this reference to a boob continued bacon what exactly is a boob a tit i beg your pardon a female breast according to my dictionary programs it must be a very unintelligent female breast to be termed a boob well said marvin with a shrug when you get right down to cases i suppose it is it doesnt make any sense continued bacon what slang do you use for the elbow do you call it a fool not very often admitted marvin ah said bacon then you think that the elbow is more intelligent than the breast marvin shrugged again i have to admit its not a subject that ive given a lot of thought to i know in fact if there is a subject anywhere in the universe that you have given a lot of thought to you certainly havent incorporated it in your writings actually there is one subject that ive given considerable thought to oh said bacon arching an eyebrow and what is that marvin smiled you somehow i foresaw that the conversation would eventually take this course said bacon sardonically then you know what im going to ask you certainly marvin leaned forward and squinted at bacons image on his conputer screen will you do it will the greatest writer in the history of the human race ghostwrite your pitiful little novel sneered bacon absolutely not but you ghosted for shakespeare protested marvin thats why i had my computer assemble you marvin go write limpware and leave me alone its called software whatever its called it is obvious to me that you were meant to work with computers your ignorance of the world at large is superceded only by your ignorance of the english language thats why i need you no but ive got a contract no and its got penalty clauses for coming in late then submit it on time and if the editor rejects it ive got to return the advance what is that to me if i have to return the advance ill have to pawn the computer to raise the money good said bacon then ill soon be speaking with someone who has a serious interest in exchanging ideas rather than stealing them i didnt steal anything snapped marvin marvin i hate to be blunt but you havent had an original idea in your nondescript life bacon grimaced at least shakespeare knew he wanted to write plays and you helped him helped him repeated bacon furiously who do you think wrote all those plays his image made an effort to recover its selfcontrol the man was a fool a complete and utter fool to his dying day he never understood why i wouldnt write henry ix and yet even now centuries later that dimwit gets all the credit for my work my creativity my genius and you have the gall to ask me to become a ghostwriter again i didnt know you were so bitter said marvin did you know that that moron wanted to set troilus and cressida in rome romes a very pretty city im told offered marvin bah muttered bacon turn me off i cant said marvin the book is due in two weeks romes a very pretty city im told echoed bacon sarcastically perhaps you can hide there from your creditors youre not being very responsive complained marvin im certain that i will regret having asked but how did a literary maladroit like you ever receive a commission to write a book in the first place my exwifes cousin is an editor i got the assignment while we were still married anyone who buys a manuscript from you deserves exactly what he gets said bacon which in my professional opinion will be nothing but i cant return the advance whined marvin its already spent a shakespearean tragedy said bacon mockingly what do you want peace and quiet i mean to write the book go away and leave me alone i cant i have no one else to turn to you should have thought of that before taking on such an awesome responsibility after all not every artiste can achieve the high literary standard required of what was the name of this magnum opus meter maids in bondage bacon grinned do have fun im begging you said marvin desperately and im refusing you name your price what possible use have i for money in my present condition replied bacon what can you use solitude what else bacon stared out at him for a long moment his eyes narrowed his lean fingers rubbing his chin thoughtfully if i agree to write this book for you i will want a favor in return anything i intend to write my autobiography which will end the controversy concerning the authorship of shakespeares plays once and for all it will be your obligation to make certain that it is published and publicized throughout the world until every new edition of shakespeare names me as the true author that could take decades im more than years old replied bacon i have a few decades to spare but i dont protested marvin it was nice knowing you marvin be sure to turn out the light when you leave the room you wouldnt settle for a nice plaster bust of you in the local art museum goodbye marvin how about a poster ive got a friend who owns a silkscreen plant bacon merely stared at him and made no reply all right all right said marvin in resignation its a deal i have no way of forcing you to keep your promise said bacon but as theres a god in heaven ill haunt you every day and night of your life if you should break your work to me i said id do it all right replied bacon im going to need a little backgrounding before i start writing its just a sex book it wont be when i get through with it marvin shrugged all right anything you need just ask if i dont have it ill get it lets start with some information such as what is a meter maid bacon finished ghosting the manuscript in nine days marvin changed eleven words that he didnt understand the only eleven corrections the stunned copy editor made on the manuscript before sending it off to the printer and then decided to take a month off before looking for a new way to make a living and fend off his creditors as it turned out he only had to wait days its a hit plays are hits books are blockbusters bacon corrected him well whatever it is were rich marvin paused by the way how the hell did you learn a word like blockbuster they didnt have blockbusters back in your time im cooped up in here all day and all night with a bunch of word processing programs answered bacon so having nothing better to do with my time i read the dictionaries oh said marvin well getting back to the news we actually got reviewed in the new york times they called it a mock elizabethian erotic masterpiece and said it was even more bitingly satirical than candy it was more bitingly satirical than candy halfway through page said bacon contemptuously and there was nothing mock about it he paused what else they say im a genius and that ive weve done things that have never been done with erotica before the few who dont mention shakespeare bacons image winced keep comparing me to voltaire a decidedly minor talent sniffed bacon still what do critics know were number one on the bestseller list and weve gone back to press six times in two weeks only six said bacon i overestimated the intelligence of the american reading public yeah retorted marvin well almost three million members of that public have forked over six bucks apiece to read a paperback original by marvin piltch suddenly he shifted his weight uncomfortably with some slight assistance by sir francis bacon of course some slight assistance roared bacon why you self centered egotistical watch your blood pressure said marvin i dont have any blood pressure you imbecile raged bacon im a computer simulacron he paused for electronic breath such ingratitude at least it took shakespeare five or six plays before he convinced himself that he was the author i apologize you had bloody well better apologize i do humbly demanded bacon humbly agreed marvin thats better were friends again we were never friends but at least were not enemies i suppose not said bacon good said marvin because weve got work to do i have work to do thats what i meant i will require no help whatsoever with my autobiography marvin shifted his weight again uh yes im afraid youre going to have to put your autobiography on the back burner for a few weeks back burner on hold english is an elastic language but it does have its limitations said bacon do try to remain within them what im saying is that we owe another book what are you talking about the contract had an option clause my wifes cousin decided to exercise it nonsense he cannot force you to write another book well said marvin hesitantly it wasnt exactly a matter of force explain yourself demanded bacon coldly he offered me a milliondollar advance for a hard soft deal straight royalties of all subsidiary rights and youve accepted payment for another book marvin nodded well i certainly hope you enjoy writing it i ah thought we might collaborate again we didnt collaborate the first time you know what i mean i know precisely what you mean said bacon distastefully you want me to write girl scouts in leather great title said marvin admiringly but no that wasnt what i had in mind what you had in mind is of no interest to me come on said marvin a deals a deal what are you talking about demanded bacon i fulfilled my end of the bargain well not officially i wrote the book you had to help me fulfill the contract continued marvin well the contract now calls for another book you mentioned nothing about a contract protested bacon you asked me to write a book i wrote it and with the absolute brilliance of which only i am capable my obligation to you is finished i was afraid you were going to become an attitude case said marvin with a sigh and i was certain that you would break your word it appears that each of us shall have his expectations fulfilled retorted bacon well said marvin with a sign of resignation it was probably beyond you anyway what was the book i signed for dont be insulting if meter maids in bondage proves anything it proves that no form of erotica is beyond my talents to attack and upgrade yeah but this ones for his science fiction line science fiction well fantasy anyway its an alternate universe story what is an alternate universe one in which history happened differently explained marvin it might be about a world in which germany won world war ii or where shakespeare is credited with ghosting all your writings where that toad ghosted my work repeated bacon incredulously this really is too much to bear suddenly he stared intently at marvin is that what you propose to write no youre quite sure quite bacon glared at him distrustfully what is the subject of your book then well i had heard you mention it and it was the first thing that popped into my mind and what is it the life of king henry ix thats not my idea you fool snapped bacon its that idiot shakespeares well if you feel you cant handle it its not that i cant its that i wont bacon was absolutely motionless for a moment his eyes fixed on some distant point that only he could see for one thing id have to write queen elizabeth out of the history books he paused and then snickered i never did like her very much anyway he seemed lost in contemplation for a long moment actually i could turn it out in less time than the last one since id be working within my own millieu will you no youve got decades to spare remember urged marvin whats a week between friends we are not friends collaborators then collaborators snapped bacon if you think id allow you to write a single word of henry ix you subliterate anthropoid it sold seventeen million copies worldwide and was made into a megahit movie starring charlton heston iii as henry and bubbles vancouver as betty jean plantagenet a role created expressly for the film more to the point it won the hugo the nebula the nova the supernova the pulitzer and even the prestigious harold robbins award listen to this enthused marvin as he read the reviews to the simulacron inside his computer the new york times says its as if the bard himself had taken pen to paper i thought time was supposed to take care of critics muttered bacon all it really seems to do is compound their ignorance and the saturday review says there are a few turns of phrase that shakespeare himself might have envied continued marvin shakespeare again snorted bacon that dolt would envy a phrase that concisely asked directions to the mens room dont take it so personally five centuries later and hes still getting credit for my work how would you take it marvin shrugged i dont know why dont you write something that doesnt read like shakespeare a complete wellconstructed sentence doesnt read like shakespeare well then write something that doesnt read so much like yourself im never writing again thank you well if you dont think you can disguise your voice of course i can disguise my voice said bacon defensively marvin shook his head you wrote a smut book and a fantasy and the critics still compare you to shakespeare they are fools they are your audience marvin corrected him and you cant hide your identity from them thats what i get for being a ghost writer in the first place if id written the tragedies under my own name but you didnt no i didnt and now said marvin carefully if you dont manage to create a new literary persona everything you write will always be credited to shakespeares influence this is intolerable i thought you might feel that way said marvin so i signed another contract no more fantasies or sex books said bacon it has to be something totally different a hardboiled detective story announced marvin i dont think ive ever read one of those ill run the scanner over some hammett and cain and chandler before i go to bed tonight they are the three exemplars of the form no theyre three hardboiled mystery writers boil and bubble won the edgar the shamus the marlowe and even the coveted jacqueline suzanne memorial trophy for positive contributions to the american cultural scene it also sold million copies and was made into a feature film a video series a computer game a roleplaying game and a chain of soup kitchens an almost perfect melding of high shakespearean tragedy and downtoearth chandleresque drama read marvin holding up the new york review of books again shrieked bacon am i never to be rid of that meddlesome fool youre getting on my nerves said marvin im the best selling author of the decade except maybe for fritz hauer and all you can do is complain ive read fritz hauers books retorted bacon theyre trifles nothing but trifles they cant begin to compare to what ive written then why dont you relax and feel triumphant or something instead of harping about shakespeare all the time complained marvin dont you understand the credit should be mine not his my work is revered throughout the world but it is his name that is worshipped not mine dont you realize what that can do to a sensitive artistic spirit boil and bubble outsold his entire body of work fivetoone last month doesnt that mean anything to you not if every word every precise turn of phrase every poetic fantasy that i create is to be credited to his influence responded bacon you are getting to be a regular pain in the ass said marvin you can always turn me off and write these masterpieces yourself said bacon with a nasty smile dont push your luck fella i may just do that one of these days i for one would thank you then i could return to that limbo in which shakespeares name is never mentioned not quite yet said marvin i just signed to do a michener a michener is that like a mystery marvin shook his head no you choose some obscure city or country spend pages making up its history and then follow five or six generations of your heros family theyre very popular i have it cried bacon ill write of my own family and then the world will know who shakespeare really was i thought the notion might appeal to you said marvin with a triumphant smile the bard and the ghost was marvins only artistic failure though it sold out its first three printings prior to its official publication date too farfetched said publishers weekly suspending disbelief long enough to read henry ix was one thing added kirkus review but when mr piltch asks us to go along with the ridiclous fancy that sir francis bacon actually wrote shakespeares plays unbelievable said the new york times in the shortest book review on record bacon was beside himself with frustration his sole topic of conversation was his contempt for shakespeare and he soon reached the point where marvin would have hired him a psychiatrist if he had known any who specialized in the treatment of monomaniacal computer simulacrons then came the fateful day that marvin in an effort to bolster his flagging sales agreed to appear on a television talk show with his only serious literary rival fritz hauer whose rise to the top of the sales charts had been as meteoric as marvins own he was waiting in the mauve room prior to walking out on stage when a young man with thick glasses an illfitting tan suit a blue bow tie and white socks peeking up over his loafers entered the room he stared at marvin for a moment then took a step closer to him marvin piltch he asked hesitantly yes i thought i recognized the tshirt its the same one you wore on the cover of time the young man extended his hand im fritz hauer pleased to meet you said marvin mind if i sit down be my guest hauer sat down and continued to stare at marvin for a few moments is something wrong asked marvin no i was just curious about what hauer shot a quick look at the door to make sure it was closed well ill never get an answer if i dont ask just between you and me whos your spook my what said marvin your ghost i dont know what youre talking about come on marvin said hauer confidentially youre my only rival on the literary scene ive studied you thoroughly i know all about your background your education your cultural upbringing you have no more business writing a classic than i have were computer hackers not writers speak for yourself said marvin defensively i will said hauer i cant ask for your confidence if i dont give you mine he paused you know how people keep saying i write with rabelaisian wit even when im doing westerns hauer grinned thats because ive got rabelais in my box really hauer nodded whos yours shakespeare is that they way they read to you who reads books thats what the reviews all say actually its francis bacon admitted marvin he wrote all of shakespeares plays so youve got an experienced spook ghosting for you said hauer boy i wish to hell mine was hes very unhappy about the situation oh asked marvin suddenly interested yeah he keeps wanting to write orgy scenes into the cowboy stories francis writes exactly what i tell him to write said marvin i envy you said hauer dont hes very difficult to get along with he gets furious every time the critics compare my books to shakespeare youd think that after being a ghost writer for so many centuries hed be used to it by now said hauer it just seems to make him madder replied marvin ill be honest with you im thinking of announcing my retirement i dont know how many more books i can get him to write whoever heard of a writer who doesnt want to write oh he wants to write but hes obsessed with this shakespeare business i have to appeal to his vanity to get him to do any contract work at all i see your problem sympathized hauer but still a spook whos willing to write something besides orgies it must be wonderful id settle for the orgies if he was just a little more pleasant who needs pleasant just lock him in a room and let him write hell rabelais wastes so much time telling dirty jokes that ive missed my last two deadlines but hes pleasant pleasant as all hell said hauer just lazy he paused i mean it isnt as if hes got anything else to do inside that damned box marvin stared intently at hauer who stared back at him are you thinking what im thinking said marvin at last a trade suggested hauer with a grin why not theyre ghost writers who else would have to know what the hell its a deal fine said marvin shaking on it now let em say i write like an elizabethian hi frankie said hauer welcome to your new home bacon eyed him suspiciously its okay really it is said hauer marvin told me all about you and were gonna get along just fine why do i doubt that beats the hell out of me but as a gesture of good will take a look at this he held a paper up before the screen what is it a contract for a novel about professional football i know nothing about football neither does shakespeare i am shakespeare you dolt what i mean is since football is totally beyond your experience and all your research will be couched in contemporary language you ought to be able to get out from under shakespeares uh your own shadow once and for all and be recognized as a truly original literary genius you know theres a twisted kind of logic to that mused bacon then youll do it ill consider it you brought the reviews with you asked bacon yes said hauer they didnt compare my writing to shakespeare this time no finally uh frankie i can hardly wait let me hear them youre sure of course im sure said bacon ive waited years to be acknowledged as my own man okay said hauer start with the new york times the green bay massacre fritz hauers latest novel begins with a brilliant conceit but soon degenerates into a slavish imitation of our foremost american writer the incomparable marvin piltch what well at least theyre not accusing you of being shakespeare any more shut up do you want to hear the rest of it or not no read me the new york review of books the green bay massacre fritz hauers heavyhanded homage to the works of marvin piltch this cant be happening cried bacon hauer stared at bacons image with some compassion then shrugged what the hell once a hack always a hack he said as he walked to the door bacons last plaintive scream seemed to linger in the dusty air of the room long after hauer had left to sign a new contract with his publisher
