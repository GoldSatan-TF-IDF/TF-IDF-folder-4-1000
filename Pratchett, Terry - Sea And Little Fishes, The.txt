the sea and little fishes by terry pratchett trouble began and not for the first time with an apple there was a bag of them on granny weatherwaxs bleached and spotless table red and round shiny and fruity if theyd known the future they should have ticked like bombs keep the lot old hopcroft said i could have as many as i wanted said nanny ogg she gave her sister witch a sidelong glance tasty a bit wrinkled but a damn good keeper he named an apple after you said granny each word was an acid drop on the air cos of my rosy cheeks said nanny ogg an i cured his leg for him after he fell off that ladder last year an i made him up some jollop for his bald head it didnt work though said granny that wig he wears thats a terrible thing to see on a man still alive but he was pleased i took an interest granny weatherwax didnt take her eyes off the bag fruit and vegetables grew famously in the mountains hot summers and cold winters percy hopcroft was the premier grower and definitely a keen man when it came to sexual antics among the horticulture with a camelhair brush he sells his apple trees all over the place nanny ogg went on funny eh to think that pretty soon thousands of people will be having a bite of nanny ogg thousands more said granny tartly nannys wild youth was an open book although only available in plain covers thank you esme nanny ogg looked wistful for a moment and then opened her mouth in mock concern oh you aint jealous are you esme you aint begrudging me my little moment in the sun me jealous why should i be jealous its only an apple its not as if its anything important thats what i thought its just a little frippery to humour an old lady said nanny so how are things with you then fine fine got your winter wood in have you mostly good said nanny good they sat in silence on the windowpane a butterfly awoken by the unseasonable warmth beat a little tattoo in an effort to reach the september sun your potatoes got them dug then said nanny yes we got a good crop off ours this year good salted your beans have you yes i expect youre looking forward to the trials next week yes i expect youve been practising no it seemed to nanny that despite the sunlight the shadows were deepening in the corners of the room the very air itself was growing dark a witchs cottage gets sensitive to the moods of its occupant but she plunged on fools rush in but they are laggards compared to little old ladies with nothing left to fear you coming over to dinner on sunday whatre you havin pork with apple sauce ye no said granny there was a creaking behind nanny the door had swung open someone who wasnt a witch would have rationalised this would have said that of course it was only the wind and nanny ogg was quite prepared to go along with this but would have added why was it only the wind and how come the wind had managed to lift the latch oh well cant sit here chatting all day she said standing up quickly always busy at this time of year aint it yes so ill be off then goodbye the wind blew the door shut again as nanny hurried off down the path it occurred to her that just possibly she may have gone a bit too far but only a bit the trouble with being a witch at least the trouble with being a witch as far as some people were concerned was that you got stuck out here in the country but that was fine by nanny everything she wanted was out here everything shed ever wanted was here although in her youth shed run out of men a few times foreign parts were all right to visit but they werent really serious they had interestin new drinks and the grub was fun but foreign parts was where you went to do what might need to be done and then you came back here a place that was real nanny ogg was happy in small places of course she reflected as she crossed the lawn she didnt have this view out of her window nanny lived down in the town but granny could look out across the forest and over the plains and all the way to the great round horizon of the discworld a view like that nanny reasoned could probably suck your mind right out of your head theyd told her the world was round and flat which was common sense and went through space on the back of four elephants standing on the shell of a turtle which didnt have to make sense it was all happening out there somewhere and it could continue to do so with nannys blessing and disinterest so long as she could live in a personal world about ten miles across which she carried around with her but esme weatherwax needed more than this little kingdom could contain she was the other kind of witch and nanny saw it as her job to stop granny weatherwax getting bored the business with the apples was petty enough a spiteful little triumph when you got down to it but esme needed something to make every day worthwhile and if it had to be anger and jealousy then so be it granny would now scheme for some little victory some tiny humiliation that only the two of them would ever know about and thatd be that nanny was confident that she could deal with her friend in a bad mood but not when she was bored a witch who is bored might do anything people said things like we had to make our own amusements in those days as if this signalled some kind of moral worth and perhaps it did but the last thing you wanted a witch to do was get bored and start making her own amusements because witches sometimes had famously erratic ideas about what was amusing and esme was undoubtedly the most powerful witch the mountains had seen for generations still the trials were coming up and they always set esme weatherwax all right for a few weeks she rose to competition like a trout to a fly nanny ogg always looked forward to the witch trials you got a good day out and of course there was a big bonfire whoever heard of a witch trial without a good bonfire afterwards and afterwards you could roast potatoes in the ashes the afternoon melted into the evening and the shadows in corners and under stools and tables crept out and ran together granny rocked gently in her chair as the darkness wrapped itself around her she had a look of deep concentration the logs in the fireplace collapsed into the embers which winked out one by one the night thickened the old clock ticked on the mantelpiece and for some length of time there was no other sound there came a faint rustling the paper bag on the table moved and then began to crinkle like a deflating balloon slowly the still air filled with a heavy smell of decay after a while the first maggot crawled out nanny ogg was back home and just pouring a pint of beer when there was a knock she put down the jug with a sigh and went and opened the door oh hello ladies whatre you doing in these parts and on such a chilly evening too nanny backed into the room ahead of three more witches they wore the black cloaks and pointy hats traditionally associated with their craft although this served to make each one look different there is nothing like a uniform for allowing one to express ones individuality a tweak here and a tuck there are little details that scream all the louder in the apparent well uniformity gammer beaviss hat for example had a very flat brim and a point you could clean your ear with nanny liked gammer beavis she might be a bit too educated so that sometimes it overflowed out of her mouth but she did her own shoe repairs and took snuff and in nanny oggs small world view things like this meant that someone was all right old mother dismasss clothes had that disarray of someone who because of a detached retina in her second sight was living in a variety of times all at once mental confusion is bad enough in normal people but much worse when the mind has an occult twist you just had to hope it was only her underwear she was wearing on the outside it was getting worse nanny knew sometimes her knock would be heard on the door a few hours before she arrived her footprints would turn up several days later nannys heart sank at the sight of the third witch and it wasnt because letice earwig was a bad woman quite the reverse in fact she was considered to be decent wellmeaning and kind at least to lessaggressive animals and the cleaner sort of children and she would always do you a good turn the trouble was though that she would do you a good turn for your own good even if a good turn wasnt what was good for you you ended up mentally turned the other way and that wasnt good and she was married nanny had nothing against witches being married it wasnt as if there were rules she herself had had many husbands and had even been married to three of them but mr earwig was a retired wizard with a suspiciously large amount of gold and nanny suspected that letice did witchcraft as something to keep herself occupied in much the same way that other women of a certain class might embroider kneelers for the church or visit the poor and she had money nanny did not have money and therefore was predisposed to dislike those who did letice had a black velvet cloak so fine that if looked as if a hole had been cut out of the world nanny did not nanny did not want a fine velvet cloak and did not aspire to such things so she didnt see why other people should have them evening gytha how are you keeping in yourself said gammer beavis nanny took her pipe out of her mouth fit as a fiddle come on in aint this rain dreadful said mother dismass nanny looked at the sky it was frosty purple but it was probably raining wherever mothers mind was at come along in and dry off then she said kindly may fortunate stars shine on this our meeting said letice nanny nodded understandingly letice always sounded as though shed learned her witchcraft out of a not very imaginative book yeah right she said there was some polite conversation while nanny prepared tea and scones then gammer beavis in a tone that clearly indicated that the official part of the visit was beginning said were here as the trials committee nanny oh yes i expect youll be entering oh yes ill do my little turn nanny glanced at letice there was a smile on that face that she wasnt entirely happy with theres a lot of interest this year gammer went on more girls are taking it up lately to get boys one feels said letice and sniffed nanny didnt comment using witchcraft to get boys seemed a damn good use for it as far as she was concerned it was in a way one of the fundamental uses thats nice she said always looks good a big turnout but i beg your pardon said letice i said but said nanny cos someones going to say but right this little chat has got a big but coming up i can tell she knew this was flying in the face of protocol there should be at least seven more minutes of small talk before anyone got around to the point but letices presence was getting on her nerves its about esme weatherwax said gammer beavis yes said nanny without surprise i suppose shes entering never known her stay away letice sighed i suppose you couldnt persuade her to not to enter this year nanny looked shocked with an axe you mean in unison the three witches sat back you see gammer began a bit shamefaced frankly mrs ogg said letice it is very hard to get other people to enter when they know that miss weatherwax is entering she always wins yes said nanny its a competition but she always wins so in other types of competition said letice one is normally only allowed to win for three years in a row and then one takes a back seat for a while yeah but this is witching said nanny the rules is different how so there aint none letice twitched her skirt perhaps it is time there were she said ah said nanny and you just going to go up and tell esme that you up for this gammer gammer beavis didnt meet her gaze old mother dismass was gazing at last week i understand miss weatherwax is a very proud woman said letice nanny ogg puffed at her pipe again you might as well say the sea is full of water she said the other witches were silent for a moment i daresay that was a valuable comment said letice but i didnt understand it if there aint no water in the sea it aint the sea said nanny ogg its just a damn great hole in the ground thing about esme is nanny took another noisy pull at the pipe shes all pride see she aint just a proud person then perhaps she should learn to be a bit more humble whats she got to be humble about said nanny sharply but letice like a lot of people with marshmallow on the outside had a hard core that was not easily compressed the woman clearly has a natural talent and really she should be grateful for nanny ogg stopped listening at this point the woman she thought so that was how it was going it was the same in just about every trade sooner or later someone decided it needed organizing and the one thing you could be sure of was that the organizers werent going to be the people who by general acknowledgement were at the top of their craft they were working too hard to be fair it generally wasnt done by the worst neither they were working hard too they had to no it was done by the ones who had just enough time and inclination to scurry and bustle and to be fair again the world needed people who scurried and bustled you just didnt have to like them very much the lull told her that letice had finished really now me said nanny im the one whos natrally talented us oggsve got witchcraft in our blood i never really had to sweat at it esme now shes got a bit true enough but it aint a lot she just makes it work hardern hell and youre going to tell her shes not to we were rather hoping you would said letice nanny opened her mouth to deliver one or two swearwords and then stopped tell you what she said you can tell her tomorrow and ill come with you to hold her back granny weatherwax was gathering herbs when they came up the track everyday herbs of sickroom and kitchen are known as simples grannys herbs werent simples they were complicateds or they were nothing and there was none of the airyfairy business with a pretty basket and a pair of dainty snippers granny used a knife and a chair held in front of her and a leather hat gloves and apron as secondary lines of defence even she didnt know where some of the herbs came from roots and seeds were traded all over the world and maybe further some had flowers that turned as you passed by some fired their thorns at passing birds and several were staked not so that they wouldnt fall over but so theyd still be there next day nanny ogg who never bothered to grow any herb you couldnt smoke or stuff a chicken with heard her mutter right you buggers good morning miss weatherwax said letice earwig loudly granny weatherwax stiffened and then lowered the chair very carefully and turned around its mistress she said whatever said letice brightly i trust you are keeping well up till now said granny she nodded almost imperceptibly at the other three witches there was a thrumming silence which appalled nanny ogg they should have been invited in for a cup of something that was how the ritual went it was gross bad manners to keep people standing around nearly but not quite as bad as calling an elderly unmarried witch miss youve come about the trials said granny letice almost fainted er how did cos you look like a committee it dont take much reasoning said granny pulling off her gloves we didnt used to need a committee the news just got around and we all turned up now suddenly theres folk arrangin things for a moment granny looked as though she was fighting some serious internal battle and then she added in throwaway tones kettles on youd better come in nanny relaxed maybe there were some customs even granny weatherwax wouldnt defy after all even if someone was your worst enemy you invited them in and gave them tea and biscuits in fact the worser your enemy the better the crockery you got out and the higher the quality of the biscuits you might wish black hell on em later but while they were under your roof youd feed em till they choked her dark little eyes noted that the kitchen table gleamed and was still damp from scrubbing after cups had been poured and pleasantries exchanged or at least offered by letice and received in silence by granny the selfelected chairwoman wriggled in her seat and said theres such a lot of interest in the trials this year miss mistress weatherwax good it does look as though witchcraft in the ramtops is going through something of a renaissance in fact a renaissance eh theres a thing its such a good route to empowerment for young women dont you think many people could say things in a cutting way nanny knew but granny weatherwax could listen in a cutting way she could make something sound stupid just by hearing it thats a good hat youve got there said granny velvet is it not made local i expect letice touched the brim and gave a little laugh its from boggis in ankhmorpork she said oh shopbought nanny ogg glanced at the corner of the room where a battered wooden cone stood on a stand pinned to it were lengths of black calico and strips of willow wood the foundations for grannys spring hat tailormade said letice and those hatpins youve got granny went on all them crescent moons and cat shapes youve got a brooch thats crescentshaped too aint that so esme said nanny ogg deciding it was time for a warning shot granny occasionally had a lot to say about jewellery on witches when she was feeling in an acid mood this is true gytha i have a brooch what is shaped like a crescent thats just the truth of the shape it happens to be very practical shape for holding a cloak is a crescent but i dont mean nothing by it anyway you interrupted just as i was about to remark to mrs earwig how fetchin her hatpins are very witchy nanny swivelling like a spectator at a tennis match glanced at letice to see if this deadly bolt had gone home but the woman was actually smiling some people just couldnt spot the obvious on the end of a tenpound hammer on the subject of witchcraft said letice with the born chairwomans touch for the enforced segue i thought i might raise with you the question of your participation in the trials yes do you ah dont you think it is unfair to other people that you win every year granny weatherwax looked down at the floor and then up at the ceiling no she said eventually im bettern them you dont think it is a little dispiriting for the other contestants once again the floor to ceiling search no said granny but they start off knowing theyre not going to win so do i oh no you surely i meant that i start off knowing theyre not goin to win too said granny witheringly and they ought to start off knowing im not going to win no wonder they lose if they aint getting their minds right it does rather dash their enthusiasm granny looked genuinely puzzled whats wrong with em striving to come second she said letice plunged onwhat we were hoping to persuade you to do esme is to accept an emeritus position you would perhaps make a nice little speech of encouragement present the award and and possibly even be er one of the judges theres going to be judges said granny weve never had judges everyone just used to know whod won thats true said nanny she remembered the scenes at the end of one or two trials when granny weatherwax won everyone knew oh thats very true it would be a very nice gesture letice went on who decided there would be judges said granny er the committee which is that is a few of us got together only to steer things oh i see said granny flags pardon are you going to have them lines of little flags and maybe someone selling apples on a stick that kind of thing some bunting would certainly be right dont forget the bonfire so long as its nice and safe oh right things should be nice and safe said granny mrs earwig perceptibly sighed with relief well thats sorted out nicely she said is it said granny i thought wed agreed that had we really she picked up the poker from the hearth and prodded fiercely at the fire ill give matters my consideration i wonder if i may be frank for a moment mistress weatherwax said letice the poker paused in midprod yes times are changing you know now i think i know why you feel it necessary to be so overbearing and unpleasant to everyone but believe me when i tell you as a friend that youd find it so much easier if you just relaxed a little bit and tried being nicer like our sister gytha here nanny oggs smile had fossilized into a mask letice didnt seem to notice you seem to have all the witches in awe of you for fifty miles around she went on now i daresay you have some valuable skills but witchcraft isnt about being an old grump and frightening people any more im telling you this as a friend call again whenever youre passing said granny this was a signal nanny ogg stood up hurriedly i thought we could discuss letice protested ill walk with you all down to the main track said nanny hauling the other witches out of their seats gytha said granny sharply as the group reached the door yes esme youll come back here afterwards i expect yes esme nanny ran to catch up with the trio on the path letice had what nanny thought of as a deliberate walk it had been wrong to judge her by the floppy jowls and the overfussy hair and the silly way she waggled her hands as she talked she was a witch after all scratch any witch and well youd be facing a witch youd just scratched she is not a nice person letice trilled but it was the trill of some large hunting bird youre right there said nanny but its high time she was taken down a peg or two weell she bullies you most terribly mrs ogg a married lady of your mature years too just for a moment nannys eyes narrowed its her way she said a very petty and nasty way to my mind oh yes said nanny simply ways often are but look you will you be bringing anything to the produce stall gytha said gammer beavis quickly oh a couple of bottles i expect said nanny deflating oh homemade wine said letice how nice sort of like wine yes well heres the path said nanny ill just ill just nip back and say goodnight its belittling you know the way you run around after her said letice yes well you get used to people goodnight to you when she got back to the cottage granny weatherwax was standing in the middle of the kitchen floor with a face like an unmade bed and her arms folded one foot tapped on the floor she married a wizard said granny as soon as her friend had entered you cant tell me thats right well wizards can marry you know they just have to hand in the staff and pointy hat theres no actual law says they cant so long as they gives up wizarding theyre supposed to be married to the job i should reckon its a job being married to her said granny her face screwed up in a sour smile been pickling much this year said nanny employing a fresh association of ideas around the word vinegar which had just popped into her head my onions all got the screwfly thats a pity you like onions even screwfliesve got to eat said granny she glared at the door nice she said shes got a knitted cover on the lid in her privy said nanny pink yes nice shes not bad said nanny she does good work over in fiddlers elbow people speak highly of her granny sniffed do they speak highly of me she said no they speaks quietly of you esme good did you see her hatpins i thought they were rather nice esme thats witchcraft today all jewellery and no drawers nanny who considered both to be optional tried to build an embankment against the rising tide of ire you could think of it as an honour really them not wanting you to take part thats nice nanny sighed sometimes nice is worth tryin esme she said i never does anyone a bad turn if i cant do em a good one gytha you know that i dont have to do no frills or fancy labels nanny sighed of course it was true granny was an oldfashioned witch she didnt do good for people she did right by them but nanny knew that people dont always appreciate right like old pollirt the other day when he fell off his horse what he wanted was a painkiller what he needed was the few seconds of agony as granny popped the joint back into place the trouble was people remembered the pain you got on a lot better with people when you remembered to put frills round it and took an interest and said things like how are you esme didnt bother with that kind of stuff because she knew already nanny ogg knew too but also knew that letting on you knew gave people the serious willies she put her head on one side grannys foot was still tapping you planning anything esme i know you youve got that look what look pray that look you had when that bandit was found naked up a tree and cryin all the time and goin on about the horrible thing that was after him funny thing we never found any pawprints that look he deserved moren that for what he done yeah well you had that look just before ole hoggett was found beaten black and blue in his own pigsty and wouldnt talk about it you mean old hoggett the wifebeater or old hoggett who wont never lift his hand to a woman no more said granny the thing her lips had pursed into may have been called a smile and its the look you had the time all the snow slid down on ole milisons house just after he called you an interfering old baggage said nanny granny hesitated nanny was pretty sure that had been natural causes and also that granny knew she suspected this and that pride was fighting a battle with honesty thats as may be said granny noncommittally like someone who might go along to the trials and do something said nanny her friends glare should have made the air sizzle oh so thats what you think of me thats what weve come to have we letice thinks we should move with the times well i moves with the times we ought to move with the times no one said we ought to give them a push i expect youll be wanting to be going gytha i want to be alone with my thoughts nannys own thoughts as she scurried home in relief were that granny weatherwax was not an advertisement for witchcraft oh she was one of the best at it no doubt about that at a certain kind certainly but a girl starting out in life might well say to herself is this it you worked hard and denied yourself things and what you got at the end of it was hard work and selfdenial granny wasnt exactly friendless but what she commanded mostly was respect people learned to respect stormclouds too they refreshed the ground you needed them but they werent nice nanny ogg went to bed in three flannelette nightdresses because sharp frosts were already pricking the autumn air she was also in a troubled frame of mind some sort of war had been declared she knew granny could do some terrible things when roused and the fact that theyd been done to those who richly deserved them didnt make them any the less terrible shed be planning something pretty dreadful nanny ogg knewshe herself didnt like winning things winning was a habit that was hard to break and brought you a dangerous status that was hard to defend youd walk uneasily through life always on the lookout for the next girl with a better broomstick and a quicker hand on the frog she turned over under the mountain of eiderdowns in granny weatherwaxs worldview was no room for second place you won or you were a loser there was nothing wrong with being a loser except for the fact that of course you werent the winner nanny had always pursued the policy of being a good loser people liked you when you almost won and bought you drinks she only just lost was a much better compliment than she only just won runnersup had more fun she reckoned but it wasnt a word granny had much time for in her own darkened cottage granny weatherwax sat and watched the fire die it was a greywalled room the colour that old plaster gets not so much from dirt as from age there was not a thing in it that wasnt useful utilitarian earned its keep every flat surface in nanny oggs cottage had been pressed into service as a holder for ornaments and potted plants people gave nanny ogg things cheap fairground tat granny always called it at least in public what she thought of it in the privacy of her own head she never said she rocked gently as the last ember winked out its hard to contemplate in the grey hours of the night that probably the only reason people would come to your funeral would be to make sure youre dead next day percy hopcroft opened his back door and looked straight up into the blue stare of granny weatherwax oh my he said under his breath granny gave an awkward little cough mr hopcroft ive come about them apples you named after mrs ogg she said percys knees began to tremble and his wig started to slide off the back of his head to the hopedfor security of the floor i should like to thank you for doing it because it has made her very happy granny went on in a tone of voice which would have struck one who knew her as curiously monotonous she has done a lot of fine work and its about time she got her little reward it was a very nice thought and so i have brung you this little token hopcroft jumped backwards as grannys hand dipped swiftly into her apron and produced a small black bottle which is very rare because of the rare herbs in it what are rare extremely rare herbs eventually it crept over hopcroft that he was supposed to take the bottle he gripped the top of it very carefully as if it might whistle or develop legs thank you ver much he mumbled granny nodded stiffly blessings be upon this house she said and turned and walked away down the path hopcroft shut the door carefully and then flung himself against it you start packing right now he shouted to his wife whod been watching from the kitchen door what our whole lifes here we cant just run away from it better to run than hop woman whats she want from me whats she want shes never nice mrs hopcroft stood firm shed just got the cottage looking right and theyd bought a new pump some things were hard to leave lets just stop and think then she said whats in that bottle hopcroft held it at arms length do you want to find out stop shaking man she didnt actually threaten did she she said blessings be upon this house sounds pretty damn threatening to me that was granny weatherwax that was he put the bottle on the table they stared at it standing in the cautious leaning position of people who were ready to run if anything began to happen says haire reftorer on the label said mrs hopcroft i aint using it shell ask us about it later thats her way if you think for one moment im we can try it out on the dog thats a good cow william poorchick awoke from his reverie on the milking stool and looked around the meadow his hands still working the beasts teats there was a black pointy hat rising over the hedge he gave such a start that he started to milk into his left boot gives plenty of milk does she yes mistress weatherwax william quavered thats good long may she continue to do so thats what i say goodday to you and the pointy hat continued up the lane poorchick stared after it then he grabbed the bucket and squelching at every other step hurried into the barn and yelled for his son rummage you get down here right now his son appeared at the hayloft pitchfork still in his hand whats up dad you take daphne down to the market right now understand what but shes our best milker dad was son was granny weatherwax just put a curse on her sell her now before her horns drop off whatd she say dad she said she said long may she continue to give milk poorchick hesitated doesnt sound awfuly like a curse dad said rummage i mean not like your genral curse sounds a bit hopeful really said his son well it was the way she said it what sort of way dad well like cheerfully you all right dad it was the way poorchick paused well its not right he continued its not right shes got no right to go around being cheerful at people shes never cheerful and my boot is full of milk today nanny ogg was taking some time out to tend her secret still in the woods as a still it was the bestkept secret there could be since everyone in the kingdom knew exactly where it was and a secret kept by so many people must be very secret indeed even the king knew and knew enough to pretend he didnt know and that meant he didnt have to ask her for any taxes and she didnt have to refuse and every year at hogswatch he got a barrel of what honey might be if only bees werent teetotal and everyone understood the situation no one had to pay any money and so in a small way the world was a happier place and no one was cursed until their teeth fell out nanny was dozing keeping an eye on a still was a day and night job but finally the sound of people repeatedly calling her name got too much for her no one would come into the clearing of course that would mean admitting that they knew where it was so they were blundering around in the surrounding bushes she pushed her way through and was greeted with some looks of feigned surprise that would have done credit to any amateur dramatic company well what do you lot want she demanded oh mrs ogg we thought you might be taking a walk in the woods said poorchick while a scent that could clean glass wafted on the breeze you got to do something its mistress weatherwax whats she done you tell er mister hampicker the man next to poorchick took off his hat quickly and held it respect fully in front of him in the aiseniorthebandidoshaveraidedourvillages position well maam my lad and i were digging for a well and then she come past granny weatherwax yesm and she said hampicker gulped you wont find any water there my good man youd be better off looking in the hollow by the chestnut tree an we dug on down anyway and we never found no water nanny lit her pipe she didnt smoke around the still since that time when a careless spark had sent the barrel she was sitting on a hundred yards into the air shed been lucky that a fir tree had broken her fall so then you dug in the hollow by the chestnut tree she said mildly hampicker looked shocked nom theres no telling what she wanted us to find there and she cursed my cow said poorchick really what did she say she said may she give a lot of milk poorchick stopped once again now that he came to say it well it was the way she said it he added weakly and what kind of way was that nicely nicely smilin and everything i dont dare drink the stuff now nanny was mystified cant quite see the problem you tell that to mr hopcrofts dog said poorchick hopcroft darent leave the poor thing on account of her the whole familys going mad theres him shearing his wife sharpening the scissors and the two lads out all the time looking for fresh places to dump the hair patient questioning on nannys part elucidated the role the haire reftorer had played in this and he gave it half the bottle mrs ogg even though esme writes a right small spoonful once a week on the label and even then you need to wear roomy trousers he said he was so nervous mrs ogg i mean whats she playing at our wives are keepin the kids indoors i mean sposin she smiled at them well shes a witch som i an i smiles at em said nanny ogg theyre always runnin after me for sweets yes but youre i mean she i mean you dont i mean well and shes a good woman said nanny common sense prompted her to add in her own way i expect there is water down in the hollow and poorchicks cowll give good milk and if hopcroft wont read the labels on bottles then he deserves a head you can see your face in and if you think esme weatherwaxd curse kids youve got the sense of a earthworm shed cuss em yes all day long but not curse em she dont aim that low yes yes poorchick almost moaned but it dont feel right thats what were saying her going round being nice a man dont know if hes got a leg to stand on or hop on said hampicker darkly all right all right ill see about it said nanny people shouldnt go around not doin what you expect said poorchick weakly it gets people on edge and well keep an eye on your sti hampicker said and then staggered backwards grasping his stomach and wheezing dont mind him its the stress said poorchick rubbing his elbow been picking herbs mrs ogg thats right said nanny hurrying away across the leaves so shall i put the fire out for you then poorchick shouted granny was sitting outside her house when nanny ogg hurried up the path she was sorting through a sack of old clothes elderly garments were scattered around her and she was humming nanny ogg started to worry the grannyweatherwax she knew didnt approve of music and she smiled when she saw nanny or at least the corners of her mouth turned up that was really worrying granny normally only smiled if something bad was happening to someone deserving why gytha how nice to see you you all right esme never felt better dear the humming continued er sorting out rags are you said nanny going to make that quilt it was one of granny weatherwaxs firm beliefs that one day shed make a patchwork quilt however it is a task that requires patience and hence in fifteen years shed got as far as three patches but she collected old clothes anyway a lot of witches did it was a witch thing old clothes had personality like old houses when it came to clothes with a bit of wear left in them a witch had no pride at all its in here somewhere granny mumbled aha here we are she flourished a garment it was basically pink knew it was here she went on hardly worn either and about my size too youre going to wear it said nanny grannys piercing blue cutyouoffattheknees gaze was turned upon her nanny would have been relieved at a reply like no im going to eat it you daft old fool instead her friend relaxed and said a little concerned you dont think itd suit me there was lace around the collar nanny swallowed you usually wear black well a bit more than usually more like always and a very sad sight i look too said granny robustly its about time i brightened myself up a bit dont you think and its so very pink granny put it aside and to nannys horror took her by the hand and said earnestly and you know i reckon ive been far too doginthemanger about this trials business gytha bitchinthemanger said nanny ogg absentmindedly for a moment grannys eyes became two sapphires again what er youd be a bitchinthemanger nanny mumbled not a dog ah oh yes thank you for pointing that out well i thought it is time i stepped back a bit and went along and cheered on the younger folks i mean i have to say i really havent been very nice to people have i er ive tried being nice granny went on it didnt turn out like i expected im sorry to say youve never been really good at nice said nanny granny smiled hard though she stared nanny was unable to spot anything other than earnest concern perhaps ill get better with practice she said she patted nannys hand and nanny stared at her hand as though something horrible had happened to it its just that everyones more used to you being firm she said i thought i might make some jam and cakes for the produce stall said granny oh good are there any sick people want visitin nanny stared at the trees it was getting worse and worse she rummaged in her memory for anyone in the locality sick enough to warrant a ministering visit but still well enough to survive the shock of a ministering visit by granny weatherwax when it came to practical psychology and the more robust type of folk physiotherapy granny was without equal in fact she could even do the latter at a distance for many a painracked soul had left their beds and walked nay run at the news that she was coming everyones pretty well at the moment said nanny diplomatically any old folk want cheerin up it was taken for granted by both women that old people did not include them a witch aged ninetyseven would not have included herself old people happened to other people all fairly cheerful right now said nanny maybe i could tell stories to the kiddies nanny nodded granny had done that once before when the mood had briefly taken her it had worked pretty well as far as the children were concerned theyd listened with openmouthed attention and apparent enjoyment to a traditional old folk legend the problem had come when theyd gone home afterwards and asked the meaning of words like disembowelled i could sit in a rocking chair while i tell em granny added thats how its done i recall and i could make them some of my special treacletoffee apples wouldnt that be nice nanny nodded again in a sort of horrified reverie she realised that only she stood in the way of a wholesale rampage of niceness toffee she said would that be the sort you did that shatters like glass or that sort where our boy pewsey had to have his mouth levered open with a spoon i reckon i know what i did wrong last time you know you and sugar dont get along esme remember them allday suckers you made they did last all day gytha only cos our pewsey couldnt get it out of his little mouth until we pulled two of his teeth esme you ought to stick to pickles you and pickles goes well ive got to do something gytha i cant be an old grump all the time i know ill help at the trials bound to be a lot that needs doing eh nanny grinned inwardly so that was it why yes im sure mrs earwig will be happy to tell you what to do and more fool her if she does she thought because i can tell youre planning something i shall talk to her said granny im sure theres a million things i could do to help if i set my mind to it and im sure you will said nanny heartily ive a feelin youre going to make a big difference granny started to rummage in the bag again you are going to be along as well arent you gytha me said nanny i wouldnt miss it for worlds nanny got up especially early if there was going to be any unpleasantness she wanted a ringside seat what there was was bunting it was hanging from tree to tree in terrible brightlycoloured loops as she walked towards the trials there was something oddly familiar about it too it should not technically be possible for anyone with a pair of scissors to be unable to cut out a triangle but someone had managed it and it was also obvious that the flags had been made from old clothes painstakingly cut up nanny knew this because not many real flags have collars in the trials field people were setting up stalls and falling over children the committee were standing uncertainly under a tree occasionally glancing up at a pink figure at the top of a very long ladder she was here before it was light said letice as nanny approached she said shed been up all night making the flags tell her about the cakes said gammer beavis darkly she made cakes said nanny but she cant cook the committee shuffled aside a lot of the ladies contributed to the food for the trials it was a tradition and an informal competition in its own right at the centre of the spread of covered plates was a large platter piled high with things of indefinite colour and shape it looked as though a herd of small cows had eaten a lot of raisins and then been ill they were urcakes prehistoric cakes cakes of great weight and presence that had no place among the iced dainties shes never had the knack of it said nanny weakly has anyone tried one hahaha said gammer solemnly tough are they you could beat a troll to death but she was so sort of proud of them said letice and then theres the jam it was a large pot it seemed to be filled with solidified purple lava nice colour said nanny anyone tasted it we couldnt get the spoon out said gammer oh im sure we only got it in with a hammer whats she planning mrs ogg shes got a weak and vengeful nature said letice youre her friend she added her tone suggesting that this was as much an accusation as a statement i dont know what shes thinking mrs earwig i thought she was staying away she said she was going to take an interest and encourage the young uns she is planning something said letice darkly those cakes are a plot to undermine my authority no thats how she always cooks said nanny she just hasnt got the knack your authority eh shes nearly finished the flags gammer reported now shes going to try to make herself useful again well i suppose we could ask her to do the lucky dip nanny looked blank you mean where kids fish around in a big tub full of bran to see what they can pull out yes youre going to let granny weatherwax do that yes only shes got a funny sense of humour if you know what i mean good morning to you all it was granny weatherwax s voice nanny ogg had known it for most of her life but it had that strange edge to it again it sounded nice we was wondering if you could supervise the bran tub miss weatherwax nanny flinched but granny merely said happy to mrs earwig icant wait to see the expressions on their little faces as they pull out the goodies nor can i nanny thought when the others had scurried off she sidled up to her friend whyre you doing this she said i really dont know what you mean gytha i seen you face down terrible creatures esme i once seen you catch a unicorn for goodness sake whatre you plannin i still dont know what you mean gytha are you angry cos they wont let you enter and now youre plannin horrible revenge for a moment they both looked at the field it was beginning to fill up people were bowling for pigs and fighting on the greasy pole the lancre volunteer band was trying to play a medley of popular tunes and it was only a pity that each musician was playing a different one small children were fighting it was going to be a scorcher of a day probably the last one of the year their eyes were drawn to the ropedoff square in the centre of the field are you going to enter the trials gytha said granny you never answered my question what question was that nanny decided not to hammer on a locked door yes i am going to have a go as it happens she said i certainly hope you win then id cheer you on only that wouldnt be fair to the others i shall merge into the background and be as quiet as a little mouse nanny tried guile her face spread into a wide pink grin and she nudged her friend right right she said only you can tell me right i wouldnt like to miss it when it happens so if you could just give me a little signal when youre going to do it eh whats it youre referring to gytha esme weatherwax sometimes i could really give you a bloody good slap oh dear nanny ogg didnt often swear or at least use words beyond the boundaries of what the lancrastrians thought of as colourful language she looked as if she habitually used bad words and had just thought up a good one but mostly witches are quite careful about what they say you can never be sure what the words are going to do when theyre out of earshot but now she swore under her breath and caused small brief fires to start in the dry grass this put her in just about the right frame of mind for the cursing it was said that once upon a time this had been done on a living breathing subject at least at the start of the event but that wasnt right for a family day out and for several hundred years the curses had been directed at unlucky charlie who was however you looked at it nothing more than a scarecrow and since curses are generally directed at the mind of the cursed this presented a major problem because even may your straw go mouldy and your carrot fall off didnt make much impression on a pumpkin but points were given for general style and inventiveness there wasnt much pressure for those in any case everyone knew what event counted and it wasnt unlucky charlie one year granny weatherwax had made the pumpkin explode no one had ever worked out how shed done it someone would walk away at the end of today and everyone would know they were the winner whatever the points said you could win the witch with the pointiest hat prize and the broomstick dressage but that was just for the audience what counted was the trick youd been working on all summer nanny had drawn last place at number nineteen a lot of witches had turned up this year news of granny weatherwaxs withdrawal had got around and nothing moves faster than news in the occult community since it doesnt just have to travel at ground level many pointy hats moved and nodded among the crowds witches are among themselves generally as sociable as cats but as also with cats there are locations and times and neutral grounds where they meet at something like peace and what was going on was a sort of slow complicated dance the witches walked around saying hello to one another and rushing to meet newcomers and innocent bystanders might have believed that here was a meeting of old friends which at one level it probably was but nanny watched through a witchs eyes and saw the subtle positioning the careful weighingup the little changes of stance the eyecontact finely tuned by intensity and length and when a witch was in the arena especially if she was comparatively unknown all the others found some excuse to keep an eye on her preferably without appearing to do so it was like watching cats cats spend a lot of time carefully eyeing one another when they have to fight thats merely to rubberstamp something thats already been decided in their heads nanny knew all this and she also knew most of the witches to be kind gentle generous and by and large quite dedicated to a life that really offered more kicks than kisses not one of them lived in a house made of confectionery although some of the conscientious younger ones had experimented with various crispbreads even children who deserved it were not slammed into their ovens generally they did what theyd always done smooth the passage of their neighbours into and out of the world and help them over some of the nastier hurdles in between you needed to be a special kind of person to do that you needed a special kind of ear because you saw people in circumstances where they were inclined to tell you things like where the money is buried or who the father was or how come theyd got a black eye again and you needed a special kind of mouth the sort that stayed shut keeping secrets made you powerful being powerful earned you respect respect was hard currency and within this sisterhood except that it wasnt a sisterhood it was a loose assortment of chronic nonjoiners a group of witches wasnt a coven it was a small war there was always this awareness of position it had nothing to do with anything the other world thought of as status nothing was ever said but if an elderly witch died the local witches would attend her funeral for a few last words and then go solemnly home alone with the little insistent thought at the back of their minds ive moved up one and newcomers were watched very very carefully morning mrs ogg said a voice behind her i trust i find you well howdyer do mistress shimmy said nanny turning her mental filing system threw up a card clarity shimmy lives over towards cutshade with her old mum takes snuff good with animals hows your mother keepin we buried her last month mrs ogg nanny ogg quite liked clarity because she didnt see her very often oh dear she said but i shall tell her you asked after her anyway said clarity she glanced briefly towards the ring whos the fat girl on now got a backside on her like a bowling ball on a short seesaw thats agnes nitt thats a good cursin voice shes got there you know youve been cursed with a voice like that oh yes shes been blessed with a good voice for cursin said nanny politely esme weatherwax an me gave her a few tips she added claritys head turned at the far edge of the field a small pink shape sat alone behind the lucky dip it did not seem to be drawing a big crowd clarity leaned closer whats she doing i dont know said nanny i think shes decided to be nice about it esme nice about it yes said nanny it didnt sound any better now she was telling someone clarity stared at her nanny saw her make a little sign with her left hand and then hurry off the pointy hats were bunching up now there were little groups of three or four you could see the points come together cluster in animated conversation and then open out again like a flower and turn towards the distant blob of pinkness then a hat would leave that group and head off purposefully to another one where the process would start all over again it was a bit like watching very slow nuclear fission there was a lot of excitement and soon there would be an explosion every so often someone would turn and look at nanny so she hurried away among the sideshows until she fetched up beside the stall of the dwarf zakzak stronginthearm maker and purveyor of occult knicknackery to the more impressionable he nodded at her cheerfully over the top of a display saying lucky horseshoes each hello mrs ogg he said nanny realized she was flustered whats lucky about em she said picking up a horseshoe well i get two dollars each for them said stronginthearm and that makes them lucky lucky for me said stronginthearm i expect youll be wanting one too mrs ogg id have fetched along another box if id known theyd be so popular some of the ladiesve bought two there was an inflection to the word ladies witches have been buying lucky horseshoes said nanny like theres no tomorrow said zakzak he frowned for a moment they had been witches after all er there will be wont there he added im very nearly certain of it said nanny which didnt seem to comfort him suddenly been doing a roaring trade in protective herbs too said zakzak and being a dwarf which meant that hed see the flood as a marvellous opportunity to sell towels he added can i interest you mrs ogg nanny shook her head if trouble was going to come from the direction everyone had been looking then a sprig of rue wasnt going to be much help a large oak treed be better but only maybe the atmosphere was changing the sky was a wide pale blue but there was thunder on the horizons of the mind the witches were uneasy and with so many in one place the nervousness was bouncing from one to another and amplified rebroadcasting itself to everyone it meant that even ordinary people who thought that a rune was a dried plum were beginning to feel a deep existential worry the kind that causes you to snap at your kids and want a drink nanny peered through a gap between a couple of stalls the pink figure was still sitting patiently and a little crestfallen behind the barrel there was as it were a huge queue of no one at all then nanny scuttled from the cover of one tent to another until she could see the produce stand it had already been doing a busy trade but there forlorn in the middle of the cloth was the pile of terrible cakes and the jar of jam some wag had chalked up a sign beside it get thee fpoon out of thee jar tries for a penney she thought shed been careful to stay concealed but she heard the straw rustle behind her the committee had tracked her down thats your handwriting isnt it mrs earwig she said thats cruel that aint nice weve decided youre to go and talk to miss weatherwax said letice shes got to stop it stop what shes doing something to peoples heads shes come here to put the fluence on us right everyone knows she does head magic we can all feel it shes spoiling it for everyone shes only sitting there said nanny ah yes but how is she sitting there may we ask nanny peered around the stall again well like normal you know bent in the middle and the knees letice waved a finger sternly now you listen to me gytha ogg if you want her to go away you go and tell her snapped nanny im fed up with there was the piercing scream of a child the witches stared at one another and then ran across the field to the lucky dip a small boy was writhing on the ground sobbing it was pewsey nannys youngest grandchild her stomach turned to ice she snatched him up and glared into grannys face what have you done to him you she began dontwannadolly dontwannadolly wannasoijer wannawannawannasoljer now nanny looked down at the rag doll in pewseys sticky hand and the expression of affronted tearful rage on such of his face as could be seen around his screaming mouth oiwannawannasoljer and then at the other witches and at granny weatherwaxs face and felt the horrible cold shame welling up from her boots i said he could put it back and have another go said granny meekly but he just wouldnt listen wannawannasol pewsey ogg if you dont shut up right this minute nanny will nanny ogg began and dredged up the nastiest punishment she could think of nanny wont give you a sweetie ever again pewsey closed his mouth stunned into silence by this unimaginable threat then to nannys horror letice earwig drew herself up and said miss weatherwax we would prefer it if you left am i being a bother said granny i hope im not being a bother i dont want to be a bother he just took a lucky dip and youre upsetting people any minute now nanny thought any minute now shes going to raise her head and narrow her eyes and if letice doesnt take two steps backwards shell be a lot tougher than me i cant stay and watch granny said quietly i know your game said letice youre planning to spoil it arent you you cant stand the thought of being beaten so youre intending something nasty three steps back nanny thought else there wont be anything left but bones any minute now oh i wouldnt like anyone to think i was spoiling anything said granny she sighed and stood up ill be off home no you wont snapped nanny ogg pushing her back down on to the chair what do you think of this beryl dismass and you letty parkin theyre all letice began i werent talking to you the witches behind mrs earwig avoided nannys gaze well its not that i mean we dont think began beryl awkwardly that is ive always had a lot of respect for but well it is for everyone her voice trailed off letice looked triumphant really i think we had better be going after all then said nanny sourly i dont like the compny in these parts she looked around agnes you give me a hand to get granny home i really dont need granny began but the other two each took an arm and gently propelled her through the crowd which parted to let them through and turned to watch them go probably the best for all concerned in the circumstances said letice several of the witches tried not to look at her face there were scraps of material all over the floor in grannys kitchen and gouts of congealed jam had dripped off the edge of the table and formed an immovable mound on the floor the jam saucepan had been left in the stone sink to soak although it was clear that the iron would rust away before the jam ever softened there was a row of empty pickle jars as well granny sat down and folded her hands in her lap want a cup of tea esme said nanny ogg no dear thank you you get on back to the trials dont you worry about me you sure ill just sit here quiet dont you worry im not going back agnes hissed as they left i dont like the way letice smiles you once told me you didnt like the way esme frowns said nanny yes but you can trust a frown er you dont think shes losing it do you no onell be able to find it if she has said nanny no you come on back with me im sure shes planning something i wish the hell i knew what it is she thought im not sure i can take any more waiting she could feel the mounting tension before they reached the field of course there was always tension that was part of the trials but this kind had a sour unpleasant taste the sideshows were still going on but ordinary folk were leaving spooked by sensations they couldnt put their finger on which nevertheless had them under their thumb as for the witches themselves they had that look worn by actors about two minutes from the end of a horror movie when they know the monster is about to make its final leap and now its only a matter of which door letice was surrounded by witches nanny could hear raised voices she nudged another witch who was watching gloomily whats happening winnie oh reena trump made a pigs ear of her piece and her friends say she ought to have another go because she was so nervous thats a shame and virago johnson ran off cos her weather spell went wrong left under a bit of a cloud did she and i was all thumbs when i had a go you could be in with a chance gytha oh ive never been one for prizes winnie you know me its the fun of taking part that counts the other witch gave her a skewed look you almost made that sound believable she said gammer beavis hurried over on you go gytha she said do your best eh the only contender so far is mrs weavitt and her whistling frog and it wasnt as if it could even carry a tune poor thing was a bundle of nerves nanny ogg shrugged and walked out into the ropedoff area somewhere in the distance someone was having hysterics punctuated by an occasional worried whistle unlike the magic of wizards the magic of witches did not usually involve the application of much raw power the difference is between hammers and levers witches generally tried to find the small point where a little changes made a lot of result to make an avalanche you can either shake the mountain or maybe you can just find exactly the right place to drop a snowflake this year nanny had been idly working on the man of straw it was an ideal trick for her it got a laugh it was a bit suggestive it was a lot easier than it looked but showed she was joining in and it was unlikely to win damn shed been relying on that frog to beat her shed heard it whistling quite beautifully on the summer evenings she concentrated pieces of straw rustled through the stubble all she had to do was use the little bits of wind that drifted across the field allowed to move here and here spiral up and she tried to stop her hands from shaking shed done this a hundred times she could tie the damn stuff in knots by now she kept seeing the face of esme weatherwax and the way shed just sat there looking puzzled and hurt while for a few seconds nanny had been ready to kill for a moment she managed to get the legs right and a suggestion of arms and head there was a smattering of applause from the watchers then an errant eddy caught the thing before she could concentrate on its first step and it spun down just a lot of useless straw she made some frantic gestures to get it to rise again it flopped about tangled itself and lay still there was a bit more applause nervous and sporadic sorry dont seem to be able to get the hang of it today she muttered walking off the field the judges went into a huddle i reckon that frog did really well said nanny more loudly than was necessary the wind so contrary a little while ago blew sharper now what might be called the psychic darkness of the event was being enhanced by real twilight the shadow of the bonfire loomed on the far side of the field no one as yet had the heart to light it almost all the nonwitches had gone home anything good about the day had long drained away the circle of judges broke up and mrs earwig advanced on the nervous crowd her smile only slightly waxen at the corners well what a difficult decision it has been she said brightly but what a marvellous turnout too it really has been a most tricky choice between me and a frog that lost its whistle and got its foot stuck in its banjo thought nanny she looked sidelong at the faces of her sister witches shed known some of them for sixty years if shed ever read books shed have been able to read the faces just like one we all know who won mrs earwig she said interrupting the flow what do you mean mrs ogg theres not a witch here who could get her mind right today said nanny and most of em have bought lucky charms too witches buying lucky charms several women stared at the ground i dont know why everyone seems so afraid of miss weatherwax i certainly am not you think shes put a spell on you then a pretty sharp one by the feel of it said nanny look mrs earwig no ones won not with the stuff weve managed today we all know it so lets just all go home eh certainly not i paid ten dollars for this cup and i mean to present it the dying leaves shivered on the trees the witches drew together branches rattled its the wind said nanny ogg thats all and then granny was simply there it was as if theyd just not noticed that shed been there all the time she had the knack of fading out of the foreground i jus thought id come to see who won she said join in the applause and so on letice advanced on her wild with rage have you been getting into peoples heads she shrieked an how could i do that mrs earwig said granny meekly past all them lucky charms youre lying nanny ogg heard the indrawn breaths and hers was loudest witches lived by their words i dont lie mrs earwig do you deny that you set out to ruin my day some of the witches at the edge of the crowd started to back away ill grant my jam aint to everyones taste but i never granny began in a modest little tone youve been putting a fluence on everyone i just set out to help you can ask anyone you did admit it mrs earwigs voice was as shrill as a gull and i certainly didnt do any grannys head turned as the slap came for the moment no one breathed no one moved she lifted a hand slowly and rubbed her cheek you know you could have done it easily it seemed to nanny that letices scream echoed off the mountains the cup dropped from her hands and crunched on the stubble then the tableau unfroze a couple of her sister witches stepped forward put their hands on letices shoulders and she was pulled gently and unprotesting away everyone else waited to see what granny weatherwax would do she raised her head i hope mrs earwig is all right she said she seemed a bit dis traught there was silence nanny picked up the abandoned cup and tapped it with a forefinger hmm she said just plated i reckon if she paid ten dollars for it the poor woman was robbed she tossed it to gammer beavis who fumbled it out of the air can you give it back to her tomorrow gammer gammer nodded trying not to catch grannys eye still we dont have to let it spoil everything granny said pleasantly lets have the proper ending to the day eh traditional like roast potatoes and marshmallows and old stories round the fire and forgiveness and lets let bygones be bygones nanny could feel the sudden relief spreading out like a fan the witches seemed to come alive at the breaking of the spell that had never actually been there in the first place there was a general straightening up and the beginnings of a bustle as they headed for the saddlebags on their broomsticks mr hopcroft gave me a whole sack of spuds said nanny as conversation rose around them ill go and drag em over can you get the fire lit esme a sudden change in the air made her look up grannys eyes gleamed in the dusk nanny knew enough to fling herself to the ground granny weatherwaxs hand curved through the air like a comet and the spark flew out crackling the bonfire exploded a bluewhite flame shot up through the stacked branches and danced into the sky etching shadows on the forest it blew off hats and overturned tables and formed figures and castles and scenes from famous battles and joined hands and danced in a ring it left a purple image on the eye that burned into the brain and settled down and was just a bonfire i never said nothin about forgettin said granny when granny weatherwax and nanny ogg walked home through the dawn their boots kicked up the mist it had on the whole been a good night after some while nanny said that wasnt nice what you done i done nothin yeah well it wasnt nice what you didnt do it was like pullin away someones chair when theyre expecting to sit down people who dont look where theyre sitting should stay stood up said granny there was a brief pattering on the leaves one of those very brief showers you get when a few raindrops dont want to bond with the group well all right nanny conceded but it was a little bit cruel right said granny and some people might think it was a little bit nasty right nanny shivered the thoughts thatd gone through her head in those few seconds after pewsey had screamed i gave you no cause said granny i put nothin in anyones head that werent there already sorry esme right but letice didnt mean to be cruel esme i mean shes spiteful and bossy and silly but youve known me since we was girls right granny interrupted through thick and thin good and bad yes of course but and you never sank to sayin im telling you this as a friend did you nanny shook her head it was a telling point no one even remotely friendly would say a thing like that whats empowerin about witchcraft anyway said granny its a daft sort of a word search me said nanny i did start out in witchcraft to get boys to tell you the truth think i dont know that what did you start out to get esme granny stopped and looked up at the frosty sky and then down at the ground dunno she said at last even i suppose and that nanny thought was that deer bounded away as they arrived at grannys cottage there was a stack of firewood piled up neatly by the back door and a couple of sacks on the doorstep one contained a large cheese looks like mr hopcroft and mr poorchick have been here said nanny hmph granny looked at the carefully yet badly written piece of paper attached to the second sack dear misftresf weatherwax i would be moft grateful if you would let me name thif new championfhip variety efine weatherwax yours in hopefully good health percy hopcroft well well well i wonder what gave him that idea cant imagine said nanny i would just bet you cant said granny she sniffed suspiciously tugged at the sacks string and pulled out an esme weatherwax it was rounded very slightly flattened and pointy at one end it was an onion nanny ogg swallowed i told him not im sorry oh nothing granny weatherwax turned the onion round and round while the world via the medium of nanny ogg awaited its fate then she seemed to reach a decision she was comfortable with a very useful vegetable the onion she said at last firm sharp good for the system said nanny keeps well adds flavour hot and spicy said nanny losing track of the metaphor in the flood of relief nice with cheese we dont need to go that far said granny weatherwax putting it carefully back in the sack she sounded almost amicable you comm in for a cup of tea gytha er id better be getting along fair enough granny started to close the door and then stopped and opened it again nanny could see one blue eye watching her through the crack i was right though wasnt i said granny it wasnt a question nanny nodded right she said thats nice
