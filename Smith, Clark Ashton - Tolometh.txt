tolometh by clark ashton smith in billowlost posedonis i was the black god of the abyss my three horns were of similor above my double diadem my one eye was a moonbright gem found in a monstrous meteor incredible far peoples came called by the thunders of my fame and passed before my terraced throne where titan pards and lions stood as pours a neverlapsing flood before the winds of winter blown below my glooming architraves one brown eternal file of slaves came in from mines of chalcedon and camels from the long plateaus laid down their sard and peridoz their incense and their cinnamon the starborn evil that i brought through all the ancient land was wrought all women took my yoke of shame i reared through sumless centuries the thrones of hellblack wizardries the hecatombs of blood and flame but now within my sunken walls the slow blind oceanserpent crawls and seaworms are my ministers and wandering fishes pass me now or press before mine eyeless brow as once the thronging worshippers and yet in ways outpassing thought men worship me that know me not they work my will i shall arise in that last dawn of atomfire to stand upon the planets pyre and cast my shadow on the skies
