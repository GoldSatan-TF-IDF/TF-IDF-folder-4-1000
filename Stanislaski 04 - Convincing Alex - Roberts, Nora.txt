chapter the curvy blonde in hotpink spandex tottered on stiletto heels as she worked her corner her eyes heavily painted with a sunburst of colors kept a sharp watch on her associates those spangled shadows of the night there was a great deal of laughter on the street after all it was springtime in new york but beneath the laughter there was a flat sheen of boredom that no amount of glitter or sex could disguise for these ladies business was business after popping in some fresh gum she adjusted the large canvas bag on her bare shoulder thank god it was warm she thought it would be hell to strut around halfdressed if the weather was ugly a gorgeous black woman in red leather that barely covered the essentials languidly lit a cigarette and cocked her hip come on baby she said to no one in particular in a voice husky from the smoke she exhaled wanna have some fun some did bess noted her eyes skimming the block some didnt all in all she thought business was pretty brisk on this spring night shed observed several transactions and the varied ways they were contracted it was too bad boredom was the byword here boredom and a defiant kind of hopelessness you talking to yourself honey huh bess blinked up into the shrewd eyes of the black goddess in red leather who had strolled over was i youre new studying bess she blew out smoke whos your man my i dont have one dont have one the woman arched her ruthlessly plucked brows and sneered girl you cant work this street without a man thats what im doing since she didnt have a cigarette bess blew a bubble with her gum then snapped it bobby or big ed find out theyre going to mess you up she shrugged after all it wasnt her problem free country girl aint nothing free with a laugh she ran a hand down her slick leathercovered hip nothing at all she flicked her cigarette into the street where it bounced off the rear fender of a cab there were dozens of questions on besss lips it was in her nature to ask them but she remembered that she had to go slow so whos your man bobby with her lips pursed the woman skimmed her gaze up and down bess hed take you on a little skinny through the butt but youd do you need protection when you work the streets and she could use the extra money bobby would pass her way if she brought him a new girl nobody protected the two girls who got murdered last month the black womans eyes flickered bess considered her self an excellent judge of emotion and she saw grief regret and sorrow before the eyes hardened again you a cop besss mouth fell open before she laughed that was a good one she thought sort of flattering no im not a cop im just trying to make a living did you know either of them the women who were killed we dont like questions around here the woman tilted her head if youre trying to make a living lets see you do it bess felt a quick ripple of unease not only was the woman gorgeous she was big big and suspicious both qualities were going to make it difficult for bess to hang back on the fringes and observe but she considered herself an agile thinker and a quick study after all she reminded herself shed come here tonight to do business sure turning she strutted slowly along the sidewalk her hips and she didnt for a minute believe that her butt was skinny swayed seductively maybe her throat was a little dry maybe her heart was pounding a bit too quickly but bess mcnee took a great deal of pride in her work she spotted the two men half a block away and licked her lips the one on the left the dark one looked very promising look rookie the ideas to take one maybe two alex scanned the sidewalk ahead hookers drunks junkies and those unfortunate enough to have to pass through them to get home my snitch says that the tall black one rosalie knew both the victims so why dont we just pick her up and take her in for questioning judd malloy was anxious for action his detectives shield was only fortyeight hours old and he was working with alexi stanislaski a cop who had a reputation for moving quickly and getting the job done better yet why dont we go roust her pimp rookies alex thought why were they always teaming him up with rookies because we want her cooperation were going to pick her up book her for solicitation then were going to talk to her real nice before bobby can come along and tell her to clam up if my wife finds out i spent the night picking up hookers a smart cop doesnt tell his family anything theyd dont need to know and they dont need to know much alexs dark brown eyes were cool very cool as they flicked over his new partners face stanislaskis rule number one he spotted the blonde she was staring at him alex stared back odd face he thought sharp sexy despite the makeup shed troweled on beneath all the gunk her eyes were a vivid green the face itself was all angles some of them wrong her nose was slightly crooked as if it had been broken some john or pimp he figured then skimmed his eyes down to her mouth full overfull and a glossy red it didnt please him at all that he felt a reaction to it not knowing what she was what she did her chin came to a slight point and with her prominent cheekbones it gave her face a triangular foxlike look the clinging tube top and spandex capri pants showed every inch of her curvy athletic little body hed always been a sucker for the athletic type but he reminded himself just where this particular number got her exercise in any case she wasnt the one he was looking for now or never bess told herself feeling her new acquaintances eyes on her hey baby though she hadnt smoked since shed been fifteen her voice was husky saying a prayer to whatever gods were listening she veered in on alex want to party maybe he hooked a finger in the top of her tube and was surprised when she flinched youre not quite what i had it mind sweetie oh what next combining instinct with her observations she tossed her head and leaned into him she had the quick impression of pressing against steel hard unyielding and very cool just what did you have in mind then for a moment she had nothing at all on hers not with the way those dark eyes cut into her through her his knuckles were brushing her skin just above the breasts she felt the heat from them from him as she continued to stare she was struck by a vivid image of the two of them rolling on a narrow bed in some dark room and it had nothing to do with business it was the first time alex had ever seen a hooker blush it threw him off made him want to apologize for the fantasy that had just whipped through his brain then he remembered himself just a different type babe in her heels they were eyetoeye it made him want to rub off the powders and paints to see what was beneath i can be a different type bess said delighted with her inspired response hey girlfriend rosalie strutted over and slipped a friendly arm around besss shoulders youre not going to be greedy and take both of these boys are you i pay dirt alex thought and shifted his attention to rosalie you two a team we are tonight she glanced from alex to his partner how bout you two judd searched for his voice hed rather have been facing a gunman in an alley and he simply couldnt put his hands on this big beautiful woman when a picture of his wifes trusting face was flashing in his head like a neon light sure he let out a long breath and tried to emulate some of alexs cocky confidence rosalie threw back her head and laughed before she stepped forward bumping bodies with judd he gave way instinctively as a dark red flush crept up his neck i believe youre new at this honey why dont you let rosalie show you the ropes because his partner seemed to have developed laryngitis alex took over how much well rosalie didnt bother to look over at bess who had gone dead pale special rate tonight you get both of us for a hundred thats the first hour she leaned down and whispered something in judds ear that had him babbling after that she continued we can negotiate i dont bess began then felt rosalies fingers dig into her bare shoulder like sharp little knives i think thatll do it alex said and pulled out his badge ladies youre busted cops bess realized on a wave of sweet relief while rosalie expressed her opinion with a single vicious word bess struggled not to burst into wild laughter perfect bess thought as she was bumped along into the squad room shed been arrested for solicitation and life couldnt be better trying to take everything in at once she grinned as she scanned the station house shed been in one before of course as she always said she took her work seriously but not in this precinct not downtown it was dirty grimy really she decided making mental notes and muttering to herself floors walls the barred windows everything had a nice picturesque coat of crud it smelled too she took a deep breath so that she wouldnt forget the ripe stench of human sweat bitter coffee and strong disinfectant and it was noisy with every nerve on sensory alert she separated the din into ringing phones angry curses weeping and the clicketyclack of keyboards at work man oh man she thought her luck was really in youre not a tourist sweetheart alex reminded her adding a firm nudge sorry the vibrant excitement in her eyes was so out of place that he stared then with a shake of his head he jabbed a finger toward a chair he was letting the rookie get his feet wet getting the vitals from rosalie once they had her booked hed take over himself using charm or threats or whatever seemed most expedient to make her talk to him about her two murdered associates okay he took his seat behind his battered and overcrowded desk you know the drill shed been staring at a young man of about twenty with a face full of bruises and a torn denim jacket excuse me alex just sighed as he rolled a form onto his typewriter name oh im bess she held out her hand in a gesture so natural and friendly he nearly took it instead he swore softly bess what mcnee and youre in charge date of birth why his eyes flicked up arrowed hers why what why do you want to know patience never his strong suit strained he tapped a finger on the form because ive got this space to fill okay im twentyeight a gemini i was born on june the first alex did the math and typed in the year residence natural curiosity had her poking through the folders and papers on his desk until he slapped her hand youre awfully tense she commented is it because you work undercover damn that smile he thought it was sassy sexy and far from stupid that and those sharp intelligent green eyes might have fooled him but she looked like a hooker and she smelled like a hooker therefore listen doll heres the way this works i ask the questions you answer them tough cynical streetsmart one dark brow lifted excuse me just a quick personality check you want my address right she rattled off an address that made both of alexs brows raise lets get serious okay willing to oblige bess folded her hands on the edge of his desk your address he repeated i just gave it to you i know what real estate goes for in that area maybe youre good thoughtful he scanned her attributes one more time maybe youre better than you look but you dont make enough working the streets to pop for that kind of rent bess knew an insult when it hit her over the head what made it worse was that shed spent over an hour on her makeup and she happened to know that her body was good lord knew she sweated to keep it that way by working out three days a week thats where i live cop her temper which had a habit of flaring quickly had her upending her enormous canvas tote onto his desk alex watched fascinated as she pawed through the pile of contents there were enough cosmetics to supply a small department store and they werent the cheap kind six lipsticks two compacts several mascara sticks and pots of eye shadow a rainbow of eyeliner pencils scattered with them were two sets of keys a snowfall of creditcard receipts rubber bands paper clips twelve pens he counted a few broken pencils a steno pad two paperback books matches a leather address book embossed with the initials elm a stapler he didnt even pause to wonder why she would carry one tissues and crumpled papers a tiny microcassette recorder and a gun he whipped it out of the pile and stared at it a water gun careful with that she warned as she found her overburdened wallet its full of ammonia ammonia i used to carry mace but this works fine here pleased with herself she pushed the open wallet under his nose it might have been her in the picture the hair was short and curly and chic a deep chestnut rather than a brassy blonde but that nose that chin and those eyes he frowned over the drivers license the address was right you got a car she shrugged and began to dump things back into her purse so women in your position usually dont because it made sense bess stalled ive got a license everybody who has a license doesnt have to have a car do they no he jerked the wallet out of her reach take off the wig pouting a little she patted it how come he reached across the desk and yanked it off himself she scowled at him while she ran her fingers through short springy red curls i want that back its borrowed sure he tossed it onto his desk before he leaned back in his squeaky chair for a fresh evaluation if this lady was a hooker he was clark kent what the hell are you it was time to come clean she knew it but something about him egged her on im just a woman trying to make a living officer that was how jade would handle it bess was sure and since jade was her creation bess was determined to do right by her he opened the wallet skimmed through the bills she was carrying around what would be for him more than two weeks pay right can you do that she demanded more curious than annoyed go through my personal property honey right now you are my personal property there were pictures in the wallet as well snapshots of people some with her some without her and the lady was a cardcarrying member of dozens of groups including greenpeace the world wildlife federation amnesty international and the writers guild the last brought him back to the tape recorder when he picked up the little toy he noted that it was running lets have it bess god he was cute the thought passed through her head as she smiled at him have what what were you doing hanging around with rosalie and the rest of the girls my job when his eyes narrowed that way bess thought he was downright irresistible impatient a little mean with a flash of recklessness just barely under control fabulous really all honesty and cheap perfume she leaned forward you see it all has to do with jade and how shes having this problem with a dual personality by day shes a dedicated lawyer a real straight arrow you know but by night she hits the streets shes blocking what happened between her and brock and coupled with a childhood memory thats begun to resurface the strains been too much for her shes on a path of selfdestruction the frown in his eyes turned them nearly black who the hell is jade jade sullivan carstairs dont you watch daytime tv his head was beginning to buzz no you dont know what youre missing youd probably really enjoy the jadestormbrock story line storms a cop you see and hes falling in love with jade her emotional problems and the hold brock has on her complicate things then there was a miscarriage and the kidnapping naturally storm has problems of his own naturally whats your point oh sorry i get offtrack i write for secret sins daytime drama youre a soapopera writer yeah unlike many in the trade she wasnt bothered by that particular label and i like to get the feel of the situations i put my characters into since jade is a special pet of mine i are you out of your mind alex barked the question as he leaned over into her face do you have any idea what you were doing she blinked at once innocent and amused research he swore again and bess found she liked the way he raked impatient fingers through his thick black hair lady just how far were you intending to take your research how oh her eyes brightened with laughter well no not quite that far what the hell would you have done if i hadnt been a cop id have thought of something she continued to smile he had a fascinating face golden skin dark eyes wonderful bones and that mouth so beautifully sculpted even if it did tend to scowl its my job to think of things and when i spotted you i thought you looked safe what i mean is you didnt strike me as the kind of man whod be interested in what was a delicate way of putting it she wondered paying for pleasure he was so angry he wanted to yank her up and toss her over his lap the idea of administering a few good whacks to that cute little butt was tremendously appealing and if youd guessed wrong i didnt she pointed out for a minute there i was worried but it all worked out better than i expected really because i had a chance to ride in a do you still call them paddy wagons hed been so sure hed seen everything heard everything with his temper straining at the bit he spoke through clenched teeth two hookers are dead two who worked that area i know she said quickly as if that explained it all that was one of the reasons i chose it you see i plan to have jade im talking about you he interrupted in a voice that had her wincing you some bubbleheaded hack writer who thinks she can strut around in spandex and a half a ton of makeup then go home to her nice neighborhood and wash it all off hack it was the only thing she took offense to look cop you look you stay out of my territory and out of those slut clothes do your research out of a book her chin shot out i can go where i want wearing what i want you think so there was a way to teach her a lesson a perfect way fine he rose tugged the tote out of her hands then took a firm grip on her arm lets go where to holding babe youre under arrest remember she stumbled in the threeinch heels and squawked but i just explained i hear better stories before breakfast every day youre not going to put me in a cell bess was sure of it positive right up until the moment the bars closed in her face it took about ten minutes for the shock to wear off when it did bess decided it wasnt such a bad turn she could be furious with the cop whoever he was but she could appreciate and take advantage of the unique opportunity hed given her she was in a holding cell with several other women there was atmosphere to be absorbed and there were interviews to be conducted when one of her cellmates informed her that she was entitled to a phone call she demanded one pleased with the progress she was making she settled back on her hard cot to talk to her new acquaintances it was thirty minutes later when she looked up and spotted her friend and cowriter lori banes standing beside a uniformed policeman bess you look so natural here with a grin bess popped up as the guard unlocked the door its been great hey one of her cellmates called out im telling you that vickis a witch and jeffrey should boot her out amelias the right woman for him bess sent back a wink ill see what i can do bye girls lori didnt consider herself longsuffering she didnt consider herself a prude or a stuffed shirt and she said as much to bess as they walked through the corridors up the stairs and back into the lobby area outside the squad room but she added pressing fingers to her tired eyes theres something that puts me off about being woken up at am to come bail you out of jail sorry but its been great wait until i tell you do you know what you look like dear yep unconcerned bess craned her neck the chair behind alexs desk was empty i had no idea that so many of the working girls watched the show but they do work nights mostly uh excuse me she caught the sleeve of one of new yorks finest as he walked by the officer who uses that desk the cop swallowed the best part of a bite of his pastrami sandwich stanislaski whew thats a mouthful is he still around hes in interrogation oh thanks come on bess weve got to pick up your things bess had signed for her purse and its contents still keeping an eye out for alex stanislaski she repeated to herself is that polish do you think how the hell do i know out of patience lori steered her toward the door lets get out of here the place is lousy with criminals i know its fabulous with a laugh she tucked an arm around loris waist i got ideas for the next three years if we decide to have elana arrested for reeds murder i dont know about having reed murdered with a sigh bess looked around for a cab lori we both know jim isnt going to sign another contract he wants to try the big leagues having his character offed is the perfect way to beef up elanas story line maybe bess slyly pulled out her ace our lives our loves picked up two points in the ratings last month lori only grunted word is dr amanda jamison is going to have twins twins lori shut her eyes soap diva ariel kirkwood who played the longsuffering psychiatrist on the competing soap was daytimes most popular star it had to be twins lori muttered okay reed dies bess allowed herself one quickvictory smile then hurried on anyway while i was in there i was picturing the elegant cool dr elana warfield stafford carstairs in prison fabulous lori itd be fabulous i wish youd seen the cop theyd walked to the corner and there wasnt a cab in sight what cop the one who arrested me he was incredibly sexy lori only had the energy to sigh leave it to you to get busted by a sexy cop really all this thick black hair his eyes were nearly black too very intense he had all those hollows and planes in his face and this beautiful mouth nice build too sort of roughandready like a boxer maybe dont start bess im not i can find a man sexy and attractive without falling in love lori shot her a look since when since the last time ive sworn off remember her smile perked up when she spotted a cab heading their way im interested in this stanislaski for strictly professional reasons right resigned lori climbed in when the cab swung to the curb i swear she lifted her right hand to add impact to the oath we want to get into storms head more into his background and stuff so i pick this cops brain a little she gave a cabbie both her address and loris after jade gets attacked by the millbrook maniac storm isnt going to be able to hold back his feelings for her more has to come out about who and what he is if we do have elana arrested for reeds murder thats going to complicate his life you know family loyalty versus professional ethics and once he confronts brock hey at a red light the cabbie turned peering at them from under his fading mets cap you talking about secret sins yeah bess brightened do you watch it the wife tapes it every day you dont look familiar were not on it bess explained we write it gotcha satisfied he punched the accelerator when the light changed let me tell you what i think about that twotiming vicki as he proceeded to do just that bess leaned forward debating with him lori closed her eyes and tried to catch up on lost sleep chapter contents prev next my wife went nuts judd malloy munched on his cherry danish while alex swung in and out of downtown traffic shes a big fan of that soap you know tapes it every day when shes in school terrific alex had been doing his best to forget his little encounter with the soap queen but his partner wasnt cooperating holly figures it was just like meeting a celebrity you dont find many celebrities turning tricks come on alex judd washed down the danish with heavily sugared coffee she wasnt really you said so yourself or the charges wouldnt have been dropped she was stupid alex said between his teeth carrying a damn water pistol in that suitcase of hers i guess she figured if a john got rough shed blat him between the eyes and that would be that judd started to comment on how it might feel to get a blat of ammonia in the eyes but didnt think his partner wanted to hear it well holly was impressed and we got some fresh juice out of rosalie so we didnt waste our time malloy youd better get used to wasting time stanislaskis rule number four alex spotted the building he was looking for and doubleparked he was already out of the car and across the sidewalk before judd found the nypd sign and stuck it in the window we sure as hell could be wasting it here with this domingo rosalie said rosalie said what we wanted to hear so wed spring her alex told him his cops eyes were already studying the building noting windows fire escapes roof maybe she gave us the straight shot on domingo and maybe she pulled it out of a hat well see the place was in good repair no graffiti no broken glass or debris lowermiddleincome alex surmised established families mostly bluecollar he pulled open the heavy entrance door then scanned the names above the line of mailboxes j domingo alex pushed the buzzer for waited then hit the answering buzz released the inner door people are so careless he commented he could feel judds nerves shimmering as they climbed the stairs but he could tell he was holding it together hed damn well better hold it together alex thought as he gestured judd into position then knocked on the door of he knocked a second time before he heard the cursing answer when the door opened a crack alex braced his body against it to keep it that way hows it going jesus what the hell do you want he fit rosalies description alex noted right down to the natty clark gable moustache and the gold incisor conversation jesus just a little conversation i dont talk to nobody at this hour when he tried to shove the door to alex merely leaned on it and flipped open his badge you dont want to be rude do you why dont you ask us in swearing in spanish jesus domingo cracked the door a little wider you got a warrant i can get one if you want more than conversation i can take you down for questioning get the paperwork and do the job before your shyster lawyer can tapdance you out want a team of badges in here jesus i havent done nothing he stepped back from the door a small man with wiry muscles who was wearing nothing but a pair of gym shorts nobody said you did did i say he did malloy enjoying himself judd stepped in behind alex nope the building might be lowermiddleclass but domingos apartment was a small hightech palace stateoftheart stereo equipment alex noted a bigscreen tv with some very classy video toys the wall of tapes ran mostly to the xrated nice place alex commented you sure know how to make your unemployment check stretch i got a good head for figures domingo plucked up a pack of cigarettes from a table lighted one so so lets talk about angie horowitz domingo blew out smoke and scratched at the hair on his chest never heard of her funny we got word you were one of her regulars and her main supplier you got the wrong word maybe you dont recognize the name alex reached into his inside jacket pocket and his fingers brushed over his leather shoulder harness as he pulled out a manila envelope why dont you take a look he stuck the police shot under domingos nose and watched his olive complexion go a sickly gray look familiar man domingos fingers shook as he brought his cigarette to his lips problem alex glanced down at the photo himself there hadnt been much left of angie for the camera oh hey sorry about that jesus malloy didnt i tell you not to put the dead shot in judd shrugged feigning casualness he was thinking he was glad he didnt have to look at it again himself guess i made a mistake yeah all the while he spoke alex held the photo where domingo could see it guys a rookie he explained always screwing up you know poor little angie sure got sliced didnt she coroner said the guy put about forty holes in her you can see most of them poor malloy here took one look and lost his breakfast i keep telling him not to eat those damned greasy danishes before we go check out a stiff but like i said alex grinned to himself as domingo made a dash for the bathroom that was cold stanislaski judd said grinning yeah im that kind of guy and i didnt throw up my breakfast you wanted to the sounds coming from the bathroom were as unpleasant as they get alex tapped on the door hey jesus you okay man im really sorry about that he passed the photo and envelope to judd tell you what let me get you some nice cold water okay the answer was a muffled retch that alex figured anyone could take for assent he moved into the kitchen and opened the freezer the two kilos were exactly where rosalie had said hed find them he took one out just as domingo rushed in you got no warrant you got no right i was getting you some ice alex turned the frozen cocaine over in his hands this doesnt look like a tv dinner to me what do you think malloy by leaning a shoulder against the door jamb judd blocked the doorway not the kind my mother used to make you son of a bitch domingo wiped his mouth with a clenched fist you violated my civil rights ill be out before you can blink could be taking an evidence bag out of his pocket alex slipped both kilos inside malloy why dont you read our friend his rights while hes getting dressed and jesus try some mouthwash stanislaski the desk sergeant called out when alex came up from seeing domingo into a cell you got company alex glanced over toward his desk seeing that several cops were huddled around it there was quite a bit of laughter overriding the usual squad room noise curiosity had him moving forward even before he saw the legs legs he recognized they were crossed at the knee and covered almost modestly in a canaryyellow skirt he recognized the rest of her too though the tough little body was clad in a multihued striped blazer and a scoopnecked blouse the same color as the skirt half a dozen slim columns of gold danced at her ears as she laughed she looked better sexier he was forced to admit with her mouth unpainted her freckles showing and those big green eyes subtly smudged with color her hair was artfully tousled a rich deep red that made him think of a mahogany statue his brother had carved for him so i told the mayor wed try to work it in and wed love for him to come on the show and do a cameo she shifted on the desk and spotted alex he was frowning at her his thumbs tucked into the pockets of a leather bomber jacket officer stanislaski mcnee he inclined his head then swept his gaze over his fellow officers the boss comes in and finds you here i might have to tell him how you didnt have enough work and volunteered to take some of mine just entertaining your guest stanislaski but the use of the squad rooms nickname for their captain had the men drifting reluctantly away what can i do for you well i youre sitting on a homicide he told her oh she scooted off the desk without the stilettos she was half a head shorter than he alex discovered he preferred it that way sorry i came by to thank you for straightening things out for me thats what they pay me for straightening things out hed been certain she would rave a bit about being tossed into a cell but she was smiling friendly as a kindergarten teacher though he couldnt recall ever having a teacher who looked like her or smelled like her regardless i appreciate it my producers very tolerant but if it had gone much further she would have been annoyed annoyed alex repeated he stripped off his jacket and tossed it onto his chair shed have been annoyed to find out that one of her writers was out soliciting johns down at twentythird and eleventh avenue researching bess corrected unoffended darla thats my producer she gets these headaches i gave her a whopper when i went on a job with a cat burglar with a he let his words trail off and eased down on the spot on the desk shed just vacated i dont think you want to tell me about that actually he was a former cat burglar fascinating guy i just had him show me how hed break into my apartment she frowned a little remembering i guess he was a little rusty the alarm dont alex held up a hand he was beginning to feel a headache coming on himself thats old news anyway she waved it away with a cheerful gesture of her hands do you have a first name or do i just call you officer its detective your first name is detective no my rank he let out a sigh alex alex thats nice she ran a fingertip over the strap of his harness she wasnt being provocative she wanted to know what it felt like once she knew him better she was sure shed talk him into letting her try it on well alex i was wondering if youd let me use you hed been a cop for more than five years and until this moment he hadnt thought anything could surprise him but it took him three seconds to close his mouth i beg your pardon its just that youre so perfect she stepped closer she really wanted to get a better look at his weapon without being obvious about it she smelled like sunshine and sex as he drew it in alex thought that combination would baffle any man im perfect absolutely she looked straight into his eyes and smiled her gaze was frank and assessing she was studying him the way a woman might study a dress in a showroom window youre exactly what ive been looking for her eyes were pure green no hint of gray or blue no flecks of gold there was a small dimple near her mouth only one nothing about that odd sexy face was balanced what youre looking for i know youre busy but id try not to take up too much of your time an hour now and then an hour he caught himself echoing her and shook himself loose listen i appreciate youre not married are you married no but that makes it simpler it just came to me last night when i was getting into bed god hed learned to appreciate women early and hed learned to juggle them skillfully if he said so himself he knew how to dodge when to evade and when to sit back and enjoy but with this one all bets were off is this heavy she asked fiddling with his harness you get used to it its just there her smile warmed making him think of sunlight again perfect she murmured id be willing to compensate you for your time and your expertise youd be he wasnt certain if he was insulted or embarrassed hold on babe just think about it bess said quickly i know its a lot to ask but i have this problem with matthew a brandnew emotion snuck in under his guard and it was as green as her eyes matthew who the hell is matthew we call him storm actually lieutenant storm warfield millbrook pd now he definitely had a headache alex rubbed his fingers against his temple millbrook the fictional town of millbrook where the shows set its supposed to be somewhere in the midwest storms a cop personally his lifes a mess but professionally hes focused and intense and occasionally ruthless in this new story line im working on i want to concentrate on his police work the routine the frustrations wait hed always been quick but it was taking him a minute to change gears you want me to help you with a story line exactly if you could just tell me how you think how you go about solving a case working with the system or around it tv cops have to work around the system quite a bit you know it plays better than bythebook he swore under his breath and rubbed his hands over his face damn it his palms were sweaty youre a real case mcnee you dont have to decide right now she was also persistent and she wondered if he had a spare gun strapped to his calf one of those sexylooking little chrome jobs shed seen that ploy in several movies still she thought if she asked him that shed lose her edge im having a thing tonight as she spoke she dug into her huge bag for her notebook eight oclock until whenever bring a friend if you like your partner too he seemed very sweet hes adorable yeah she ripped off the page and handed it to him id really like you to stop by he took the sheet not bothering to remind her he already had her address why why not she beamed at him again before he could list the reasons he heard his name called alexi alexi bess was already enchanted with the sound as she rolled the name over in her head different exotic sexy she was certain it suited him much more than the casual alex bess studied the woman bearing down on them this wasnt one whod be lost in a crowd she mused she was stunning totally selfassured and very pregnant beside bess alex pushed off the desk and sighed rachel a moment of your time detective rachel said flipping a glance over bess before pinning alex with a tawny stare to reacquaint you with civil rights your sister bess surmised beaming at both of them alex sent her a considering frown how did you know that im really good with faces same bone structure same coloring same mouth you have to be brother and sister or first cousins guilty rachel admitted though she would have liked to know what alex was doing with the sharpeyed redhead she wasnt about to be swayed from her duties as a public defender jesus domingo alexi illegal search and seizure bull alex crossed his arms and leaned back against the desk you had a search warrant didnt need one he invited us in and invited you to poke through his belongings i suppose nope alex grinned while bess watched them bounce the verbal ball as though they were champion tennis players jesus got sick i offered to get him some water he didnt object i opened the freezer to get the poor guy some ice and there it was two kilos itll all be in my report thats lame alexi youll never get a conviction maybe maybe not talk to the da i intend to rachel shifted her briefcase and began to rub her belly in circular motions to soothe the baby who seemed to be doing aerobics in her womb you had no probable cause sit down i dont want to sit down the baby does he yanked over a chair and all but shoved her into it when are you going to knock this off it did feel better to sit indescribably better but she wasnt about to admit it the babys not due for two months i have plenty of time we were discussing rach he laid a hand on her cheek very gently a shouted curse wouldnt have stopped her but the small gesture did dont make me worry about you im perfectly fine you shouldnt be here im having a baby its not contagious now about domingo alex gave a brief pithy opinion on what could be done with domingo talk to the da he repeated sitting down she looks pretty strong to me bess commented two pair of eyes turned to her one furious the other thoughtful thank you the men in my life are coddlers rachel explained sweet but annoying muldoon should take better care of you alex insisted i dont need zack to take care of me and the fact is between him and nick im barely allowed to brush my own teeth she held out a hand to bess since my brother is too rude to introduce me im rachel muldoon bess mcnec youre a lawyer thats right i work for the public defenders office really besss thoughts began to perk whats it like to alex held up a hand dont get her started shell pick your brain clean before you know shes had her fingers in it look mcnee he turned to bess determined not to be charmed by her easy smile were a little busy here of course you are im sorry obligingly she swung her huge purse onto her shoulder well talk tonight nice to meet you rachel same here rachel ran her tongue over her teeth and both she and alex watched bess weave her way out of the squad room well that was rude its the only way to handle her believe me hmm she seems like an interesting woman how did you meet her dont ask he sat back down on his desk irked that the scent of sunshine and sex still lingered in the air i cant believe were doing this holly judds pretty wife of eight months was all but hopping out of her party shoes wait until i tell everyone in the teachers lounge where i spent the evening take it easy honey judd tugged at the tie shed insisted he wear its just a party just a party as the elevator rode up she fussed with her honeybrown hair i dont know about you two but it isnt every day i get to eat canapes with celebrities ominously silent alex stayed hunched in his leather jacket he didnt know what the hell he was doing here his first mistake had been mentioning the invitation to judd no matter how insouciant judd pretended to be hed been bursting at the seams when he called his wife alex had been swept along in their enthusiasm but he wasnt going to stay hollys sense of decorum might have insisted that she and judd couldnt attend without him but hed already decided just how hed play it hed go in maybe have a beer and a couple of crackers then hed slip out again hed be damned if hed spend this rare free evening playing soapopera groupie oh my was all holly could say when the elevator doors opened the walls of the private foyer were splashed with a mural of the city times square rockefeller center harlem little italy broadway people seemed to be rushing along the walls just as they did the streets below it was as if the woman who lived here didnt want to miss one moment of the action the wide door to the main apartment was open and music laughter and conversation were pouring out along with the scents of hot food and burning candles oh my holly said again dragging her husband along as she stepped inside from behind them alex scanned the room it was huge and it was packed with people draped in silk or cotton clad in business suits and lush gowns they stood elbow to elbow on the hardwood floor lounged hip to hip on the sapphire cushions of the enormous circular conversation pit sat knee to knee on the steps of a bronze circular staircase that led to an open loft where still more people leaned against a railing decked with naked cherubs two huge windows let the lights of the city in more partygoers sat on the pillowplumped window seats balancing plates and glasses on their laps paintings were scattered over the ivorytoned walls vivid frenetic modern art mindbending surrealism there was enough color to make his head swim yet through the crowd and the clashing tones he saw her dancing seductively with a distinguishedlooking man in a gray pinstriped suit she wore an excuse for a dress the color of crushed purple grapes he wondered irritated if she owned anything that covered those legs this number certainly didnt nor did it cover much territory at all the way it dipped to the waist in the back skimmed above midthigh and left her shoulders bare but for skinny glittery straps multihued gemstones fell in a rope from her earlobes to those nicely sloped shoulders her feet were bare she looked alex thought as his stomach muscles twisted themselves into nasty knots outrageously alluring oh lord theres jade oh and storm and vicki dr carstairs too hollys fingers dug into her husbands arm its amelia who secret sins dummy she gave judd a playful punch the whole casts here thats not all because he remembered in time he was supposed to be jaded judd stopped himself from pointing and inclined his head thats lawrence d strater dancing with our hostess the l d strater of strater industries the fortune s darling the mayors over in that corner talking with hannah loy the grand old lady of broadway his excitement began to hum in his voice as he continued to scan the room man there are enough luminaries in this room to light every borough in new york but alex hadnt noticed furthermore he didnt give a damn his attention was focused on bess shed stopped dancing and had leaned up to whisper something in her partners ear that made him laugh before he kissed her smack on the lips she kissed him back too her hands lightly intimate at his waist before she turned and spotted the new arrivals she waved made her excuses then scooted and dodged her way through the crowd toward them you made it she gave both alex and judd a friendly peck on the cheek before holding out both hands to holly nice to meet you my wife holly this is bess mcnee thanks for asking us holly caught herself starting to stutter as she had the first time she faced a classroom of tenyearolds she flushed my pleasure bess gave her hands a reassuring squeeze lets get you something to eat and drink she gestured toward a long table by the wall instead of the useless finger food and fancy unrecognizable dishes alex had expected it was laden with big pots of spaghetti mountains of garlic bread and generous trays of antipasti its italian night she explained grabbing a plate and heaping it high theres plenty of wine and beer and a full bar she handed the plate to holly and began to dish up another the desserts are on the other side of the room theyre unbelievable as she passed judd a plate she noted the gleam in hollys eyes would you like to meet some of the cast oh i the hell with sophistication yes id love it great excuse us help yourself alexi this is really something judd said over a mouthful of spaghetti something alex agreed deciding to make the best of it he fixed himself a plate he wasnt going to stay but the food was great in any case he didnt have anything else to do it didnt hurt to hang around and rub elbows with the fast and famous while he was helping himself to a good hot meal it certainly made a change from his daily routine of wading through misery and bitterness after washing down spaghetti with some good red wine he found himself a spot on a window seat where he could sit back and watch the show bess dropped down beside him clinked her glass against his best seat in the house some house yeah i like it ill show you the rest later if you want she broke off a tiny piece of the pastry on his plate and sampled it great stuff yeah you got a little here before his good sense could take over he rubbed a bit of the rich cream from her lip watching her he licked it from the pad of his thumb and tasted her its not bad for a moment she wondered if the circuits in her brain had crossed something certainly had sent out a spark she managed a small sound of agreement as she flicked her tongue to the corner of her mouth and tasted him your ah partners wife holly small talk any talk had always come easily to her she wasnt sure why she was laboring now what about her who oh right holly shes nice i cant imagine what it would be like to teach fifthgraders im sure youll ask her i already did at ease again she smiled at him something about that sarcastic edge to his voice made her relax and enjoy come on alexi we may be in different professions but both of them require a certain amount of curiosity about human nature arent you sitting here right now wondering about all of these people and what theyre doing at my party not as much as im wondering what im doing at your party he swirled the wine in his glass before sipping when he drank his eyes stayed on hers watchful she liked that she liked that very much the way he could sit so still energy humming from every pore while he watched while he waited bess was willing to admit that one of her biggest failings was being unable to wait for anything you were curious she told him some her skirt hitched up another inch when she curled her legs up on the seat id be happy to tell you whatever you want to know in exchange for your help you see that guy over there the gorgeous one with the blonde hanging on his biceps alex scanned homed in yeah i wouldnt say he was gorgeous youre not a woman thats my detective storm warfield the black sheep of the snooty disgustingly rich warfield clan the rebel the volatile brother of the longsuffering elana warfield stafford carstairs hes recently pulled himself out of the destructive affair with the wicked wily vicki the blonde crawling up his chest theyre an item offcamera but on storm is madly in love with the tragedyprone and ethereal jade who is of course torn between her feelings for him and her misplaced loyalty to the maniacally clever and dastardly brock carstairs half brother to elanas stalwart husband dr maxwell carstairs max was once married to jades formerly conniving but now repentant sister flame who was killed in a peruvian earthquake soon after the birth of her son who may or may not be her husbands child naturally the body was never recovered either ive had too much wine or youre making me dizzy bess smiled and gave him a companionable pat on the thigh that sent his blood pressure soaring its really not that complicated once you know the players but i want you for storm alex sent the actor a considering look i dont think hes my type your professional expertise detective i need an informal technical advisor my producerd be happy to compensate you for your time particularly since weve been number one in the ratings for the past nine months someone called her name and bess sent a quick wave looks like its going to start to thin out listen can you hang around until ive finished playing hostess she popped up and was gone before he could answer after a moment alex set the rest of the dessert aside and rose if he was going to see the party through he might as well enjoy himself as she saw to the rest of her guests bess kept an eye on him once he decided to relax she noted he made the most of it it didnt surprise her that he knew how to flirt or that several women in the room made a point of wandering in his direction not even lori no pushover in the men department was unaffected so thats the one who busted you lori asked her popping a plump olive into her mouth what do you think lori chewed savored swallowed yumyum with a laugh bess chose a wedge of cheese i assume thats a comment on the man not my buffet you bet and the best part is hes not an actor still sore bess murmured lori shrugged but her gaze cut over to steven marshall alias brock carstairs i never give him or his weenie little brain athought no sensible woman would spend her life competing with an actors ego for attention sense has nothing to do with it lori looked away because it hurt more than she could bear to admit to watch steven while he was so busy ignoring her this from the queen of the bungled relationships i dont bungle them i enjoy them i hasten to remind you that two of your former fiances are in this room its a big party besides i wasnt engaged to lawrence he gave you a ring with a rockthe size of a buick a token of his esteem bess said blithely i never agreed to marry him and charlie and i she waved to charles stutman esteemed playwright we were only engaged for a few months we both agreed gabrielle was perfect for him and parted the closest of friends it was the first time id heard of a woman being best man at her former fiancees wedding lori admitted i dont know how you do it you dont angst over men and they never toss blame your way when things fall apart because i end up being a pal besss lips curved for the briefest of moments there was something wistful in the smile not always a position a woman craves but it seems to suit me going to be pals with the cop once again bess found herself searching the remaining guests for alex she found him dancing slow and close with a sultry brunette it would help if hed bring himself to like me a little i think its going to take some work ive never known you to fail ive got to go see you monday okay bess was astute enough to glance over in stevens direction as lori left she was also clearsighted enough to see the expression of misery in his eyes as he watched lori walk to the elevator people were much too hard on themselves she thought with a sigh love she was certain was a complicated and painful process only if you wanted it to be and she should know she mused as she took another sip of wine she had slipped painlessly in and out of love for years as she set the glass aside alex caught her eye there was a quick surprising tremor around her heart but it was gone quickly as someone swept her up into a dance chapter contents prev next how often do you have one of these things alex asked when he took bess up on her offer of a last cup of cappuccino in her now empty and horribly cluttered apartment oh when the mood strikes the afterparty wreckage didnt concern her she and the cleaning team shed hired would shovel it out sooner or later besides she enjoyed this the mess and debris the spilled wine the lingering scents it was a testament to the fact that she and a good many others had enjoyed themselves want some cold spaghetti she asked him no i do she unfolded herself from the corner section of the pit and wandered over to the buffet i didnt get a chance to eat much earlier just what i could steal off other peoples plates she came back to stretch out on the cushions and twine pasta on her fork what did you think of bonnie who bonnie the brunette you were dancing with the one who stuck her phone number in your pocket remembering alex patted his shirt pocket right bonnie very nice mmmshe is as she agreed bess twined more pasta she propped her feet on the coffee table where they continued to keep the beat of the lowvolume rock playing on the stereo i appreciate your staying ive got some time i still appreciate it let me run this by you okay she continued to eat rapidly working her way through a large plate full of food jades got a split personality due to an earlychildhood trauma which i wont go into thank god dont be snide millions of viewers are panting for more anyway jades alter ego josie is the hooker or will be once we start taping that story line storms nuts about jade its difficult for him as hes a very passionate sort of guy and shes fragile at the moment because of brock you catch on anyway hes wildly in love and miserably frustrated and hes got a hot case to solve the millbrook maniac the alex shut his eyes oh man hey the press is always giving psychotics catchy little labels anyway the maniacs going around strangling women with a pink silk scarf its symbolic but we wont get into that right now either i cant tell you how grateful i am she offered him a forkful of cold pasta after a moment he gave in and leaned closer to take it now the press is going to start hounding storm bess continued and the brass will be on his case too his emotional life is a wreck how does he separate it how does he go about establishing a connection between the three so far victims and when he realizes jade may be in danger how does he keep his personal feelings from clouding his professional judgement thats the kind of stuff you want for a start okay he propped his feet beside hers first you dont separate not like you mean the minute you have to think like a cop thats what you are thats how you think and youve got no personal life until you can stop thinking like a cop again wait bess shoved the plate into his lap then bounded up and hunted through a drawer until she came up with a notebook she dropped onto the sofa again curling up her legs this time so that her knee lay against the side of his thigh okay she said scribbling youre telling me that when you start on a case or get a call or whatever everything else just clicks off since she seemed to be through eating he set the plate on the coffee table it better click off how he shook his head there is no how it just is look cop work is mostly monotonous its routine but its the kind of routine you have to keep focused on make a mistake in the paperwork and some slime gets bounced on a technicality what about when youre on the street thats a routine too and youd better keep your head on that routine if you want to go home in one piece you cant starting thinking about the fight you had with your woman or the bills you cant pay or the fact that your mothers sick you think about now right now or you wont be able to fix any of those things later youll just be dead her eyes flashed up to his he said it so matteroffactly when she studied him she saw that he thought of it that way what about fear you usually have about ten seconds to be afraid so you take them but what if the fears for someone else someone you love then youd better put it aside and do what youve been trained to do if you dont youre no good to yourself or your partner and youre a liability so its cutanddried he smiled a little except on tv youre asking me for feelings mcnee intangibles a cops feelings she told him id think they would be very tangible maybe a cop wouldnt be allowed to show his emotions on the job an occasional flareup maybe but then youd have to suck it in and follow routine and no matter how good you are an arrest isnt always going to stick the bad guy isnt always going to pay that has to cause immeasurable frustration and repressing that frustration considering she tapped her pencil against the pad see i think of people as pressure cookers sure you do no really that quick smile the flash of the single dimple whatevers inside good or bad has to have some means of release or the lids blows she shifted again and her fingers nearly brushed his neck she talked with them hed noted with her hands her eyes her whole body the woman simply didnt know how to be still what do you use to keep the lid on alexi i make sure i kick a couple of small dogs every morning she smiled with entirely too much understanding too personal okay well come back to it later its not personal damn it she made him uncomfortable as if he had an itch in the small of his back that he couldnt quite scratch i use the gym beat the crap out of a punching bag a few days a week lift too many weights sweat it out thats great perfect grinning now she cupped a hand over his biceps and squeezed not too shabby i guess it works she flexed her own arm inviting him to test the muscle it was the gesture of a small boy on a playground but alex couldnt quite think of her that way i work out myself she told him im addicted to it but i cant seem to develop any upperbody strength he watched her eyes as he curled a hand over her arm and found a tough little muscle your upper body looks fine a compliment surprised that a reaction had leapt straight into her gut at the casual touch she started to move her arm he held on it took some work to keep her smile from faltering what you want to armwrestle detective her skin was like rose petals smooth fragrant experimenting he skimmed his hand down to the curve of her elbow she was smiling he noted and her eyes were lit with humor but her pulse was racing a few years back i armwrestled my brother for his wife i lost the idea was just absurd enough to catch her imagination really is that how the stanislaskis win their women whatever works because he was tempted to explore more of that silky exposed skin he rose he reminded himself that the uncomplicated bonnie was more his style than the overinquisitive oddly packaged bess mcnee i have to go whatever had been humming between them was fading now as bess walked him to the door she debated with herself whether she wanted to let those echoes fade or pump up the volume until she recognized the tune stanislaski is that polish russian what were ukrainian ukrainian intrigued she watched him pull his jacket on from the southwest of the european soviet union with the carpathian mountains in the west yeah and through those mountains his family had escaped when he was no more than a baby he felt a tug a small one as he often did when he thought of the country of his blood youve been there only in spirit smiling she straightened his jacket for him i minored in geography in college i like reading about exotic places she kept her hands on the front of his jacket enjoying the feel of leather the scent of it and of him their bodies were close more casual than intimate but close looking into his eyes those dark uncannily focused eyes she discovered she wanted to hear that tune again after all are you going to talk to me again she asked him his fingers itched to roam along that tantalizingly bare skin on her back for reasons he couldnt have named he kept his hands at his side you know where to find me if ive got the time and the answers well talk thanks her lips curved as she rose on her toes so that their eyes and mouths were level she leaned in slowly an inch then two to touch her mouth to his the kiss was soft and breezy either of his sisters might have said goodbye to him in precisely the same manner but that cool and fleeting taste of her didnt make him feel brotherly she heard the humming in her head a nice quiet sound of easy pleasure he tasted faintly of wine and spices and his firm lips seemed to accept the gesture as it was meant as one of affection and curiosity her lips were still curved when she dropped back on her heels good night alexi he nodded he was fairly sure he could speak but there was no point in taking the chance turning he walked into the foyer and punched the elevator button when he glanced back she was still standing in the doorway smiling she waved another goodbye and started to close the door it surprised them both when he whirled around and slapped a hand on it to keep it open the fact that she took an automatic step in retreat surprised her further but it was the look in his eyes she thought that made her feel like a rabbit caught in a rifles cross hairs did you forget something yeah very slowly very deliberately he slid his arms around her waist ran his hand up her back so that her eyes widened and her skin shivered i forgot i like to make my own moves bess braced for the kind of wild assault that was in his eyes and was surprised for the third time in as many minutes he didnt swoop or crush but eased her closer degree by degree until she was molded to him his fingers cruised lazily up her back until they reached the nape of her neck where they cupped and held still his mouth hovered above her his hand moved low intimately where skin gave way to silk stand on your toes he murmured what stand on your toes this time it was his lips that curved dazed she obeyed then gave a strangled gasp when he increased the pressure on her back and pressed them center to center his eyes stayed open as he moved his mouth to hers brushing nipping then taking in a dreamy kind of possession that had her own vision blurring the humming in her brain increased until it was a wall of sound unrecognizable she was deaf to everything else even her own throaty moan as he dipped his tongue between her lips to seduce hers it was all slowmotion and softfocus but that didnt stop the heat from building she could feel the little flames start to flare where she was pressed most intimately against him then spread long patient fingers of fire outward everywhere he never pushed he never pressured he savored as a man might who had enjoyed a satisfying meal and was content to linger over a tasty dessert even knowing she was being sampled tested lazily consumed she couldnt protest for the first time in her life bess understood what it was to be helplessly seduced he hadnt meant to do this hed been thinking about doing just this for hours however much pleasure it gave him to feel her curvy body melt against his to hear those small vulnerable sounds vibrating in her throat to taste that dizzy passion on her lips he knew hed made a mistake she wasnt his type and he was going to want more the instinct hed been born with and then honed during his years on the force helped him to hold back that part of himself that if let loose could turn the evening into a disaster for both of them still he lingered another moment taking himself to the edge when his system was churning with her and his mind was clouded with visions of peeling her out of that swatch of a dress he stepped back he supported her by the elbows until her eyes fluttered open they were big and dazed he clenched his teeth to fight back the urge to pull her to him again and finish what hed started but however stunned and fragile she looked at the moment alex recognized a dangerous woman hed been a cop long enough to know when to face danger and when to avoid it you ah where was all her glib repartee bess wondered it was a little difficult to think when she wasnt sure her head was still on her shoulders well she managed and settled for that well he let her go and added a cocky grin before he walked back to the elevator though his stance was relaxed he was praying the elevator would come quickly before he lost it and crawled back to her door she was still there when the elevator rumbled open alex let out a quiet relieved breath as he stepped inside and leaned against the back wall see you around mcnee he said as the doors slid shut yeah she stared at the muralcovered walls see you around holly hasnt been able to stop talking about that party judd was scarfing down a blueberry muffin as alex cruised broadway it made her queen of the teachers lounge i bet alex didnt want to think about besss party he especially didnt want to think about what would be after the party work was what he needed to concentrate on and right now work meant following up on the few slim leads theyd hassled out of domingo if domingos given it to us straight angie horowitz was excited about a new john alex tapped his fingers against the steering wheel hed hired her two wednesdays running dressed good tipped big judd nodded as he brushed muffin crumbs from his shirt and she was killed on a wednesday so was rita shaw its still pretty thin alex so we make it thick it continued to frustrate him that theyd wasted time interrogating the desk clerks at the two fleabag hotels where the bodies had been found like most in their profession the clerks had seen nothing heard nothing knew nothing as for the ladies who worked the streets however nervous they were they werent ready to trust a badge tomorrows wednesday judd said helpfully i know what the hell tomorrow is do you do anything but eat judd unwrapped another muffin i got low blood sugar if were going to go back and look at the crime scene again i need energy what you need is alex broke off as he glanced past judds profile and into the glaring lights of an allnight diner he knew only one person with hair that shade of red he began to swear slowly steadily as he searched for a parking place you really write for tv rosalie asked bess finished emptying a third container of nondairy product into her coffee thats right i didnt think you were a sister interested as much in bess as in the fifty dollars shed been paid rosalie blew out smoke rings and you want to know what its like to turn tricks i want to know whatever youre comfortable telling me bess shoved her untouched coffee aside and leaned forward im not sitting in judgment or asking for confidences rosalie id like your story if you want to tell it or we can stick with generalities you figure you can find out whats going on on the streets by putting on spandex and a wig like you did the other night i found out a lot bess said with a smile i found out its tough to stand in heels on concrete for hours at a time that a woman has to lose her sense of self in order to do business that you dont look at the faces the faces dont matter the money does and what you do isnt a matter of intimacy not even a matter of sex for you but a matter of control she scooted her coffee back and took a sip am i close for a moment rosalie said nothing youre not as stupid as you look thanks im always surprising people that way especially men yeah for the first time rosalie smiled beneath the hardedged cosmetics and the lines life had etched in her face she was a striking woman not yet thirty ill tell you this girlfriend the men who pay me see a body they dont see a mind but i got a mind and i got a plan ive been on the streets five years i aint going to be on them five more what are you going to do what do you want to do when i get enough saved up im going south going to get me a trailer in florida and a straight job maybe selling clothes i look real fine in good clothes she crushed out her cigarette and lit another lots of us have plans but dont make it i will im clean she said and lifted her arms turning them over it took bess a minute to realize rosalie was saying she wasnt a user one more year im gone less than that if i hook on to a regular john with money angie did angie bess flipped through her mental file angie horowitz isnt that the woman who was murdered yeah rosalie moistened her lips before sucking in smoke she wasnt careful im always careful how can you be careful you keep yourself ready rosalie told her angie she liked to drink shed talk a john into buying a bottle thats not being careful and this guy the rich one he what the hell do you think youre doing both rosalie and bess looked up standing beside the scarred table was a tall man with thin shoulders there was a cheroot clamped between his teeth and a diamond winked on his finger his face was moonpale with furious blue eyes his hair was nearly as white and slicked back ending in a short ponytail im having me a cup of coffee and a smoke bobby rosalie told him but beneath the defiance bess recognized the trickle of fear you get back on the street where you belong excuse me bess offered her best smile bobby is it he cast his icy blue eyes on her you looking for work sweetheart ill tell you right now i dont tolerate any loafing thank you but no im not looking rosalie was just helping me with a small problem she doesnt solve anyones problems but mine he jerked his head toward the street move it bess slid out of the booth but held her ground this is a public place and were having a conversation you dont talk to anybody i dont tell you to talk to bobby gave rosalie a hard shove toward the door bess didnt think simply reacted if she detested anything it was a bully now just a damn minute she grabbed his sleeve he rounded on her other patrons put on their blinders when he pushed her into the table bess came up fists clenched just as alex slammed through the door one move bobby he said tightly just one move toward her bobby brushed at his sleeve and shrugged i just came in for a cup of coffee isnt that right rosalie yeah rosalie closed her hand over the business card bess had slipped her we were just having some coffee but alexs eyes were all for bess she didnt look pale and frightened her eyes were snapping and her cheeks were flushed with fury tell me you want to press charges im sorry with an effort bess relaxed her hands we were just having a conversation nice talking to you rosalie sure she swaggered out blowing smoke in alexs face for effect take off bobby moved his shoulders again smirked the coffees lousy here anyway he flicked a glance at bess next time sweetheart alex waited ten humming seconds after the door swung shut without a word he stalked over to bess and grabbed her by the arm and hustled her out the door look if this is a knightinshiningarmor routine i appreciate it but i dont need rescuing you need a straitjacket with murder in his heart he dragged her half a block in the car he snapped opening the back door of the patrol car a cab would be he swore put a hand on her head and shoved her into the back seat resigned bess settled back hi judd she said as he took his place in the passenger seat in front hows holly great thanks he slanted a look toward his partner ah she really had a good time at your place im glad well have to do it again alex whipped out into traffic with enough force to have her slamming back against the seat without missing a beat bess crossed her legs am i allowed to ask where were going or is this another bust i should be taking you to bellevue where you belong alex responded but im taking you home well thanks for the lift his eyes flashed to hers in the rearview mirror her face was still flushed and her irises were a sharp enough jade to slice to the bone but she looked more miffed than upset miffed he thought with a snort stupid word it fit her perfectly youre an idiot mcnee and like most idiots youre dangerous oh really she scooted up in the seat so that she could lean between him and judd just how do you figure that smart guy not only do you go back down to an area you have no business even knowing about give me a break but he continued you sit there drinking coffee with a hooker then pick a fight with her pimp the kind of guy whod as soon give a woman a black eye as wish her goodmorning bess poked a finger at his shoulder i didnt pick a fight with anyone and if i had it would be my business thats why youre an idiot hey alex ease off keep out of this alex and bess snarled in unison im not even here judd mumbled scooting down in his seat it so happens i was conducting an interview bess folded her arms on the seat so that she wouldnt give in to the nasty urge to twist alexs ear in a public place she added and you had no right to come bursting in and ruining everything before id finished if i hadnt come bursting in babe youd have had your nose broken again she scowled wrinkling her undeniably crooked nose i can defend my nose and anything else just fine yeah anyone can see youre a regular amazon ow he slapped at her hand and swore the air blue when she gave in and twisted his ear the minute i get you out of this car im going to uh alex i told you to keep out of it im out judd assured him but you might want to take a look at the liquor store coming up at nine oclock still steaming alex did then let out a heavy sigh perfect this makes it perfect call it in bess watched wideeyed as judd radioed in an armed robbery in progress gave their location and requested backup before she could shut her gaping mouth alex was swinging to the curb you he said stabbing a finger in her face stay in the car or i swear ill wring your neck im not going anywhere bess assured him after she managed to swallow the large ball of fear lodged in her throat but before the words were out he and judd were out of the car and drawing their weapons hed already forgotten her she realized as she stared at his profile before he and judd had crossed the street hed put on his cops mind and his cops face shed seen hundreds of actors try to emulate that particular look some came close she realized but this was the real thing it wasnt grim or fierce but flat almost blank except for the eyes she thought with a quick shudder shed had only one glimpse of his eyes but it had been enough life and death had been in them and a potential for violence she would never have guessed at in the darkened car she gripped her hands together and prayed he hadnt forgotten her it infuriated him that he had to fight to tuck her into some back corner of his mind there were innocent people in that store a man and a woman he could smell the fear while he was still three yards away but he broke his concentration long enough to glance back and make certain she was staying put he gestured judd to one side of the door while he took the other he didnt have time to worry that the rookie might freeze right now they were just two cops and he had to believe judd would go with him through the door the mm felt warm in his hand hed already identified the weapons of the two perpetrators one had a sawedoff shotgun the other a wickedlooking he could hear the woman crying pleading not to be hurt alex ignored it they would wait for backup as long as they could he shifted just enough to look inside behind the counter a woman of approximately sixty stood with her hands at her throat weeping a man of about the same age was emptying the cash register as fast as his trembling hands allowed one of the gunmen grabbed a bottle off a shelf he ripped off the top and guzzled swearing at the old man he smashed the bottle on the counter and jabbed the broken glass toward his face alex had seen the look before and he knew they wouldnt be content with the money were going in he whispered to judd you go low go for the one on the right pale judd nodded say when dont fire your weapon unless you have to alex sucked in his breath and went through the door police in the back of his mind he heard the sirens from the backup as the first gunman swung the shotgun in his direction drop it he ordered knowing it was useless the woman was already screaming before the first shots were fired the shotgun blew out a bank of fluorescent lights as the force of alexs bullet sent the man slamming backward alex was getting the second man in his sights when a bullet from the slammed into a bottle inches above his head spraying alcohol and glass judd fired and stopped being a rookie slowly with the same blank look on his face alex came out of his crouch and studied his partner judd wasnt pale now he was green you okay yeah after replacing his weapon judd rubbed the back of his hand over his mouth there was a greasy knot in his stomach that was threatening to leap into his throat it was my first i know go outside im okay alex gave him a nudge on the shoulder his hand remained there a moment surprisingly gentle go outside anyway tell the backup to call an ambulance bess was waiting beside the car when alex came out some twenty minutes later he looked the same she thought just the same as hed looked when he walked in then he lifted his head and looked at her and she saw she was wrong his eyes hadnt looked so tired so terribly tired twenty minutes before i told you to stay in the car i did then get back in gently she laid a hand on his arm alexi you made your point ill take a cab you have things to do ive done them he skirted the car and yanked open the passenger door she could almost feel his body vibrating but when he spoke his voice was firm sharp get in the damn car bess she didnt have the heart to argue so she crossed over and complied what about judd hes heading to the cop shop to file the report oh he let the silence hang for three blocks it hadnt been his first but he hadnt told judd that the bright shaky sickness didnt fade it only turned inward becoming anger disgust frustration and you never stopped asking yourself why arent you going to ask how it felt what went through my mind what happens next no she said it quietly i dont have to ask when i can see and its easy enough to find out what happens next it wasnt what he wanted he didnt want her to be understanding or quietly agreeable or to turn those damned sympathetic eyes on him passing up a chance for grist for your mill mcnee you surprise me or cant your tv cop blow away a couple of stoned perps he was trying to hurt her well she understood that bess thought it often helped to lash out when you were in pain im not sure i can fit it into any of our scheduled story lines but who knows his hands clenched on the wheel i dont want to see you down there again understand if i do i swear ill find a way to lock you up for a while dont threaten me detective you had a rough night and im willing to make allowances but dont threaten me leaning back she shut her eyes in fact do us both a favor and dont talk to me at all he didnt but when he pulled up at her building the smoke from his anger was still hanging in the air satisfied she slammed out of the car shed taken two steps when he caught up with her come here he demanded and hauled her against him she tasted it all the violence and pain and fury of what hed done that night what hed had to do there was no way for her to comfort she wouldnt have dared there was no way for her to protest she couldnt have tried instead she let the sizzling passion of the kiss sweep over her just as abruptly he let her go hed be trembling in a minute and he knew it god he needed something from her needed but didnt want stay off my turf mcnee he turned on his heel and left her standing on the sidewalk chapter contents prev next when it comes to murder bess mused i like a nice quickacting poison something exotic i think lori pursed her lips if were going to do it i really think he should be shot through the heart shifting in her seat at the cluttered table bess scooped up a handful of sugared almonds too ordinary reeds a sophisticated sensuous cad i think he should go out with more than just a bang she munched and considered in fact we could make it a slow insidious poison milk a few weeks of him wasting away nagging headaches dizzy spells loss of appetite lori put in and chills he really should have chills bess steepled her hands and imagined he gives this big cocktail party see you know how he likes to flaunt his power and money in the faces of all the people hes dumped on over the years lori sighed thats why i love him and why millions of viewers love to hate him if were going to take him out lets do it big theyre all there at reeds mansion jade whos never forgiven him for using her sister for his own evil ends elana whos agonizing over the fact that reed will use his secret file distorting the information to discredit max mmm getting into the spirit lori gestured with her watereddown soft drink brock whos furious that with one phone call reed can upset the delicate balance of the tryson deal and cost brock a fortune and miriam of course of course we havent seen nearly enough of her lately reeds selfdestructive exwife who blames him for all her problems justifiably lori pointed out then theres vicki the woman scorned jeffrey the cuckolded husband she grinned and the rest of the usual suspects okay what kind of poison something rare bess mused maybe oriental ill work on it she scribbled a reminder on a notepad so they all have a motive for killing him even the housekeeper because he seduced her naive innocent daughter then cast her aside sometime during the party we see a glass of champagne the rooms in shadows closeup on a small black vial a hand pours a few drops into the glass well see if its a man or woman the hands gloved bess decided then realized how ridiculous it would be to wear gloves at a cocktail party okay okay we dont see it at the party before theres this box see this ornately carved wooden box and the gloved hand opens it candlelight flickers off the glass vial as the hand removes it from the bed of velvet thats the ticket well cut to that kind of thing three or four times during the week of the party let the audience know its bad business for somebody meanwhile reeds playing everyone like puppets handing out his personal brand of misery building the pressure to the boiling point until it explodes on the night of the party itll be great bess assured her throughout the evening reeds enjoying himself stirring up old fires poking at sores miriam has too much to drink and gets sloppy and shrill this provides the perfect distraction for our killer to doctor reeds champagne because its slowacting the symptoms dont begin to show right away we have some fatigue a little dizziness some minor pain maybe a rash i like a good rash lori agreed by the time he kicks off itll be difficult for the cops to pinpoint the time and place when the poison was administered we just might have the perfect crime there is no perfect crime both bess and lori glanced toward the doorway alex stood there his hands tucked in his pockets there was a half smile on his face a result of his enjoyment at listening to them plotting a murder besides if your tv cop didnt figure it out your viewers would be pretty disappointed hell figure it out bess reached for another almond as she watched him her bare feet propped on the chair beside her alex discovered that the baggy slacks she wore effectively hid her legs but didnt stop him from thinking about them did somebody call a cop she asked lori not me well aware that three was most definitely a crowd lori rose listen ive got to make a call and i think ill run up and peek in on the taping nice to see you detective yeah he shifted so that lori could get through the door but he didnt step inside instead he glanced around annoyed with himself for feeling so awkward some place he said at length besss lips curved the room was hardly bigger than a closet and windowless the table where she and lori worked was covered with books folders and papers and dominated by a word processor that was still humming besides the table there was one overstuffed chair a small couch and two televisions we call it home bess said and tilted her head so what brings you down to the dungeons alexi the description was fairly apt they were in the basement of the building that held the studios and production offices for secret sins and its network he shrugged off her question with one of his own how long are you in for the duration i hope casually she rubbed the ball of one foot over the instep of the other after the last emmy they did offer us an upstairs office with a view but lori and i are creatures of habit besides whos going to come down here and peek over our shoulders while we write she recrossed her ankles are you offduty i took a couple hours personal time oh she drew the word out thinking he looked very appealing when he was embarrassed should i consider this a personal visit yeah he stepped inside then regretted it there wasnt enough room to wander around listen i just wanted to apologize it was probably very small of her bess thought but oh she was enjoying this generally or specifically specifically he shook his head when she held out the bowl of almonds after the robbery attempt when i took you home i was out of line okay she set the bowl down and smiled at him were dealing with your behavior during the last half hour of the evening his brows drew together everything i said before that sticks you had no business doing what you were doing where you were doing it get back to the apology i like that better i took what i was feeling out on you and im sorry figuring the worst was over he sat on the edge of the table you didnt react the way i expected which was scared outraged disgusted he shrugged again i dont usually take women to armed robberies now things were getting interesting where do you take them his gaze locked on hers he knew when he was being teased and he knew when it was goodnatured to dinner to the flicks dancing to bed well armed robbery is probably more exciting at least than the first three she rose placed her hands on his shoulders and kissed him lightly on the mouth no hard feelings when his hands came to her hips and held her in place she lifted a brow was there something else ive been thinking about you that could be good his lips twitched i havent decided that yet maybe we could start with dinner start what working our way to bed thats where i want you oh her breath came out a little too quickly and not quite steady it didnt help that his eyes were calm amused and very confident how she wondered had their positions been so neatly reversed thats certainly cutting to the chase you said once that people in our professions observe people what ive observed about you mcnee is that youd probably see through any flowers and moonbeams i might toss at you slowly she ran her tongue over her teeth depends on your pitching arm the idea isnt without its appeal alexi but i prefer taking certain aspects of my life sex being one of them in a cautious gradual manner he grinned at her that could be good she had to laugh meanwhile but he didnt let her scoot back meanwhile he echoed keeping his hands firm have dinner with me just dinner hadnt she told herself she wasnt going to get involved again fall in love again oh well i often enjoy just dinner tomorrow im on tonight tomorrows fine he nudged her an inch closer im making you nervous no youre not yes he was youre wriggling he grinned again surprised at how satisfying it was to know hed unsettled her ive got work thats all me too why dont i come by about seventhirty my brotherinlaws got this place i think youll get a kick out of it lady clothes or real clothes what are you wearing now she glanced down at her sweater and slacks real ones thatll do he stood then tilted her chin with a finger until they were eyetoeye you have the oddest face he said half to himself you should be ugly she laughed unoffended i was ive burned all pictures of me before the age of eighteen her dimple winked out as she smiled at him i imagine you were always gorgeous he winced though he knew he should be used to having that term applied to him my sisters were gorgeous he told her are my brother and i are ruggedly attractive ah manly men you got it and you grew up surrounded by flocks of adoring females we started with flocks and moved on to hordes her eyes lit with amusement and curiosity what was it like to he cut her off the most sensible way he liked the quick little jolt her body gave before she settled into him and the way her mouth softened accepted no pretenses here he thought as she gave a quiet sigh and melted into the kiss it was simple and easy as basic as breathing if his system threatened to overcharge he knew how to control it perhaps he drew the kiss out longer than hed intended to deepened it more than he had planned but he was still in control maybe for just a moment he imagined what it would be like to lock the door to sweep all those papers off the table and take her fast and hot on top of it but he wasnt a maniac he reminded himself of that even as his blood began to swim a slow and gentle touch brought pleasure to both and let a woman see that she was appreciated for everything she was dangerous he murmured in ukrainian as he slid his mouth from her very dangerous woman what she blinked at him with eyes that were arousingly unfocused and heavy what does that mean he had to make a conscious effort to keep his hands gentle at her shoulders i said i have to go keep off the streets mcnee she called to him as he reached the doorway detective her heart was thumping her head was reeling but she really hated not having the last word for lack of anything better she dredged up an old line from hill street blues lets be careful out there alone she lowered herself into a chair as carefully as an elderly aunt five minutes later lori found her in exactly the same spot still staring into space uhoh one look had lori dropping down beside her with a shake of her head she handed bess a fresh soft drink i knew it i knew this was going to happen the minute i saw that gorgeous cop at your party it hasnt happened yet bess took a long drink funny she hadnt realized how dry her throat had become im afraid its going to but it hasnt happened yet you had that same look on your face when you fell for charlie and for sean and miguel not to mention then dont frowning she focused on lori miguel are you certain i was sure i had better taste miguel lori said ruthlessly granted you came to your senses within fortyeight hours but the day after he took you to the opera you had the same stupid look on your face we saw carmen bess pointed out i dont think the look had anything to do with him besides im not in love with alexi im just having dinner with him tomorrow thats what you always say like with george besss shoulders straightened george was the sweetest man ive ever known being engaged to him taught me a lot about understanding and compassion i know you were understanding enough to be godmother to his firstborn well after all i did introduce him to nancy and he promptly dumped you and ran off with her he didnt dump me i wish you wouldnt hold that against him lori breaking our engagement was a mutual decision and the best thing to happen to you george was a wimp a whiny wimp because it was precisely true bess sighed he just needed a lot of emotional support at least you never slept with him he was saving himself they looked at each other and burst out laughing once she caught her breath bess shook her head i should never have told you that it was indiscreet observation lori announced and bess gestured a goahead the cop isnt going to save himself i know bess felt the warning flutter in her stomach thoughtfully she drew her finger down through the moisture on the bottle ill cross that bridge when i come to it bess you dont cross bridges you bum them lori gave her hand a quick squeeze dont get hurt there was a touch of regret in besss smile do i ever alex liked the way she looked it took a certain panache he supposed to be able to wear the jadetoned blouse with bright blue slacks particularly if you were going to add hotpink hightops but bess pulled it off everything about her was vivid he supposed that was why hed gone into her office to apologize and ended up asking her out it was probably why he hadnt been able to get her or the idea of taking her to bed out of his mind since hed met her for herself bess took one look at zackary muldoons bar lower the boom and knew she had a relaxed enjoyable evening in store there was music from the juke box a babble of voices a medley of good rich scents the tangle of pearshaped gemstones at her ears swung as she turned to alex this is great is the food as good as it smells better he gave a wave in the general direction of the bar as he found them a table as usual the bar was cluttered with people and thick with noise since his sister had married zack alex had made a habit of dropping in once a week or so and he knew most of the regulars by name he grinned at the waitress who stopped at their table hey lola hows it going itll do cutie resting her tray on her hip lola gave bess the onceover though less than ten years alexs senior lola had taken a maternal interest in him it wasnt often alex brought a date into the bar and lola made it her business to check out his current lady so what can i get you tequila bess dropped her bag in the empty chair beside her with a thunk straight up alex only lifted a brow at besss choice give me a beer lola rachel around upstairs and she better have her feet up she gave the ceiling a scowl shell probably sneak down here fore the nights over cant keep her away from the boss whats rios special tonight paella her eyes lit with appreciation shed sampled some herself hes been driving nick crazy making him shell shrimp you game for that alex asked bess you bet as lola wandered off bess propped her chin on her hands so whos the boss whos rio and whos nick zacks the boss he gestured toward the tall broadshouldered man working the bar rios the cook this jamaican giant wholl fix you the best meal this side of heaven nicks zacks brother bess nodded she liked to know the players and rachels married to zack after a long study of the man behind the bar she smiled impressive howd she meet him she was nicks pd after i busted him for attempted burglary bess didnt blink or look shocked she simply leaned a little closer what was he stealing alex was vaguely disappointed that he hadnt gotten a reaction electronics and doing a poor job of it he was tangled up with a gang at the time this was about a year and a half ago absently he toyed with the squarecut aquamarine on her finger watching it catch the light nick had some problems actually hes zacks stepbrother nick was still a kid when zack went off and joined the navy and his mother died anyhow when zack came back a few years ago his father was dying and the kid was chindeep in trouble this is great bess beamed up at lola as their drinks were served thanks the smile did it lola sent alex a look of approval before she swung by the bar to report to zack dont stop now alex lifted his mug of beer he knew very well that lola was giving zack a sotto voce rundown of her impressions and opinions of his choice of companion you want to hear the whole thing of course i do bess sprinkled salt on her wrist licked it then tossed back the tequila with all the flair of a mexican bandit while she sucked on the lime wedge lola had brought with the drink she grinned at zack i like the zing how many times can you do that and live i havent tested it that far the liquor left a nice trail of heat down her throat and into her stomach i did ten once but i was younger then and stupid so keep going she leaned forward again zack came back after sailing the seven seas and found his brother in trouble well nick was tangled up with the cobras alex began by the time their paella was served he was enjoying himself it always polished a mans ego to have a womans complete and fascinated attention so thats how i ended up on the point of having an irishukrainian niece or nephew terrific youve got a flair for storytelling alexi must be some gypsy blood in there naturally she smiled at him all he needed was a hoop of gold in one ear and a violin she thought but she was sure he wouldnt want to hear it it doesnt hurt that you have this wisp of an accent that peeks out now and then of course your materials firstrate too im a sucker for happy endings i cant have many of them in my field once we tie things up we have to unravel them again or we lose the audience why i thought most people went for the happy ending they do but in soaps a character loses the edge if he or she isnt dealing with some crisis or tragedy she sampled the paella and sighed her satisfaction thats why elanas been married twice had amnesia was sexually assaulted had two miscarriages and a nervous breakdown went temporarily blind shot a former lover in selfdefense overcame a gambling addiction had twins who were kidnapped by a psychotic nurse and recovered them only after a long heartrending and perilous search through the south american jungles she took another glorious bite not necessarily in that order before alex could ask who elana was lola was setting down fresh drinks you watch secret sins she asked bess religiously you well yeah she shrugged knowing there were several patrons in the bar whod rag her about it i got hooked when i was in the hospital having my youngest hes ten now that was back when elana was a firstyear resident at millbrook memorial and in love with jack banner he was a great character one of the best bess agreed brooding and selfdestructive i was really sorry when he died in that warehouse fire i didnt think elana would ever get over it shes a tough lady bess commented had to be when someone called her lola waved to them to wait if it hadnt been for her storm would never have gotten himself together and become the man he is today you like storm oh man who wouldnt with a chuckle lola rolled her eyes the guys every womans fantasy you know im really pulling for him and jade they deserve some happiness after everything theyve been through jeez all right harry im on my way enjoy your dinner she said to bess and hurried off bess turned to alex with a smile you look confused he only shook his head you two were talking about those characters as though they were real people but they are bess told him and scooped up some shrimp for an hour a day five days a week didnt you ever believe in batman or sam spade scarlett ohara indiana jones its fiction good fiction creates its own reality thats entertainment picking up the saltshaker she grinned come on alexi even a cop needs to fantasize now and then he looked at her long enough to make her pulse dance i do my share bess swallowed the tequila but its zing paled beside the one that alexs quiet statement had streaking through her youll have to tell me about that sometime she glanced around at the sound of piano music against the far wall was a huge upright a slimly built sandyhaired young man was caressing blues out of the keys thats nick alex told her really bess angled her chair around for a better look hes very good yeah he talked zack into putting a piano in the bar about a year ago rachel and muldoon tried to get him to go back to school get more training but no dice some things cant be taught bess murmured looks like anyway he still works in the kitchen with rio and comes out and plays when the mood strikes and has every female in the joint mooning over him hes just a kid alex said quickly too quickly with her tongue in her cheek bess turned back younger men have their own appeal to the experienced woman in fact right now jessica is embroiled in a passionate affair with tod whos ten years her junior the mail is running five to one in favor we were talking about you she only smiled were we zack walked over to slap alex on the back hows the meal its terrific bess held out a hand youre zack im bess nice to see you zack kept a hand on alexs shoulder after giving besss a quick squeeze you must be the bess rachel ran into down at the station i must be you have a great place here now that ive found it ill be back thats what we like to hear his blue eyes sparkled with friendly curiosity alex doesnt bring his ladies around very often he likes to keep us guessing she couldnt help but respond to the humor in zacks eyes is that so ease off muldoon alex muttered hes still sore at me for stealing his baby sister alex sent him an arched look i just figured she had better taste he lifted his beer speaking of which he gestured with the mug bess saw zacks eyes change and recognizing love her heart sighed it didnt surprise herwhen rachel came to the table whats this rachel demanded a party and nobody invited me sit zack and alex said in unison im tired of sitting ignoring them both she turned to bess nice to see you again she took a deep appreciative sniff rios paella incredible isnt it yes it is alex was just telling me how the two of you met oh rachels brow lifted why dont you join us and give me your side of it twenty minutes later alex was forced to admit that besss casual friendliness had gotten rachel to sit down and relax in a way neither he nor zack would have been able to with their demanding concern for a woman who was so full of energy and verve she had a knack for putting people at ease he noted a gift for listening to details and asking just the right question and for entertaining he mused effortlessly it didnt surprise him that she was able to talk music with nick when he was called over to join them or food with rio when she asked to go back into the kitchen to compliment him on the meal he wasnt surprised when she and rachel made a date to meet for lunch the following week i like your family bess stated as they settled into a cab youve only met a fraction of it well i like the ones ive met how much more do you have my parents another sister her husband their three kids a brother his wife and their kid what about you hmm family oh i was an only child do they all live in new york all but natasha he toyed with the curls at the nape of her neck you dont talk about yourself are you kidding she laughed though she wanted to curl like a cat into the fingers brushing her skin i never stop talking you ask questions you talk about things other people your characters but you dont talk about bess she should have known a cop would notice what most people didnt we havent had that many conversations she pointed out when she turned her head her mouth was close to his she wanted to kiss him bess thought it wasnt merely to distract him after all she had nothing to hide but she didnt speak only moved her lips to his the fingers at the back of her neck tensed as he changed the angle of the kiss and the mood of it it was light and friendly only for an instant then it darkened deepened lengthened mixed with the taste the texture were hints of what was to come theres a storm brewing bess thought dizzily and oh shed never been able to resist a storm her heart was knocking by the time his lips moved to her temple you know how to change the subject mcnee what subject his hand slid to her throat cupped there he felt the pigeon beat of her rapid pulse the rhythm of it was as seductive as jungle drums you now im only more curious theres not that much to tell uneasy and confused by the sensation she drew back as the cab pulled to the curb looks like were here she slid across the seat while alex paid the driver her knees were a little weak she realized another first alexi stanislaski was going to require some thought you dont have to walk me up she said surprised that it unnerved her to see the cab pull away and leave the two of them alone on the shadowy sidewalk which means youre not going to ask me in no she smiled a little running her fingers up and down the strap of her bag but she wanted to it was amazing to her just how much she wanted to i think it would be smarter if i didnt he accepted that because the choice had to be hers and the prospect of changing her mind along the way was tremendously appealing well do this again yes he closed a hand over her restless one brought it to his lips soon she felt something a small vague ache centered in her heart confused by it she slipped her hand away all right soon good night hold it before she could turn away he took her face in his hands held it there for a moment before lowering his mouth to hers the pressure was whisperlight persuasive invasive even as she responded the kiss had that odd ache spreading helpless she brought her hands to his wrists clinging to them for balance though his mouth remained beautifully gentle the pulse she felt beneath her fingers raced in time with her own then he let her go stepped back his eyes stared into hers good night he said she managed a nod before hurrying inside there was something about bess alex thought as he waited patiently for the light in her apartment to come on something hed just have to find out what it was chapter contents prev next the last person bess expected to see when she left her office a few days later was rosalie even in the bustling crowds of midtown the woman stood out after a moment of blank surprise bess smiled and crossed the sidewalk hi were you waiting for me yeah you should have come in bess adjusted the weight of her bag and briefcase i figured it would be better for you if i waited out here dont be silly her words trailed off as she tried to see through and around rosalies huge tinted glasses those sunburst colors around the left eye werent all cosmetics besss friendly smile faded what happened to you rosalie shrugged bobby he was a little ticked off about the other night thats despicable ive had worse bastard she said it between her teeth but overlying her fury was a terrible sense of guilt im sorry im so sorry it was my fault aint nobodys fault girlfriend just the way things are its not the way they should be and if i hadnt she let that go knowing you could only go back and change things in scripts do you want to go to the police ill go with you we could hell no rosalie let out what passed for a laugh id get a lot worse than a sore eye if i tried that and if you think theres a cop alive who gives a damn about a hooker with a black eye you are as dumb as you look alex would care bess thought she refused to believe otherwise well do whatever you want rosalie pulled out a cigarette cocking her hip as she lit it listen you said youd pay me to talk i figure i can use the extra money and im on my own time all right ideas were beginning to stir how much do you average a night as a matter of course rosalie started to inflate it but found the lie stuck in her throat after bobby takes his cut about seventyfive maybe a hundred business isnt as good as it used to be well talk distracted bess searched for a cab well never get a taxi at this hour she mumbled i live uptown about twenty blocks do you mind walking this time rosalie laughed full and long girl walking the streets comes natural to me once they reached besss apartment rosalie tipped down her shaded glasses and whistled unable to resist she walked to one of the wide windows she could see a swatch of the east river through other buildings the sound of traffic was so muted it was almost musical a far cry from the clatter and roar she lived with every day my oh my you do live high how about dinner automatically bess stepped out of her shoes well order in red meat bess thought at the moment she could have eaten it raw sit down ill get us some wine wine rosalie thought as she stretched out on the plump cushions of the pit she figured that sounded just dandy you pay for all this just writing stuff mostly on impulse bess chose one of the best bottles in her wine rack youre not a vegetarian are you rosalie snorted get real good i want a steak after handing rosalie a glass she picked up the phone to order dinner i cant pay for that im buying bess assured her and curled up on the couch i need a consultant rosalie it was a risk but so was breathing she decided ill give you five hundred a week rosalie choked on the wine five hundred just to tell you about turning tricks no i want more i want why i want you to tell me about the other women what draws them in what youre afraid of what youre not when i ask you a question ill want an answer her voice was brisk now all business ill know if you lie rosalies eyes were shrewd and steady you need all that for a tv show youd be surprised it had gone well beyond the show the bruise on rosalies face grated on her she had caused it bess reflected she would find a way to fix it im buying a lot of your time for five hundred a week rosalie you might want to take a little vacation from bobby what i do after i talk to you is for me to say absolutely but if you decided you wanted to take a break from the streets and if you needed a place to stay while you did i could help you why bess smiled why not it wouldnt cost me any more intrigued rosalie considered ill think about it fine we can get started right away she rose to gather up pads pencils her tape recorder remember this is daytime tv and we can only do so much ill have to filter down a great deal of what you tell me why dont i fill you in on the story line rosalie merely shrugged its your nickel yes it is she settled down again and was weaving the complex and overlapping relationships of millbrook to rosalies confusion and fascination when she heard the buzzer for her private elevator still talking she walked over to release the security lock so anyway the josie personality is dynamically opposed to jade the stronger she gets the more confused and frightened jade becomes she doesnt remember where shes been when josie comes out and the lapses are getting longer sounds like the lady needs a shrink actually shell go to elana shes a psychiatrist but thats down the road a bit and under hypnosis ah heres the food at the elevators ding bess opened the door the smile froze on her face alexi dont you bother to ask who it is before you let someone come up he shook his head before he caught her chin in his hand and kissed her yes that is not when im expecting someone what are you doing here kissing you and at that moment she wasnt as responsive as hed come to expect then it occurred to him that shed said she was expecting someone a man a date a lover his eyes cooled as he stepped back i guess i should have called first no i mean yes that is are you off tonight i go back on in a couple hours oh well the buzzer sounded again you could always tell him im the plumber baffled she stepped back inside to release the elevator tell who what the guy on his way up why should i tell the delivery boy youre a plumber delivery boy a sound inside the apartment had him edging closer he wasnt jealous damn it he was just curious i guess youve already got company he began and pushed the door wider actually i do giving up bess gestured him inside we were just about to have some dinner he looked over at the couch just as rosalie stood caught between them bess felt herself battered by double waves of hostility what the hell is she doing here you called the cops rosalie said accusingly before bess could answer you called the damn cops no no i didnt rosalie was already striding across the room bess knew that if the woman made it to the door she would have lost her chance rosalie she grabbed her arm i didnt call him and why the hell didnt you alex tossed back because its none of your business still gripping rosalie bess swirled on him this is my home and shes my guest and youre a bigger idiot than i thought sizing up the situation rosalie relaxed fractionally you two got a thing yes alex shot back no bess snapped then sighed something in between the two she mumbled she snatched her wallet out of her bag as she heard the elevator ding excuse me thats dinner while she herded the delivery boy inside to set up the meal alex and rosalie stood eyeing each other with mutual dislike and suspicion whats the game rosalie no game she flashed a smile that was as feral as a sharks im a paid consultant your lady hired me the hell with that he paused a moment studying her bruised eye bobby do that rosalie angled her chin i walked into a door sure you did he did care bess might have been surprised at how much he cared rosalie certainly would have been stunned but he also knew there were things that couldnt be fixed youll want to watch your step i dont make the same mistake twice he turned away from her his hands balled into fists in his pockets mcnee i want to talk to you oh just shut up she didnt bother to look up as she counted out bills cant you see im trying to figure the tip there you go thanks lady the delivery boy tucked the bills away enjoy your dinner theres enough for three bess stated turning toward alex but youre not going to stay if youre rude rude the single word bounced off her ceiling he was beside her in two strides you think its rude for me to ask you if youve lost your mind when i walk in and find youve invited a hooker to dinner her eyes narrowed out damn it bess i said out she gave him a hefty shove toward the door we went on one date she reminded him one maybe i entertained the idea of something more but that gives you no right to come into my house and tell me what to do and who to talk with he grabbed her hand before she could push him again one has nothing to do with the other youre right absolutely right what i should have said is that i run my life detective she snatched her hand away so that she could poke a finger at his chest me alone get the picture yeah he wondered how shed like a nice clip on that pointy little chin of hers ive got a picture for you he hauled her up and kissed her hard no gentle touch no finesse all steam heat it lasted only seconds but he succeeded in shocking her speechless things change mcnee dark furious eyes pinned her to the spot get used to it with that he stormed out slamming the door behind him well bess took one breath then another her throat felt scalded of all the incredible nerve who the hell does he think he is marching in here that way hands on her hips she spun to face rosalie did you see that hard to miss it grinning rosalie snatched a french fry from a plate if he thinks hes getting away with that that attitude hes very much mistaken mans nuts about you excuse me girl that was one lovesick puppy bess snatched up her wine and gulped dont be ridiculous he was just showing off uhhuh if i had me a man who looked at me like that id do one of two things which are id either sit back and enjoy or id run for my life frowning bess sat down and picked up her fork i dont like to be pushed seems to me it depends on whos doing the pushing she sat as well and dug right into her steak he sure is one finelooking man for a cop bess stabbed at her salad i dont want to talk about him youre paying the tab rosalie said agreeably with a grunt of assent bess tried to eat damn cop she thought hed ruined her appetite there was something to be said for beating the hell out of inanimate objects alex had always found the therapy of a pair of boxing gloves and a punching bag immeasurably rewarding with those so easily accessible he could never figure out why so many people felt the need for a psychiatrists couch until recently twenty minutes of sweating and pounding hadnt relieved his basic frustration he often used the gym in the middle of a difficult case when one went wrong when a good arrest turned sour in court the same ingredients had worked equally well for him whenever hed fought with family or friends or had female problems not this time whatever hold bess mcnee had on him alex couldnt seem to punch himself out of it so much energy so early the familiar voice had alex blinking away the sweat that had dripped through his headband into his eyes his brother mikhail and alexs tenmonthold nephew griff were standing hand in hand grinning identical grins got your papa out early did you tough guy alex swung griff up for a smacking kiss griff babbled out happily the only word alex could decipher in the odd foreign language of a toddler was mama sydneys tired mikhail explained she has some wheeling and dealing keeping her up at night this ones an early riser he ruffled his sons hair so i thought wed come down and lift weights right griff grinned and cocked his elbows papa your muscles bigger alex assured him hey its the griffman rocky the former lightweight who ran the gym gave a whistle and held out his wiry arms come see me champ with a squeal of pleasure griff wiggled out of alexs arms to toddle off on his almost steady legs better watch out rock mikhail called out hes slippery i can handle him with the confidence of a fourtime grandfather he hefted griff we got things to do he told mikhail why dont you talk to your brother there and find out why this is the third time this week hes come in to pound on my equipment nosy alex muttered hes worse than an old woman mikhail tilted a brow when alex went back to pounding the bag speaking of women we werent why do men come to such places as this unless its to talk of women the music of the ukraine flavored mikhails voice alex wondered if his brother knew how much he sounded like their father to hit things he retorted to talk dirty and to sweat that too so it is a woman yes its always a damn woman alex said between gritted teeth this ones named bess alexs punch stopped in midswing turning he used his forearm to swipe his brow how do you know about bess rachel tells me pleased mikhail grinned she also tells me that this bess is not beautiful so much as unique and that shes smart this isnt your usual type alexi shes nobodys type alex turned back to the bag feinted with his right then jabbed with his left unique he said with a snort thats her all right her face it was like god was distracted that day and mixed up the features for five different women her eyes are too big her chins pointed her nose is crooked his gloved fist plowed into the bag and she has skin like an angel i touch it and my mouth waters mmm ill have to get a look at this one ive sworn off alex told him between grunts i dont need the aggravation she doesnt have all her circuits working at the same time maybe rachel thinks shes smart because she went to college radcliffe mikhail supplied she had lunch with rachel and rachel asked radcliffe letting out a breath alex leaned against the bag it figures she also told rachel that the two of you had a misunderstanding i understood perfectly look maybe she went to some fancy college but you couldnt fill up a teaspoon with her common sense i dont need to get involved with someone that flaky mikhails bark of laughter echoed through the gym this from a man who once dated miss lug wrench it was miss carburetor ah thats different a smile twitched and alex punched halfheartedly at the bag working up a sweat hadnt relaxed him but five minutes with mikhail was doing the job anyway were finished before we got started and both better off undoubtedly youre right i know im right wed always be coming at things from different angles hers is crosseyed she doesnt see anything the way she should a difficult woman difficult alex held out his hands so that mikhail could unlace his gloves that doesnt begin to describe her she acts so mild and relaxed you wouldnt think you could rile her with a cattle prod then you point out an obvious mistake for her own good and she jumps on you with both feet kicks you out of the house mikhail tucked his tongue in his cheek youre better off without her youre telling me alex tossed his gloves aside and flexed his hands who needs unreasonable women men yeah with a sigh alex sent his brother a miserable look i want her so much i cant breathe i know the feeling he punched his brothers sweaty shoulder so go get her go get her alex repeated put her in her place a dangerous light one mikhail recognized flickered in alexs eyes her place right hey mikhail called out when his brother strode off the showers are that way ill catch one at the station see you later later mikhail agreed he wandered off to find his son wondering how soon he would meet this unique unreasonable woman without common sense she sounded perfect for his baby brother bess was never at her best in the morning and she suspected anyone who was her alarm was buzzing when she heard the pounding on her door shed been ignoring the first for nearly ten minutes but the incessant knocking had her dragging herself out of bed blearyeyed pulling a skimpy silk robe over an equally skimpy nightshirt she stumbled to the door what the hell she demanded is it a fire or what or what alex told her when she yanked open the door struggling to focus she dragged a hand through her hair the robe drooped off one shoulder howd you get up here flashed my badge for the security guard after closing the door behind him he looked his fill there was a great deal to be said for a sleepy woman in rumpled white silk get you up mcnee what time is it she turned away following the scent from her coffeemaker which was set to brew at each morning what day is it thursday he followed her weaving progress through the living area and into a big whiteandnavy kitchen there was a huge arrangement of fresh orchids on the center island orchids in the kitchen he thought only bess about in the morning blindly she groped for a mug what are you doing here at on a thursday morning this he spun her around the taste of her mouth warm and soft from sleep had him groaning before she could think he didnt want either of them to think he slipped his tongue between her lips to seduce hers her body went stiff then melted softening against his like candle wax touched by a flame through the roaring of his blood he heard the crash as the china mug shed held slipped from her fingers and smashed on the tiles was she still dreaming bess wondered her dreams had always been very vivid but this it wouldnt be possible to feel so much need so desperately in a dream and she could taste him really taste him a mingling of man and desire and salty sweat delicious his mouth was so hot so unyielding just as his hands were through the thin silk she wore she could feel the cool tiles beneath her feet a shivery contrast to the heat roaring around her under her palms his cheeks were rough arousingly rough and she heard her own voice a muffled confused sound as she tried to say his name i have to wake up she managed when his mouth left hers to cruise over her throat i really have to you are awake he had to touch her just once however unfair his advantage he had to so he cupped her breasts in his hands molding their firmness through the silk brushing his thumbs featherlight over straining nipples see shed never been the swooning type but she was afraid this would be a first i have to she gasped for as shed started to step back hed swept her up into his arms a skitter of panic completely unfamiliar raced down her spine alexi dont he covered her mouth again felt her trembling surrender and knew he could and could not your feet are bare he said and set her on the counter i made you drop your cup shaken she stared down at the shards of broken crockery oh you have a broom a broom shewas awake now wideawake but her mind was still mush somewhere why he was making her stupid he realized and grinned so i can clean it up before you cut yourself stay there he walked to a likelylooking closet and located a dustpan and broom because he was a man whose mother had trained him well in such matters he went about the sweeping job quickly and competently so have you missed me i havent given you a thought she blew the hair out of her eyes hardly me either he dumped the shards into the trash replaced the broom and dustpan how about some coffee sure maybe that would help her regain her normal composure as he poured she caught a whiff of him over the homey morning aroma you smell like a locker room sorry i was at the gym when he handed her the coffee she sat where she was and sipped half a cup later she was able to take her first cleareyed look at him he looked fabulous rough and sweaty and ready for action the thick tangle of hair was falling over a faded gray sweatband his face was unshaven his nypd tshirt was ripped and darkened in a vee down the chest his sweatpants were loose and frayed at the cuffs when she lifted her gaze back to his he smiled good morning mcnee good morning he skimmed a finger over her thigh she was sensitive there he noted he could tell by the way her eyes darkened and the pulse in her throat picked up the beat im not apologizing this time you should be no im right about this he put a finger over her lips before she could speak trust me im a cop he could have all but seduced her in her own kitchen before her eyes were even open but she had a point to make closing a hand over his wrist she drew his hand away my personal decisions whether they have to do with my professional or my private life are just that personal ive been making those decisions right or wrong for a long time i dont intend to stop now im not going to see you hurt thats very sweet alexi softening a bit she brushed a hand through his hair i dont intend to be hurt you dont know what youre dealing with oh you think you do he continued recognizing the look in her eyes but all you know is the surface there are things that go on in the streets every day every night that you have no conception of you never will she couldnt argue not with what she saw in his face maybe not i dont see what you see or know what you know maybe i dont want to my friendship with rosalie friendship yes the expression on her face dared him to contradict her i feel something for her about her with a helpless gesture bess set her cup aside i cant possibly explain it to you alexi youre not a woman i can help her dont tell me its a fairy tale to believe i can save her from the streets and what shes chosen to be ive gotten that advice already from someone with at least half a brain he surmised i had no idea this had gotten so out of hand you said you wanted to talk to her for background stuff for your story thats true enough but bess remembered the bruise on rosalies face too well is it so impossible that i might be able to make a difference in her life has being a cop made you so hard you arent willing to give someone a chance to change he gripped her hands hard this isnt about me no she said and smiled its not he swore and let go of her to pace to the coffee maker okay point taken its none of my business but im going to ask for a promise you can ask dont go out on the streets with her dont go anywhere near bobbys territory she thought of the man with the silver hair and the vicious eyes that i can promise feel better im not through dont let her up here unless youre sure shes alone meet her down at your office or in some public place really alexi please she said nothing for a moment and then because she could see how much it had cost him to use that word she relented all right bess scooted away from the counter then opened the bread drawer want a bagel sure she popped two into the toaster oven before going to the refrigerator for cream cheese theres something i should tell you im hoping theres a lot of things with a puzzled smile she turned back im sorry i want to know about this personal life of yours mcnee i want to know all about you then i want to take you to bed and make love with you until we both forget our own names ah it didnt seem to take more than one of those long level looks of his to make her forget a great deal more than her name anyway anyway he repeated helpfully as the toaster oven dinged i was going to tell you about angie horowitz the lazy smile vanished his eyes went cool and flat what do you know about her boy it really does click off bess murmured i feel like i just stepped into one of those rooms with the twoway mirror and the rubber hoses angie horowitz he repeated what do you know about her i dont know much of anything but i thought i should tell you what rosalie told me she got out plates then began to spread the bagels generously she said that angie was really happy to have hooked up with this one guy hed hired her a couple of times and slipped her some extra money treated her well promised her some presents in fact he gave her this little pendant a gold heart with a crack down the center alexs face remained impassive there had been a broken neck chain wrapped in angies hand when they found her just as there had been with the first victim that little detail had been kept out of the press there hadnt been a heart he thought now but someone had broken the chain for a reason she wore it all the time according to rosalie bess went on rosalie also told me mary rodell had one just like it she was the other victim wasnt she she asked alex she had it on the last time rosalie saw her alive is that it bess was disappointed that he wasnt more pleased with the information theres a little more sulking a bit she bit into her bagel angie called the guy jack and she bragged to rosalie that he was a real gentleman and was built like she trailed off cleared her throat but her eyes were bright with humor rather than embarrassment women have colorful terms for certain things just like men i get the picture he had a scar what kind i dont know a scar on his hip angie told rosalie he got upset when she asked him about it thats all she told me alexi but i figured the coincidence of the pendants you might want to know about this guy it never hurts he gave her an easy smile though his instincts were humming probably nothing but ill look into it he tugged on her hair do yourself a favor and dont tell rosalie you passed this along to me im softhearted detective not softheaded she thinks you have a really nice butt but youre still a cop he grimaced i dont think i like you discussing my anatomy with a friend she supplied with a warning lift of her brow i also had lunch with your sister we discussed your nasty temperament i heard he stole her bagel radcliffe huh so so nothing want to go dancing with me she debated with herself for almost a full second okay tonight cant tomorrow it meant canceling dinner at le cirque with l d strater that debate took nearly half a second thats fine sexy or sedate sexy definitely good why dont you come by around she glanced at the clock stared then yelped damn it now im going to be late ill owe lori twenty dollars if im late one more time this month she began pushing alex out of the kitchen its all your fault now beat it so i can throw on some clothes and get out of here since youre already late he had some very good moves even as she shoved him toward the door he was turning to catch her close i can arrange it so youre a lot later smooth talker she said with a laugh take a hike youve already lost twenty im just offering to make it worth your while i dont know how i can resist that incredibly romantic gesture but somehow i find i have the strength you want romance there was a gleam in his eyes as he headed for the door tomorrow night well just see how strong you are chapter contents prev next after spending most of the morning kicking his heels in court waiting to testify in an assault case alex returned to the station to find his partner hipdeep in paperwork the boss wants to see you judd said through a mouthful of chocolate bar right alex shrugged out of his jacket and dragged off his courtappearance tie with his free hand he picked up his pile of messages i think he meant now judd said helpfully i got it as he passed judds desk alex peeked over his shoulder at the report in the typewriter two ps in apprehend einstein judd backspaced and scowled you sure trust me he swung through the squad room and knocked on captain trilwaiters glass door come trilwalter glanced up if alex often thought he was swamped in paperwork it was nothing compared to what surrounded his captain trilwalters desk was heaped with it the overflowing files stacks of reports and correspondence gave trilwalter a bookish accountantlike look this was enhanced by the half glasses perched on his long narrow nose the slightly balding head and the ruthlessly knotted knit tie but alex knew better trilwalter was a cop down to the bone and he might still be on the street but for the bullet that had damaged his left lung you wanted to see me captain stanislaski trilwalter crooked his finger then pointed it gesturing to alex to come in and shut the door he leaned back in his chair folded his hands over his flat belly and scowled what the hell is all this about soap operas sir soap operas trilwalter repeated i just had a call from the mayor testing his ground alex nodded slowly the mayor called you about soap operas you look confused detective a rare and not entirely humorfilled smile curved trilwaiters mouth that makes two of us the name mcnee mean anything to you bess mcnee alex closed his eyes a moment oh boy rings a bell does it yes sir alex gave himself a brief moment to contemplate murder miss mcnee and i have a personal relationship sort of im not interested in your personal relationship sort of or otherwise unless they come across my desk when i arrested her arrested her trilwalter held up one hand while he took off his glasses slowly methodically he massaged the bridge of his nose i dont think i have to know about that no im sure i dont despite himself alex began to see the humor in it if i could say so captain bess tends to bring that kind of reaction out in a man shes a writer yes sir for secret sins trilwalter lifted tired eyes secret sins apparently the mayor is quite a fan not only a fan detective but an old chum of your bess mcnees old chum was just how he put it finding discretion in silence alex said nothing as trilwalter rose the captain walked to the watercooler wedged between two file cabinets in the corner of his office he poured out a paper cupful and drank it down his honor the mayor requests that miss mcnee be permitted to observe a day in your life detective alex made a comment normally reserved for locker rooms and pool halls trilwalter nodded sagely my sentiments exactly however one of the less appealing aspects of working this particular desk is playing politics you lose detective captain were closing in on that robbery on lexington ive got a new lead on the hooker murders and a message on my desk from a snitch who could know something about that stiff we found down on east twentythird how am i supposed to work with some ditzy woman hanging over my shoulder this is the ditzy woman you have a personal relationship with alex opened his mouth then closed it again how to explain bess sort of he said at length look captain i already agreed to talk to mcnee about police work in general now and again i never agreed to specifics i sure as hell dont want her riding shotgun while i work a day in your life stanislaski with that same grim smile trilwalter crushed his cup and tossed it monday next to be exact captain deal with it trilwaiter said and see that she stays out of trouble dismissed alex stalked back to his desk he was still muttering to himself when judd wandered over with two cups of coffee problem women alex said tell me about it because hed been waiting all moming for the chance judd sat on the edge of alexs desk speaking of women did you know that bess was engaged to l d strater alexs head snapped up what used to be judd explained one of the teachers at hollys schools a real gossipgatherer reads all the tabloids and stuff she was telling holly how strater and bess were a thing a few months ago is that so alex remembered how theyd danced together at her party kissed his mouth flattened into a grim line as he lifted the cup a real whirlwind sort of thing according to my sources before that she was engaged to charles stutman who the hell is that you know the writer hes got that hot play on broadway now dust to dust holly really wants to see it i thought maybe bess could wangle some tickets the sound alex made was neither agreement nor denial it was more of a growl then there was george collaway you know the son of that big publisher that was about three years ago but he married someone else the lady gets around alex said softly yeah and in top circles and hey holly was really blown away when she found out that bess was roger k mcnees daughter you know the camera guy camera guy alex repeated feeling a hole spreading in the pit of his stomach as in mcneeholden yeah first camera i ever bought was a holden use their film all the time too hell so does the department well he straightened if you get a chance maybe you could ask bess about those tickets it sure would mean a lot to holly mcneeholden alex ran the names over in his head while the noise of the squad room buzzed around him for gods sake he had one of their cameras himself hed bought their little red packs of film hundreds of times over the years the department used their developing paper he was pretty sure nasa did too wasnt bess just full of secrets so she was rich filthy rich he picked up his messages again telling himself it wasnt such a big deal wouldnt have been he corrected silently if shed told him about it herself engaged he thought with a frown three times engaged shrugging he picked up the phone none of his business he reminded himself as he punched in numbers if shed been married three times it would be none of his business he was taking her dancing not on a honeymoon but it was a long time before he was able to shuffle her into a back corner of his mind and get on with his job sexy the man had said bess remembered turning in front of her cheval glass it looked as though she were going to oblige him snug teal silk hugged every curve and ended abruptly at midthigh over the strapless unadorned bodice she wore a short body jacket of fuchsia long wandshaped crystals dangled at her ears after stepping into her heels she gave her hair a last fluff she felt like dancing when her buzzer sounded she grinned at her reflection leave it to a cop to be right on time grabbing her purse a small one that bulged with what she considered the essentials she hurried to the intercom ill come down hold on she found him on the sidewalk looking perfect in gray slacks and a navy shirt his hands were tucked in the pockets of his bomber jacket hi she kissed him lightly then tucked an arm through his where are we going it gave him a jolt the way their eyes and mouths lined up as they would if they were in bed downtown he said shortly and steered her left toward the corner to catch a cab he couldnt have pleased her more with his choice of the noisy crowded club the moment she stepped inside besss blood started to hum the music was loud the dancing in full swing they squeezed up to the bar to wait for a table vodka rocks alex ordered raising his voice over the din two bess decided and smiled at him i think i was here before a few months ago i wouldnt be surprised not his business alex reminded himself her background the men in her life none of it the hell it wasnt it doesnt look like the kind of place strater would bring you ld her eyes laughed no not his style she angled herself around i love to watch people dance dont you its one of the few legal forms of exhibitionism in this country when he handed her her drink she murmured a thankyou take that guy there she gestured with the glass at a man who was strutting on the floor thumbs in his belt loops hips wiggling thats definitely one of the standard urban white male mating dances did you do a lot of dancing with stutman alex heard himself ask charlie she sampled the vodka pursed her lips not really he was more into sitting in some smoky club listening to esoteric music that he could obsess to still scanning the crowd she caught the eye of a man in black leather he cocked a brow and started toward her one hard look from alex and he veered away bess chuckled into her glass that put him in his place rattling her ice she grinned up at him were you born with that talent or did you have to develop it alex plucked the glass out of her hand and set it aside lets dance always willing to dance bess let him pull her onto the floor but instead of bopping to the beat he wrapped his arms around her while legs flashed and arms waved around them and the music rocked they glided nice smiling into his eyes she linked her arms around his neck i see why you like to make your own moves detective i believe i promised you romance he skimmed his lips over her jaw to her ear yes her breath came out slow and warm as she closed her eyes you did im not sure what a woman like you considers romantic her skin shivered under his lips this is a good start its tough he drew away so that their lips were an inch apart its tough for a cop to compete with tycoons and playwrights her eyes were halfclosed and dreamy through her lashes what are you talking about a couple of your former fiances the lashes lifted fractionally what about them i wondered when you were going to mention them or the fact that your father runs one of the biggest conglomerates known to man or the little detail about your chum the mayor calling my captain they continued to dance as he spoke but bess could see the anger building in his eyes do you want to take them as separate issues or all in one piece she was a cool one he thought he was feeling anything but cool why dont we start with the mayor you had no right i didnt ask him to call alexi she spoke carefully feeling the taut strength of his fingers at her waist we were having dinner and you often have dinner with the mayor hes an old family friend she said patiently i was telling him how helpful youd been and one thing led to another i didnt know hed called your captain until after it was done i admit i liked the idea and if its caused you any trouble im sorry great my works as important to me as yours is to you she shot back struggling with her own temper if youd prefer i can arrange to spend monday observing another cop youll spend monday where i can keep my eye on you fine excuse me she broke away and worked her way through the crowd to the rest room the music pulsed against the walls as she paced the small room ignoring the charter from the two women freshening their lipstick at the mirror losing her temper would be unproductive she reminded herself better much better to handle this situation calmly coolly when she was almost sure she could she walked back out he was waiting for her taking her arm he led her to a table in the rear where they could talk without shouting i think we should go theres no use staying when youre so angry with me she began but he merely scraped back her chair sit she sat when were you going to tell me about your family i dont see it as an issue and that was true enough why should it be this is only the second time weve gone out the look he sent her had her jiggling a foot under the table you know damn well theres more going on between us than a couple of dates all right yes i do she picked up her drink then set it down again untouched but thats not the point youre acting as though i deliberately hid something from you or lied thats just not true he picked up the fresh drink hed ordered so tell me now what didnt you run a make on me his narrowed eyes gave her some small sense of satisfaction okay detective ill fill you in since youre so interested my family owns mcneeholden which since its inception in has expanded from still cameras and film to movies television satellites and all manner of things shall i have them send you a prospectus dont get smart im just warming up she hooked an arm over the back of her chair my father heads the company and my mother entertains and does good works im an only child who was born rather late in life to them my fathers name is roger and he enjoys a racketing good game of polo my mothers name is susan never sue or susie and she prefers a challenging rubber of bridge what else would you like to know despite his temper he wanted to take her hand and soothe her damn it bess it isnt an interrogation isnt it let me make it easy for you alexi i was born in new york spent the early part of my childhood on our estate on long island in the care of a very british nanny i was extremely fond of before going off to boarding school which i detested this however left my mother free to pursue her many charitable causes and my father free to pursue his business we are not close from time to time we did travel together but i was not a pretty child nor a tractable one and my parents usually left my care up to the servants bess im not finished her eyes were hard and bright this isnt a poorlittlerichgirl story alexi i wasnt neglected or unhappy since i had no more in common with my parents than they had with me i was content to go my own way they dont interfere and we get along very well because i prefer making my own way i dont trumpet the fact that im roger k mcnees little girl i dont hide it either otherwise i would have changed my name its simply a fact satisfied he took her hand before she could rise his voice was calm again and too gentle to resist i wanted to know who you are i have feelings for you so it matters slowly her hand relaxed under his the hard gleam faded from her eyes i understand that someone with your background would feel that their family who and what they came from are part of what they are i dont feel that way about myself where you come from means something bess where you are means more what does your father do hes a carpenter why arent you a carpenter because it wasnt what i wanted he drummed his fingers on the table as he studied her your point he acknowledged look im sorry i pushed it was just weird hearing all this from judd from judd he got it from holly who got it from some other teacher who reads the tabloids even as he said it it struck him as ridiculous he grinned see relaxed again she leaned forward life really is a soap opera yours is three exfiances that depends on how you count she took alexs hand because she liked the feel of it in hers i wasnt engaged to ld he did give me a ring and i didnt have the heart to tell him it was ostentatious but marriage wasnt discussed one of the ten richest men in the country gave you an ostentatious ring but marriage wasnt discussed thats right hes a very nice man a little pompous sometimes but who wouldnt be with so many people ready to grovel can we get some chips or something sure he signaled to a waitress so you didnt want to marry him i never thought about it since he asked she did so now no i dont think i would have liked it very much he wouldnt have either ld finds me amusing and a little unconventional being a tycoon isnt all fun and games you know if you say so she chuckled but hed prefer a different type for his next wife she dived in immediately when the waitress set baskets of chips and pretzels on the table i enjoyed being in love with him for a few weeks but it wasnt the romance of the century what about the other one the writer charlie there was a trace of wistfulness now i was really stuck on charlie he has this kind of glow about him hes so interested in people in emotions in motivations she gestured with half a pretzel the thing about charlie is hes good deepdown good entirely too good for me she finished off the pretzel see i do things like join greenpeace charlie flies to alaska to help clean up oil spills hes committed thats why gabrielle is perfect for him gabrielle his wife they met at a whale rally theyve been married almost two years now alex was determined to get it right you were engaged to a married man no insulted she poked out her lip of course not he got married after we were engaged that is after we werent engaged anymore charlie would never cheat on gabrielle hes too decent sorry my mistake he considered changing the subject but this one was just too fascinating how about george was he between charlie and strater no george was before charlie and after troy practically in another life troy there was another one oh you didnt know about him she propped her chin on her hand i guess your source didnt dig back far enough troy was while i was in college and we werent engaged for very long only a couple of weeks hardly counts alex picked up his drink again hardly anyway george was a mistake though id never admit it to lori she gloats george was a mistake the others werent she shook her head learning experiences but george well i was a little rash with him i felt sorry for him because he was always sure he was coming down with some terminal illness and hed been in therapy since kindergarten we should never have gotten involved romantically i was really relieved when he decided to marry nancy instead is this like a hobby alex asked after a moment no people plan hobbies i never plan to fall in love it just happens her smile was amused and tolerant it feels good and when its over no ones hurt it isnt a sexual thing like with vicki she goes from man to man because of the sense of sexual power it gives her i know most people think if you have a relationship with a man particularly if youre engaged to him you must be sleeping with him but its not always true and if youre not engaged to him because the question demanded it she met his eyes levelly every situation has its own rules i dont know what they are for this one yet things may get serious there was a slight pressure around her heart thats always a possibility theyre serious enough right now for me to ask if youre seeing anyone else she knew it was happening bess had never been able to prevent that slow painless slide into love are you asking me if i am or are you asking me not to it wasnt painless for him it was terrifying with what strength of will he had left alex held himself on that thin shaky edge im asking you not to and im telling you that i dont want anyone else i cant even think of anyone else her eyes were warm as she leaned over to touch her lips to his there is no one else he laid a hand on her cheek to keep her mouth on his for another moment even as he kissed her he wondered how many other men had heard her say those same words he told himself he was a jealous idiot with an effort he managed to smother the feeling rising he took her hands and pulled her to her feet were supposed to be dancing so i was told alexi snuggling into love as she would have into a cozy robe she cupped his face in her hands what im just looking i want to make sure youre not mad at me anymore im not mad at you to prove it he kissed the tip of her crooked nose no not angry she thought searching his eyes but there was something else shadowed there she couldnt quite identify it my middle names louisa with a half smile on his lips he tilted his head okay im trying to think if theres something else you might want to know that i havent told you needing to be close she rested her cheek against his i really dont have any secrets he turned his face into her hair god what was she doing to him to tie him up in knots like this he pulled her against him wrapping his arms tight around her i know all i need to know he said quietly were going to have to figure out those rules bess were going to have to figure them out fast okay she wasnt sure what was holding her back it would have been so easy to hurry out of the club with him to go home and be with him her body was straining for him and yet the first tremor of panic shocked her enough to have her pull back and smile too brightly she wasnt afraid she assured herself and she didnt need to overanalyze when the time was right to move forward shed know it that was all come on detective still smiling she pulled him away from the table lets see if you can keep up with me on the dance floor chapter contents prev next alex read over a particularly grisly autopsy report on half of a suspected murdersuicide and tried to ignore the fact that bess was sitting in a chair to his right scribbling in her notebook she was as good as her word he was forced to admit though she did tend to mumble to herself now and again she was quiet unobtrusive and once shed realized he wouldnt answer her questions much less acknowledge her presence shed directed them to judd he couldnt say she was a problem but of course she was a problem she was there and because she was there he thought about her shed even dressed quietly in bonecolored slacks and a navy blazer as if he thought the conservative clothes would help her fade into the background and make him forget she was bothering him fat chance when he was aware of her in every cell he could smell her couldnt he he thought seething with resentment that fresh and seductive scent had been floating at the edges of his senses all morning sneaking into his brain the way a good secondstory man sneaks through a window and he could sense her too he didnt need a cops instincts to know she was behind him to picture those big green eyes drawing a bead on his every move to imagine those neverstill hands making notes or that soft agile mouth curving when a fresh idea came to her she could have dressed in cardboard and made him needy he was so damn cute bess was thinking smiling at the back of his head she enjoyed watching him work the way he scooped his hand through all that gorgeous black hair when he was trying to think or shifted the phone from one ear to the other so that he could take notes the sound of his voice clipped and nononsense or sly and persuasive depending on what he wanted from the listener and she particularly enjoyed the way he moved his shoulders restlessly annoyance in every muscle when he became too aware of her presence she had a terrific urge to press a kiss to the back of his neck and to see what he was reading after a couple of scowls from him she scooted her chair back and stopped peeking over his shoulder she was cooperating fully alex was forced to admit which only made it worse he wanted her to go away how could he explain that it was impossible for him to concentrate on his job when the woman he was falling in love with was watching him read an autopsy report here you go bess gave him a cup of coffee and a friendly smile you look like you could use it thanks cream no sugar he noted as he sipped shed remembered was that part of her appeal he wondered the fact that she absorbed those little details about people you must be getting bored taking a chance she sat on the edge of his desk why nothing much going on he gestured to indicate the pile of paperwork maybe just maybe he could convince her she was wasting her time if you have your tv cop doing this it isnt going to up your ratings well want to show different aspects of his work she broke a candy bar in half and offered alex a share like the fact that hed have to concentrate and handle this sort of paperwork and detail in the middle of all this chaos he took a bite what chaos she smiled again jotting down notes he didnt even see it any longer she realized or hear it all the noise the movement the rush dozens of little dramas had taken place that morning fascinating her unnoted by him they brought a drug dealer in over there she gestured with a nod as she continued to write skinny guy in a white fedora and striped jacket wearing a heavy dose of designer cologne pasquale alex said noting the description so you saw him i smelled him he shrugged wasnt my collar chuckling to herself bess crossed her legs and got comfortable a korean shopkeeper came rushing in shouting about vandalism at his store he was so excited he lost most of his english they sent out for an interpreter yeah it happens what was her point he wondered she only smiled and finished her chocolate right after that they brought in a woman whod been knocked around by her boyfriend she was sitting over there defending him even while her face was swelling the detective at the far end had a fight with his wife over the phone he forgot their anniversary must have been rogers hes always fighting with his wife impatience rippled back whats that got to do with anything atmosphere she told him youve stopped noticing it and become a part of it its interesting to see and youre very organized she added licking chocolate from her thumb not like judd over there with all his neat little piles but in the way you spread things out and know just where to find the right piece of paper at the right time i hate having you stare at me when i work he slapped her hand away from the autopsy report i know unoffended she grinned she leaned a little closer there was something in her eyes besides humor he noted he wasnt sure if hed ever seen desire and amusement merged in the same expression before and he certainly hadnt realized how the combination could make a mans blood hum you look very sexy plowing your way through all this gun strapped to your side your hair all messed up from raking your fingers through it that keen dangerous look in your eyes mortified he shifted in his chair cut it out mcnee i like the way your eyes get all dark and intense when youre taking down some important tidbit of information over the phone for all you know that was my dry cleaner uhuh she took his coffee to wash down the last bite of candy bar tell me something alexi are you annoyed that im here or are you nervous that im here both he rose there must be something he had to do someplace else thats what i thought she hooked a finger around the strap of his holster she wasnt afraid of the gun he wore in fact she was counting on talking him into letting her hold it one day so that she could see how it felt how he felt when he was forced to draw it you know you havent even kissed me im not going to kiss you here she lifted her eyes slowly there was a definite dare in them why not because the next time i kiss you watching her he slid a hand around her throat his thumb caressing her collarbone until her cocky smile faded away really kiss you its just going to be you and me alone and im going to keep right on kissing you and all sorts of other things until there arent any more rules any more reasons was that what she wanted she thought it was right now when her skin was humming where his fingers lay she thought it was exactly what she wanted but there was something else some complex mixture of yearning and fear so unfamiliar it caused her to step back whats wrong mcnee delighted by her reaction he let his hand slide down her shoulder and away whos making who nervous now were supposed to be working she reminded him not making each other nervous today when i go off the clock so do you stanislaski alexs eyes stayed on hers another moment before flicking behind her captain sorry to interrupt your social hour he said sourly i need that report right here even as alex was turning to reach for it bess was offering her hand to trilwalter captain its so nice to meet you im bess mcnee i wanted to let you know how much i appreciate the departments cooperation today trilwalter scowled at her a moment then remembering stifled a sigh right youre the writer a sneer twisted his mouth soap operas yes i am her smile made the fluorescents overhead dim i wonder if i can have just a moment of your time i know youre very busy so i wont keep you he didnt want any part of her he knew it she knew it and so did any of the cops hovering close enough to hear but riding a desk had taught him that diplomacy was often his only weapon besides once he made his feelings known shed be out of his hair and off finding another precinct to haunt why dont you come into my office ms mcnee thank you she shot a grin over her shoulder at alex as she followed trilwalter you going to let her go in there alone judd murmured yeah alex bit back a chuckle as he heard the glass of trilwalters door rattle oh yeah and im going to enjoy it ten minutes later alex was surprised by a burst of laughter swiveling in his chair he spotted trilwalter leading bess out of his office the two of them were chuckling together like two old friends over a private joke im going to remember that one bess just dont tell the mayor where you heard it i know how to respect a source still smiling he glanced over at a slackjawed alex detective you take care of ms mcnee make sure she gets what she needs sir he cut his eyes over to bess she merely batted her lashes managing to look about as innocent as a smoking gun i have every intention of making certain ms mcnee gets exactly what she needs bess laid her hand in trilwalters thank you again donald my pleasure dont be a stranger donald alex said the moment the captain was out of earshot yes bess made a production out of brushing dust from her sleeve that is his name we use several other names for him around here what the hell did you do in there why we chatted what else glancing over her shoulder alex noticed money changing hands the odds had been even that trilwalter would chew her up then spit her out within ten minutes since hed lost twenty on the deal himself alex wasnt particularly pleased sit down and be quiet he told her ive got work of course before she could take her seat his phone rang stanislaski yeah he listened a moment then pulled out his notepad to scribble i hear you you know how it works boomer it depends on what its worth nodding to himself he replaced the pad yeah well talk ill be there in ten when alex hung up the phone and grabbed for his jacket bess was right behind him what is it ive got someplace to go judd lets hit it im going with you alex didnt even glance back as he started out he was already working on tucking her in some far corner of his mind forget it im going with you she repeated and snagged his arm thats the deal it surprised him when he tried to shake her off and she wouldnt shake the lady had a good grip he noted i didnt make any deal she could be just as tough and coldblooded as he she thought she planted her feet angled her chin your captain did i ride with you detective wherever you may be going a day in the life remember fine frustration vibrated through him as he stared her down you ride and you stay in the car no way youre scaring off my snitch want me to drive judd offered as they headed down the steps to the garage no alexs answer was flat and left no room for argument judd sent bess a goodnatured shrug then because alex made no move to do so he opened the back door of their nondescript unmarked car for her where are we going bess asked determined to be pleasant to talk to the scum of the earth alex shot back as he pulled out of the garage sounds fascinating bess said and meant it she didnt think shed ever been in this part of town before many of the shop windows were boarded up those still in business were grubbier than usual people still walked as though they were in a hurry but it didnt look as if they had anyplace to go funny she thought how alex seemed to blend with the surroundings it wasnt simply the jeans and battered jacket he wore or the hair hed deliberately mussed it was a look in the eyes a set of the body a twist of the mouth no one would look twice at him she thought or if they bothered they wouldnt see a cop theyd see another street tough obviously on the edge of his luck taking her cue from him she pulled out her bag of cosmetics darkening her mouth adding just a little too much eyeliner and shadow she tried a couple of bored looks in the mirror of her compact and decided to tease up her hair alex glanced back at her and scowled what the hell are you doing to your face getting into character she said blithely just like you are we going to bust somebody he only turned away and muttered just his luck he thought he wanted to slip into boomers joint unobtrusively and he was stuck with a redhead who thought they were playing cops and robbers unoffended bess put away her mirror and scanned the area parking wasnt a problem here bess decided that if anyone left his car unattended in this neighborhood for above ten minutes hed come back and be lucky to find a hubcap alex swung over the curb and swore he couldnt leave her in the car here damn it any of the hustlers or junkies on the streets would take one look then eat her alive you listen to me he turned leaning over the seat to make his point stay close to me and keep your mouth shut no questions no comments all right but where no questions he slammed out of his door then waited for her with his hand firm on her arm he hauled her to the sidewalk if you step out of line i swear ill slap the cuffs on you romantic isnt he she said to judd just sends shivers down my spine keep a lid on it mcnee alex told her refusing to be amused he pulled her through a grimy door into an airless shop it took her a minute to get her bearings in the dim light there were shelves and shelves crowded with dusty merchandise radios picture frames kitchenware a tuba a huge glass display counter with a diagonal crack across it dominated one wall security glass ran to the ceiling cutting through it was a window like a bank tellers studded with bars a pawnshop bess said with such obvious delight that alex snarled at her one word about atmosphere ill clobber you but she was already dragging out her notebook go ahead do what you have to do you wont even know im here sure he thought how would anyone know she was there simply because that sunshine scent of her cut right through the grime and must he stepped up to the counter just as a scrawny man in a loose white shirt came through the rear door stanislaski boomer what have you got for me grinning boomer passed a hand over his heavily greased black hair come on i got some good stuff and you know i make a point of cooperating with the law but a mans got to make a living you make one ripping off every poor slob who walks through the door aw now you hurt my feelings boomers pale blue eyes glittered rookie he asked nodding at judd he used to be after an appraising look boomer glanced over at bess she was busy poking through his merchandise looks like i got me a customer hang on shes with me alex shot him a knifeedged look that forestalled any questions just forget shes here boomer had already appraised the trio of rings on besss right hand and the blue topaz drops at her cars he sighed his disappointment youre the boss stanislaski but listen i like to be discreet alex leaned on the counter like a man ready to shoot the bull for hours his voice was soft and deadly jerk my chain boomer and im going to have to come down here and take a hard look at what you keep in that back room stock just stock but he grinned he didnt have any illusions about alex boomer knew when he was detested but he also knew they had an agreement of sorts and thus far it had been advantageous to both of them i got something on those hookers that got sliced up though his expression didnt change though he didnt move a muscle alex went on alert what kind of something boomer merely smiled and rubbed his thumb and forefinger together when alex drew out a twenty it disappeared quickly through the bars twenty more if you like what i have to say if its worth it youll get it you know i trust you smelling of hair grease and sweat boomer leaned closer word on the street is youre looking for some high roller guys names jack so far im not impressed just building up to it pal the first one that was wasted she was one of big eds wives i recognized her from the newspaper picture now she was finelooking not that i ever used her services turn the page boomer okay okay he shot a grin at judd he dont like conversation i heard both those unfortunate ladies were in possession of a certain piece of jewelry youve got good ears man in my position hears things it so happens i had a young lady come in just yesterday she had a certain piece of jewelry she wanted to exchange opening a drawer boomer pulled out a thin gold chain dangling from it was a heart cracked down the center when alex held out a hand boomer shook his head i gave her twenty for it saying nothing alex pulled another bill out of his wallet seems to me im entitled to a certain amount of profit eyes steady alex pulled the twenty back an inch youre entitled to go in and answer a bunch of nasty questions down at the cop shop with a shrug boomer exchanged the bill for the heart hed only given ten for it in any case she wasnt much more than a kid boomer added eighteen maybe twenty at a stretch still pretty bottle blonde blue eyes little mole right here he tapped beside his left eyebrow got an address well now twenty for the address boomer alexs tone told the man to take it thats it satisfied boomer named a hotel a few blocks away signed her name crystal he added wanting to keep the partnership intact crystal larue figure she made it up lets check it out he said to judd then tapped bess on the shoulder she was apparently absorbed in an ugly brass lamp in the shape of a rearing horse lets go in a minute she turned a smile on boomer how much oh for you forget it alex was dragging her to the door i want to buy its ugly annoyed at the loss but pleased to have recorded the entire conversation she sighed thats the point but she climbed meekly into the car and began to scribble her impressions in her book cramped shop very dirty mostly junk excellent place for props proprietor a complete sleaze alexi in complete control of exchange a kind of gameplaying quietly disgusted but willing to use the tools at hand by the time shed finished scribbling alex was pulling to the curb again same rules he said to bess as they climbed out of the car absolutely lips pursed she studied the crumbling hotel she recognized it as a rentbythehour special is this where she lives who the girl you were talking about she lifted a brow i have ears too alexi he should have known as long as you keep your mouth shut theres no need to be rude she told him as they started in tell you what just to show theres no hard feelings ill buy you both lunch great judd gallantly opened the door for her youre so easy alex muttered to his partner as they entered the filthy lobby hey we gotta eat sometime he hated to bring her in here alex realized into this dirty place that smelled of garbage and moldy dreams how could she be so unaffected by it he wondered then struggled to put thoughts of her aside as he approached the desk clerk you got a crystal larue the clerk peered over his newspaper there was an unfiltered cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth and total disinterest in his eyes dont ask for names alex merely pulled out his badge flashed it blonde about eighteen goodlooking a beauty mark beside her eyebrow working girl dont ask what they do for a living neither with a shrug the clerk went back to his paper twotwelve she in havent seen her go out with bess trailing behind they started up the steps to entertain herself she read the various tenants suggestions and statements that were scrawled on the walls there was a screaming match in progress behind one of the doors on the first floor someone was banging on the wall from a neighboring room and demanding in colorful terms that the two opponents quiet down a bag of garbage had spilled on the stairs between the second and first floors it had gone very ripe alex rapped on the door of waited he rapped again and called out crystal need to talk to you with a glance at judd alex tried the door the knob turned easily in a place like this youd think shed lock it judd commented and wire it with explosives alex added he slipped out his gun and judd did the same stay in the hall he ordered bess without looking at her they went through the door guns at the ready she did exactly what she was told but that didnt stop her from seeing crystal hadnt gone out and she wouldnt be walking the streets again as the door hung open bess stared at what was sprawled across the sagging mattress inside the stench of blood and worse streamed through the open doorway death violent death she had written about it discussed it watched gleefully as it was acted out for the cameras but shed never seen it facetoface had never known how completely a human being could be turned into a thing from far away she heard alex swear over and over but she could only stare frozen until his body blocked her view he had his hands on her shoulders squeezing god she was cold bess thought shed never been so cold i want you to go downstairs she managed to lift her gaze from his chin to his eyes the iced fury in them had her shivering what he nearly swore again she was white as a sheet and her pupils had contracted until they were hardly bigger than the point of a pin go downstairs bess he tried to rub the chill out of her arms knowing he couldnt are you listening to me he said his voice quiet gentle yes she moistened her lips pressed them together im sorry yes go down stay in the lobby dont say anything dont do anything until judd or i come down okay he gave her a little shake and wondered what he would do if she folded on him okay she took one shaky breath then nodded shes so young with an effort she swallowed the sickness that kept threatening to rise in her throat im all right dont worry about me im all right she repeated then turnedaway to go downstairs she shouldnt have seen this judd said his own stomach was quivering nobody should see this banking down on every emotion alex closed the door at his back she stuck it out refusing to budge when judd came down to drive her home after finding an old chair she settled into a corner while the business of death went on around her from her vantage point she watched them come and go forensics the police photographer the morgue detached she studied the people who crowded in asking questions making comments being shuffled out again by blankfaced cops there was grief in her for a girl she hadnt known a fury at the waste of a life but she remained not because of the job because of alex he was angry with her she understood it and didnt question it when they were finished at the scene she rode in silence in the back of the car back at the station she took the same chair shed had that morning hours went by endlessly long at one point she slipped out and bought alex and judd sandwiches from a deli after a time he went into another room she followed still silent noted a board with pictures tacked to it horrible pictures she looked away from them took a chair and listened while alex and other detectives discussed the latest murder and the ongoing investigation later she rode with him back to the pawnshop waited patiently while he questioned boomer again waited longer while he and judd returned to the motel to reinterview the clerk the tenants like them she learned little about crystal larue her name had been kathy segal and shed once lived in wisconsin it had been hard terribly hard for bess to listen when alex tracked down and notified her parents hard too to understand from alexs end of the conversation that they didnt care for them their daughter had already been dead shed been nobodys girl shed worked the streets on her own two months after she moved into the tiny little room with the sagging mattress she had died there no one had known her no one had wanted to know her no one had cared alex couldnt talk to bess it was impossible for him intolerable he shared this part of his life with no one who mattered to him it was true that his sister rachel saw some of it as a public defender but as far as alex was concerned that was too much perhaps that was why he kept all the pieces he could away from the rest of his family and loved ones he hated remembering the look on besss face as shed stood in that doorway there should have been a way to protect her from that to shield her from her own stubbornness but he hadnt protected her he hadnt shielded her though that was precisely what he had sworn to do for people hed never met from the first day hed worn a badge yet for her for the woman he was god yes the woman he was in love with hed opened the door himself and let her in so he didnt talk to her not even when it was time to turn it off and go home and in the silence his anger built and swelled and clawed at his guts he found the words when he stepped into her apartment and closed the door did you get enough bess was in no mood to fight her emotions always close to the surface had been wrung dry by what shed seen and heard that day she would let him yell if that was what he needed but she was tired she was aching and her heart went out to him let me get you a drink she said quietly but he snagged her arm and whirled her back is it all in your notes that cold terribly controlled fury swiped out at her can you find a way to use it to entertain those millions of daytime viewers im sorry it was all she could think of alexi im so sorry she took a deep breath i want a brandy ill get us both one fine a nice civilized brandy is just what we need she walked away to choose a bottle from an old lacquered cabinet i dont know what you want me to say very carefully very deliberately she poured two snifters ill apologize for choosing today to do this if that helps ill apologize for making it more difficult for you by being there when this happened she brought the snifter to him but he didnt take it right now id be willing to say anything youd like to hear he couldnt get beyond it no matter what she said he couldnt get beyond knowing hed opened the door on the kind of horror shed never be able to forget you had no business being there you had no business seeing any of that with a sigh she set both snifters aside maybe brandy wouldnt help after all you were there you saw it his eyes flashed white heat its my damn job i know she lifted a hand to his cheek soothing i know compelled he grabbed her wrist held tight a moment before he turned away i dont want you touched by it i dont want you touched by it ever again i cant promise that because it was her way she wrapped her arms around his waist rested her cheek against his back he was rigid as steel unyielding as granite not if you want something between us its because i do want something between us alexi so many emotions she thought always before it had been easy to sort them out to drift with them but this time it had been a long hard day she reminded herself there would be time to think later if what you want is someone you can tuck in a comfortable corner it isnt me what you do is part of what you are when he turned she brushed her hands over his cheeks again refusing to let him retreat you want me to say i was appalled by what i saw in that room i was i was appalled by the cruelty of it sickened by the terrible terrible waste that sliced at him a long thin blade through the heart i shouldnt have let you go with me that part of my life isnt ever going to be part of yours stop the sorrow that had paled her face hardened into determination do you think that because i write fantasy i dont know anything about the real world youre wrong i know it just doesnt overwhelm my life and i know that what you faced today you may face tomorrow or worse i know that every time you walk out the door you may not come back the quick lick of fear reminded her to slow down and speak carefully what you are makes that a very real possibility but i wont let that overwhelm me either because theres nothing about you id change for a moment he simply stared at her a hundred different feelings fighting for control inside him then slowly he lowered his brow to hers and shut her eyes i dont know what to say to you you dont have to say anything we dont have to talk at all he knew what she was offering even before she tilted her head and touched her lips to his he wanted it and her more than anything he wanted to steep himself in her until the rest of the world went away he took his hands through her hair letting his fingers toy with those loose vivid curls we havent come up with those rules her lips curved slanted over his well figure them out later he murmured his agreement drawing her closer i want you i need to be with you i think id go crazy if i couldnt be with you tonight im here right here bess his mouth moved from hers to skim along those sharp cheekbones im in love with you she felt her heart stutter that was the only way she could describe this sensation shed never experienced before alexi dont he closed his mouth over hers again dont say it it comes too easy to you just come to bed he buried his face against her neck for gods sake let me take you to bed chapter contents prev next hurt oh shed read the stories and the poetry watched the movies shed even written the scenes but shed never believed that love and pain existed together could twine into one clenched fist to batter the soul yet his words had hurt her immeasurably even as her heart opened to give and accept this time it was different how could she possibly explain that to him when she was still groping for the answers herself and what good were words now when there was so much need a touch would be enough she promised herself as they swayed toward the steps tonight would be enough and tomorrow all the aches would only be memories his mouth came back to hers restless insistent as they began the climb the first helpless sigh caught in her throat as he pulled her close and aroused her unbearably with a long sumptuous meeting of lips her fingers trembled when she tugged at his jacket had they ever trembled for a man before she wondered no and as the leather slid away leaving her free to grip those magnificent shoulders she knew that none of this had happened before not the trembling not the raw scrape of nerves not the sting of bright tears not the sweet slow throb of her blood this was the first time for so many things he didnt know how much longer he could perform the simple act of drawing breath in and out of his lungs not when her body was shivering against his not when he could hear those small desperately needy sounds in her throat the staircase seemed to stretch interminably with a muffled oath he swept her up into his arms her eyes met his and though her heart seemed ready to burst she managed to smile she knew he needed smiles tonight and i said you werent romantic i have my moments shaky she nuzzled her face into the curve of his neck im awfully glad im here for this one keep it up he said in a strained voice as she ran nibbling kisses from throat to ear and ill do something really romantic like falling on my face and dropping you oh i trust you detective she caught the lobe of his ear in her teeth and felt the quick jerk of reaction completely with his heart roaring in his head he reached the top she was teasing his jawline now making little murmurs of approval as she sampled his flesh he headed for the first door this better be the bedroom mmmhmm while she worked her way to his mouth her fingers were busy unbuttoning his shirt he recognized her scent first even as he passed through the doorway it wrapped its alluring womans fingers around him that cheerful sexy fragrance hung in the air the result no doubt of spilled powder and an unstoppered bottle of perfume her clothes were a colorful mess of silk blouses bright cotton pants tangled hose his quick scan passed over a lifesize stuffed ostrich a pair of thriving ficus trees flanking the wide window and a collection of antique bottles elegant in jewel colors before he focused on the bed it was a long wide ocean of cool blue sheets topped by a lush mountain of vividtoned pillows all satins and silks because his mouth was beginning to water he took one long slow breath but the air so fragrant burned his lungs that looks big enough for six close friends i like a lot of room even as his stomach quivered at the images that evoked she was continuing i used to fall out of bed a lot when i was a kid is that how you broke your nose no but i chipped a tooth once he set her down beside the bed pleased that her arms stayed linked around his neck i think we can probably keep from falling out of this one if we work on it she raised up on her toes just a little just enough to bring them eyetoeye im willing to risk it determined to steady himself he kissed her brow her cheeks let me take my gun off he stripped off the holster set it on the floor with fingers that were suddenly numb and awkward she reached for the buttons of her blazer no it was that one quick flash of nerves in her eyes that had settled his own he closed his hands over hers let me he unfastened buttons then took his hands slowly up her sides his thumbs just brushing her breasts youre shaking i know watching her he slid the jacket from her shoulders are you afraid of me no she couldnt swallow of this a little its silly he toyed with the first button of her blouse then the second her skin quivered as his knuckle skimmed over it i like it thats good she tried to laugh but only managed one trembling breath because i cant seem to stop theres plenty of time to relax the blouse slipped away and desire curled its powerful fist in his stomach midnightblue silk shimmered in the dimming light gleaming against ivory skin theres no hurry i her head fell back as he traced a finger over the silk gently so gently over the swell of her breasts as though hers was the first body hed touched the only one he wanted to touch god alexi ive spent a lot of time imagining this step out of your shoes he suggested while he unhooked her slacks in a daze she obeyed as the slacks slithered down her legs im going to spend a lot more time enjoying it i want all of you lazily testingly he ran a finger under the lace cut high on her thigh ah the skin there was like rose petals dewed with morning her eyes went wide and dark her body quaked all of you he repeated she couldnt move every muscle in her body had turned to water hot rushing water she couldnt speak not when so many emotions clogged her throat as she stood swaying helplessly seduced he watched her touched her clever fingers brushing stroking exploring he trailed them up her arms slid them over her shoulders then back to silk until her body burned like fever his eyes never left hers even when he kissed her lightly tormenting her hungry lips with the barest of tastes his eyes stayed open and aware youre making me crazy her voice hitched out through trembling lips i know i want to he caught her wrists when she reached for him then ran their tangled fingers over her so that she felt her own response to him inside and out as he touched his mouth to hers again patiently erotically he deepened the kiss until her hands went limp and her pulse thundered then he brought her hands up spread them over his chest together they spread his open shirt apart with his mouth still clinging to hers he tugged it off his heart gave a quick hard lurch as her hands hot and eager raced over him yanking her close he took off his shoes his skin was already damp when he fumbled for the snap of his jeans i want you under me he tore his mouth from hers to savor her throat i want to feel you move under me they lowered to the bed rolled once then twice over silk he used every ounce of control every degree of will to keep himself from plunging into her and taking the quick desperate release his body craved his mind his soul wanted more than that she seemed smaller like this slighter it helped him remember that passion could outstrip tenderness so while the blood pounded and burned in his veins he loved her slowly she discovered that a woman could drown willingly in sweetness she knew there was a gun on the floor beside them and that he had used it at least once to kill but the hands that moved over her were those of a gentle man one who cared she rested a palm on his cheek as she floated away on the kiss one who loved who loved her staggered by the knowledge she poured everything she had into the kiss needing to show him that whatever he felt was returned equally then his mouth slid from hers to trail down her throat over her shoulder all thought all reason skittered away in a warm slippery pool of silk and satin he showed her what it was to ache for someone to yearn for the sharp thin point of pain the poets call ecstasy her hips arched under his desperately offering but he only continued that tormenting journey over her with teasing lips and gentle hands when his tongue flicked under the line of lace that clung tenuously to her breasts she moaned pressing an urgent hand to the back of his head the taste there honey dampened by her arousal nearly unraveled the taut knot of his control so he pleased them both closing a greedy mouth over that firm scented swell gasping out with pleasure she bucked under him straining for more her nails digging heedlessly into his back as she whimpered and struggled for what was just out of reach maddened by her response he brought his mouth to hers again crushing her lips as he slithered a hand down to cup the heat between her thighs prayers and pleas trembled on her tongue but before she could voice them he slipped under the silk to stroke the unbearable pleasure shattered fractured lights whirling colors spun behind her eyes to blind her she heard herself cry out his name was nearly a sob then there was his groan a sound of sweet satisfaction as her body went limp in release never before her hands slid away from him boneless sweet lord never like this she felt weak wrecked weepy as her breath sobbed out as her eyes fluttered closed they both knew that her mind her body were totally his for the taking hed never felt stronger her wild response her absolute surrender filled him with a kind of intense power hed never experienced before silk rustled against silk as he drew the teddy down tossed it aside her skin slick with passion glowed in the shadows he touched where he chose watching fascinated as his own hands molded her gold against ivory he tasted wherever he liked feeling her muscles quiver involuntarily as he traced openmouthed kisses over her rib cage down to her stomach heat to heat then wanting that instant of sheer pleasure again he drove her up a second time shuddering himself as her body convulsed and flowed with the crest of the wave at last unable to wait a moment longer he slipped inside that hot moist sheath her groan of stunned delight echoed his own slowly as in a dream her arms lifted to wrap around him she rose to meet him to take him deep they moved gently at first treasuring the intimacy willing to prolong it but need outpaced them driving them faster until thrust for thrust they sprinted toward the final crest his hand fisted in her hair as the last link of control snapped clean her name exploded from his lips like an oath as he emptied himself into her she wondered how she could ever have thought herself experienced while it was true she hadnt been with as many men as some thought she hadnt come to alexi an innocent yet things had happened tonight that had never happened before and because she was a woman who understood herself well she knew that nothing she had experienced here would happen again unless it was with him relaxed now she rubbed her cheek over his chest content to remain as shed been since he rolled over and dragged her across him tucked in the cocoon of his arms she felt as cozy as a cat and she arched lazily as he ran a hand down her spine will you tell me again she asked what she pressed her lips against him feeling his heart beating strong and fast beneath them what every woman wants to hear i love you when she lifted her head he laid a hand gently over her lips he knew it would hurt to hear her say it when she didnt mean it as he did suddenly she was glad it was dark and he couldnt see the smile fade away from her face even after this she said carefully you dont want me to love you back more than anything he thought more than life lets just leave things as they are he traced her face with a fingertip enjoying those odd angles tell me how you broke your nose she was silent a moment gathering her composure she couldnt offer what he didnt want to take fistfight he chuckled and drew her back to cuddle instinctively soothing the tension out of her i should have figured she made an effort to relax against him there was time to convince him hadnt he said they had plenty of time at boarding school she added i was twelve and homely as a duck too skinny funny hair dumb face i like your face and your hair his hand cupped her breast comfortably and your body you didnt know me when i was twelve when youre odd in any way youre a target i know interested she lifted her head again do you i didnt learn english until i was five before my fathers business got off the ground times were rough he turned his face into her hair to breathe in the scent i was this little ukrainian kid wearing my brothers handmedowns and back then soviets werent particularly popular with americans well you made such great villains she kissed his cheek comforting the small boy hed been it must have been difficult for you i had the family we had each other school was a little rugged at first namecalling playground scuffles even some of the parents werent too keen on having their kids play with the russkie no point in trying to explain we were ukrainian he shifted tangled his legs with hers so after a few black eyes and bloody noses i earned a reputation for being tough after a while we kind of got absorbed into the neighborhood what neighborhood brooklyn my parents still live there same house with a shake of his head he drew back he could make her out now in the dark could see the way her eyes were smiling at him how come were talking about me when i asked you about your nose i like hearing it there was a fistfight he said prompting her bess sighed one of those girl cliques she began you know the type the cool kids all hair and teeth and attitude i was the nerd they liked to pick on you were never a nerd i was a champion nerd gawky top of the class academically socially inept you there was such pure disbelief in the tone she laughed which of those descriptions dont you buy alexi he considered a moment any of them i guess im twothirds flattered and onethird insulted i was tall for my age and skinny a very late bloomer in the bosom and hips department you might have bloomed slow he began proving his point with a sweep of his hand but you bloomed very well thank you my mind however had developed quite nicely straight as no kidding he grinned in the dark and you were the kid who always trashed the grading curve for the rest of us thats the idea added to that i was more comfortable with a book or thinking than i was tittering young girls do a lot of tittering because i was hardheaded i automatically took a dislike to anything that was popular or fashionablc at the time as a result i took a lot of flak bess the mess that sort of thing she paused long enough to shift some pillows anyway we had this history exam coming up one of the cool kids her name was dawn gallagher heartshaped face perfect features long flowing blond hair you get the picture promqueen type exactly she was flunking bigtime and wanted me to let her copy from my paper shed made my life adolescent hell and she figured if she was nice to me for a couple of days let me stand within five feet of her maybe sit at the same lunch table id be so grateful id let her but you hung tough i dont cheat for anybody the upshot was she flunked the exam and her parents were called to the school for a conference dawn retaliated by pinching me whenever i got too close getting into my room and breaking my things stealing my books smalltime terrorism one day on the basketball court you shot hoop team captain i was an athletic nerd she explained anyway she tripped me if that wasnt bad enough she had a few friends on the other team they elbowed the hell out of me during the game i had bruises everywhere an immediate flood of resentment had him tightening his hold little bitches pleased with the support she cuddled closer it was an epiphany for me suddenly i saw that pacifism while morally sound could get you trampled into dust i waited for dawn outside the science lab one day we started out with words ive always been good at them we progressed to pushing and shoving and drew quite a crowd she swung first i didnt expect it and she bopped me right on the nose let me tell you detective pain can be a great motivator separates the nerds from the toughs you got it it took three of them to pull me off her but before they did id blackened her babyblues split her cupidsbow mouth and loosened several of her pearlywhites good for you mcnee it was good she said with a sigh in fact it felt so good ive had to be careful with my temper ever since i didnt just want to hurt her you see i wanted to mangle her he took her hand curled it into a fist and raised it to his lips ill have to watch my step did you take much heat we both got suspended my parents were appalled and embarrassed enough by my behavior to cancel my summer plans and switch me to another school but he cut himself off not every family was as supportive as his it was the best thing that could have happened to me she told him i started off with a clean slate i was still ugly but i knew how to handle myself even if she didnt realize she was carrying around some emotional scars he did he rolled over her cupping her face in his hands listen mcnee youre beautiful amused she grinned sure i am he didnt smile in the dim light his eyes were very intense i said youre beautiful why else havent i been able to get you out of my mind since the first time i saw you intriguing she corrected unusual gorgeous he murmured and watched her blink in surprise ivory for skin fire for hair jade for eyes and these he traced a fingertip over a sprinkling of freckles gold dust youve already gotten me into bed alexi she said lightly she had to speak lightly or shed humiliate herself with tears but the flattery is appreciated with a grin she linked her arms around his neck but havent you heard the one about actions speaking louder than words he arched a brow if you insist oh i do she murmured as his mouth came down to hers i absolutely do with her bag slapping hard against her hip bess raced into the office ten minutes late i have a good excuse she called to lori her perpetually prompt partner was standing by the coffeepot her back to the door its all right im running behind myself you bess dropped her bag stretched her shoulders she might have skipped her workout that morning but she was feeling as limber as a snake what is it a national holiday she crossed to the pot herself chattering as she poured a cup well id save my excuse for another time but i can hardly stand not to tell you she lifted shining eyes then stopped after one look at loris face what is it honey its nothing after giving herself a shake lori sipped her coffee its just that steven caught me on my way in did he say something to upset you he said he loved me she pressed her lips together shed be damned if shed cry over him again the sonofabitch lets sit down bess curled a comforting arm around loris shoulder you might not want to hear this but i think he means it he doesnt even know what it means furious lori dashed one rogue tear away im not going to let him do this to me again get me believing get me all churned up just so he can back off when things get serious let him have the fantasy life ive got reality because shed been waiting for an opening just like this bess crouched down in front of her which is a job paying your bills boring bess finished and loris brimming eyes flashed then im boring no youre not sighing bess set her coffee aside and took one of loris hands maybe youre afraid to take risks but that doesnt make you boring and i know you want more out of life than a job and a good credit rating whats wrong with those things nothing as long as thats not all you have lori i know youre still in love with him thats my problem his too hes miserable without you suddenly weary lori rubbed her fingers between her brows hes the one who broke things off he said he didnt want complications a longterm commitment he was wrong id bet the bank that he knows hes wrong why dont you just talk to him i dont know if i can she squeezed her eyes tight it hurts an odd light flickered in besss eyes is that how you know its real when it hurts its one of the top symptoms she opened her eyes again this time there was a trace of hope mixed with the tears do you really think hes unhappy i know he is just talk lori hear each other out maybe she gave besss hand a quick squeeze then reached for her coffee again i wasnt going to dump this on you first thing what are pals for well pal wed better get to work or a lot of people will be out of a job great ive been playing with the dialogue in that scene between storm and jade we want to bump up the sexual tension lori was already nodding and booting up the computer youre the dialogue champ she began then glanced up so why were you late its not important weve got them running into each other at the station house the long look first then bess youre only making me more curious get it out of the way or i wont be able to work okay she was all but bursting to tell in any case i was with alexi i thought that was yesterday it was besss smile spread and last night and this morning oh lori its incredible ive never felt this way about anyone right she started to pick up her reading glasses then looked up again for a moment she did nothing but study besss face say that again ive never felt this way about anyone good grief on a quick huff of breath lori sat back i think you mean it its different with a half laugh bess pressed a hand to her cheek its scary and it hurts and sometimes i look at him and i cant even breathe im so afraid he might take a good look at me and realize his mistake she let her hand drop away its supposed to be easy no slowly lori shook her head that was always your mistake its supposed to be hard and scary and real theres this clutching around my heart yeah and and frustrated bess turned scooting around a chair so that she could pace the length of the table and my stomachs all tied up in knots one minute the next i feel so happy i can hardly bear it when we were together last night no way to describe it she thought no possible way lori i swear no ones ever made me feel like that and this morning when i woke up beside him i didnt know whether to laugh or cry lori rose held out a hand congratulations mcnee youve finally made it looks that way with a laugh she threw her arms around lori and squeezed why didnt you ever tell me how it feels its something you have to experience firsthand how about him he loves me she felt foolish and weepy digging through her bag she found a tattered tissue he told me he looked at me and he told me but ohoh he doesnt want me to tell him how i feel hissing a breath through her teeth she pressed a hand to her stomach oh god it hurts it hurts everywhere when i realize he doesnt trust me enough he thinks its like all the other times why shouldnt he but i want him to know its not and i dont know how he only has to look at you its not enough calmer now bess blew her nose everythings different this time i guess i have to prove myself i do love him lori i can see that i wasnt sure i ever would touched she lifted a hand to besss hair you could take your own advice and talk to him we have talked but he doesnt want to hear this at least not yet he wants things to stay as they are lori lifted her brows what do you want for him to be happy she chuckled and stuffed the mangled tissue back in her purse that makes me sound like a wimp you know im not who knows you better it only makes you sound like a woman in the first dizzy stages of love bess gave her a watery smile does it get worse or better both thats good news well while its getting worse and better ill have time to show him how i feel she picked up her coffee then set it aside again lori theres one more thing what could be bigger lori demanded alexi wants me to have dinner with his family on sunday after a quick gurgle of laughter loris eyes widened hes taking you home to mother and father bess put in and brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews a couple times a month they have a big family dinner on sunday obviously the man is crazy about you he is i know he is then she shut her eyes and dropped into a chair his family is enormously important to him you can hear it every time he mentions one of them she grabbed another tissue and began to tear it to shreds i want to meet them really but what if they dont like me you have got it bad take it from me you just be the bess mcnee we all know and love and theyll be crazy about you too but what if what if you pull yourself together this time lori picked up her glasses perched them on her nose put some of this angst into storm and jades heartbreak millions of viewers will thank you after a deep breath bess nodded okay okay that might work and if we dont get the morning session out of the way we wont be ready when rosalie comes in at noon for a consulting session your deal sister frowning lori gestured with a pencil that particular lady makes me nervous dont worry about rosalie i know what im doing how many times have i heard that but bess only smiled and let her mind drift okay storm and jade she closed her eyes envisioned the scene so they run into each other at the station chapter contents prev next and then bess continued as she zipped through traffic jade turns back devastated and says but what you want isnt always what you need music swells fade out its not that im not fascinated by the twists and turns of those people in holbrook millbrook right alex winced as she cut off a sedan i just wish youd watch the road it would be really embarrassing if you got a ticket while i was in the car with you im not speeding frowning she glanced down at her speedometer hardly she handled the five speed like a seasoned veteran of the indianapolis alex thought and at the moment she was treating the other innocent drivers on the road like competitors maybe you could find a home in one lane and stay there killjoy but she did as he asked i hardly ever get to drive i love it he had to smile the wind whipping in through the open sunroof was blowing her hair everywhere id never have guessed the last time i had a chance was when ld and i went to some fancy do on long island she checked her mirror and unable to resist shot into the next lane one trip with me and he insisted on taking his car and driver every damn place she sent alex a smile then sobered instantly when she saw his expression im sorry for what for bringing him up i didnt say anything no he hadnt said anything she admitted a man didnt have to say a word when his eyes could go that cold her hands tightened on the wheel now she stared straight ahead he was a friend alexi thats all he ever was i didnt she took a long careful breath i never slept with him i didnt ask one way or the other he said coolly maybe you should one minute you want to know all there is about me and the next you dont i think i think youre driving too fast again he reached over and brushed his knuckles down her cheek and you should relax okay okay but her fingers remained tight on the wheel id like sometime for us to talk about it sometime damn it didnt she realize he didnt want to talk about the other men whod been part of her life he didnt want to think about them especially now now that he was in love and he knew what it was like to be with her he knew the sound of that little sigh she made when she turned toward him in the night the way her eyes stayed unfocused and heavy long after she awakened in the morning he knew she liked her showers too hot and too long and that she smelled so good because she rubbed some fragrant cream all over before shed even dried off she was always losing things an earring a scribbled note money she never counted her change and she always overtipped he knew those things was coming to treasure them why should he talk about other men who had come to know them turn here hmm i said turn he trailed off with a huff of breath as she breezed by the exit okay take the next one and well double back the next what turn mcnee he reached over and gave her hair a quick tug take the next turn which means you have to get over in the right lane oh she did punching the gas and handily cutting off another car at the rude blast of its horn she only lifted a hand and waved he wasnt being friendly alex pointed out after he took his hands from in front of his eyes i know but thats no reason for me to be rude too some people consider cutting off another driver rude no thats an adventure somehow they made it without mishap but the moment shed squeezed into a parking place two doors down from his parents row house he held out his hand keys sulking she jingled them in her hand i didnt get a ticket probably because there wasnt a traffic cop brave enough to pull you over lets have them mcnee ive had enough adventure for one day you just want to drive her eyes narrowed suspiciously its a man thing its a survival thing he plucked them from her hand i just want to live not that he was going to object to handling the natty little mercedes but he decided against bringing that up as they climbed out of opposite doors pretty neighborhood she commented taking in the trees and freshly painted house trim and flowering plants the scatter of kids riding over the uneven sidewalk on bikes and skateboards a few of them called out to alex bess found herself being given the onceover by a group of teenage boys before they sent hoots and whistles and thumbsup signs in alexs direction ah the first stamp of approval but she rubbed her damp palm surreptitiously against her skirt before taking his hand did you used to ride bikes along the sidewalk sure battling nerves she strolled with him toward the house and sit on the curb in the summer and lie about girls i didnt have to lie he told her with a wicked grin he glanced up the steps as the door opened and mikhail came out griff on his hip youre late again he started down jiggling griff she missed the turn hes always late mikhail smiled youre bess yes hello she held out a hand and found that his was hard as rock griff had already leaned over to give alex a kiss and now still puckered he leaned toward bess laughing she pressed her mouth to his and hello to you too handsome griff likes the ladies mikhail told her takes after his uncle dont start alex muttered mikhail ignored him and continued to study bess until she was fighting the need to squirm do i have dirt on my face or what no sorry he shifted his gaze to his brother youre improving alexi he said in ukrainian this one is well worth a few sweaty mornings in the gym tak he skimmed a hand down to the nape of besss neck if you tell her about that ill strangle you in your sleep mikhails grin flashed the resemblance was startling bess thought those wild dark looks that simmering sexuality and the child had the looks as well she realized lord help the women of the twentyfirst century guy talk she asked bad manners mikhail said apologetically deciding he liked not only her unusual looks but the intelligence in her eyes as well yes indeed he thought alex was definitely improving i was complimenting my brother on his taste take her in alex griff wants to watch the kids ride awhile sydney he asked as he mounted the steps shes here but shes tired she works too hard there is that the grin spread again and shes pregnant alex stopped turned yeah he went down the steps again to catch mikhail and griff in a bear hug its good its great we want our children close our family big youre off to the right start he grabbed besss hand as mikhail lifted griff onto his shoulders and crossed the street griff was clapping his hands and shouting toddler gibberish to the other kids im still trying to get used to him being a papa and now hes going to have another shed forgotten her nerves perhaps the childs sweet unaffected kiss had done it she slipped an arm around alexs waist come on uncle alex i want to meet the rest of them theyre loud he warned as they started back up the door i like loud they can be nosy so can i at the door he took both of her hands hed brought women into his home before but it had never been important this was vital i love you bess before she could speak he kissed her then pushed open the door they certainly were loud bess discovered no one seemed to mind if everyone talked at once or if the big droopyeared dog barked and raced around the living room to hide behind chairs and they were nosy though they were charming with it shed hardly had a chance to get her bearings before she was sitting next to alexs father yuri and being cagily interrogated so you write stories for tv he nodded his big shaggy head approvingly you have brains a few she smiled up at zack when he offered her a glass of wine rachel says more than a few he sent his wife a wink as she sat with her hands folded over her enormous belly shes been watching your show oh yeah i admit i was curious rachel wanted to shift to get comfortable but she knewit was useless after we met i taped it a couple of times then when i gave in to zacks hounding me about taking maternity leave i realized how easy it is to get hooked im not sure ive got all the characters straight yet but its amazingly entertaining nicks caught it with me she glanced at her brotherinlaw to his credit nick didnt blush but he did squirm i was just keeping you company he might have come a long way from trying to prove his manhood with gangs like the cobras but even at nearly twentyone he wasnt quite secure enough to admit hed gotten caught up in the secret sins of millbrook he shrugged shook back his shaggy blond hair then caught the quick grins of his family it wasnt like i was really watching his green eyes glinted with humor except for the babes thats what they all say bess smiled back enjoying him too bad he wasnt an actor she thought those brooding good looks tough with just a hint of vulnerability beneath would shine onscreen so whos your type nick luanne our sensitive ingenue with the big weepy eyes who suffers in silence or the scheming brooke who uses her sexuality to destroy any man who crosses her considering he ran his tongue around his teeth actually i go for jade ive got this thing for older women zack caught him in a headlock hey nick laughed not bothering to try to free himself were having a conversation here im trying to make tune with alexs lady kill him in the other room will you alex said easily we have to eat in here i watch your show many times nadia said as she popped in from the kitchen alexs mothers handsome face was flushed pink from oven heat i like it well that yields not hard to watch zack stood behind his wife now rubbing her shoulders men always go for the cheap floozies rachel put in how about you alex caught any secret sins no not that hed admit mcnee keeps me up on whats happening in millbrook it must be hard sydney looking pale but blissfully relaxed in her corner of the couch sipped her ginger ale the pace its murder bess grinned i love it so how is it you meet alexi yuri asked he arrested me there was a moment of silence while alex aimed a killing look at bess then a burst of laughter that sent the dog careening around the room again did i miss a joke mikhail demanded as he swung through the door with griff no rachel chuckled again while her brother sat on the arm of the couch beside his wife but i have a feeling its going to be a good one come on bess this i have to hear she told them while alex interrupted a halfdozen times to disagree or correct or put in his own perspective even as they sat at the big old table to enjoy nadias pot roast they were shouting with laughter or calling out questions he put you in a cell but you still go out with him this from mikhail well bess ran her tongue over her teeth he is kind of cute with a hearty laugh yuri slapped his son on the back the ladies they always say so alex scooped up potatoes thanks papa is good to be attractive to women he wiggled his brows at his wife then when you pick one she is helpless to resist i picked you nadia told him passing biscuits to nick you were very slow like a bear with ah she struggled for the right word soft brains she ignored yuris snort of objection he did not come to court me so i courted him every time i turn there she is in my way when he looked at his wife bess saw memories and more in his eyes there was no prettier girl in the village than nadia then she was mine i liked your big hands and shy eyes she told him her smile was quick and lovely soon you were not so shy but my boys she added turning the smile on bess they were never shy with the girls why waste time on impulse alex put a hand on besss cheek and turned her face to his her smile was puzzled then surprise shot into her eyes as he covered her mouth with his not a quick friendly kiss this but a scaring one that made her head buzz she had no way of knowing that hed never kissed a woman not of his family at his mothers table nor that by doing so he was telling those he loved that this was the woman as the table erupted with applause bess cleared her throat no she managed not a bit shy nadia blinked back tears and raised her glass she understood what her son had told her and felt the bittersweet pleasure that came from knowing the last of her children had given his heart welcome she said to bess a little confused bess reached for her glass as all the others were lifted thank you she sipped relieved when the chattering started again how easy to fall in love with them she realized all of them were so warm so open so comfortable with each other her parents would never have had such a sweetly intimate conversation at the table nor had they ever embraced her with the verve and passion both yuri and nadia showed their children was this what shed been missing all of those years bess wondered had lacking something like this caused her to be so socially clumsy as a child and making up for it so socially active as an adult still what she had had and what she hadnt had forged her into what she was so she couldnt regret it well perhaps a little she mused falling unknowingly into the family tradition by sneaking the dog bits of food under the table it was hard not to regret it a little when you saw how lovely it could be to be part of such a solid whole absorbing everything she glanced around the table and found mikhails eyes on her this time she smiled youre doing it again she told him yes i want to carve you i beg your pardon your face he reached out to take it in his hand the conversation continued around them as if he handled women at the dinner table regularly very fascinating mahogany would be best amused she sat patiently while he turned her face this way and that is this a joke mikhail never jokes about his work sydney commented coaxing one more green bean into her son im just surprised its taken him so long to demand you sit for him sit she shook her head and then her eyes widened as it all came together oh of course stanislaski the artist ive seen your work lusted after it actually you will sit for me and ill give you a piece youll choose it i could hardly turn down an offer like that good satisfied he went back to his meal shes very beautiful he said to alex in such an offhand way that bess laughed id say that stanislaski taste runs to the odd but your wife proves me wrong mikhail brushed a hand over sydneys halo of auburn hair stroked a finger down her classically lovely face there are different kinds of beauty youll come to the studio next week dont bother to argue sydney caught mikhails hand squeezed it it wont do you a bit of good at the other end of the table rachel winced nadia leaned closer spoke gently how far apart rachel gave a little sigh eight ten minutes theyre very mild yet whats mild zack glanced at her and then his mouth all but dropped to his knees oh god now now not this very minute she would be calm rachel told herself and took a deep cleansing breath to prove it i think you have time for some of mamas cream cake shes in labor he gaped across the table at his equally panicked brother were not ready here nick stumbled to his feet were ready back at home im supposed to call the doctor but i dont have the number mama does rachel assured her husbands younger brother then she lifted a hand to her husbands take it easy muldoon theres plenty of time time hell were going now shouldnt we go now zack demanded of nadia she smiled and nodded it would be best for you zack but mama rachels protest was cut off by nadias gentle flow of ukrainian the gist of which had a great deal to do with placating frightened husbands she should put her feet up mikhail announced this helped you yes yes sydney agreed but i think we should wait until she gets to the hospital nineoneone alex shoved away from the table and sprang to his feet ill call oh sit down rachel waved an annoyed hand at him i dont need a cop an ambulance he insisted im not sick im in labor i take her in the truck yuri was already up prepared to lift his baby girl into his big arms we get there very fast while the men began to argue in a mixture of languages nadia rose quietly and went into the kitchen to call rachels obstetrician ive already been through this mikhail was saying to alex i know how to handle it ha their father pushed them both aside and pounded a fist on his broad chest me four times you know nothing we dont have the tape recorder or the music nick ran a hand through his flow of sandy hair he was desperately afraid hed be sick though no one was listening to him he continued to babble the video camera weve got to get the video camera honey you want some water you want some juice when she yelped he turned dead white another one it hasnt been ten minutes has it youre breaking my hand rachel shook it free and sent a pleading look to sydney okay guys back off the steel under velvet that made sydney a successful businesswoman snapped into her voice alex go upstairs and get your sister a pillow for the ride yuri go start the truck thats a very good idea nick you mikhail and griff go back to your apartment and get what rachel needs well meet you at the hospital how do you get there mikhail demanded i have a car bess was watching the family drama with fascinated eyes we can fit three in a pinch wonderful dispersing the troops with all the flair of a general sydney gave her husband a kiss and a shove get going zack and nadia will ride with yuri and rachel ill go with alex and bess as the next contraction hit rachel began to breathe slowly steadily sorry she said to bess in between breaths to put you out no problem she had to bite her tongue to prevent herself asking what it felt like to go into labor at a family dinner thered be time for that later i called the doctor and natasha nadia came back into the room pleased that sydney had organized the troops natasha and her family are coming we should go zack helped rachel to her feet and swallowed hard shouldnt we go by the time they arrived at the hospital sydney and bess were the best of friends it was difficult to be otherwise when theyd been crammed together in one seat while alex drove like a madman back to manhattan they talked about clothes a few mutual friends theyd discovered and the stanislaski men sydney agreed that it was very forbearing of bess not to mention the quality of alexs driving after hed been so critical of hers by the time they found their way to the maternity level rachel was already settled in a birthing room zack had gotten over the first stages of panic and yuri was patting a pocket full of cigars shes in the early stages nadia explained to them in the corridor company is good for her alex strode straight through the door but bess hung back idont want to intrude she said to nadia this is not intrusion this is family nadia cocked her head are you uneasy with childbirth oh no i couldnt be after ive written so many alex poked his head back out howd you research that mcnee i did rounds with an obstetrician her dimple winked out and found a few motherstobe who didnt object to having me hang around during labor and delivery have you ever seen one no his eyes changed just like a man they ah show us films just in case but ive never been at ground zero its pretty great she laughed perfectly able to read his thoughts dont worry ill hold your hand they passed the time in the big airy birthing room telling stories giving advice joking with zack once mikhail and nick arrived with rachels things griff was happily settled in with zacks cook rio so there was little to do but wait when rachel felt like walking they took turns leading her around the corridors rubbing her back making small talk to take her mind off the discomfort between contractions i can see your mind working alex murmured to bess how can i use this its ingrained she murmured her thanks when he passed her his cold drink your family she said glancing around the room ive never known anyone like them my parents theyd be appalled to be expected to take part in something like this its our baby too she smiled and lifted a hand to his cheek thats what i mean youre all very special im glad youre here as he leaned over to kiss her yuri slapped him on the back now all my children make babies but you he wiggled his brows at bess you start soon yes papa not sure how to take besss chuckle alex rose and spoke firmly and quietly in his mother tongue when i decide to make babies ill let you know what decide yuri gestured toward bess shes the one you want isnt she yes now yuri gestured expansively with both hands then i have my reasons for waiting theyre my reasons though the shake of yuris head was a gesture of sadness there was a twinkle in his eye how is it all my children are so stubborn how is it my papa is so nosy with a laugh yuri embraced alex and kissed both his cheeks go take this pretty girl for a walk steal some kisses your sister will be some time yet thats advice ill take he reached for besss hand and pulled her to her feet come on lets get some air alexi bess had to quicken her pace to keep up with him dont be angry with him he didnt mean to embarrass you yes he did but im not angry with him what were you two rattling on about he punched the button for the elevator you know i dont think ill teach you any ukrainian it comes in too handy but its rude he finished for her grinning i know by the time they came back again alex had taken his fathers advice to heart besss head was still spinning when they walked past the waiting room it was alex who spotted nick pacing and smoking in the smoking lounge like the cliche expectant daddy hows it going kid its been an awfully long time nicks hand shook a bit as he lifted the cigarette to his lips i mean sydney was only in a couple of hours for griff its getting really intense and rachel kicked me and the camera out how come they dont do something i dont know a lot about it alex mused but i think babies come when theyre ready its only been a little more than six hours bess moved in to soothe touched that nick should have such deep concern for his sisterinlaw feels like six days zack commented as he staggered in he plucked the cigarette from nicks hand and took a deep drag shes swearing at me i know what some of those names are now even if they arent in english thats a good sign bess assured him it means things are moving along she swore at the doctor too with a sigh he passed the cigarette back to nick but she didnt take a swing at him if she missed alex commented she must be in really bad shape wincing zack rubbed his shoulder she didnt id better get back lets go give him some support alex began but then he spotted a woman rushing off the elevator tash oh alex bess watched the woman fly into the waiting room gypsy hair flowing there was concern in her eyes and laughter on her lips as she swung into alexs arms alexi how is rachel swearing at her doctor and punching zack ah she relaxed instantly thats good nick she held out a hand for his dont look so worried your niece or nephew will be along soon spence is parking the car we were going to leave the children but they were so disappointed we brought them freddies looking forward to seeing you nick brightened a bit hows she doing shes taller than me now and so pretty alex wheres rachel ill take you oh this is bess bess natasha turned one hand still on her brothers arm of course shed heard about bess west virginia might be a fair distance from new york but family business traveled fast on phone wires im sorry i didnt realize thats all right youve got a lot on your mind and then bess said the first thing that came to hers what fabulous genes you all have natashas brows lifted then below them her eyes lit with laughter rachel said i would like you i hope we have time to talk before we leave town im sorry to rush off dont worry about it i think nick and ill go to the cafeteria rustle up some food for this group three hours later bess had delivered sandwiches and coffee bounced natashas youngest daughter katie on her knee and introduced herself to spence kimball and helped him entertain his very cranky son shed met freddie and noted that the pretty pixielike teenager was deep in puppy love with nick as time dragged on she added her support when mikhail pressured his very tired wife to rest in the waiting room took a fewminutes to interrogate some nurses to help her beef up some hospital scenes and soothed alexs nerves as his sisters labor reached the final stages it wont be much longer thats what they said an hour ago they were standing in the waiting room alex refused to sit after a yawn and a good stretch bess wrapped her arms around him shes fully dilated and the baby was crowning the last glance i had of the fetal monitor showed a really strong heartbeat a fast one i think its a girl how do you know so much research she settled her head on his shoulder i was figuring earlier that ive delivered twelve babies including one set of twins in a matter of speaking when her voice slurred he tipped up her chin youre asleep on your feet mcnee i should have sent you home you couldnt have pried me away no that was true he realized it was just one more aspect to her beauty i owe you then pay up she lifted her mouth sighing into the kiss mama though hed enjoyed watching his brother mikhail shot to his feet when he spotted his parents in the doorway we have a new member of the family there were tears in nadias eyes and in yuris as he stood with his arm tight around his wife what is it nick and alex demanded together you will come see they bring the baby to the glass in a moment rachel is resting yuri dashed away a tear you will kiss her good night soon they trooped out together to wait by the nursery window for the first glimpse im an uncle nick said to freddie the girls cheeks turned pink as he gave her a hard hug hey theres zack he kept his arm around her as his brother walked forward holding a tiny bundle the bundle was squalling and zack was grinning from ear to ear he held the baby up atop the curling black hair was a bright pink bow its a girl alex murmured and held bess hard against him shes beautiful man was the best nick could do oh man overcome for a moment he glanced down and found himself looking at freddie who was still tucked under his arm he drew back brushed a fingertip along her cheek and caught a tear on the tip whats this its just so sweet freddies eyelashes were spiky and her eyes swam as she looked up at him he thought for a moment an uncomfortable moment that it would be easy to drown in those eyes yeah its great he let out a careful breath she was his cousin he reminded himself well a kind of cousin and she was hardly more than a kid i ah dont have a handkerchief or anything its all right freddie felt a drop roll down her cheek but she didnt mind after all these were the very best kind of tears do you ever think about having babies she asked with disarming candor having nick would have stepped back then way back but the family was crowding him in no he said firmly and made himself look away from her damp glowing face no way i do she sighed and let her head rest against his arm mikhail was whispering something to sydney that had her nodding and wiping away tears behind freddie natasha shifted katie in her arms and turned to her husband he had one hand on freddies shoulder and his sleeping son lay curved on his own every one is a miracle he bent his head to kiss her damp cheeks just say the word anytime you decide youd like another miracle of our own i am a man blessed yuri grabbed the closest body it happened to be besss and she found herself whirled in a circle two grandsons now three granddaughters he tossed bess up she came down laughing gripping his shoulders congratulations she pleased him enormously by kissing him firmly on the mouth grandpapa its a good day he reached in his pocket have a cigar chapter contents prev next rosalie considered herself an excellent judge of people and she had already decided bess was one strange lady but she kept coming back sure the money was good rosalie thought as she sat drinking a diet soda in besss basement office and for a woman with a retirement plan that had to be number one yet it was more than making an extra buck that kept her taking the trip up and across town several days each week more too that kept her hanging around after they finished what bess liked to call consulting sessions rosalie was human enough to get a charge out of being connected however remotely to the entertainment world she couldnt deny that shed been excited awed and impressed when she watched a couple of tapings but there was another factor a much more basic one rosalie enjoyed besss company besides being a strange lady bess had class rosalie didnt figure a person had to possess class to recognize it in another class wasnt just a matter of pedigree though shed discovered bess had one it was more than having an old lady in the dar or an old man in whos who it was hazier than that though rosalie couldnt quite come up with the terms she wanted she had recognized in bess those rare and often nebulous qualities grace and compassion she was procrastinating over taking the trip back downtown by dawdling over her drink bess didnt seem to mind if rosalie hung around while she worked in the few weeks since theyd hooked up rosalie had noted that bess worked hard and long harder in rosalies opinion than she herself or any of the other ladies in her profession certainly besss hours were longer it amused rosalie to compare the two in fact she and bess had gotten into a very interesting discussion on the similarities and differences between besss selling her mind and rosalie her body what a kick that had been rosalie thought now while bess typed and mumbled philosophical discussions werent the norm in rosalies world the simple term she had not quite grasped for their relationship was friendship they had become friends how late you gonna work rosalie asked and bess glanced up absently from the computer screen oh not much longer her eyes were still slightly unfocused when she blew her hair away from them brock was on the verge of seducing jessica i just had this idea for a little twist on a scene for tomorrow she smiled then it was quick and a little wicked of course several members of the cast are going to want to murder me when i toss this at them in the morning but thats show biz rosalie took a drag on her cigarette what time did you get in here this morning today about ninethirty i was she thought of alex running a little late lips pursed rosalie looked at the fake designer watch on her wrist and its after seven now her grin flashed girlfriend youd only put in half that many hours in my line of work yeah but i get to sit down bess rubbed at the dull ache in the back of her neck she really was going to have to work on her posture hungry she asked want to order something in with a little tug of regret rosalie stabbed out the cigarette no i gotta get to work too you could take the night off casually bess ran a finger lightly over the keyboard maybe we could catch a movie chuckling rosalie dug in her purse for a mirror to check her makeup you said you werent going to try to reform me i lied bess sat back in her chair while rosalie painted her mouth bloodred shed tried very hard not to pontificate not to pressure not to preach and thought she had succeeded but she hadnt tried not to care that would have been useless i really worry about you especially since the last murder the odd twisting in rosalies stomach had her shifting her eyes from her compact mirror to bess she couldnt remember if anyone had ever worried about her before certainly not in years didnt i tell you i could take care of myself yes but no buts about it honey with a second dip into her purse rosalie pulled out a stiletto one flick of the wrist and the long razorsharp blade zipped out what i cant handle this can bess managed to close her mouth but her eyes stayed riveted to the knife in the overhead lights it gleamed silver bright as sudden death she couldnt say it was elegant but it was fascinating deathly fascinating can i with a shrug of her shoulders rosalie passed the weapon to her dont mess with the blade she warned its as sharp as it looks bess took a good grip on the handle twisting her wrist this way and that like a fencer she wondered if jade josie might carry one she was already imagining a scene where the tormented jade found the knife maybe with the blade smeared with blood in one of her practical handbags no her briefcase better have you ever not yet rosalie held out a hand to take it back but theres always a first time she pressed the button and the blade whisked away again so dont loose any sleep over me after dropping the weapon back into her bag she took out an atomizer and sprayed scent generously on her skin the air bloomed with roses couple more months ill have enough put away im going to be spending the winter in the florida sunshine while you slog through duty snow she rose tugging her tight offtheshoulder top provocatively down so that the rise of her breasts swelled invitingly over it see you around wait bess scrambled through her own purse and came up with her mini recorder if it wont bother your ethics i thought you might use this at rosalies wry glance besss cheeks heated i dont mean to record that part just the streets conversations with the other women maybe a couple of ah transactions youre the boss taking the recorder rosalie slipped it away be careful bess added though she knew rosalie would laugh she did sending a last cocky look over her bare shoulder girlfriend im always careful still chuckling rosalie headed down the narrow corridor toward the freight elevator she was already picturing the way besss eyes would pop out when she listened to the tape and discovered that her consultant had recorded everything the prospect of pulling such a fine joke had her grinning as the doors slid open her amusement died a quick death when alex walked off while they eyed each other with mutual suspicion alex pressed two fingers to the door open button hows the moonlighting going rosalie it passes the time when she started past him he raised an arm to block the elevator opening what do you know about crystal larue i know shes dead rosalie fisted a hand on her hip cocked it something else you want alex let her see that her snide invitation only amused him what do you know about her before she was dead nothing she would have given him the same answer if shed been crystals most intimate friend but as it was she was telling the simple truth i never met her heard she was new didnt have a man yet now i heard that too alex said conversationally and i heard that bobby wanted to make her one of his wives maybe bobby likes to start them young alex struggled with his disgust shed been seventeen he thought a runaway who hadnt know the rules and would never have a chance to learn them did bobby roust her put on the pressure cant say cant say or wont rosalie opened the hand on her hip and began to drum her fingers there listen i dont know what bobby did ive been keeping out of his way lately saying nothing alex studied her face the bruising had faded seems to me bess is paying you enough that you could stay out of his way altogether thats my business and hers alex said evenly i dont want him finding out about this sideline of yours and going after her his eyes were cold and passionless then id have to kill him you think id turn bobby on to her arrogance was sidelined as fury snapped into rosalies voice i owe her what respect she said with an innate and graceful dignity that had alex softening she had me eat at her table she even said i could stay in her extra bedroom like a guest her lips thinned at alexs expression dont sweat it honey i didnt take her up on it sure shes paying me and maybe you dont think thats any different than me taking money from some slob off the street but she treats me like somebody not some thing somebody embarrassed by her own vehemence she shrugged she doesnt have the sense not to shes got sense all right not all good alexs lips twitched even as rosalies did maybe she hasnt gone so wrong here i just dont want her hurt neither do i rosalie tapped a scarlet nail on his chest you got a bad case cop stars in your eyes the little wisp of envy came and went almost unnoticed make sure you keep them in hers or youll answer to me his grin flashed before he could prevent it the charm of it nearly had rosalie changing her mind about cops yes maam like bess he wanted to say something that would stop her from going back on the streets unlike bess he accepted that there was nothing that would do it maybe i see why shes so stuck on you when he moved his blocking arm she stepped into the elevator turned you be good to her stanislaski she deserves good the elevator doors clunked shut alex stood studying them a moment before he turned and wandered down the corridor to find bess she was bent over the keys rapping out a machinegun fire of words onto the monitor her fingers moved like lightning but her eyes were far away in millbrook he thought smiling to himself she had her legs crossed under her up on the chair the way her shoulders were hunched he imagined her muscles would complain loudly the moment she came back to earth she was wearing a skirt again a little leather number in bold blue that was hiked high up on her thighs the hotpink blouse shed tucked into it should have clashed with her hair but it didnt the blouse looked like silk and was carelessly shoved up to her elbows a halfdozen gold bracelets clanged at her wrist as she worked rings flashed on her fingers and the big gypsy hoops she wore at her ears peeked out of her tousled hair his heart ached with love for her and his loins alex let out a little breath he wanted quite simply to devour her inch by delicious inch what the hell was he going to do he wondered when she tried to slither out of his life he was sure she would as shed done with others before he could lock her up carry her off he could beg or threaten he already knew he would do whatever he had to in order to keep her in his life what had ever made him think he would one day find some nice pretty woman with simple tastes and a quiet style someone who would be content to sit home while he worked his crazy hours who would have and help him raise the houseful of children he so badly wanted with bess nothing was simple nothing was quiet she would never be content to sit home but would badger him incessantly picking at him until he gave in and talked about the darker aspects of his work those pieces of his life that he wanted to keep locked away from everyone who mattered as for children he didnt know how the devil to get and keep a ring on her finger much less ask her to help make a family being in love with her left him helpless made him stupid brought him a kind of fear hed never faced as a cop not fear for his life fear for his heart he could only take his own advice and leave things as they were handle each day until she was so used to him shed want to stay as he watched she stopped typing lifted a hand to her neck for a quick impatient rub her skirt hiked higher as she shifted it took all his control not to lick his lips she punched a few buttons had the machine clicking a moment later the printer beside her began to hum with a smile on his face and lust in his heart alex closed the door quietly at his back locked it she jumped like a rabbit when his hands came down on her shoulders didnt anyone ever teach you to sit in a chair alexi she pressed a hand to her galloping heart you scared oh her sigh was long and heartfelt as he massaged away the aches thats wonderful youre going to do permanent damage if you keep sitting like that all day i was planning on soaking in a hot tub for two or three days she leaned into his hands wheres lori she wasnt feeling too terrific as the printer continued to rattle bess closed her eyes i told her i was leaving too then i snuck back i wanted to make a few changes for tomorrow she brought her hand up to one of his skimming her fingers over it to the wrist you said you might have to work late lead fizzled well work on tracing the heart necklace down but thats better during business hours trace it down hit the jewelers he explained see if we can track down to when it was bought long shot but do you think the heart has a personal meaning for him like some woman broke his heart so he gives them a symbol of it before he whacks them he gave a little grunt as he continued to knead her muscles its a little too obvious to dismiss psychiatric profile figures him as sexually inadequate on a normal level so he pays for women to perform he wants them and detests himself for that as much as he detests them for being available the fact that he goes through a short courtship routine shows that he broke off as she reached for a pad hold on mcnee he gave her shoulders a hard squeeze i dont know how you do it one minute im thinking about getting you out of these clothes and the next youve got me talking about a case he pressed a kiss to the top of her head no notes her fingers retreated from the pad but with obvious reluctance i like hearing you talk about your work i want you to be able to talk to me about anything apparently i can even the stuff i dont want you to hear ive got a problem with you bess you wont let me tuck you into that nice safe comer where i want you to be you only think thats where you want me to be smiling she tugged his hand around so that she could kiss it you like me right where i am turning his hand over she pressed her lips to his palm im going to stay there she felt his fingers tense then relax slowly as he spread them over her cheek i was watching you while you worked a rippling thrill raced through her at the words and at the shimmer of desire she heard in them were you and thinking his hands slid down over her breasts sampled their weight molded them fantasizing her head fell back against the chair her breathing quickened about the things id like to do with you through layers of silk he caught her nipples tugging gently to you when she tried to shift in the chair to face him he increased the pressure held her still her dazzled eyes focused on the monitor she could still see the ghost of herself there and his hands moving sliding stroking impossibly erotic to see and to feel drymouthed she watched his fingers undo her buttons and saw the dark shadow of his hair as he pressed a hot mouth to her throat she lifted a hand hooked it around his neck as she tilted her head to offer more i can shut down in thirty seconds he bit her lightly just above the collarbone im not going to give you a chance to shut down she laughed shakily even as she lifted her other arm to capture him in a reverse embrace i meant the computer he would have laughed himself but hed stopped breathing i know what you meant but i he slipped a hand under her skirt and it was so sudden so searing before she could gasp out in shock he had driven her ruthlessly to the peak i watched you each word burned his throat as she poured into his hand i wanted you half demented he whipped her up again pressing his face into her neck as her body shuddered shuddered do you remember the first time i found you here what she couldnt remember her own name there was only this need he was ruthlessly building inside her again alexi please come home with me i need this time she cried out as the third high hard wave swamped her i wanted you then in one violent move he spun her chair around and dragged her to her feet and her already weakened system went limp at what she read in his face let me show you exactly what i wanted this wasnt the smooth and patient lover of the night before this man with the fierce eyes and bruising hands wouldnt cuddle her and whisper exotic endearments this was the warrior shed only glimpsed he would plunder whether or not she was ready he was showing her that dark reckless side of him that he kept so tightly controlled in the moment when he stared at her the look in his eyes hot and concentrated she understood that excitement took a twist into the primitive when it carried a touch of fear he fisted a hand in her hair and yanked her against him his body was like rock vibrating from deep within as if from an erupting volcano for that moment there was only the strength and the fury of the inevitable his mouth burned over hers his tongue diving deep while his free hand tugged the snap of her skirt free he wanted her flesh craved it that heated silk those alluring curves and taut muscles time and place had lost all impact there was only here only now only her shivery fingers of fear ran up her spine she hadnt known what it was to be wanted this way it was so huge so violent so glorious before he had given her more than she had ever dreamed of now he seemed compelled to give her more than she had ever dared dream beside them the printer stopped its practical clatter and dropped into a hum the low waiting sound was drowned out by the thundering of her heart the bright working lights overhead seemed to dim as he took her hips and pressed her hard against him you make a war inside me he muttered as his teeth scraped roughly down her throat theres no end to it no peace from it say my name i want to hear you say my name alexi when his lips crushed down on hers again he felt her breathe it warm into his mouth take me now the wild need slammed into her so that her mouth was as turbulent her hands as frantic dozens of tiny explosions burst inside her body merging into one huge tumult of sensation that battered bruised and bewitched she was all but sobbing with it as she tugged and pulled at his clothes she was quivering for him couldnt stop the power and pressure growing inside her was all but unbearable and the heat the furnace blast of heat had her skin slicked and her head spinning glorying in it she brought her mouth to his bare shoulder savoring the taste of flesh his busy bruising hands had her bearing down with teeth and nails his breath hissed in her ear as she reached down to curl impatient fingers around him confused and tangled phrases whirled in his mind he heard them burst from his lips to hang on the thick air as he fought to catch his breath on an oath he gripped her shoulders and hauled her back her face was flushed her eyes were glowing hed marked that ivory skin he could see where his fingers had pressed where his roughened cheeks had scraped but the part of him that would have been shocked by his lack of care was far overshadowed by a dark and desperate desire to conquer to consume to mate he saw them now as brands signs that made her his only his with a jerk of his head he tossed his hair back the way it swayed and settled had new emotion burning her throat naked muscles bunched as if to fight he looked so magnificent he dazzled her eyes then he looked at her and the smile that had nearly formed on her face froze into wonder no one makes you feel like this but me his accent had thickened and the sound of it sent chills along her heated skin she could only shake her head no one touches you like me he took his hands from her shoulders and gripped the bodice of her chemise no one has you ever again but me alexi but he shook his head he could feel her heart pounding under his hands and his own chest was heaving understand me youre mine now her eyes widened with shock as he jerked his hands and ripped the chemise in half all of you he pushed her back against the table watching the play of stunned excitement over her face yes he wanted to excite her and shock her stagger her his fingers dug into her hips as he lifted her he was braced straining like a stallion at the bit hold on to me he demanded but her fluttering hands slid off his sweatslick arms his breath heaved out his fingers dug into her smooth taut flesh hold she met his eyes then and felt that wild whip of power drunk on it she gripped his hair and wrapped her legs around him when he plunged inside her her body arched back absorbing that first rocketing flash of heat it was like being consumed from the inside out she felt the cool surface of the table against her back first then his weight on her greedy for more she tightened around him matching his fast frantic rhythm dragging his mouth back to hers so that they could echo the intimacy with their tongues he lost himself there was only her now and the need to possess her the desperate craving to be possessed by her images reeled through his brain all dark and sharpedged until he thought he would go mad and went mad in a frenzy of movement he dragged her farther onto the table crushing papers knocking aside empty cups scattering pencils he couldnt take his eyes from her face the way her eyes clouded like fog over moss the way her lips trembled with each gasping breath there was a bloom on her skin now a rose under glass he was hammering himself into her empowered by a rabid fury of emotion that had its razortipped fingers around his throat too much she thought frantically never enough the harsh overhead lights fractured into rainbows that blinded her eyes they seemed to arch around his head but she didnt think of angels his eyes were so dark so fiercely focused even as her own grew leaden she refused to close them oh to watch him wanting her taking her she couldnt understand the words he murmured over and over again but she understood what was in those eyes they were tearing each other apart and they couldnt stop the animal had taken over and it had diamondsharp claws and jagged teeth there was nothing left but the sound of their mixed labored breathing the solid slap of flesh against flesh and the heady scent of hot desperate sex she felt his body go rigid felt the rippling muscles in the arms she gripped turn to stone he groaned out her name as his eyes sharpened like daggers when he poured himself into her she cried out in triumph then again in wonder as he drove her over that crumbling edge with him the strength that had screamed through him switched off like a light and he collapsed panting his full weight on her fighting for breath he wallowed in her hair drawing in the scent of it and the fragrance theyd made together he couldnt find his center the focus that was so vital for survival he no longer had one without her god he could feel her vibrating beneath him shuddering from the aftershocks and there were tears mixed with the dew of sweat on her face with breath still burning his lungs he levered himself on his elbows and shook his head to try to clear it at the movement she made a small whimpering sound in her throat that both aroused and dismayed trying to find the gentleness that had always been so easy for him he shifted their positions and began to stroke her hair her shoulders her back murmuring apologies he cradled her like a child milaya im sorry i hurt you i must have hurt you dont cry im not crying but of course she was he could feel the tears fall even as she ran kisses over his face and throat just tell me you love me please tell me you love me i love you shh he covered her mouth tenderly with his you know i love you i love you she pressed those wet shaky kisses to his cheeks to his jaw you have to believe that i love you a hot fist clenched in his gut but he kept his hands gentle just let me hold you tearing up again she pressed her face to his shoulder even now you dont believe me alexi what more can i do i believe you but they both knew he said it only to comfort you belong to me i believe that youre everything i want she relaxed against him satisfied that he would take that much no more tears no he tilted her chin up to search her face how badly did i hurt you i dont think the results will be in for days she smiled a little how badly did i hurt you his eyes narrowed and her smile widened youre not upset about what i was an animal with a hand that had yet to steady he brushed her tumbled hair out of her face i took you on a table like a lunatic i know after one long satisfied sigh she slid her body lazily over his it was wonderful yes guilt began to turn to pride you liked it after being so thoroughly ravished it wasnt difficult to stroke his ego it was like being dragged off by some barbarian i couldnt even understand what you were saying it was exciting she kissed his cheek frightening and the other it was also the most erotic experience of my life you were crying alexi she touched a hand to his face you didnt just overpower me you overwhelmed me no ones ever made me feel more wanted more irresistible i cant resist you but im sorry i put bruises on you i dont mind under the circumstances after another luxurious sigh she glanced around the room i dont know how ill ever work in here again though now he grinned wickedly maybe itll inspire you there is that she shifted to straddle him and watched his sleepy eyes skim down to her breasts and back possibilities she thought there were definite possibilities in that look being a cop i imagine youve been through arduous physical training the possibilities had occurred to him as well absolutely and youd probably have amazing recuperative powers his brow lifted under the right conditions good to be certain she created them she ran her hands over his stillgleaming chest with a half laugh he caught her wrists mcnee wouldnt you rather pick this up in bed for an answer she leaned over letting her lips hover a breath away from his the tip of her tongue darted out to trace the shape of his mouth to dip teasingly inside then retreat slowly she tilted her head softly she tasted his lips achingly achingly she deepened the kiss does that give you a clue detective chapter contents prev next i cant believe you want to spend the best part of a saturday morning in a sweaty gym alex was stalling even as he walked with bess up the iron steps that led to rockys its your sweaty gym bess said and kissed him the past few days had been almost like a honeymoon she thought if she took out the hours theyd both been at work but theyd made the most of what time theyd had together snuggling on the couch in her place cooking a meal in his wrestling in bed in both she was starting to hope that he believed she loved him and once he did she wanted nothing more than for them to take that next step the step that would lead to an authentic honeymoon with all the trimmings you picked me up at my gym yesterday she pointed out that wasnt a gym there was the faintest trace of a masculine sneer in his voice that was an exercise palace fancy lighting pipedin music all those mirrors at least ill be able to see when my butt starts to drop he gave it a friendly pat ill let you know do and die she said smartly and pushed through the frosted glass doors she immediately thought of every bad boxing film shed ever seen the huge room echoed with grunts and slaps and thumps it smelled of mildew and sweat and she took a testing sniff and decided she didnt want to know what else there were exposed pipes along the ceilings and walls and there was a hardwood floor that looked as though it had been gouged by spikes the boxing ring that was set up in one corner was already occupied by two compact dancing men in tiny shorts who were trying to pop each other in the eye a trio of punching bags hung at strategic points a halfnaked man with a body like a cement truck was currently trying to whip the tar out of one of them weights were being employed as well she watched tendons bulge and muscles bunch they didnt worry about mirrors and lighting here nor did she spot any of the hightech equipment she was accustomed to this was downanddirty squat sweat and punch she sincerely doubted there would be a juice bar in the vicinity either had enough alex asked he was obviously amused at the thought of her stripping down to her leotard and having a go with the boys bess closed her mouth then answered his grin with a cool stare i havent even started yet it was his turn to drop his jaw when she peeled off her sweatshirt beneath she wore a snug lowcut crop top in zigzagging stripes of green and purple as she shimmied out of her baggy street shorts he shoved the discarded shirt in front of her come on bess put your clothes on sweet lord the bottom half was worse over formfitting tights she had on a teeny strip of spandex that covered little more than a gstring you cant wear that in here is it illegal she bent over to stuff her sweats into her gym bag and heard the heavy thump of weights as they were dropped maintaining position she turned her head and smiled at the popeyed man staring at her the catcalls and whistles started immediately the sound swelling and bouncing off the cinderblock walls alex was very much afraid there would be a riot one he was likely to incite himself damn it put something on before i have to kill somebody they look harmless she straightened again and lifted her arms to tie the short curls at the nape of her neck into a stubby ponytail anyway i came to work out with a challenging grin she flexed a muscle how much can you benchpress mcnee dont you dare he broke off with an oath as she blithely strolled across the room to chat with the weight lifter the two hundred pounds of muscle began to babble like a teenager alex had no choice but to send out a warning snarl much as a guard dog might to a pack of encroaching wolves before he went after her she pulled it off of course he should have known she would the men started out drooling kicked over into laughing and finally wound up competing with each other to show her the proper way to perform squat lifts chinups and leg curls before an hour was over shed been shown pictures of wives and children listened to sob stories over sweethearts and stopped being ogled unless it was at a discreet distance you sure you want to do this alex asked again tapping his gloved hands together absolutely she smiled at rocky as he himself laced up her gloves i couldnt leave without one sparring match you watch out for his left its a good one rocky advised her kid couldve been a contender if he hadnt wanted to be a cop she winked at rocky ive got fast feet he wont lay a glove on me two of her new admirers held open the ropes for her so that she could step into the ring enjoying the sensation she adjusted her padded helmet arent we supposed to wear those funny retainers the what oh mouth guards he couldnt resist and he leaned over and kissed her to an accompaniment of hoots baby im not going to hit you in a friendly gesture he tapped his gloves to hers okay put your hands up when she did lifting them toward the ceiling he rolled his eyes its not an arrest mcnee patiently he adjusted her hands until they were in a defensive position now you want to guard see keep your left up keep it up if i come in like this he did a slowmotion jab at her jaw you block jab back thats it and i fake with my left she said and did so if you want lord she was sweet now try for here he tapped his own chin go ahead you dont have to pull it when she punched halfheartedly he shook his head no you punch like a girl put your body behind it pretend im dawn gallagher her eyes lit and she swung fullout only to come up solidly against his block hey thats good impressed she swung again but ive got to move around right fake you out with my grace and fancy footwork she did a quick boogie that had the onlookers clapping and alex grinning at her you got style lets work on it he was enjoying himself showing her the moves and it certainly didnt hurt for a woman living in the city to learn how to defend herself with something more than an ammoniafilled water pistol its fun she ducked her head as hed shown her and tried two quick jabs with her left always room for another flyweight rocky called out to her come on bess body blow chuckling she aimed for alexs midsection and dodged his light tap toward her chin you look so cute in gym shorts she murmured dont try to distract me well you do she danced around him again and laughing he turned toward her okay that ought to he ended on a grunt when she connected hard with his jaw and set him down on his butt oh god she crouched instantly battering his face with her gloves as she tried to stroke it oh alexi im sorry did i hurt you he wiggled his jaw sending her a dark look right cross he muttered as men climbed through the ropes to cheer and hold besss arms in the air im really sorry bess said again as they started down the iron steps but she was fingering the little bit of tarnished metal rocky had pinned with some ceremony to her sweatshirt you said not to pull my punches i know what i said hed be lucky if he didnt have a bruise alex thought and how the hell would he explain that you only got through because i was finished she ran her tongue over her teeth and stepped outside uhhuh dont get smart with me mcnee he snatched her up and swung her around or ill demand a rematch wildly in love she tossed her arms around his neck anytime oh yeah how about he trailed off with a grimace as his beeper sounded sorry its all right she only sighed a little as he tracked down a phone and called in as she stood beside him watching his face listening to his terse comments she realized that their plans for a picnic in the park and some casual shopping were about to go bust you have your cops face on she said when he hung up do you have to go in yeah but he didnt tell her theyd found another victim it was bad enough that he was spoiling their plans for the day its probably going to take a while im really sorry bess look she framed his face with her hands i understand this is part of it he brought those hands to his lips i but he didnt tell her he loved her because she would echo the words and it made him nervous to hear them i appreciate it he said instead and ill make it up to you tell you what why dont i finish up what i have to do then stop by the market ill make dinner something that wont spoil if it has to be wanned up a couple of times though his mind was already drifting away from her he managed a pained smile youre going to cook im not that bad im not she insisted with a bit of a huff when he grinned i only burned the potatoes the other night because you kept distracting me i guess its the least i can do he kissed her lightly once then again longer ill try to call if you can she waved him off then stood watching while he jogged down into the subway with a quick laugh she spun around hugging herself she felt just like a cops wife i hope you dont mind me dropping by of course not rachel took a look at the bulging shopping bags in besss hands been busy whenever i get started with that little plastic card i cant seem to stop she dumped her purchases inside the apartment door you look wonderful how can you look wonderful less than a week after going through childbirth strong genes pleased in general and with bess in particular rachel kissed her on both cheeks come sit down thanks i oops she dipped into the bag and pulled out a gold foiled candy box for mom oh rachels eyes took on the glow a womans get when she looks at a lover or a fivepound box of exclusive chocolates i think you just became my best friend chuckling bess dug into the bags again well i know that people tend to drop by with baby gifts she held out a box wrapped in snowy white with bright red lollipops scattered over it and though i couldnt resist the tradition i figured you deserved something really sinful for yourself i do rachel tucked the baby box under her other arm its really sweet of you bess and unnecessary you and alex already brought brenna that wonderful stuffed dragon that was from us this is from me its a girl thing i saw this tiny little white organdy dress with all these flounces and little pink bows and i couldnt resist rachels newmothers heart melted really i figure in another year she might want to wear motorcycle boots so this may be your only chance to play dressup i swore that whatever i had i wouldnt make sexist decisions in dress or attitude she sighed over the box white organdy six flounces i counted i cant wait to put her in it ah company mikhail strode out of the bedroom with brenna tucked in his arm hello aunt bess he kissed both of her cheeks then her mouth you said you wouldnt wake her up this from rachel who was already leaning over to coo i didnt exactly whats this recognizing the gold foil box he flipped it open and dived in mine rachel said in a huff if you eat more than one ill break your fingers she was always greedy he said over the first piece wheres alexi he got called in good now you have time to sit down ill sketch you now womanlike bess lifted a hand to her hair im not exactly dressed for it i want your face obviously well used to making himself at home he opened the drawer on an end table and rummaged for a pad perhaps ill do your body later its a good one her laugh was quick thanks you might as well cooperate rachel told her and crossed over to take the baby once the artist in htm takes over you havent got a chance im flattered really theres no reason to be he said absently as he unearthed a suitable pencil you have the face you were bom with thank god thats not always true that caught his interest you had it fixed no i just sort of grew into it not there he told her before bess could sit over there closer to the window in the light rachel when do i get the drink you promised me on its way she stopped nuzzling brenna long enough to look up what can i get you bess anything cold and a shot at holding the baby i can accommodate you on both counts rachel laid her daughter gently in besss arms she hardly ever cries and i think her eyes may stay blue like zacks shes a beauty bess leaned down to brush her lips over the curling dark hair and to draw in the indescribably sweet scent of baby like all of you move mikhail ordered his sister youre in my way shooting off a mild ukrainian insult she headed for the kitchen talk if you like mikhail gestured with his pencil and began to sketch its one of my best things shed already forgotten to be selfconscious wheres sydney and griff griff has the sniffles the pencil was moving with quick deft strokes over the pad sydney fusses over him but she says im fussing over him and sends me out on errands which he does by coming by and plaguing me rachel called out shes happy to see me mikhail said because shes lonely with zack and nick over checking on the progress of the new apartment oh thats right youre moving comfortable bess tucked up her legs alexi mentioned it we need a bigger place of course it was supposed to be ready a month ago but things never run on time ill miss this one she said coming back in with a tray of cold drinks and having nick underfoot but i imagine hell like having this place to himself bess reached for her drink with her free hand gently jiggling the baby with the other i guess he had as big a crush on you as freddie has on him for a moment rachel only stared then she let out her breath in a quiet laugh alex said you saw things just part of the job rachel didnt consider herself a slouch in the readingpeople department so how big a crush do you have on alexi the biggest bess smiled and rubbed her cheek over brennas he thinks im flighty fickle but im not not with him why would he think that i have a varied track record but its different with him when bess lowered her head to murmur to the baby rachel glanced at her brother they exchanged a great deal without uttering a word it makes me envy people like your sister natasha bess went on those three beautiful children a husband who after years together still looks at her as if he cant believe she belongs to him work she loves i envy all that youd like a family i never had one rachel knew it was the lawyer in her but she couldnt help moving along the line of questioning does it bother you that hes a cop bother me besss brows lifted in surprise no do you mean will i worry i suppose i will but its not something i could change or that i want to change i love who he is hes making you sad mikhail said quietly no besss denial was quick enough to startle the dozing baby she soothed her automatically as she shook her head no of course he isnt i see whats in your eyes he would she realized and felt the warmth creep into her cheeks its only that i know he doesnt trust me my feelings or i suppose the endurance of my feelings its not his fault he was always one to pick things apart there was brotherly disgust in mikhails voice never one to take anything on faith ill speak to him oh no this time she laughed hed be furious with both of us all that slavic pride and male ego instantly mikhails eyes narrowed whats wrong with that nothing she grinned at rachel not a thing ill just wear him down in my own way in fact im going to start tonight im cooking dinner i thought maybe i could call your mother find out if he has a favorite dish i can tell you that rachel offered anything well that certainly widens my choices do you think shed mind if i called her asked for some pointers my kitchen skills are moderate at best shed love it rachel smiled to herself knowing her mother would hang up the phone and immediately start planning the wedding it was after midnight when alex let himself into besss apartment with the key shed given him he was punchy with fatigue and his head was buzzing from too much coffee those were usual things as much a part of his work as filing reports or following a lead but the sick weight in his stomach was something new he would have to tell her shed left the television on in an old blackandwhite movie a woman screamed in abject terror and fled down a moonlit beach as he shrugged out of his jacket alex moved across the room to switch it off before he reached the set he saw her curled on the couch shed waited for him the sweetness of that speared through him as he crouched beside her for so many years now hed come home alone to no one gently he brushed the dark red curls from her cheek and replaced them with his lips she stirred murmuring her eyes fluttered open im just going to carry you into bed he whispered go back to sleep alexi she lifted a hand to rub over the cheek he hadnt shaved that morning her voice was thick with sleep her eyes glazed with it what time is it its late you should have gone to bed she made a vague sound of disagreement and pushed up on one elbow i was waiting up but the movie was so bad her laugh was groggy and she rubbed her eyes like a child it zapped me she circled her shoulders before leaning forward to kiss him you had a long day detective yeah and maybe because she was halfasleep he could put off the rest so have you ill cart you in no im okay she sat up yawning did you eat something i caught a sandwich im really sorry i tried to call and got the machine she said with a rueful nod because id forgotten the paprika and had to run back out to the market you cooked the idea both touched him and accented his guilt i amazed myself it felt good to settle against him when he joined her on the couch and slipped an arm around her cozy right and wonderfully simple your mothers recipe for chicken and dumplings hungarianstyle csirke paprikas normally it would have made his mouth water thats a lot of work it was a culinary adventure and the cleaning lady will probably quit on monday after one look at the kitchen she laughed up at him then scrubbed her knuckles over his cheek when she caught the look in his eyes dont worry itll heat up just fine for tomorrows lunch then again she snuggled closer if youre feeling really guilty ill take you up on that ride to the bedroom and whatever else you can think of but instead of chuckling and scooping her up he pushed away to pace to the television and snap it off we have to talk his tone had nerves skittering in her stomach but she nodded all right he thought it might be best for both of them if they had some of the brandy she had offered him during an earlier crisis trying out the words in his head he walked to the lacquered cabinet its bad she murmured and pressed her lips together hard her first thought was that he had changed his mind about her that he had finally taken that good look shed been afraid of and realized his mistake its bad he concurred then brought the snifters to the couch here drink a little its all right i dont make scenes he tilted the brandy toward her lips himself just a little milaya she closed her eyes and did as he asked he couldnt say that sweet word to her in that loving tone if hed changed his mind okay a deep breath and she opened her eyes again there was another murder last night oh alexi instantly the image of crystal larues mangled body flashed behind her eyes oh god she caught his hand in hers and squeezed last night the desk clerk found her this morning they had an arrangement she only used that room for work and he was ticked that she hadnt checked out and slipped him his usual tip he was taking it slow deliberately so that the general horror would pass before he hit her with the specifics again he tipped the brandy up to her lips shed rented the room three times last night he caught a glimpse of the third john when they went up so weve had him looking over mug shots most of the day youll catch him oh yeah theres no doubt about it this time he didnt find the guy in the books but he gave the police artist a fair description well be broadcasting it this time we should have his blood type too dna couple of other things youll have him soon not soon enough bess the woman his fingers tightened on hers but he told her the worst as gently as he knew how it was rosalie she only stared and he watched helpless as the color simply slid out of her face no she was tugging her hand from his but he only held tighter youre wrong you made a mistake i just saw her i just talked to her a couple of days ago theres no mistake his voice toughened for her sake i idd her myself rechecked that with prints and the desk clerks id bess it was rosalie the moan came out brokenly as she wrapped her arms around herself and began to rock dont she said when he tried to gather her close dont dont dont she sprang up needing the distance desperate to find something to do with the helpless rage that was building inside her she didnt have to die it isnt right it isnt right for her to die like that its never right it was his tone the cool detachment of it that had her whirling on him but she was just a hooker dont get involved right dont feel anything isnt that what you told me he went very still as if shed pulled a gun and taken aim i guess i did i wanted to help her but you told me i couldnt you told me it was a waste of my time and energy and you were right werent you alexi how fine it must be to always be so right he took the blow what else could he do why dont you sit down bess youll make yourself sick she wanted to break something to smash it but nothing was precious enough i cared damn you i cared about her she wasnt just a story line to me she was a person all she wanted was to go south buy a trailer when her breath began to hitch she covered her mouth with her hands she shouldnt have died like that i wish i could change it the bitter sense of failure turned his voice to ice i wish to god i could before he realized the glass was leaving his hand he was heaving the snifter against the wall how do you know what i felt when i walked into that filthy room and found her like that how the hell do you know what its like to face it and know you couldnt stop it she was a person to me too im sorry the tears that spilled over now spilled for all of them alexi im sorry for what he tossed back it was the truth facts not truth hed tried to soften the blow to cushion her when his own emotions were raw hed needed to comfort his eyes had been dazed with fatigue and pain and the kind of grief she might never understand but hed needed to shield herand she hadnt allowed it hold me please i need you to hold me for a moment she was afraid he wouldnt move then he crossed to her though his arms were rigid with tension they came around her i didnt mean to hurt you she murmured but he only shook his head and stroked her hair grieving she turned her face into his throat i wanted to make it a lie somehow to make you wrong so it could all be wrong she squeezed her eyes closed and held tight she was somebody he stared blankly over her shoulder as he remembered one of the last things rosalie had said to him she treats me like somebody i know youll catch him she said fiercely well catch him well put him away he wont hurt anybody else though her words still scraped against him he rocked her he would tell her the rest and hoped it helped she had a knife i saw it she showed me she used it i dont know how bad she hurt him but she put up a hell of a fight its recorded recorded eyes dull with shock she leaned back my god the tape i gave her my mini recorder i figured as much for whatever consolation it is the fact that you did give it to her and she decided to use it is going to make a difference a big one you heard them she said through dry lips you heard we got everything from the deal on the street until the end dont ask me bess he lifted a hand to cup her face even if i could tell you what was on the tape i wouldnt i wasnt going to ask i dont think i could bear to know what happened in that room calmer now he searched her face ive only got a few hours i have to go in first thing in the morning do you want me to stay with you tonight or would you rather i go shed hurt him more than shed realized perhaps the only way she could heal the wound was to admit and to show him that she needed comfort needed it from him drawing him close she laid her head on his shoulder i want you with me alexi always and tonight i dont think id make it through tonight without you she began to cry then alex picked her up and carried her to the couch where they could lie down and grieve together chapter contents prev judd flexed his hand on the steering wheel as he turned on west seventysixth he wasnt nervous this time he was eager the idea of bringing wilson j tremayne iii a us senators grandson in for questioning in the murders of four women had him chafing at the bit they had him judd thought he knew they had the creep the artists sketch the blood type the voiceprint it had been quick work on that he mused flavored with luck besss tape had been one of those twisted aspects of police work that never failed to fascinate him it was trilwalter whod identified tremayne from the sketch judd remembered that the boss had taken a long hard look at the artists rendering and then ordered alex to the newspaper morgue the desk clerk had picked the reprint of tremaynes newspaper picture from a choice of five from there alex had used a connection at one of the local television stations and had finessed a videotape of tremayne campaigning for his grandfather the lab boys had jumped right on it and had matched the voice to the one on besss tape it still made him queasy to think about what had been on that tape but that was something he didnt want to show to alex just as he knew better than to let alex spot his eagerness now so he said casually you think the yankees have got a shot this year alex didnt even glance over he could all but taste his partners excitement when a cop starts licking his lips he forgets things miranda rights probable cause makes all kinds of little procedural mistakes that help slime ooze out of courtrooms and back onto the street judd clenched his jaw im not licking my lips malloy youll be drooling any minute alex looked over at the beautiful old building while judd hunted up a parking space the gothic touches appealed to him as did the tall narrow windows and the scattering of terrace gardens tremayne lived on the top floor in a plush twolevel condo with a view of the park and a uniformed doorman downstairs he came and went as he pleased wearing his italian suits and his swiss watch and four women were dead dont take it personally alex said when they got out of the car stanislaskis rule number five but judd was getting good very good at reading his partner you want him as bad as i do alex looked over his eyes meeting then locking on judds there wasnt eagerness in them or excitement or even satisfaction they were all cold fury so lets go get the bastard they flashed their badges for the doorman then rode partway up in the elevator with a plump middleaged woman and her yipping schnauzer alex glanced up and spotted the security camera in the corner it might come in handy he thought the da would have to subpoena the tapes for the nights of the murders if they were dated and timed so much the better but if not they would still show tremayne going and coming the schnauzer got off at four they continued on to eight side by side they approached b though the door was thick alex could hear the strains of an aria from aida coming from the apartment hed never cared much for opera but hed liked this particular one he wondered if it would be spoiled for him now he rang the buzzer he had to ring it a second time before tremayne answered alex recognized him it was almost as though they were old friends now that alex had pored over the newspaper shots and stories the videotape and of course he knew his voice knew it when it was calm when it was amused and when it was darkly sickly thrilled dressed in a thick velour robe that matched his chinablue eyes tremayne stood dripping rubbing a thick monogrammed towel over his fair hair wilson j tremayne thats right tremayne glanced pleasantly from face to face he didnt have the street sense to smell cop im afraid youve caught me at a bad time yes sir never taking his eyes off tremaynes alex took out his badge detectives stanislaski and malloy detectives tremaynes voice was bland only mildly curious but alex saw the flicker dont tell me my secretary forgot to pay my parking tickets again youll have to get dressed mr tremayne still watching alex replaced his shield wed like you to come with us with you tremayne eased backward a step judd noted that his hand eased down toward the doorknob closed over it knuckles whitened im afraid that would be very inconvenient i have a dinner engagement youll want to cancel that alex said this may take a while detective stanislaski ah stanislaski do you know who i am because it suited him because he wanted it alex let tremayne see the knowledge i know exactly who you are jack alex allowed himself one quick flash of pleasure at the fear that leaped into tremaynes eyes were going downtown mr tremayne your presence is requested for questioning on the murders of four women mary rodell his voice grew quieter more dangerous on each name angie horowitz crystal larue and rosalie hood youre free to call your attorney this is absurd alex slapped a hand on the door before tremayne could slam it shut we can take you in as you are and give your neighbors a thrill or you can get dressed alex saw the quick panic and was braced even as tremayne turned to run he knew better sure he did but it felt so damn good to bodyslam the man up against that silkpapered wall a small delicate statue tipped from its niche and bounced on the carpet when he hauled tremayne up by the lapels he saw the gold chain the dangling heart with a crack running through it that was the twin of the one they had in evidence and he saw the fresh white bandage that neatly covered the wounds rosalie had inflicted as she fought for her life give me a reason alex leaned in close id love it ill have your badges tears began to leak out of tremaynes eyes as he slid to the floor my grandfather will have your badges in disgust alex stood over him go find him some pants he said to judd ill read him his rights with a nod judd started for the bedroom dont take it personally stanislaski alex glanced over with something that was almost a smile kiss off malloy they had him cold alex thought as he turned into besss building they could call out every fancy lawyer on the east coast and it wouldnt mean a damn thing the physical evidence was overwhelming particularly since theyd found the murder weapon in the nightstand drawer opportunity was unlikely to be a problem and as for motive hed leave that up to the shrinks undoubtedly theyd cop an insanity plea maybe theyd even pull it off one way or the other he was off the streets it went a long way toward easing the bitterness hed felt over rosalies death he hoped it helped bess with her grief hed nearly called her from the station but hed wanted to tell her facetoface as he waited for the elevator he shifted the bunch of lilacs he held maybe it was a weird time to bring her flowers but he thought she needed them stepping into the car he tucked a hand in his pocket and felt the jewelers box it was even a weirder time to propose marriage but he knew he needed it it scared him just how much hed come to depend on having her with him to talk to him to listen to him to make him laugh to make love with him he knew he was rushing things but he justified it by assuring himself that if he got her to marry him quickly enough she wouldnt have time to change her mind she believed she was in love with him after they were committed emotionally and legally he would take as much time as necessary to make certain it was true the elevator opened and alex dug for his keys theyd order in tonight he decided put on some music light some candles he grimaced as he fit the key into the lock no shed probably had that routine before and hed be damned if hed follow someone elses pattern hed have to think of something else he opened the door with his arms full of nodding lilacs his mind racing to think of some clever innovative way to ask bess to be his wife the color went out of his face and turned his eyes to midnight he felt something slam into his chest it was like being shot she was standing in the center of the room her laughter just fading away in another mans arms her mouth just retreating from another mans lips charlie i she heard the sound of the door and turned the bright beaming smile on her face froze then faded away like the laughter alexi i guess i should have knocked his voice was dead calm viciously calm no of course not there were butterflies in her stomach and their wings were razorsharp charlie this is alexi ive told you about him sure think i met you at besss last party lanky longhaired and obviously oblivious to the tension throbbing in the air he gave besss shoulders a squeeze she gives the best alex set the flowers aside one fragile bloom fell from the table and was ignored so ive heard well ive got to be going charlie bent to give bess another kiss alexs hands clenched you wont let me down of course not she worked up a smile grateful that charlie was too preoccupied to sense the falseness of it you know how happy i am for you charlie ill be in touch he went out cheerfully calling out a last farewell before he shut the door in the silence alex noticed the music for the first time violins and flutes whispered out of her stereo very romantic he thought and his teeth clenched like his fists well her eyes were burning dry though her heart was weeping i can see i should explain she walked over to the wine shed poured for charlie and topped off her glass i can also see that youve already made up your mind so explanations would be pointless you move fast bess she was glad she had her back to him for a moment very glad because her hand trembled as she lifted the wine do you think so alexi or maybe youve been seeing him all along you can say that now she turned and the first flashes of anger burst through her you can stand there and say that to me what the hell do you expect me to say he shot back he didnt go near her didnt dare i walk in here and find you with him a little music a nice bottle of wine he wished he had been shot it couldnt possibly hurt more than this bite of betrayal do you think im an idiot no no i dont she needed to sit but she locked her knees straight but i must be to have been so careless as to have an assignation here when you were bound to find me out her eyes were like glass as she toasted him caught me he took a step forward stopped himself are you going to tell me you didnt sleep with him in the thrum of silence the flutes sang no im not going to tell you that im not ashamed that i once cared enough for a very good man to be intimate with him id tell you that i havent been with charlie or anyone else since i met you but the evidence is against me isnt it detective she was so tired bess thought so terribly tired and the scent of the lilacs made her want to weep rosalies funeral had been that morning and shed quietly made the arrangements herself shed gone alone without mentioning it to alex but shed needed him you let him kiss you yes i let him kiss me ive let lots of men kiss me isnt that the problem she set down the wine before she could do something rash like tossing it to the floor you didnt come to me a virgin alexi nor did i expect you to thats one of the big differences between us theres a bigger difference between a virgin and a he broke off appalled with himself he wouldnt have meant it stumbling horrified apologies whirled through his head but he could see by the way her head jerked up the way her color drained that there would be no taking back even the unsaid i think she said in an odd voice youd better go we havent finished i dont want you here even a whore can choose his face was as pale as hers bess i didnt mean that i could never mean that i want to understand no you dont she cut him off her voice so thick with tears that she had to fight for every word you never wanted to understand alexi you never wanted to hear the one thing i needed you to believe now the only thing you need to understand is that i dont want to see you again he felt something rip apart in his gut you cant have that if you dont leave now ill call security ill call your captain ill call the mayor desperation was rising like a flood whatever it takes to keep you away from me his eyes narrowed sharpened you can call god almighty it wont stop me maybe this will she gripped her hands tightly together and looked just over his shoulder i dont love you i dont want you i dont need you it was fun while it lasted but the games over you can let yourself out she turned away and walked quickly up the stairs there had been hurt in his eyes if there had been anger she knew he would have come after her but there had been hurt and she made it to the bedroom alone with her hands over her face she waited biting back sobs until she heard the door close downstairs with a sound of mourning she lowered herself to the floor and tasted her own tears they were bitter impatient and unsympathetic mikhail paced the floor of alexs sparsely furnished apartment you dont answer your phone he was saying you dont return messages he kicked a discarded shirt aside the apartment was a shambles lucky for you i came instead of mama shed box your ears for living like a pig i gave the staff the month off with the concentrated care of the nearly drunk alex poured another glass of vodka from the halfempty bottle on the table and drinking alone in the middle of the day so join me alex gestured carelessly toward the kitchen where dishes were piled high bound to be a clean glass somewhere mikhail washed one out before coming back to the table he sat poured what is this alexi celebration my day off alex took a swallow and waited for the vodka to join the rest swimming through his system i caught the bad guy with a half laugh he toasted himself and lost the girl mikhail drummed his fingers on the table as he drank it was no less than hed expected you fought with bess fought lips pursed alex studied the clear potent liquid in his glass i dont know thats the term exactly found her with another man mikhails glass froze halfway to his lips youre wrong nope alex reached for the bottle with an almost steady hand walked in and found her liplocked to this guy she used to be engaged to bess has this hobby of getting engaged mikhail merely shook his head something was not quite right with this picture did you kill him thought about it before he drank again alex ran his tongue over his teeth good he thought they were nearly numb the rest would follow too damn bad im a cop what was her explanation didnt give me one got pissed is all he set the glass down so that he could use both hands to rub his face because you accused without trusting i didnt accuse alex shot back then pressed his fingers to his burning eyes i didnt have to what i didnt say was unforgivable she tossed me out on my ear but not before she told me she didnt love me anyway she lies before alex could lift his glass again mikhail grabbed his wrist i tell you she lies a few days ago she visited rachel and the baby i made her sit for me and sketched her while she talked of you theres no mistaking what i saw in her eyes alexi youre blind if you havent seen it yourself he had seen it and the pain of remembering what hed seen clawed through him so that he stumbled to his feet as if to escape it she falls in love easily so there is love and love how many times have you taken the fall this is the first for this kind yes there were others they were different ah patient and amused mikhail held up a finger so its okay for you to play with love until you find the truth but its not okay for bess its put that way it was tough to argue with especially when his head was reeling damn it i was jealous i have a right to be jealous you have a right to make an ass of yourself too pleased now that he knew it could be fixed mikhail lucked back and crossed his booted feet did you bigtime alex swayed then sat down heavily i was going to ask her to many me mik i had the ring in my pocket and these stupid lilacs i was scared to death shed say yes more scared that shed say no he propped his spinning head in his hands what the hell was she doing kissing that son of a bitch maybe if you had asked nicely she would have told you with a lopsided grin alex turned his bleary eyes on his brother would you have asked nicely no i would have broken his arms maybe his legs too then i would have asked with a sigh mikhail patted alexs shoulder but that is me you were always more impulsive we could go find him alex considered and warming to the idea leaned over to give mikhail a sloppy hug well go beat him up together like old times well try something different rising mikhail hauled alex to his feet where we going im going to put you in a cold shower until your heads clear alex staggered and linked an arm around his brothers neck what for so you can go find your woman and grovel unsure of his footing alex stared at the tilting floor i dont wanna grovel yes you do its best to get used to it before you marry her i have more experience in this oh yeah enjoying the idea of his big brother crawling at sydneys feet he grinned as mikhail thrust him fully clothed into the shower can i watch next time no with immense satisfaction mikhail turned the cold water on full and listened to his brothers pained shout bounce viciously on the tiles this is a very good start he decided you son of a bitch they were both laughing when alex grabbed mikhail in a headlock and dragged him under the spray he was nearly sober by the time he walked into besss office but he wasnt laughing it was hard to laugh when your throat was thick with nerves he was going to be reasonable he promised himself they would discuss the entire matter like civilized adults and if she didnt give him the right answers hed strangle her he could always arrest himself afterward but he only saw lori sitting at the keyboard frantically typing ill have the damn changes by six she called out her brow was furrowed in concentration as she glanced up her eyes frosted over what the hell do you want i need to see bess youre out of luck nobody hurt her friend and got away with it nobody shes not here where she offered an anatomically impossible suggestion offered it so coolly he nearly smiled but it wasnt enough she leapt up and slammed the door shut locked it sit down buster ive got an earful for you tell me where she is when hell freezes over do you know what you did to her she took the flat of her hand to push him back why didnt you just cut her heart and slice it into little pieces while you were at it what i did he jammed his hands into his pockets so he wouldnt shove her back im the one who walked in and found her snuggled up to that prettyfaced playwright you dont know what you found then why dont you tell me shed die first you dont know her at all do you you didnt have a clue how lucky you were shes the most loving most generous most unselfish person ive ever known shed have crawled through broken glass for you afraid shed do something violent if she didnt move lori began to pace i was so happy when she told me about you i could see how much in love she was really in love she wasnt just taking you under her wing until she could find someone for you find someone for me what do you think she did with all those other men who were dazzled by her lori tossed back oh shed try to talk herself into being in love and thinking they loved her back and the whole time shed listen to their problems like some den mother then shed steer them in the direction of some woman shed decided was perfect for them she was usually right she was going to marry she was never going to marry anyone whenever she said yes it was because she couldnt bear to hurt anyones feelings and okay because she always wanted to have someone she could count on but however loyal however sensitive she is to other peoples feelings shes not stupid shed tell herself she was going to get married then shed go into overdrive finding the guy a substitute substitute why but lori wasnt ready to let him get a word in not that she ever calculated it that way but after you watched it happen a couple of times you saw the pattern but you she whirled back to him you broke the pat tern she needed you you made her cry angry tears glazed loris own eyes not once did i ever see her cry over any man shed just slip seamlessly into the mypalbess category and everyone was happy but shes cried buckets over you he felt sick and small and he was beginning to understand a great deal about groveling tell me where she is please why the hell should i i love her she wanted to snarl at him for daring to say so but she recognized the same misery in his eyes shed seen in her friends charlie was no he shook his head quickly it doesnt matter what did matter was trust and it was time he gave it i dont need to know i just need her with a sigh lori fingered the squarecut diamond on her left hand bess had pushed her into taking the right step with steven she could only hope she was doing the same in return if you hurt her again alex i wont then he sighed i dont want to hurt her again but i probably will she weakened because it was exactly the thing a man in love would say i sent her home she wasnt in any shape to work dyakuyu what thanks she hated feeling this way the only way bess could get from one day to the next was by telling herself it would get better it had to get better but she didnt believe it she hadnt had the heart to throw out the lilacs shed tried to shed even stood holding them over the trash can weeping like a fool but the thought of parting with them had been too much now she tormented herself with the fragile scent whenever she came downstairs she thought about taking a trip anywhere she certainly had the vacation time coming but it didnt seem fair to leave lori in the lurch especially since lori had added wedding plans to her work load a lot of good she was doing lori or the show this way she thought but the problem of the people in millbrook seemed terribly petty when compared to hers too bad she couldnt write herself out of this one she thought as she stood in the kitchen trying to talk herself into fixing something to eat well shed certainly made the grade bess told herself and pressed her fingers against her swollen eyes shed fallen in love and had her heart broken great research for the next troubled relationship she invented for the television audience the hell with food she was going to go up to bed and will herself to sleep tomorrow she would find some way to put her life back together when she stepped out of the kitchen what was left of her life shattered at her feet he was standing by the table one hand brushing over the lilacs all he did was look at her turn his head and look and she nearly crumpled to her knees what are you doing here the pain made her voice razorsharp i still have my key he lowered his hand slowly her eyes were still puffy from her last bout of tears and there were smudges of fatigue under them nothing that had been said to him nothing hed said to himself had lashed more sharply you didnt have to bring it by if composure was all she had left she would cling to it you could have dropped it in the mail but thanks her smile was so cold it hurt her jaw if thats all im in a hurry i was just on my way up to change before i go out you cant look at me when you lie he said it half to himself remembering how her eyes had drifted away from his face when she said she didnt love him she forced her gaze back to his held it steady what do you want alexi a great many things maybe too many things but first for you to forgive me her face crumpled at that she put a hand up to cover it knowing it was too late leave me alone milaya let me dont she cringed away crossing her arms over herself in selfdefense and his hands stopped an inch away there was an odd catch in his breath as he drew them back and let them fall to his sides i wont touch you his voice was quiet and strained please let me say what ive come to say what else could there be she turned away i know what you think of me you made that clear what i did was hurt you and make a fool of myself oh yes you hurt me she was still trembling from it but not just that last time you hurt me every time you pulled back when i needed to tell you how much i loved you i thought i wont let it matter because hell have to see it god hell have to see it because its right there every time i look at him every time i think about him and he loves me he wants me in my whole life no one wanted me not really bess she jerked away from his hands my parents she began turning back how many times i heard them say to each other where did she come from as if i was some stray pet that had wandered in by mistake when she began to roam the room her shoulders still hunched protectively he said nothing how could he tell her he was sorry hed opened up old wounds and sorry as well that it had taken that to have her reveal those smothered feelings to him i handled it those stiff shoulders jerked as she tried to shrug it off what else could i do it wasnt their fault really theyve always been so perfect in their way and i could never be not for them not even for you do you think thats what i want she glanced back then the tears had dried up there was no point in them i dont know what you want alexi i only know it keeps circling around i went from my parents into school those awful teenage years when all the girls were so bright and pretty and falling in and out of love no one wanted me oh i had friends somewhere along the line id learned that if you didnt try so hard if you just relaxed and acted naturally that there were a lot of people whod like you for what you were but there was never anyone to love there has never been anybody to love until you theres never going to be anyone else he waited until she turned back i love you bess please give me another chance it wont work she rubbed at her drying tears with the heel of her hand i thought it would i wanted it to i was so sure love would be enough but its not not without hope certainly not without faith the calm way she said it had panic streaking through him do you want me to crawl he ignored her defensive retreat and gripped her arms then i will youre not going to push me out of your life because i was stupid because i was afraid i wont let you was this how a man crawled she wondered with his eyes flashing fire and his voice booming and the next time you see me kissing an old friend i wont care with a sound of disgust he released her to stalk the room i will care ill kill the next one who touches you then new york would be littered with bodies it should be funny she thought why wasnt it funny i cant change what i am for you alexi i wouldnt ask you to change for me no you wouldnt he scrubbed his hands over his face and struggled to find some balance i know a kiss between friends is harmless bess im not quite that big a fool but the other night when i walked in you assumed i was betraying you i dont know what i assumed it was as honest as he could get when i saw you i felt it was all feeling he said carefully so i didnt think in my heart in my head i know better than to assume anything one of my own rules that i broke there were reasons calmer now he walked back and took her hands wed just finished the bust and i was wired from it i knew id tell you about it all about it id gone beyond trying to separate that part of my life any part of it from you it was going to upset you to think about it because of rosalie i knew that too damn it i knew youd gone to that funeral alone and i felt like the lowest kind of creep for letting you he was prying her heart open again inch by inch i didnt think you knew i knew his voice was flat all he could think was how desperately he wanted to hold her you leave notes everywhere all these pieces of paper scattered around with scribbling on them about drycleaning and dialogue and appointments i saw the one about the flowers youd ordered for her and the directions to the cemetery he looked down at their hands if things hadnt been moving so fast in the investigation i would have taken the time i would have tried to that she didnt doubt it was more important to me that you catch the man who killed her than that you go stand over her grave i wasnt with you he said more slowly and i wanted to be and when i got here i wanted to this was hardly the time to bring up the ring in his pocket i was churned up about a lot of things bess my response was way out of line and ill apologize for it as often as you like but id like you to hear me out its all right she gave his hands a squeeze hoping hed release hers he didnt alexi charlie was here because i dont need to know now he let her hands go to bring his own to her face he wanted her to see what was in his eyes you dont have to explain yourself to me you dont have to change yourself for me she felt something move inside her heart and was afraid to believe it was healing id rather clear the air i was too angry to do it before he came by to tell me that gabrielle was expecting he was like a little boy at christmas and he wanted to share his good news with a friend and to ask me if id be godmother even though its seven and a half months down the road he lowered his brow to hers you should have slugged me mcnee when he moved his mouth toward hers he felt her retreat patiently he stroked his thumbs over her temples just once he murmured and tasted her lips he didnt mean to deepen the kiss didnt mean to crush her against him and hold her so tightly neither of them could breathe but he couldnt stop himself until he felt her body shake with a fresh bout of tears dont please dont he pressed his face into her hair and rocked her ill break apart turning her face into his shoulder she fought back the worst of the tears i didnt want you to come back i didnt want to feel this again he deserved that he thought as he squeezed his eyes tight you were right to send me away i want a chance to prove to you that youre right to let me back in he brushed a hand through her hair youre so good at listening bess i have to ask you to listen to me now you dont need to apologize again she could do nothing but love him she realized and drawing back she managed a smile and i cant let you back in because you were always here her words brought a pressure to his chest he pressed their joined hands against it to try to ease it away just that easy its not easy she supposed it would never be easy its just the way it is mikhail said i would grovel he murmured bess you humble me lets put it behind us she drew a deep breath then kissed both his cheeks as a sign of peace im good at fresh starts no taking her hand he pulled her to the couch i like our other start we dont need a new one only to play this one out sit he pulled her down with him keeping her hand close to his heart you explained now i will i was afraid to believe in you no woman has ever meant what you mean and i let myself imagine that youd be with me forever just as i let myself imagine that youd turn away and because i was more afraid of the second it seemed more real its hard to be afraid she turned her cheek to her hand i know you dont know all he glanced away toward the flowers subtly scenting the room you kept the lilacs i tried not to she smiled again but they were so beautiful i brought you something besides lilacs that day he reached into his pocket and drew out the box her hand went limp in his he watched her lips tremble apart i dont think its ostentatious when she only continued to stare he shifted that was a joke okay the two syllables came out in a whisper are you are you going to let me see it for an answer he opened the box himself inside was a gold band set with a rainbow of gems he knew what they were only because hed asked the jeweler to identify each of them the amethyst the peridot the blue topaz the citrine i know its not traditional he said when she remained silent but it reminded me of you and i wanted hell i wanted something no one else would have thought to give you no one has she managed barely breathing no one would if you dont like it we can look for something else she was afraid she would cry again and knew it would do neither of them any good its lovely beautiful she managed to tear her gaze from it you bought me this before you had it with you the other night you were going to give it to me then you walked in and saw me with charlie laughing she lifted a hand to her cheek im surprised you didnt gun us both down i couldnt have written it better myself then you forgive me she already had but since he was looking so nervous she nodded anyone with such good taste deserves a second chance i bought this days ago but it took me a while to work up the nerve facing a junkie with an uzi seemed easier but he was into it now and he was going to finish my idea was to pressure you to accept it then push for a quick wedding so you wouldnt change your mind but that was wrong he closed the box and was encouraged by besss quick gasp of dismay it was stupid and it showed a lack of faith in both of us im sorry i you she let out a frustrated breath i dont mind of course you do he said it was calculating even devious when a proposal of marriage should be romantic so when were both ready ill ask you properly her face fell when were both ready i dont want to push you when you might be feeling a little vulnerable especially since a long engagement is out so ill give you time time she echoed ready to scream its fair he waited a beat okay im ready before she could laugh he was down on one knee what are you doing a proper proposal of marriage he nearly launched into his humble little speech instead his eyes darkened when she continued to laugh you dont want one damn right i want one but i want you up here she took his hand to tug him back to the couch so that they were at eye level with each other i want you to look me right in the eye okay then i get something i want too name it i want to hear you say it he caught her hand brought it to his cheek i want very much to hear you say it i need to hear the words from you i love you alexi for the first time she said the words smiling knowing they would be taken as they were meant im going to love you forever he turned his face so that his lips pressed into her palm taking the ring out of the box he slipped it onto her finger it shot out a rainbow of color as he linked his fingers with hers he lifted his head be my family he shook his head before she could speak and felt himself stumble i meant to be romantic let me no overwhelmed she laid a hand over his lips that was perfect dont change it dont change anything then say yes yes she threw her arms around him and laughed oh yes if you enjoyed reading about the stanislaski brothers look for the stanislaski sisters natasha and rachel complete novels available in one fabulous

february at your favorite retail outlets heres a sneak preview of taming natasha the first story in the stanislaski sisters natasha and rachel it was only dinner natasha told herself as she walked to the door and he was only a man she added pulling the door open an outrageously attractive man he looked wonderful was all she could think with his hair swept back from his face and that half smile in his eyes hi he held out another red rose natasha nearly sighed giving in a little she tapped the blossom against her cheek it wasnt the roses that changed my mind she said about what about having dinner with you he smiled then fully and exasperated her by looking charming and cocky all at the same time what did im hungry she set her short velvet jacket on the arm of the sofa ill put this in water the restaurant hed chosen was only a short drive away over her first glass of wine she told herself to relax and enjoy over dinner she was careful to steer the conversation toward subjects they had touched on in his class but spence was equally determined to explore more personal areas tell me about your family natasha slipped a hot butterdrenched morsel of lobster into her mouth im the oldest of four she began then became abruptly aware that his fingertips were playing casually with hers on the tablecloth she slid her hand out of reach her maneuver had him lifting his glass to hide a smile are you all spies a flicker of temper joined the lights that the candle brought to her eyes certainly not i wondered since you seem so reluctant to talk about them his face sober he leaned toward her say get moose and squirrel her mouth quivered before she gave up and laughed i have two brothers and a sister my parents still live in brooklyn you said you were about five when you came to the states do you remember much about yourlife before that of course he ran a fingertip down her wrist and surprised a shiver out of her before she moved her hand away he felt her pulse scramble what do you remember because her reaction annoyed her she was determined to show him nothing she only shrugged my father bringing in wood for the fire his hair and coat all covered with snow the baby crying my youngest brother the smell of the bread my mother baked pretending to be asleep when i listened to papa talk to her about escape were you afraid yes her eyes blurred with the memory she didnt often look back didnt often need to but when she did it came not with the watery look of dreams but clear as glass oh yes very afraid more than i will ever be again will you tell me she started to pass it off but the memory remained too vivid we waited until spring and took only what we could carry we told no one no one at all and set off in the wagon papa said we were going to visit my mothers sister who lived in the west but i think there were some who knew who watched us go with tired faces and big eyes papa had papers badly forged but he had a map and hoped we would avoid border guards and you were only five nearly six by then thinking she ran a fingertip around and around the rim of her glass mikhail was between four and five alex just two at night if we could risk a fire we would sit around it and papa would tell stories those were the good nights we would fall asleep listening to his voice and smelling the smoke from the fire we went over the mountains and into hungary it took us ninetythree days he couldnt imagine it not even when he could see it reflected so clearly in her eyes thinking of the little girl he took her hand and waited for her to go on my father planned for years perhaps he had dreamed of it all his life he had names people who would help defectors there was war the cold one but i was too young to understand i understood the fear in my parents in the others who helped us we were smuggled out of hungary into austria the church sponsored us brought us to america it was a long time before i stopped waiting for the police to come and take my father away thats a lot for a child to deal with i also remember eating my first hot dog she smiled and picked up her wine she never spoke of that time never not even with family now that she had with him she felt a desperate heed to change the subject no childhood is ever completely secure but we grow up im a businesswoman and youre a respected composer why dont you write she felt his fingers tense on hers im sorry she said quickly i had no business asking that its all right his fingers relaxed again i dont write because i cant i know your music something that intense doesnt fade it hasnt mattered a great deal in the past couple of years just lately its begun to matter again dont be patient when he smiled she shook her head no i mean it people always say when the time is right when the mood is right when the place is right years are wasted that way if my father had waited until we were older until the trip was safer we might still be in the ukraine there are some things that should be grabbed with both hands and taken life can be very very short he could feel the urgency in the way her hands gripped his and he could see the shadow of regret in her eyes the reason for both intrigued him as much as her words you may be right he said slowly then brought the palm of her hand to his lips waiting isnt always the best answer its getting late natasha pulled her hand free then balled it into a fist on her lap but that didnt stop the heat from spearing her arm
