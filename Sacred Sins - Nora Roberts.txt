chapter august fifteenth it was a day following other days of sweat and hazy skies there were no puffy white clouds or balmy breezes only a wall of humidity nearly thick enough to swim in reports on the six and eleven oclock news glumly promised more to come in the long lazy last days of summer the heat wave moving into its second pitiless week was the biggest story in washington dc the senate was adjourned until september so capitol hill moved sluggishly relaxing before a much touted european trip the president cooled off at camp david without the daytoday shuffle of politics washington was a city of tourists and street vendors across from the smithsonian a mime performed for a sticky crowd that had stopped more to catch its collective breath than in appreciation of art pretty summer dresses wilted and children whined for ice cream the young and the old flocked to rock creek park using the shade and water as a defense against the heat soft drinks and lemonade were consumed by the gallon beer and wine downed in the same quantity but less conspicuously bottles had a way of disappearing when park police cruised by during picnics and cookouts people mopped sweat charred hot dogs and watched babies in diapers toddle on the grass mothers shouted at children to stay away from the water not to run near the road to put down a stick or a stone the music from portable radios was as usual loud and defiant hot tracks the deejays called them and reported temperatures in the high nineties small groups of students drew together some sitting on the rocks above the creek to discuss the fate of the world others sprawled on the grass more interested in the fate of their tans those who could spare the time and the gas had fled to the beach or the mountains a few college students found the energy to throw frisbees the men stripping down to shorts to show off torsos uniformly bronzed a pretty young artist sat under a tree and sketched idly after several attempts to draw her attention to the biceps hed been working on for six months one of the players took a more obvious route the frisbee landed on her pad with a plop when she looked up in annoyance he jogged over his grin was apologetic and calculated he hoped to dazzle sorry got away from me after pushing a fall of dark hair over her shoulder the artist handed the frisbee back to him its all right she went back to her sketching without sparing him a glance youth is nothing if not tenacious hunkering down beside her he studied her drawing what he knew about art wouldnt have filled a shot glass but a pitch was a pitch hey thats really good wherere you studying recognizing the ploy she started to brush him off then looked up long enough to catch his smile maybe he was obvious but he was cute georgetown no kidding me too prelaw impatient his partner called across the grass rod we going for a brew or not you come here often rod asked ignoring his friend the artist had the biggest brown eyes hed ever seen now and again why dont we rod come on lets get that beer rod looked at his sweaty slightly overweight friend then back into the cool brown eyes of the artist no contest ill catch you later pete he called out then let the frisbee go in a high negligent arch finished playing the artist asked watching the flight of the frisbee he grinned then touched the ends of her hair depends swearing pete started off in pursuit of the disk hed just paid six bucks for it after nearly tripping over a dog he scrambled down a slope hoping the frisbee wouldnt land in the creek hed paid a lot more for his leather sandals it circled toward the water making him curse out loud then hit a tree and careened off into some bushes dripping sweat and thinking about the cold moosehead waiting for him pete shoved at branches and cleared his way his heart stopped then sent the blood beating in his head before he could draw breath to yell his lunch of fritos and two hot dogs came up violently the frisbee had landed two feet from the edge of the creek it lay new and red and cheerful on a cold white hand that seemed to offer it back she had been carla johnson a twentythreeyearold drama student and parttime waitress twelve to fifteen hours before she had been strangled with a priests amice white edged in gold detective ben paris slumped at his desk after finishing his written report on the johnson homicide hed typed the facts using two fingers in a machine gun style but now they played back to him no sexual assault no apparent robbery her purse had been under her with twentythree dollars and seventysix cents and a mastercard in it an opal ring that would have hocked for about fifty had still been on her finger no motive no suspects nothing ben and his partner had spent the afternoon interviewing the victims family an ugly business he thought necessary but ugly they had unearthed the same answers at every turn carla had wanted to be an actress her life had been her studies she had dated but not seriously shed been too devoted to an ambition she would never achieve ben skimmed the report again and lingered over the murder weapon the priests scarf there had been a note pinned next to it hed knelt beside her himself hours before to read it her sins are forgiven her amen ben murmured and let out a long breath it was after one am on the second week of september when barbara clayton cut across the lawn of the washington cathedral the air was warm the stars brilliant but she wasnt in the mood to enjoy it as she walked she muttered badtemperedly shed give that ferretfaced mechanic an earful in the morning fixed the transmission good as new what a crock damn good thing she only had a couple more blocks to walk now shed have to take the bus to work the ugly greasesmeared sonofabitch was going to pay a shooting star exploded and trailed across the sky in a brilliant arch she never even noticed nor did the man who watched her hed known shed come hadnt he been told to keep watch wasnt his head even now almost bursting from the pressure of the voice hed been chosen given the burden and the glory dominus vobiscum he murmured then gripped the smooth material of the amice tightly in his hands and when his task was complete he felt the hot rush of power his loins exploded his blood sang he was clean and so now was she slowly gently he ran his thumb over her forehead her lips her heart in the sign of the cross he gave her absolution but quickly the voice had warned him there were many who wouldnt understand the purity of the work he did leaving her body in the shadows he walked on eyes bright with the tears of joy and madness the medias crawling up our backs with this one captain harris slammed a fist on the newspaper spread over his desk the whole goddamn citys in a panic when i find out who leaked this priest business to the press he trailed off drawing himself in it wasnt often he came that close to losing control he might sit behind a desk but he was a cop he told himself a damn good one a good cop didnt lose control to give himself time he folded the paper letting his gaze drift over the other cops in the room damn good ones harris admitted he wouldnt have tolerated less ben paris sat on the corner of the desk toying with a lucite paperweight harris knew him well enough to understand that ben liked something in his hands when he was thinking young harris reflected but seasoned with ten years on the force a solid cop if a bit loose on procedure the two citations for bravery had been well earned when things were less tense it even amused harris that ben looked like the hollywood screenwriters version of an undercover cop leanfaced strongboned dark and wiry his hair was full and too long to be conventional but it was cut in one of those fancy little shops in georgetown he had pale green eyes that didnt miss what was important in a chair three feet of leg spread out before him sat ed jackson bens partner at sixfive and two hundred fifty pounds he could usually intimidate a suspect on sight whether by whim or design he wore a full beard that was as red as the curly mane of hair on his head his eyes were blue and friendly at fifty yards he could put a hole in the eagle of a quarter with his police special harris set the paper aside but didnt sit whatve you got ben tossed the paperweight from hand to hand before he set it down other than build and coloring theres no connection between the two victims no mutual friends no mutual hangouts youve got the rundown on carla johnson barbara clayton worked in a dress shop divorced no kids family lives in maryland blue collar shed been seeing someone pretty heavily up to three months ago things fizzled he moved to la were checking on him but he looks clean he reached in his pocket for a cigarette and caught his partners eye thats six ed said easily bens trying to get under a pack a day he explained then took up the report himself clayton spent the evening in a bar on wisconsin kind of a girls night out with a friend who works with her friend says clayton left about one her car was found broken down a couple blocks from the hit seems shes been having transmission problems apparently she decided to walk from there her apartments only about half a mile away the only things the victims had in common were that they were both blond white and female ben drew in smoke hard let it fill up his lungs then released it now theyre dead in his territory harris thought and took it personally the murder weapon the priests scarf amice ben supplied didnt seem too hard to trace our guy uses the best silk he didnt get it in the city ed continued not in the past year anyway weve checked every religious store every church got a line on three outlets in new england that carry that type the notes were written on paper available at any dime store ben added theres no tracing them in other words youve got nothing in any words ben drew smoke again weve got nothing harris studied each man in silence he might have wished ben would wear a tie or that ed would trim down his beard but that was personal they were his best paris with his easygoing charm and surface carelessness had the instincts of a fox and a mind as sharp as a stiletto jackson was as thorough and efficient as a maiden aunt a case was a jigsaw puzzle to him and he never tired of shifting through the pieces harris sniffed the smoke from bens cigarette then reminded himself that hed given up smoking for his own good go back and talk to everyone again get me the report on claytons old boyfriend and the customer lists from the religious outlets he glanced toward the paper again i want to take this guy down the priest ben murmured as he skimmed the headline the press always likes to give psychos a title and lots of coverage harris added lets get him out of the headlines and behind bars hazy after a long night of paperwork dr teresa court sipped coffee and skimmed the post a full week after the second murder and the priest as the press termed him was still at large she didnt find reading about him the best way to begin her day but professionally he interested her she wasnt immune to the death of two young women but shed been trained to look at facts and diagnose her life had been dedicated to it professionally her life was besieged by problems pain frustrations to compensate she kept her private world organized and simple because shed grown up with the cushion of wealth and education she took the matisse print on her wall and the baccarat crystal on the table as a matter of course she preferred clean lines and pastels but now and again found herself drawn to something jarring like the abstract oil in vivid strokes and arrogant colors over her table she understood her need for the harsh as well as the soft and was content one of her top priorities was to remain content because the coffee was already cold she pushed it aside after a moment she pushed the paper away as well she wished she knew more about the killer and the victims had all the details then she remembered the old saying about being careful what you wished for because you just might get it with a quick check of her watch she rose from the table she didnt have time to brood over a story in the paper she had patients to see eastern cities are at their most splendid in the fall summer bakes them winter leaves them stalled and dingy but autumn gives them a blast of color and dignity at two am on a cool october morning ben paris found himself suddenly and completely awake there was no use wondering what had disturbed his sleep and the interesting dream involving three blondes rising he padded naked to his dresser and groped for his cigarettes twentytwo he counted silently he lit one letting the familiar bitter taste fill his mouth before he went to the kitchen to make coffee turning on only the fluorescent light on the stove he kept a sharp eye out for roaches nothing skidded into cracks ben set the flame under the pot and thought the last extermination was still holding as he reached for a cup he pushed away two days worth of mail hed yet to open in the harsh kitchen light his face looked hard even dangerous but then he was thinking about murder his naked body was loose and rangy with a leanness that would have been gaunt without the subtle ridges of muscle the coffee wouldnt keep him awake when his mind was ready his body would just follow suit hed trained himself through endless stakeouts a scrawny dustcolored cat leaped on the table and stared at him as he sipped and smoked noting he was distracted the cat readjusted her idea about a latenight saucer of milk and sat down to wash they were no closer to finding the killer than they had been the afternoon the first body was discovered if theyd come upon something remotely resembling a lead it had fizzled after the first miles of legwork dead end ben reflected zero zilch of course there had been five confessions in one month alone all from the disturbed minds that craved attention twentysix days after the second murder and they were nowhere and every day that went by he knew the trail grew colder as the press petered out people began to relax he didnt like it lighting one cigarette from the butt of another ben thought of calm before storms he looked out into the cool night lit by a halfmoon and wondered dougs was only five miles from bens apartment the little club was dark now the musicians were gone and the spilled booze mopped up francie bowers stepped out the back entrance and drew on her sweater her feet hurt after six hours on fourinch heels her toes were cramping inside her sneakers still the tips had been worth it working as a cocktail waitress might keep you on your feet but if your legs were good and hers were the tips rolled in a few more nights like this one she mused and she might just be able to put a down payment on that little vw no more hassling with the bus that was her idea of heaven the arch of her foot gave out a sweet sliver of pain wincing at it francie glanced at the alley it would save her a quarter mile but it was dark she took another two steps toward the streetlight and gave up dark or not she wasnt walking one step more than she had to hed been waiting a long time but hed known the voice had said one of the lost ones was being sent she was coming quickly as if eager to reach salvation for days he had prayed for her for the cleansing of her soul now the time of forgiveness was almost at hand he was only an instrument the turmoil began in his head and spiraled down power rolled into him in the shadows he prayed until she passed by he moved swiftly as was merciful when the amice was looped around her neck she had only an instant to gasp before he pulled it taut she let out a small liquid sound as her air was cut off as terror rammed into her she dropped her canvas bag and grabbed for the restriction with both hands sometimes when his power was great he could let them go quickly but the evil in her was strong challenging him her fingers pulled at the silk then dug heavily into the gloves he wore when she kicked back he lifted her from her feet but she continued to lash out one of her feet connected with a can and sent it clattering the noise echoed in his head until he nearly screamed with it then she was limp and the tears on his face dried in the autumn air he laid her gently on the concrete and absolved her in the old tongue after pinning the note to her sweater he blessed her she was at peace and for now so was he theres no reason to kill us getting there eds tone of voice was serene as ben took the mustang around a corner at fifty shes already dead ben downshifted and took the next right youre the one who totaled the last car my last car he added without too much malice only had seventyfive thousand miles on it highspeed pursuit ed mumbled the mustang shimmied over a bump reminding ben that hed been meaning to check the shocks and i didnt kill you contusions and lacerations sliding through an amber light ben drove it into third multiple contusions and lacerations reminiscently ed smiled we got them didnt we they were unconscious ben squealed to a halt at the curb and pocketed the keys and i needed five stitches in my arm bitch bitch bitch with a yawn ed unfolded himself from the car and stood on the sidewalk it was barely dawn and cool enough so you could see your breath but a crowd was already forming hunched in his jacket and wishing for coffee ben worked his way through the curious onlookers to the ropedoff alley sly with a nod to the police photographer ben looked down on victim number three he would put her age at twentysix to twentyeight the sweater was a cheap polyester and the soles of her sneakers were worn almost smooth she wore dangling goldplated earrings her face was a mask of heavy makeup that didnt suit the departmentstore sweater and corduroys cupping his hands around his second cigarette of the day he listened to the report of the uniformed cop beside him vagrant found her we got him in a squad car sobering up seems he was picking through the trash when he came across her put the fear of god into him so he ran out of the alley and nearly into my cruiser ben nodded looking down at the neatly lettered note pinned to her sweater frustration and fury moved through him so swiftly that when acceptance settled in they were hardly noticed bending down ed picked up the oversized canvas bag shed dropped a handful of bus tokens spilled out it was going to be a long day six hours later they walked into the precinct homicide didnt have the seamy glamor of vice but it was hardly as neat and tidy as the stations in the suburbs two years before the walls had been painted in what ben referred to as apartmenthouse beige the floor tiles sweat in the summer and held the cold in the winter no matter how diligent the janitorial service was with pine cleaner and dust rags the rooms forever smelled of stale smoke wet coffee grounds and fresh sweat true theyd taken up a pool in the spring and delegated one of the detectives to buy some plants to put on the windowsills they werent dying but they werent nourishing either ben passed a desk and nodded to lou roderick as the detective typed up a report this was a cop who took his caseload steadily the way an accountant takes corporate taxes harris wants to see you lou told him and without looking up managed to convey a touch of sympathy just got in from a meeting with the mayor and i think lowenstein took a message for you thanks ben eyed the snickers bar on rodericks desk hey lou forget it roderick continued to type his report without breaking rhythm so much for brotherhood ben muttered and sauntered over to lowenstein she was a different type from roderick altogether ben mused she worked in surges stop and go and was more comfortable on the street than at a typewriter ben respected lous preciseness but as a backup hed have chosen lowenstein whose proper suits and trim dresses didnt hide the fact that she had the best legs in the department ben took a quick look at them before he sat on the corner of her desk too bad she was married he thought poking idly through her papers he waited for her to finish her call hows it going lowenstein my garbage disposals throwing up and the plumber wants three hundred but thats all right because my husbands going to fix it she spun a form into her typewriter itll only cost us twice as much that way how about you she smacked his hand away from the pepsi on her desk got anything new on our priest just a corpse if there was bitterness it was hard to detect ever been to dougs down by the canal i dont have your social life paris he gave a quick snort then picked up the fat mug that held her pencils she was a cocktail waitress there twentyseven no use letting it get to you she murmured then seeing his face passed him the pepsi it always got to you harris wants to see you and ed yeah i know he took a long swallow letting the sugar and caffeine pour into his system got a message for me oh yeah with a smirk she pushed through her papers until she found it bunny called when the high breathy voice didnt get a rise out of him she sent him an arch look and handed him the paper she wants to know what time youre picking her up she sounded real cute paris he pocketed the slip and grinned she is real cute lowenstein but id dump her in a minute if you wanted to cheat on your husband when he walked off without returning her drink she laughed and went back to typing out the form theyre turning my apartment into condos ed hung up the phone and went with ben toward harriss office fifty thousand jesus its got bad plumbing ben drained the rest of the pepsi and tossed it into a can yeah got any vacancies over at your place nobody leaves there unless they die through the wide glass window of harriss office they could see the captain standing by his desk as he talked on the phone hed kept himself in good shape for a man of fiftyseven whod spent the last ten years behind a desk he had too much willpower to run to fat his first marriage had gone under because of the job his second because of the bottle harris had given up booze and marriage and now the job took the place of both the cops in his department didnt necessarily like him but they respected him harris preferred things that way glancing up he signaled for both men to enter i want the lab reports before five if there was a piece of lint on her sweater i want to know where it came from do your job give me something to work with so i can do mine when he hung up he went over to his hot plate and poured coffee after five years he still wished it were scotch tell me about francie bowers shes been working tables at dougs for almost a year moved to dc from virginia last november lived alone in an apartment in north west ed shifted his weight and checked his notebook married twice neither lasted over a year were checking out both exes she worked nights and slept days so her neighbors dont know much about her she got off work at one apparently she cut through the alley to get to the bus stop she didnt own a car nobody heard anything ben added or saw anything ask again harris said simply and find someone who did anything more on number one ben didnt like victims by numbers and stuck his hands in his pockets carla johnsons boyfriends in la got a bit part on a soap hes clean it appeared shed had an argument with another student the day before she was killed witnesses said it got pretty hot he admitted it ed continued seems theyd dated a couple of times and she wasnt interested alibi claims he got drunk and picked up a freshman with a shrug ben sat on the arm of a chair theyre engaged we can bring him in again but neither of us believe he had anything to do with it hes got no connection with clayton or bowers when we checked him over we found out that the kids the ailamerican boy from an uppermiddleclass family lettered in track its more likely eds a psychotic than that college boy thanks partner well check him out again anyway whats his name robert lawrence dors he drives a honda civic and wears polo shirts ben drew out a cigarette white loafers and no socks roderickll bring him in wait a minute im assigning a task force to this business harris said cutting ben off he poured a second cup of coffee roderick lowenstein and bigsbyll be working with you i want this guy before he kills the next woman who happens to be out walking alone his voice remained mild reasonable and final you have a problem with that ben strode to the window and stared out it was personal and he knew better no we all want him including the mayor harris added with only the slightest trace of bitterness he wants to be able to give the press something positive by the end of the week were calling in a psychiatrist to give us a profile a shrink with a half laugh ben turned around come on captain because he didnt like it either harriss voice chilled dr court has agreed to cooperate with us at the mayors request we dont know what he looks like maybe its time we found out how he thinks at this point he added with a level glance at both men im willing to look into a crystal ball if wed get a lead out of it be here at four ben started to open his mouth then caught eds warning glance without a word they strode out maybe we should call in a psychic ben muttered closeminded realistic the human psyche is a fascinating mystery youve been reading again and those trained to understand it can open doors layman only knock against ben sighed and flicked his cigarette into the parking lot as they stepped outside shit shit tess muttered as she glanced out her office window there were two things she had no desire to do at that moment the first was battling traffic in the cold nasty rain that had begun to fall the second was to become involved with the homicides plaguing the city she was going to have to do the first because the mayor and her grandfather had pressured her to do the second her caseload was already too heavy she might have refused the mayor politely even apologetically her grandfather was a different matter she never felt like dr teresa court when she dealt with him after five minutes she wasnt five feet four with a womans body and a blackframed degree behind her she was again a skinny twelveyearold overpowered by the personality of the man she loved most in the world hed seen to it that shed gotten that blackframed degree hadnt he with his confidence she thought his support his unstinting belief in her how could she say no when he asked her to use her skill because handling her current caseload took her ten hours a day perhaps it was time she stopped being stubborn and took on a partner tess looked around her pastel office with its carefully selected antiques and watercolors hers she thought every bit of it and she glanced at the tall oak file cabinet circa it was loaded with case files those were hers too no she wouldnt be taking on a partner in a year shed be thirty she had her own practice her own office her own problems thats just the way she wanted to keep it taking the minklined raincoat from the closet she shrugged into it and maybe just maybe she could help the police find the man who was splashed across the headlines day after day she could help them find him stop him so that he in turn could get the help he needed she picked up her purse and the briefcase which was fat with files to be sorted through that evening kate stepping into her outer office tess turned up her collar im on my way to captain harriss office dont pass anything through unless its urgent you should have a hat the receptionist answered ive got one in the car see you tomorrow drive carefully already thinking ahead she walked through the door while digging for her car keys maybe she could grab some takeout chinese on the way home and have a quiet dinner before tess one more step and she would have been in the elevator swearing under her breath tess turned and managed a smile frank and shed been so successful at avoiding him for nearly ten days youre a hard lady to pin down he strode toward her impeccable that was the word that always leaped to tesss mind when she saw dr f r fuller right before boring his suit was pearlgray brooks brothers and his striped tie had hints of that shade and the baby pink in his arrow shirt his hair was perfectly and conservatively groomed she tried hard to keep her smile from fading it wasnt franks fault she couldnt warm to perfection ive been busy you know what they say about all work tess she gritted her teeth to keep herself from saying no what did they say hed simply laugh and give her the rest of the cliche ill just have to risk it she pressed the button for down and hoped the car came quickly but youre leaving early today outside appointment deliberately she checked her watch she had time to spare running a bit late she lied without qualm ive been trying to get in touch with you pressing his palm against the wall he leaned over her another of his habits tess found herself detesting youd think it wouldnt be a problem since our offices are right next door where the hell was an elevator when you needed it you know what schedules are like frank indeed i do he flashed his toothpaste smile and she wondered if he thought his cologne was driving her wild but we all need to relax now and again right doctor in our own way i have tickets to the noel coward play at the kennedy center tomorrow night why dont we relax together the last time the only time shed agreed to relax with him shed barely escaped with the clothes on her back worse before the tugofwar shed been bored to death for three hours its nice of you to think of me frank again she lied without hesitation im afraid im already booked for tomorrow why dont we the doors opened oops im late sending him a cheery smile she stepped inside dont work too hard frank you know what they say due to the pounding rain and traffic she ate up nearly all of her extra time driving to the station house strangely enough the halfhour battle left her rather cheerful perhaps she thought because she had escaped so neatly from frank if shed had the heart and she didnt she would simply have told him he was a jerk and that would be the end of it until he pushed her into enough corners shed use tact and excuses reaching beside her she picked up a felt hat and bundled her hair under it she glanced in the rearview mirror and wrinkled her nose no use doing any repairs now the rain would make it a waste of time still there was bound to be a ladies room inside where she could dig into her bag of tricks and come out looking dignified and professional for now she was just going to look wet pushing open the door of the car tess grabbed her hat with one hand and made a dash for the building check this out ben halted his partner on the steps leading to headquarters they watched heedless of the rain as tess jumped over puddles nice legs ed commented damn theyre better than lowensteins maybe ed gave it a moments thought hard to tell in the rain still running head down tess dashed up the steps and collided with ben he heard her swear before he took her shoulders pulling her back just far enough to get a look at her face it was worth getting wet for elegant even with rain washing over it ben thought of elegance the slash of cheekbones was strong high enough to make him think of viking maidens her mouth was soft and moist making him think of other things her skin was pale with just a touch of rose but it was her eyes that made him lose track of the glib remark hed thought to make they were big cool and just a bit annoyed and violet hed thought the color had been reserved for elizabeth taylor and wildflowers sorry tess managed when she got her breath back i didnt see you no he wanted to go on staring but managed to bring himself around he had a reputation with women that was mythical exaggerated but based on fact at the rate you were traveling im not surprised it felt good to hold her to watch the rain cling to her lashes i could run you in for assaulting an officer the ladys getting wet ed murmured until then tess had only been aware of the man who held her staring at her as though shed appeared in a puff of smoke now she made herself look away and over then up she saw a wet giant with laughing blue eyes and a mass of dripping red hair was this a police station she thought or a fairy tale ben kept one hand on her arm as he pushed open the door hed let her inside but he wasnt going to let her slip away not yet once in tess gave ed another look decided he was real and turned to ben so was he and he was still holding her arm amused she lifted a brow officer i warn you if you arrest me for assault ill file charges of police brutality when he smiled she felt something click so he wasnt as harmless as shed thought now if youll excuse me forget the charges ben kept his hand on her arm if you need a ticket fixed sergeant detective he corrected ben detective i might take you up on that another time but at the moment im running late if you want to be helpful im a public servant then you can let go of my arm and tell me where to find captain harris captain harris homicide she saw the surprise the distrust and felt her arm released intrigued she tilted her head and removed her hat pale blond hair tumbled to her shoulders thats right bens gaze skimmed the fall of hair before he looked back at her face it didnt fit he thought he suspected things that didnt fit dr court it always took an effort to meet rudeness and cynicism with grace tess didnt bother to make it right again detective youre a shrink she gave him back look for look youre a cop each might have added something less than complimentary if ed hadnt burst out laughing thats the bell for round one he said easily harriss office is a neutral corner he took tesss arm himself and showed her the way chapter flanked on either side tess walked down the corridors now and then a voice barked or a door opened and closed hollowly the sound of phones ringing came from everywhere at once they never seemed to be answered rain beat against the windows to add a touch of gloom a man in his shirtsleeves and overalls was mopping up a puddle of something the corridor smelled strongly of lysol and damp it wasnt the first time shed been in a police station but it was the first time shed come so close to being intimidated ignoring ben she concentrated on his partner you two always travel as a pair genial ed grinned he liked her voice because it was pitched low and was as cool as sherbet on a hot sunday afternoon the captain likes me to keep an eye on him ill bet ben made a sharp left turn this way doctor tess slanted him a look and moved past him he smelled of rain and soap as she stepped into the squad room she watched two men drag out a teenage boy in handcuffs a woman sat in a corner with a cup in both hands and wept silently the sounds of arguing poured in from out in the hall welcome to reality ben offered as someone began to swear tess gave him a long steady look and summed him up as a fool did he think shed expected tea and cookies compared to the clinic where she gave her time once a week this was a garden party thank you detective paris he wondered why he felt she was laughing at him ben paris dr court this is my partner ed johnson taking out a cigarette he lit it as he watched her she looked as out of place in the dingy squad room as a rose on a trash heap but that was her problem well be working with you how nice with the smile she reserved for annoying shop clerks she breezed by him before she could knock on harriss door ben was opening it captain ben waited as harris pushed aside papers and rose this is dr court he hadnt been expecting a woman or anyone so young but harris had commanded too many women officers too many rookies to feel anything but momentary surprise the mayor had recommended her insisted on her harris corrected himself and the mayor no matter how annoying was a sharp man who made few missteps dr court he held out his hand and found hers soft and small but firm enough i appreciate you coming no she wasnt quite convinced he did but she had worked around such things before i hope i can help please sit down she started to shrug out of her coat and felt hands on her arms taking a quick look over her shoulder she saw ben behind her nice coat doctor his fingers brushed over the lining as he slipped it from her fiftyminute hours must be profitable nothings more fun than soaking patients she said in the same undertone then turned away from him arrogant jerk she thought and took her seat dr court might like some coffee ed put in always easily amused he grinned over at his partner she got kind of wet coming in seeing the gleam in eds eyes tess couldnt help but grin back id love some coffee black harris glanced over at the dregs in the pot on his hot plate then reached for his phone roderick get some coffee in here four no three he corrected as he glanced at ed if theres any hot water ed reached in his pocket and drew out an herbal tea bag and a cup of hot water harris said his lips twisting into something like a smile yeah for jackson dr court harris didnt know what had amused her but had a feeling it had something to do with his two men they had better get down to business well be grateful for any help you can give us and youll have our full cooperation this was said with a glance a telling one at ben youve been briefed on what we need tess thought of her twohour meeting with the mayor and the stacks of paperwork shed taken home from his office brief she mused had nothing to do with it yes you need a psychological profile on the killer known as the priest youll want an educated expert opinion as to why he kills and to his style of killing you want me to tell you who he is emotionally how he thinks how he feels with the facts i have and those youll give me its possible to give an opinion an opinion she stressed on how and why and who he is psychologically with that you may be a step closer to stopping him so she didnt promise miracles it helped harris to relax out of the corner of his eye he saw ben watching her steadily one finger idly stroking down her raincoat sit down paris he said mildly the mayor gave you some data he asked the psychiatrist a bit i started on it last night youll want to take a look at these reports as well taking a folder from his desk harris passed it to her thank you tess pulled out a pair of tortoiseshell glasses from her bag and opened the folder a shrink ben thought again as he studied her profile she looked like she should be leading cheers at a varsity game or sipping cognac at the mayflower he wasnt certain why both images seemed to suit her but they did it was the image of mind doctor that didnt psychiatrists were tall and thin and pale with calm eyes calm voices calm hands he remembered the psychiatrist his brother had seen for three years after returning from nam josh had gone away a young freshfaced idealist hed come back haunted and belligerent the psychiatrist had helped or so it had seemed so everyone had said josh included until hed taken his service revolver and ended whatever chances hed had the psychiatrist had called it delayed stress syndrome until then ben hadnt known just how much he hated labels roderick brought in the coffee and managed not to look annoyed at being delegated gofer you bring in the dors kids harris asked him i was on my way paris and jacksonll brief you and lowenstein and bigsby in the morning after roll call he dismissed him with a nod as he dumped three teaspoons of sugar in his cup across the room ed winced tess accepted her cup with a murmur and never looked up should i assume that the murderer has more than average strength ben took out a cigarette and studied it why tess pushed her glasses down on her nose in a trick she remembered from a professor in college it was meant to demoralize other than the marks of strangulation there werent any bruises any signs of violence no torn clothing or signs of struggle ignoring his coffee ben drew on the cigarette none of the victims were particularly hefty barbara clayton was the biggest at fivefour and a hundred and twenty terror and adrenaline bring on surges of strength she countered your assumption from the reports is that he takes them by surprise from behind we assume that from the angle and location of the bruises i think i follow that she said briskly and pushed her glasses up again it wasnt easy to demoralize a clod none of the victims was able to scratch his face or thered have been cells of flesh under their nails have i got that right before he could answer she turned pointedly to ed so hes smart enough to want to avoid questionable marks it doesnt appear he kills sporadically but plans in an orderly even logical fashion their clothing she went on was it disturbed buttons undone seams torn shoes kicked off ed shook his head admiring the way she dove into details no maam all three were neat as a pin and the murder weapon the amice folded across the chest a tidy psychotic ben put in tess merely lifted a brow youre quick to diagnose detective paris but rather than tidy id use the word reverent by holding up a single ringer harris stopped bens retort could you explain that doctor i cant give you a thorough profile without some more study captain but i think i can give you a general outline the killers obviously deeply religious and id guess trained traditionally so youre going for the priest angle again she turned to ben the man may have been in a religious order at one time or simply have a fascination even a fear of the authority of the church his use of the amice is a symbol to himself to us even to his victims it might be used in a rebellious way but id rule that out by the notes since all three victims were of the same age group it tends to indicate that they represent some important female figure in his life a mother a wife lover sister someone who was or is intimate on an emotional level my feeling is this figure failed him in some way through the church a sin ben blew out a stream of smoke he mightve been a clod she mused but he wasnt stupid the definition of a sin varies she said coolly but yes a sin in his eyes probably a sexual one he hated the calm impersonal analysis so hes punishing her through other women she heard the derision in his voice and closed the folder no hes saving them ben opened his mouth again then shut it it made a horrible kind of sense thats the one aspect i find absolutely clear tess said as she turned back to harris its in the notes all of them the mans put himself in the role of savior from the lack of violence id say he has no wish to punish if it were revenge hed be brutal cruel and hed want them to be aware of what was going to happen to them instead he kills them as quickly as possible then tidies their clothes crosses the amice in a gesture of reverence and leaves a note stating that theyre saved taking off her glasses she twirled them by the eyepiece he doesnt rape them more than likely hes impotent with women but more important a sexual assault would be a sin possibly probably he derives some sort of sexual release from the killing but more a spiritual one a religious fanatic harris mused inwardly tess told him outwardly he probably functions normally for long periods of times the murders are spaced weeks apart so it would appear he has a level of control he could very well hold down a normal job socialize attend church church ben rose and paced to the window regularly id think its his focal point if this man isnt a priest he takes on the aspects of one during the murders in his mind hes ministering absolution ben murmured the last rites intrigued tess narrowed her eyes exactly not knowing much about the church ed turned to another topic a schizophrenic tess frowned down at her glasses as she shook her head schizophrenia manic depression split personality labels are too easily applied and tend to generalize she didnt notice that ben turned back and stared at her she pushed her glasses back in their case and dropped them in her purse every psychiatric disorder is a highly individual problem and each problem can only be understood and dealt with by uncovering its dynamic sources id rather work with specifics myself harris told her but theres a premium on them in this case are we dealing with a psychopath her expression changed subtly impatience ben thought noting the slight line between her brows and a quick movement of her mouth then she was professional again if you want a general term psychopathy will do it means mental disorder ed stroked his beard so hes insane insanity is a legal term detective this was said almost primly as tess picked up the folder and rose once hes stopped and taken to trial thatll become an issue ill have a profile for you as soon as possible captain it might help if i could see the notes that were left on the bodies and the murder weapons dissatisfied harris rose he wanted more though he knew better he wanted a b and c and the lines connecting each detective parisll show you whatever you need to see thank you dr court she took his hand youve little to thank me for at this point detective paris right this way with a cursory nod he led her out he said nothing as he took her through the corridors again and to the checkpoint where they signed in to examine the evidence tess was silent as well as she studied the notes and the neat precise printing they didnt vary and were exact to the point that they seemed almost like photostats the man whod written them she mused hadnt been in a rage or in despair if anything hed been at peace it was peace he sought and peace in his twisted way he sought to give white for purity she murmured after shed looked at the amices a symbol perhaps she mused but for whom she turned away from the notes more than the murder weapons they chilled her it appears hes a man with a mission ben remembered the sick frustration hed felt after each murder but his voice was cool and flat you sound sure of yourself doctor do i turning back she gave him a brief survey mulled things over then went on impulse what time are you off duty detective he tilted his head not quite certain of his moves ten minutes ago good she pulled on her coat you can buy me a drink and tell me why you dislike my profession or just me personally i give you my word no tabletop analysis something about her challenged him the cool elegant looks the strong sophisticated voice maybe it was the big soft eyes hed think about it later no fee she laughed and stuck her hat in her pocket we might have hit the root of the problem i need my coat as they walked back to the squad room each of them wondered why they were about to spend part of their evening with someone who so obviously disapproved of who and what they were but then each of them was determined to come out on top before the evening was over ben grabbed his coat and scrawled something in a ledger charlie tell ed im engaged in further consultation with dr court you file that requisition ben shifted tess almost like a shield and headed for the door file damn it ben tomorrow in triplicate he had himself and tess out of earshot and nearly to the outer door dont care much for paperwork she said he pushed the door open and saw the rain had turned to a damp drizzle its not the most rewarding part of the job what is he gave her an enigmatic look as he steered her toward his car catching bad guys oddly enough she believed him ten minutes later they walked into a dimly lit bar where the music came from a jukebox and the drinks werent watered it wasnt one of washingtons most distinguished night spots nor one of its seamiest it seemed to tess a place where the regulars knew each other by name and newcomers were accepted gradually ben sent the bartender a careless wave exchanged a muffled word with one of the cocktail waitresses and found a table in the back here the music was muted and the lights even dimmer the table rocked a bit on one shortened leg the minute he sat down he relaxed this was his turf and he knew his moves whatll you have he waited for her to ask for some pretty white wine with a french name scotch straight up stolichnaya he told the waitress as he continued to watch tess rocks he waited until the silence stretched out ten seconds then twenty an interesting silence he thought full of questions and veiled animosity maybe hed throw her a curve you have incredible eyes she smiled and leaned back comfortably i would have thought youd come up with something more original ed liked your legs im surprised he could see them from his height hes not like you she observed i imagine you make an impressive team leaving that aside detective paris im interested in why you distrust my profession why when her drink was served she sipped it slowly it warmed in places the coffee hadnt touched curiosity it comes with the territory after all were both in the business of looking for answers solving puzzles you see our jobs as similar the thought made him grin cops and shrinks perhaps i find your job as unpleasant as you find mine she said mildly but theyre both necessary as long as people dont behave in what society terms normal patterns i dont like terms he tipped back his drink i dont have much confidence in someone who sits behind a desk probing peoples brains then putting their personalities into slots well she sipped her drink again and heard the music turn to something dreamy by lionel richie thats how you term psychiatrists yeah she nodded i suppose you have to tolerate a great deal of bigotry in your profession as well something dangerous flashed in his eyes then it was gone just as quickly your point doctor she tapped a finger on the table the only outward sign of emotion he had an admirable capacity for stillness she had already noticed that in harriss office yet she sensed a restlessness in him it was difficult not to appreciate the way he held it in check all right detective paris why dont you make your point after swirling his vodka he set it down without drinking okay maybe i see you as someone raking in bucks off frustrated housewives and bored executives everything harks back to sex or mother hating you answer questions with questions and never raise a sweat fifty minutes goes by and you click over to the next file when someone really needs help when someones desperate it gets passed over you label it file it and go on to the next hour for a moment she said nothing because under the anger she heard grief it mustve been a very bad experience she murmured im sorry uncomfortable he shifted no tabletop analysis he reminded her a very bad experience she thought again but he wasnt a man who wanted sympathy all right lets try a different angle youre a homicide detective i guess all you do all day is twowheel it down dark alleys with guns blazing you dodge a few bullets in the morning slap the cuffs on in the afternoon then read the suspect his rights and haul him in for interrogation is that general enough for you a reluctant smile touched him mouth pretty clever arent you so ive been told it wasnt like him to make absolute judgments of someone he didnt know his innate sense of fair play struggled with a long ingrained prejudice he signaled for another drink whats your first name im tired of calling you dr court yours is ben she gave him a smile that made him focus on her mouth again teresa no he shook his head thats not what youre called teresas too ordinary terry doesnt have enough class she leaned forward and dropped her chin on her folded hands you might be a good detective after all its tess tess he tried it out slowly then nodded very nice tell me tess why psychiatry she watched him a moment admiring the easy way he sprawled in his seat not indolent she thought not sloppy just relaxed she envied that curiosity she said again the human mind is full of unanswered questions i wanted to find the answers if you can find the answers you can help sometimes heal the mind ease the heart it touched him the simplicity ease the heart he repeated and thought of his brother no one had been able to ease his you think if you heal one you can ease the other its the same thing tess looked beyond him to a couple who huddled laughing over a pitcher of beer i thought all you got paid to do was look in heads her lips curved a little but her eyes still focused beyond him the mind the heart and the soul canst thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuffd bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart hed lifted his gaze from his drink as shed spoken her voice remained quiet but hed stopped hearing the juke the clatter the laughter macbeth when she smiled at him he shrugged cops read too tess lifted her glass in what might have been a toast maybe we should both reevaluate it was still drizzling when they turned back into the parking lot at headquarters the gloom had brought the dark quickly so that puddles shone beneath streetlights and the sidewalks were wet and deserted washington kept early hours shed waited until now to ask him what shed wondered all evening ben why did you become a cop i told you i like catching bad guys the seed of truth was there she thought but not the whole so you grew up playing cops and robbers and decided to keep right on playing i always played doctor he pulled up beside her car and set the brake it was educational im sure then why the switch to public service he couldve been glib he couldve evaded part of his charm for women was his ability to do both with an easy smile somehow for once he wanted to tell the simple truth all right now ive a quote for you the law is but words and paper without the hands and swords of men with a half smile he turned to see her studying him calmly words and paper arent my way of handling things and the sword is thats right he leaned over to open her door their bodies brushed but neither acknowledged the physical tug i believe in justice tess its a hell of a lot more than words on paper she sat a moment digesting there was violence in him ordered and controlled perhaps the word was trained but it was violence nonetheless hed certainly killed something her education and personality completely rejected hed taken lives risked his own and he believed in law and order and justice just as he believed in the sword he wasnt the simple man shed first pegged him to be it was a lot to learn in one evening more than enough she thought and slid aside well thanks for the drink detective as she pushed out of the car ben was out on the other side dont you have an umbrella she sent him an easy smile as she dug for her keys i never carry it when it rains hands in his back pockets he sauntered over to her for reasons he couldnt pinpoint he was reluctant to let her go wonder what a head doctor would make of that you dont have one either good night ben he knew she wasnt the shallow overeducated sophisticate hed labeled her he found himself holding her door open after shed slid into the drivers seat ive got this friend who works at the kennedycenter he passed me a couple of tickets for the noel coward play tomorrow night interested it was on the tip of her tongue to refuse politely oil and water didnt mix neither did business and pleasure yes im interested because he wasnt sure how he felt about her agreement he just nodded ill pick you up at seven when he slammed her door shut she rolled down the window dont you want my address he sent her a cocky smile she shouldve detested im a detective when he strolled back to his car tess found herself laughing by ten the rain had stopped absorbed in the profile she was compiling tess didnt notice the quiet or the dull light from the moon the takeout chinese had slipped her mind and her dinner of a roast beef sandwich was half eaten and forgotten fascinating she read over the reports again fascinating and chilling how did he choose his victims she wondered all blond all late twenties all small to medium builds who did they symbolize to him and why did he watch them follow them did he choose them arbitrarily maybe the hair color and build were simply coincidence any woman alone at night could end up being saved no it was a pattern she was sure of it somehow he selected each victim because of general physical appearance then he managed to peg her routine three killings and he hadnt made one mistake he was ill but he was methodical blond late twenties small to medium build she found herself staring at her own vague reflection in the window hadnt she just described herself the knock at the door jolted her then she cursed her foolishness she checked her watch for the first time since shed sat down and saw shed worked for three hours straight another two and she might have something to give captain harris whoever was at the door was going to have to make it quick letting her glasses drop on the pile of papers she went to answer grandpa annoyance evaporated as she rose on her toes to kiss him with the gusto hed helped instill in her life he smelled of peppermint and old spice and carried himself like a general youre out late late his voice boomed it always had off the walls of the kitchen where he fried up fresh fish at a ball game where he cheered for whatever team suited his whim on the floor of the senate where hed served for twentyfive years its barely ten im not ready for a lap robe and warm milk yet little girl fix me a drink he was already in and shrugging his sixfoot linemans frame out of his coat he was seventytwo tess thought as she glanced at the wild mane of white hair and leathered face seventytwo and he had more energy than the men she dated and certainly more interest maybe the reason she was still single and content to be so was because she had such high standards in men she poured him three fingers of scotch he looked over at the desk piled with papers and folders and notes that was his tess he thought as he took the glass from her always one to dig in her heels and get the job done he didnt miss the halfeaten sandwich either that was also his tess so he tossed back scotch what do you know about this maniac weve got on our hands senator tess used her most professional voice as she sat on the arm of a chair you know i cant discuss this with you bullshit i got you the job for which im not going to thank you he gave her one of his steely looks veteran politicians had been known to cringe from it ill get it from the mayor anyway instead of cringing tess offered her sweetest smile from the mayor then damn ethics he muttered you taught them to me he grunted pleased with her what about captain harris an opinion she sat a moment brooding as she did when gathering her thoughts competent controlled hes angry and frustrated and under a great deal of pressure but he manages to keep it all on a leash what about the detectives in charge of the case paris and jackson she ran the tip of her tongue along her teeth they struck me as an unusual pair yet very much a pair jackson looks like a mountain man he asked typical questions but he listens very well he strikes me as the methodical type paris she hesitated not as sure of her ground hes restless and i think more volatile intelligent but more instinctive than methodical or maybe more emotional she thought of justice and a sword are they competent i dont know how to judge that grandpa if i went on impression id say theyre dedicated but even thats only an impression the mayor has a great deal of faith in them he downed the rest of his scotch and in you she focused on him again eyes grave i dont know if its warranted this mans very disturbed grandpa dangerous i may be able to give them a sketch of his mind his emotional pattern but that isnt going to stop him guessing games rising she stuck her hands in her pockets its all just a guessing game its always just a guessing game tess you know there are no guarantees no absolutes she knew but she didnt like it she never had he needs help grandpa hes screaming for it but no one can hear him he put a hand under his chin hes not your patient tess no but im involved when she saw the frown crease his brow she changed her tone dont start worrying im not going to go overboard you told me that once about a box full of kittens they ended up costing me more than a good suit she kissed his cheek again then picked up his coat and you loved every one of them now ive got work to do kicking me out just helping you with your coat she corrected good night grandpa behave yourself little girl she closed the door on him remembering hed been telling her the same thing since she was five the church was dark and empty but it hadnt been difficult for him to deal with the lock nor did he feel hed sinned in doing so churches werent meant to be locked gods house was meant to be open for the needy for the troubled for the reverent he lit the candles four of them one for each of the women hed saved and the last for the woman he hadnt been able to save dropping to his knees he prayed and his prayers were desperate sometimes only sometimes when he thought of the mission he doubted a life was sacred hed taken three and knew the world looked on him as a monster if those he worked with knew theyd scorn him put him in prison detest him pity him but flesh was transient a life was only sacred because of the soul it was the soul he saved the soul he must continue to save until hed balanced the scales doubting he knew was a sin in itself if only he had someone to talk to if only there were someone to understand to give him comfort a wave of despair washed over him hot and thick giving in would have been a relief there was no one no one he could trust no one to share this burden when the voice was silent he was so alone hed lost laura laura had lost herself and taken pieces of him with her the best pieces sometimes when it was dark when it was quiet he could see her she never laughed anymore her face was so pale so full of pain lighting candles in empty churches would never wipe away the pain or the sin she was in the dark waiting when his mission was complete only then would she be free the smell of votive candles burning the hushed silence of church and the silhouettes of statues soothed him here he might find hope and a place hed always found such comfort in the symbols of religion and the boundaries lowering his head to the rail he prayed more fervently as hed been taught he prayed for the grace to accept whatever trials were ahead of him when he rose the candlelight flickered over the white collar at his throat he blew them out and it was dark again chapter washington traffic could tear at the nerves especially when youd woken up sluggish primed yourself with coffee then handled backtoback appointments tess inched along behind a pinto with a faulty exhaust and simmered through another red light beside her a man in a big blue gmc revved his engine it disappointed him when she didnt bother to glance over she was worried about joey higgins two months of therapy and she wasnt any closer to the real problem or more accurately the real answer a fourteenyearold boy shouldnt be clinically depressed but out playing third base today shed felt hed been on the verge of really opening up to her on the verge tess thought with a sigh but he hadnt yet crossed the line building his confidence his selfesteem was like building the pyramids step by agonizing step if she could just get to the point where she had his full trust she fought her way across town while concern for a sullen young boy with bitterness in his eyes weighed on her there were so many other things too many other things tess knew she didnt have to sacrifice her lunch hour and hand deliver the profile to captain harris she had been under no obligation to work on it until two am either but found it impossible not to something pushed at her instinct hunch superstition she couldnt have said which all she knew was that she was involved with the faceless killer as deeply as with any of her patients the police needed whatever assistance she could give to help them understand him and needed to understand him in order to catch him he had to be caught so he could be helped as she pulled into the stations lot she took a quick scan no mustang but then she reminded herself as she stepped out of her car that wasnt why shed come then again she wasnt sure why shed agreed to go out with ben paris since she considered him arrogant and difficult and her workload was jamming up with the extra time she was taking on the homicides she knew if she put in a couple of hours that evening she could have things running fairly smoothly again several times that day she had thought about phoning him and begging off whats more dating wasnt something tess approached with much enthusiasm the singles scene was a tough nasty circle that usually left everyone involved frustrated or frazzled she was automatically put off by the slick hereiam arentyoulucky type frank nor did she have any illusions about the fanatically casual letsnottalkcommitment sort like the public defender shed seen occasionally last spring it wasnt that men didnt interest her it was simply that most of the men shed met couldnt hold her interest when your expectations were high disappointment came easily all in all it was easier to stay home with an old movie or a fat briefcase but she wasnt going to beg off tess told herself it would be rude to break a date on such short notice even a date she knew had been made on impulse by both parties shed go enjoy the play then say good night shed work over the weekend when she walked into homicide she took a quick look at who was sitting at a desk who was walking from place to place someone had his head stuck in a small scarred refrigerator but when he straightened he was a stranger ben wasnt there but she saw a variety of styles in the cops who were suits and ties jeans and sweaters boots and sneakers the one thing that seemed universal was the shoulder holster it seemed to her to fall far short of the glamor of the sword a glance at harriss office showed her it was empty dr court she stopped and looked over at a man just rising from a typewriter yes im detective roderick if youre looking for captain harris hes in a meeting with the chief i see he was the suitandtie sort she observed though his jacket was slung over the back of his chair his tie was neat and straight she decided ben would never wear one is he expected back yes if youd like to wait he shouldnt be too much longer he grinned remembering the day before i can get you some coffee ah she looked at her watch her next patient was due in forty minutes it would take her half of that to get back to her office no thanks i dont have much time myself i have a report for the captain the profile you can give it to me when he saw her hesitation he went on im assigned to the case dr court sorry id appreciate it if you could see captain harris gets this as soon as he comes in unzipping her briefcase tess drew out the file if he has any questions he can reach me in my office until five then at home until seven i dont suppose you can tell me if theres been any progress i wish i could at this point were going back over the same ground hoping we missed something the first halfadozen times tess glanced at the file and wondered if he could really understand the man shed written about could anyone dissatisfied she nodded and handed over the file it looked harmless but so did a bomb at rest thank you a lady he thought you began to miss seeing the real thing in this line of work sure you have a message for the captain no everythings in the file thanks again detective lowenstein waited until tess was out of earshot that the psychiatrist roderick ran the folder through his fingers before he set it on his desk yeah brought in the profile for harris looks like harpers bazaar lowenstein murmured classy though i heard she left with paris last night with a chuckle she gave roderick a pat on the arm she raise your blood pressure lou embarrassed he shrugged i was thinking of something else lowenstein stuck her tongue in her cheek sure well i hope she knows her stuff better than a ouija board i guess she flung her bag over her shoulder bigsby and i are going to interview some of the regulars at dougs keep the home fires burning bring back a lead maggie roderick dropped back in his chair or we might just have to haul out the ouija board tess had turned the second corner when she heard someone cursing when she looked back she saw ben giving a vending machine a hefty kick sonofabitch ben ed put a hand on his shoulder thats stuffs poison to your system forget it your bodyll thank you ive got fifty cents in there putting his hands on either side of the machine ben shook it and swore again fifty fucking cents is robbery in the first place for a skinny piece of chocolate and a few nuts you oughta try raisins ed suggested natural sugar full of iron ben gritted his teeth i hate raisins nothing but dried grapes detective paris unable to resist tess had backtracked down the corridor do you always have fights with inanimate objects he turned his head but didnt loosen his grip on the machine when they hassle me he gave the machine another violent shake but he looked at her she wasnt wet today he noticed and shed pinned her hair up and back in a cool sleek style that made him think of elegant pastries under crystal maybe she thought it was professional but it made his mouth water you look good doc thank you hello detective jackson maam he put a hand back on bens shoulder i cant tell you how embarrassed i am for my partner thats perfectly all right im used to behavioral problems shit ben gave the machine one last shove then turned away from it the first chance he got he was going to pick the lock were you looking for me tess thought of her scan of the parking lot then the squad room she decided on tact rather than truth no i brought in the profile for captain harris you work fast if id had more to work with it wouldve taken longer with a movement of her shoulders she expressed both acceptance and dissatisfaction i dont know how much help ive been id like to do more our job ben reminded her hi guys lowenstein passed by and stuck change in the vending machine in fact she wanted a closer look at the psychiatrist more than she wanted candy she would have bet a weeks pay the rosecolored suit was silk that suckers defective ben told her but when she pulled the handle two candy bars dropped into the tray two for one lowenstein said plopping both in her bag see you later wait a minute you dont want to make a scene in front of dr court ed reminded him lowensteins got my property youre better off sugarll kill you this is all fascinating tess said dryly as she watched ben glare at lowensteins back but im pressed for time i want you to know that i had a suggestion its included in my report to the captain ben stuck his hands in his pockets and looked back at her which is you need a priest weve gone that route doctor ed and ive interviewed a dozen of them with experience in psychiatry tess finished ive given you what i can but im not qualified to probe deeply into the religious angle and that in my judgment is the key her glance skimmed over ed but she knew whose opinion she had to sway i could research catholicism but it would take time i dont think any of us wants to waste that i know of a doctor at catholic university monsignor logan he has an excellent reputation in the church and in psychiatric medicine i want to consult with him the more people we consult with ben put in the more chance there is of a leak we cant let the specifics get to the press and if you dont try something else your investigations going to stay right where it is stagnant she saw the annoyance and rolled over it i could go to the mayor put on the pressure but thats not the way i want to handle it i want you to back me on this ben he rocked back on his heels another shrink he thought and a priest at that but as much as he hated to admit it the investigation was stagnant if she wanted to pull a rabbit out of her hat they might as well look it over ill talk to the captain the smile came easily after victory thanks she pulled out her wallet and dropped change into the machine behind him after brief consideration she pulled a handle with a quiet plop a hershey bar dropped into the tray here you go solemneyed she handed it to ben you really broke my heart nice to see you again detective jackson my pleasure maam a grin split his face as he watched her walk away handles herself real well doesnt she scowling ben tossed the candy bar from hand to hand oh yeah he murmured like a pro it wasnt like her to fuss about clothes the truth was her wardrobe had been meticulously chosen down to the last cashmere sweater and linen blazer for the specific reason that tess didnt have the patience to debate each morning about what to wear for the most part she stuck with classic styles and blendable colors because they looked best on her and it made it simple to put her hand in her closet and draw out the next thing in line on harried mornings but she wasnt dressing for the office as tess shoved the third dress back on the hanger she reminded herself she wasnt dressing for prince charming either at twentynine she knew there were no princes nor did a rational woman want an ivory tower an uncomplicated date with an attractive man who made you think on your feet was a different matter and ben paris certainly made her think a glance at her watch warned her she was doing so much thinking she was going to be late standing in a brief fleshcolored teddy she took out a black silk dress and gave it a critical study simple but elegant a wise choice she decided and she didnt have time to fool around anymore she slipped it on and did up the range of buttons that ran from waist to neck another long survey in the cheval glass brought a nod of approval yes she thought this was better than the ice blue shed started with or the raspberry georgette shed just rejected she settled on her mothers diamond studs and the thin gold bracelet her grandfather had given her when shed earned her degree she debated about sweeping her hair up but the knock on the door decided for her it had to stay down she hadnt expected he could look elegant but when she opened the door his steelgray suit and salmoncolored shirt proved her wrong still shed been right about the tie his collar was open she started to smile at him then saw the clutch of violets in his hand it wasnt like her to be tossed so off balance but when she looked back up at him she felt like a teenager with her first handful of wilted flowers peace offering ben told her feeling every bit as unsettled and out of character as tess he shouldnt have been he told himself since he was used to making grandiose or impulsive gestures with the women he dated it was his way tracking down a nosegay of violets in october hadnt seemed a foolish thing to do until hed stood there offering them theyre lovely thank you regaining her balance she smiled at him accepting the flowers as she stood back to let him in the scent reminded her of the spring that was so far on the other side of winter ill get a vase as she walked into the kitchen ben looked around he saw the matisse print the turkish rugs the neat petit point pillows soft pretty colors and old distinguished wood it was a room that spoke of quiet generational wealth what the hell are you doing here he asked himself her grandfathers a senator yours was a butcher she grew up with servants and your mother still scrubs her own john she graduated with honors from smith and you crammed your way through two years of college before the academy oh hed researched her all right that was also his way and he was dead sure theyd run out of conversation after fifteen minutes when she came back in she carried the violets in a small wedgwood vase ill offer you a drink but i dont have any stolichnaya its all right he made the decision without weighing pros and cons hed learned to trust his instincts while she set the violets in the center of a table he walked to her and took her hair in his hand she turned slowly no jerking no surprise and met the long silent look with one of her own she smelled of paris he remembered the five days hed spent there in his twenties going on a shoestring and optimism hed fallen in love with it the look the smells the air every year he promised himself hed go back and find whatever it was hed been looking for i like it better down he said at length and let his fingers linger a moment longer when you had it up this afternoon you looked remote inaccessible tension snapped into her the ripe manwoman tension she hadnt felt with anyone in years hadnt wanted to she still didnt want to professional she corrected and took an easy step back would you like that drink he thought about making a long thin slice through her control what would it be like but if he did he might find his aim off and slice his own well get one at the theater theres enough time before the curtain get my coat he seemed as familiar with the staff at the roof terrace as hed been with those in the smoky little bar the night before tess watched the way he spoke to this one greeted that one the ease the casual intimacy so he wasnt a loner she concluded except when he chose to be she admired someone who could be at ease with people without worrying about impressions opinions to be that way you first had to be at ease with yourself somehow as content as she was with her lifestyle shed never quite gotten there ben picked up his glass stretched out his legs and stared back at her got me figured out yet not completely she picked up an almond from the bowl on the table and chewed it thoughtfully but i think you do if more people understood themselves the way you do id have to look for a different line of work and youre very good at what you do he watched her choose another almond with long slim fingers an antique pearl gleamed dully on her right hand class valedictorian he began and watched her hand stop a private practice thats growing too fast for you to keep up with it you just turned down an offer to join the psychiatric staff at bethesda naval but you work once a week in the donnerly clinic in south east for no fee his mild rundown annoyed her tess was accustomed to knowing more about the people she associated with than they knew of her do you always do background checks on a date detective habit he said easily you spoke about curiosity yourself last night senator jonathan writemores your maternal grandfather a little left of center outspoken charismatic and tough as nails hell be pleased you said so you lost your parents when you were fourteen im sorry he lifted his drink again its always hard to lose family i she caught the tone the empathy that told her hed lost someone too my grandfather made a difference i may not have recovered without him how did you find out so much cops dont reveal a source i read your profile she stiffened a bit expecting criticism and you feel our mans intelligent yes cunning he leaves what he chooses behind but no trail after a moment ben nodded what you said made sense im interested in how you came to the conclusions tess took a sip of her drink before answering she wouldnt ask herself why it was important she make him understand it simply was i take facts the pattern he leaves behind you can see its almost identical each time he doesnt vary i suppose in your business you call it an mo he smiled a little as he nodded yeah the pattern forms a picture a psychological picture youre trained to look for clues evidence motives and apprehend im trained to look for reasons causes then to treat to treat ben she repeated meeting his eyes not to judge he lifted a brow and you think thats what im doing you want him she said simply yeah i want him off the streets and in a cage he crushed out a cigarette slowly methodically it was a measure of control but his hands were strong you want him punished i understand that even if i dont agree youd rather open his head and make him all better christ he tossed back his drink you dont want to let your heart bleed over a man like this compassions part of my business she said tightly hes ill desperately ill if you read my profile and understood it youd know what he does he does in pain he strangles women if it hurts him to tie a knot around their necks it doesnt make them any less dead ive got compassion tess for the families of those women ive had to talk to i have to look at their faces when they ask me why i dont have an answer im sorry she reached for his hand without thinking her fingers closed over his its a hideous job one that wakes you up at night ive had to talk to families the ones left stunned and bitter after a suicide she felt his hand tense and soothed automatically when you lie awake at three am you still see the questions in their eyes and the grief ben she leaned toward him needing to draw him closer i have to think like a doctor on this i could give you clinical terms impulse disorder functional psychoses whatever label we use it equals illness this man isnt killing for revenge or for profit but in despair and i have to think like a cop its my job to stop him thats the bottom line he was silent a moment then pushed his drink aside we talked about your monsignor logan harris is checking it out thats good thank you dont i havent a lot of faith in the idea she drew back with a little sigh we dont have any common ground do we maybe not but he remembered how small and warm her hand had been on his maybe we just havent found it yet what do you like to do on a saturday afternoon she asked abruptly sit down with a beer and watch the ball game she wrinkled her nose that wont work what about music he grinned what about it what do you like depends i like rock when im driving jazz when im drinking and mozart on sunday mornings were getting closer how about jelly roll morton surprised he grinned again yeah and springsteen he caught me with the river marvin gaye ben sat back and took another long look maybe weve got a start his leg brushed hers under the table wanna go back to my place and listen to my record collection detective paris tess chose one last almond trained psychiatrists dont fall for shopworn lines how about fresh ones such as have a late supper with me after the theater and well see who can remember more old beatle lyrics she flashed him a grin quick impulsive and totally unlike the careful smiles shed given him before youll lose and youre on do you know a guy with two thousand dollars worth of caps on his teeth and a brooks brothers suit her brows drew together is this a quiz too late hes coming over who oh hello frank tess didnt expect to see you here he patted the hand of the pencilslim exotic woman at his side lorraine this is dr teresa court an associate of mine obviously bored and earning tesss sympathy the woman held out a hand so happy to meet you her gaze slid easily over tess and latched on to ben hello his smile was slow and though his eyes never left her face he took in every detail hello im ben tess you shouldve told me you were coming wed have made a party of it frank said lorraine tilted her head as she looked at ben maybe the night could be salvaged after all she thought theres always after the play lorraine said there certainly is ben murmured and earned a swift kick from tess under the table his smile never wavered but tess and i have to make an early night of it business sorry frank well have to do it another time knowing escape was always in doubt tess was already up see you around the office bye lorraine heres your hat whats your hurry ben mumbled as he followed her out if you knew what i knew youd thank me your ah colleague has better taste in women than he does in ties really tess made a business of brushing her coat smooth as they walked i thought she was rather obvious yeah ben cast a look over his shoulder uhhuh obvious some men like cleavage and mink eyelashes i suppose some men are animals she was his second choice tess heard herself saying i turned him down first is that so intrigued ben slowed her down by swinging an arm over her shoulders he asked you to the coward thing and you turned him down thats right im flattered she shot him a look his ego didnt need any help from her i only said yes to you because youre not perfect hmm when did he ask you yesterday afternoon it didnt seem to put his nose out of joint that you turned him down and were here with me uncomfortable tess shifted under his arm i told him i had a date oh you lied he said it with such pleasure she laughed im not perfect either that makes things easier the early night ben had spoken of ended at two am when they walked down the corridor to tesss apartment im going to hate myself in the morning tess said over a yawn i havent even asked you to go to bed yet the yawn ended on a muffled laugh i was thinking about drinking a half bottle of wine and five hours sleep she stopped at her door and turned to lean against it i didnt expect to have such a good time neither had he why dont we try it again maybe we wont she thought about it for three full seconds all right when theres a bogart festival tomorrow night across town the maltese falcon and the big sleep she smiled comfortably sleepy okay when he stepped closer she waited for him to kiss her if the idea warmed her she thought it only natural the desire to be held and touched was a human one her eyes half closed and her heart beat just a little faster youve got to replace this mickey mouse lock her lashes fluttered up again what your door lock tess is a joke he traced a finger down her nose pleased to see confusion if youre going to live in a building without security youd better make sure youve got a dead bolt on your door dead bolt with a half laugh she straightened and reached for her keys i cant argue with a cop glad to hear it he put his hands over hers and kissed her before shed prepared herself again later when she could think straight shed wonder if hed planned it that way it was silly to believe that a kiss as gentle as easy as this one could send shock waves through the body blood didnt really heat and the mind didnt really swim she knew better but felt it anyway touching nothing but her hands he took her under his mouth was clever but shed suspected as much his lips were warm soft and he used his teeth to add a nip of excitement they scraped over her lip before his tongue slid over hers she told herself it was the late hour the wine the relaxation but she gave herself to the moment without any of the caution she was prone to she was supposed to be cool a little aloof hed expected it he hadnt expected the heat the passion or the sweetness that poured from her into him he hadnt expected the immediate intimacy of longtime lovers he knew women well or thought he had tess was a mystery to him that demanded solving desire was familiar to him something else hed thought he understood well but he couldnt remember ever having it ram into him and take his breath away he wanted her now instantly desperately ordinarily hed have followed through it was natural for reasons he couldnt begin to understand he backed away from her for a moment they just stared at each other this could be a problem he managed to say after a few seconds yeah she swallowed and concentrated on the cool metal of the keys in her hand put on the security chain okay ill see you tomorrow she missed the keyhole by a quarter inch on the first try and swore as she stuck it in on the second good night ben good night he waited until he heard the click of the lock and the rattle of chain before he turned and walked down the hall a problem he thought again one hell of a problem hed been walking for hours when he let himself into his apartment he was almost too tired to stand in the past few months he found he slept dreamlessly only if he exhausted himself first it wasnt necessary to turn on a light he knew the way ignoring the need to rest he went past his bedroom sleep would come only after hed completed this last duty the room beyond was always locked when he opened it he drew in the faint feminine scent of the fresh flowers he put there daily the priests robe hung by the closet door draped over it the amice was a slash of white striking a match he lit the first candle then another and another until the shadows waved on the pristine surface of the altar cloth there was a picture there in a silver frame of a young woman blond and smiling forever shed been captured young innocent and happy pink roses had been her favorite and it was their scent that mixed with the burning candles in smaller frames were the carefully clipped newspaper prints of three other women carla johnson barbara clayton francie bowers folding his hands he knelt before them there were so many others he thought so many hed only just begun chapter the boy sat across from tess quiet and sullen he didnt fidget or look out of the window he rarely did instead he sat in the chair and looked down at his own knees his hands lay spread on his thighs the fingers slender the knuckles a bit enlarged from nervous cracking the nails were bitten down below the quick signs of nerves yet people often go through life well enough while cracking and snapping and chewing on themselves it was rare for him to look at the person he was speaking with or more accurately in his case the person speaking to him every time she managed to get him to make eye contact she felt both a small victory and a small pang there was so little she could see in his eyes for hed learned at a young age how to shield and conceal what she did see when she was given even that rare quick chance to look was not resentment not fear only a trace of boredom life had not played fair with joseph higgins jr and he wasnt taking any chances on being slipped another shot below the belt at his age when adults called the plays he chose isolation and noncommunication as defense against a lack of choice tess knew the symptoms lack of outward emotion lack of motivation lack of interest a lack somehow some way she had to find the trigger that would push him back to caring first about himself then the world around him he was too old for her to play games with too young for her to meet on the level of adult to adult she had tried both and hed accepted neither joey higgins had placed himself firmly in an inbetween space adolescence wasnt simply awkward for him it was miserable he was wearing jeans good solid jeans with the button fly raved about in the slick commercials and a gray sweatshirt with the maryland terrapin grinning across his chest his leather hightop nikes were trendy and new light brown hair was cut into moderate spikes around a too thin face outwardly he looked like an average fourteenyearold boy all the trappings were there inside he was a maze of confusion selfhate and bitterness that tess knew she hadnt even begun to touch it was unfortunate that instead of being a confidante a wailing wall or even a blank sheet of paper to him she was only one more authority figure in his life if just once hed broken out and shouted or argued with her she would have felt the sessions were progressing through them all he remained polite and unresponsive how are you feeling about school joey he didnt shrug it was as if even that movement might give away some of the feelings he kept locked so tightly inside okay okay id guess its always kind of tough to switch schools shed fought against that done everything in her power to persuade his parents not to make such a dramatic move at this point in his therapy bad companions they had said they were going to get him away from the people influencing him those whod drawn him toward alcohol a brief flirtation with drugs and an equally quick but more uneasy courtship with the occult his parents had only succeeded in alienating him and hacking away a little more at his selfesteem it hadnt been companions bad or otherwise who had taken joey on any of those journeys it was his own spiraling depression and search for an answer one he might believe was completely and uniquely his own because they no longer found joints in his dresser drawers or smelled liquor on his breath his parents were confident he was beginning to recover they couldnt see or wouldnt that he was still spiraling down quickly hed simply learned how to internalize it new schools can be an adventure tess went on when she received no response but its tough being the new kid its no big deal he murmured and continued to look at his knees im glad to hear that she said though she knew it was a lie i had to switch schools when i was about your age and i was scared to death he glanced up then not believing but interested he had dark brown eyes that should have been eloquently expressive instead they were guarded and wary nothing to be scared of its just a school why dont you tell me about it its just a school how about the other kids anyone interesting theyre mostly jerks oh hows that they sort of stand around together theres nobody i want to know no one he did know tess corrected the last thing hed needed at this point was to feel rejected by the school after losing the classmates hed been used to it takes time to make friends friends who count its harder to be alone joey than it is to try to find them i didnt want to transfer i know she was with him there someone had to be and i know its hard to feel as though you can be yanked around whenever the people who make the rules feel like changing them its not all that way joey your parents chose the school because they wanted the best for you you didnt want them to pull me out he glanced up again but so quickly she hardly caught the color of his eyes i heard mom talking as your doctor i felt you might be more comfortable in your old school your mother loves you joey transferring you wasnt a punishment but her way of trying to make things better for you she didnt want me to be with my friends but it wasnt said with bitterness simply flat acceptance no choice how do you feel about that she was afraid if i was around them id start drinking again im not drinking it was said not resentfully again not bitterly but wearily i know tess said and laid a hand on his arm you can be proud of yourself for pulling out for making the right choice i know how hard you have to work every day not to moms always blaming things that happen on somebody else what things just things like the divorce as usual a mention of it brought no response at all tess backtracked how do you feel about not riding the bus anymore buses stink your mothers taking you to school now yeah have you talked to your father hes busy he looked at tess with a touch of resentment mixed with a plea hes got a new job with this computer place but im going to be spending the weekend with him probably next month for thanksgiving how do you feel about that its going to be good the little boy was there briefly shining with hope were going to go to the redskins game hes going to get tickets on the fiftyyard line its going to be like it used to be like it used to be joey he looked down at his knees again but his brows had drawn together in anger its important to understand that things wont be like they used to different doesnt have to be bad sometimes change even when its hard can be the best for everyone i know you love your father you dont have to stop because youre not living with him he doesnt have a house anymore just a room he said if he didnt have to pay child support he could have a house she could have damned joseph higgins sr to hell but kept her voice firm and soft you understand that your father has a problem joey you are not the problem alcohol is we have a house he muttered if you didnt do you think your father would be happier no response he was staring at his shoes now im glad youre going to spend some time with your father i know youve missed him hes been busy yes too busy to see his son too busy to return the calls of the psychiatrist who was trying to heal the hurts sometimes adults can get pretty wrapped up in their lives you must know how difficult things are for your father now in a new job because youre in a new school im going to spend a weekend with him next month mom says not to depend on it but im going to your mother doesnt want you to be disappointed if something comes up hes going to come get me i hope so joey but if he doesnt joey she touched his arm again and through sheer force of will drew his gaze to hers if he doesnt you have to know that it isnt because of you but because of his illness yeah he agreed because agreeing was the quickest way to avoid a hassle tess knew it and wished not for the first time that she could convince his parents he needed more intensive therapy did your mother bring you today he continued to look down but the anger at least outwardly was gone my stepfather are you still getting along with him hes okay you know caring for him doesnt mean you care less for your father i said hes okay any pretty girls at your new school she wanted a smile from him any size any kind i guess guess maybe it was the smile in tesss voice that had him looking up again you look like you have good eyes to me maybe theres a couple and his lips did curve a little i dont pay much attention well theres time for that will you come back and see me next week i guess will you do me a favor in the meantime i said you had good eyes look at your mother and your stepfather he turned his head but she took his hand and held it joey she waited until those dark unreadable eyes were on hers again look at them theyre trying to help they may make mistakes but theyre trying because they care about you a lot of people do you still have my number dont you yeah i guess i do you know you can call me if you want to talk before next week she walked to the door of her office with him and watched as his stepfather rose and gave joey a big bluff smile he was a businessman successful easygoing and well mannered he was the antithesis of joeys father all done huh he glanced at tess and there was no smile only tension in his expression howd we do today dr court just fine mr monroe thats good thats good why dont we pick up some chinese joey surprise your mom okay he bundled into his school jacket the school he no longer attended leaving it unsnapped he turned back and looked at a point beyond tesss right shoulder bye dr court goodbye joey ill see you next week they were feeding him she thought as she shut her orifice door and he was starving they were clothing him but he was still cold she had the key but she had yet to be able to turn it so that it opened the lock with a sigh she walked back to her desk dr court tess answered her intercom as she slipped the joey higgins file into the briefcase beside her desk yes kate you had three calls while you were in session one from the post one from the sun and one from wttg three reporters tess slipped her earring off to gently rub her lobe all three wanted confirmation of your assignment to the priest homicides damn she dropped the earring on her blotter not available for comment kate yes ma am slowly she fastened the earring again shed been promised anonymity that had been part of her deal with the mayors office no media no hype no comment the mayor had given her his personal guarantee that she would be able to work without pressure from the press no use blaming the mayor tess reminded herself as she rose to pace to the window it had leaked and she would have to deal with it she didnt care for notoriety that was her problem she liked her life simple and private that too was her problem common sense had told her the whole business would come out before it was over but shed still taken the job if shed been advising one of her patients she would have told him to face the reality and deal with it one step at a time outside rush hour traffic was starting to heat up a few horns blasted but the sound was muffled by the window and distance joey higgins was out there riding for chinese takeout with the stepfather he refused to allow himself to trust or love bars were ready to serve the letshaveaquickonebeforedinner crowd day care centers were emptying and throngs of working mothers single parents and frazzled daddies were packing up preschoolers and threading their volvos and bmws through packs of other volvos and bmws with one thought in mind to get home to be safe and warm behind the doors and windows and walls of the familiar it was unlikely that any one of them gave any real thought to someone else who was out there someone with a small deadly bomb ticking away inside his head for a moment she wished she could join them in that easy nightly routine thinking only about a warm supper or the dentist bill but the priest file was already in her briefcase tess went back and picked up her briefcase the first step was to go home and make sure all her calls were screened by her answering service who leaked it ben demanded and blew out a stream of smoke were still working on it harris stood behind his desk studying the officers assigned to the task force ed slouched in a chair passing a bag of sunflower seeds from hand to hand bigsby with his large red face and burly hands tapped his foot lowenstein stood beside ben with her hands in her pockets roderick sat straight in his chair with his hands folded in his lap ben looked as though he would bare his teeth and snarl at the first wrong word what we have to do now is work with the situation the press knows dr court is involved instead of blocking them we use them weve been getting hammered in the press for weeks captain lowenstein put in things were just starting to ease off i read the papers detective he said it mildly bigsby shifted roderick cleared his throat and lowenstein shut her mouth tight well set up a press conference for tomorrow morning the mayors office is getting in touch with dr court paris jackson as heads of the team i want you there you know what information weve cleared for the press we dont have anything new for them captain ed pointed out make it sound new dr court should be enough to satisfy them set up the meeting with this monsignor logan he added shifting his gaze back to ben and keep this one under wraps more shrinks ben ground his cigarette out the first one hasnt told us anything we didnt know she told us hes on a mission lowenstein said quietly that even though things have been quiet for a while he isnt likely to be finished with it shes told us hes killing young blond women ben snapped back wed already figured that out give it a break ben ed murmured knowing the temper would be deflected on to him you give it a break the hands in bens pockets balled into fists that sonofabitch is just waiting to strangle the next woman whos in the wrong place at the wrong time and we sit around talking to psychiatrists and priests i dont give a damn about his soul or his psyche maybe we should roderick looked to the captain first then to ben look i know how you feel how i guess we all feel we just want him but weve all read dr courts profile we arent dealing with somebody whos just out for blood for kicks if were going to do our job i think wed better understand who he is you get a good look at the morgue photos lou we know who they are who they were all right paris you want to let off any more steam you go down to the gym harris waited a moment drawing the room together with his sense of authority alone hed been a good street cop he was a better desk cop knowing it only depressed him occasionally press conference is being set up for eight am mayors office i want a report on the meeting with monsignor logan on my desk tomorrow bigsby you keep working on where those damn scarfs came from lowenstein roderick go back and work on the family and friends of the victims now get out of here go get something to eat ed waited until theyd signed out covered the corridors and were crossing the parking lot its not doing you any good to take out what happened to your brother on dr court josh has nothing to do with this but the pain was still there he couldnt say his brothers name without it hurting his throat thats right and dr courts just doing a job like the rest of us thats fine i dont happen to think that her job has any connection with ours criminal psychiatry has become a viable working tool in the ed for christs sake youve got to stop reading those magazines stop reading stop learning want to go get drunk this from a man carrying sunflower seeds there was still tension along the back of his neck hed lost one brother but ed had come along and nearly filled the void not tonight anyway it embarrasses me when you have them pour all that fruit juice in with the vodka a mans got to think of his health hes also got to think of his reputation ben opened his car door then stood jingling his keys it was a cool night cool enough so that you could just see your breath if it rained before morning as the starless skies indicated it would come down in sleet in their tidy highceilinged row houses georgetowns affluent would be setting logs in the fireplace sipping irish coffees and enjoying the flames the street people were in for a long unpleasant night she bothers me ben said abruptly a woman looks like that shes bound to bother a man not that simple ben slid into his car and wished he could put his finger on it ill pick you up tomorrow seventhirty ben ed leaned over holding the door open tell her i said hi ben shut the door the rest of the way then gunned the engine partners got to know each other too well tess hung up the phone and with her elbows on the desk pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes joe higgins sr needed therapy as much as his son but he was too involved with destroying his life to see it the phone call had resolved nothing but then conversations with alcoholics on a binge rarely did hed just wept at the mention of his son and slurred a promise to phone tomorrow he wouldnt tess thought odds were he wouldnt even remember the conversation in the morning her treatment of joey hinged on the father and the father was glued to the bottle the same bottle that had destroyed his marriage lost him countless jobs and left him alone and miserable if she could get him to an aa meeting get him to take the first step tess let out a long breath as she dropped her hands hadnt joeys mother explained how many times shed tried how many years shed devoted to prying joseph higgins sr away from the bottle tess understood the womans bitterness respected her determination to resume her own life and bury the past but joey couldnt all through his childhood his mother had protected him shielded him from his fathers illness shed made excuses for the late nights and the lost jobs believing the truth should be hidden from the boy as a child joey had seen too much heard more then had taken his mothers explanations and excuses and built a wall of lies around his father lies he was determined to believe if his father drank then drinking was okay okay enough that at fourteen joey was already being treated for alcohol addiction if his father lost his job it was because his boss was jealous meanwhile joeys grades in school slid down and down as his respect for authority and himself diminished when joeys mother had no longer been able to tolerate the drinking and the break had come the lies broken promises and years of resentment had poured out shed heaped the fathers faults on the son in a desperate attempt to make him see the mistakes and not to blame her joey hadnt of course nor had he blamed his father there was only one person joey could blame and that was himself his family had broken apart hed been taken out of the home hed grown up in and his mother had gone to work hed floundered when mrs higgins had married again it was joeys stepfather who had pressed for counseling by the time tess had begun to see joey hed had thirteenandahalf years of guilt bitterness and pain to wade through in two months shed barely made a dent in the armor he wore in their private sessions or the family counseling twice a month with his mother and stepfather the rage swept through her so quickly she had to sit for several minutes and fight it off it wasnt her function to rage but to listen to question and to offer options compassion she was allowed to feel compassion but not anger so she sat with the anger backing up in her fighting against the control shed been born with then honed to a professional tool she wanted to kick something hit something strike out somehow at this hateful sense of hopelessness instead she picked up joeys file and began to make further notes on their afternoon session sleet had begun to fall she picked up her glasses but didnt look out of the window didnt see the man across the street standing on the curb and watching the light in her apartment if she had looked had seen she would have thought nothing of it just as when the knock came she thought of nothing but the annoyance of being interrupted her phone had rung incessantly but shed been able to ignore that and leave it to her answering service if one of the calls had been a patient the beeper beside her would have sounded the calls tess had guessed had all been connected with the article in the evenings paper linking her to the homicide investigation leaving the file open tess walked to the door who is it paris a lot could be gleaned from the tone of a voice even in one word tess opened the door knowing she opened it to a confrontation detective isnt it a little late for an official call just in time for the eleven oclock news he walked over and switched on her set she hadnt moved from the door havent you got a tv at home its more fun to watch a circus with company she shut the door peevish enough to let it slam look im working why dont you say what you have to say and let me get back to it he glanced over at her desk at the files open and her bigframed reading glasses tossed on them this wont take long he didnt sit but stood with his hands in his pockets watching the news teams intro it was the pretty heartshaped face brunette who read the evenings top story the mayors office confirmed today that dr teresa court noted washington psychiatrist has been assigned to the investigation team of the priest homicides dr court granddaughter of veteran senator jonathan writemore could not be reached for comment the murders of at least three women are suspected to be linked to the killer termed the priest because of his use of an amice a scarf used in ceremony by roman catholic priests to strangle his victims the police continue an investigation begun last august now with the assistance of dr court not bad ben murmured got your name mentioned three times he didnt even blink when tess strode over and slammed the button to off ill repeat say what you have to say her voice was cool he drew out a cigarette determined to match her we have a press conference at eight tomorrow in the mayors office i was notified youre to keep your comments general stay as far away from the specifics of the case as possible the press knows about the murder weapon but weve managed to keep the notes and the contents of them from leaking im not a fool ben i can handle an interview im sure you can this one happens to be on departmental business not personal glory her mouth opened but all that came out was a hiss of breath she knew it was both undignified and useless to lose her temper she knew that such a ridiculous and bitter statement deserved no answer she knew that he standing there in judgment deserved nothing but the coolest most controlled dismissal you bigoted smallbrained insensitive ass her phone rang again but they both ignored it who the hell do you think you are barging in here and tossing out your little gems of idiocy he glanced around for an ashtray and settled on a small handpainted dish there was a vase of fresh autumnal mums beside it which gem was that she stood straight as a soldier while he stood at ease and flicked ashes into the dish lets just get something straight i didnt leak this business to the press nobody said you did didnt they she stuffed her hands in the pockets of the skirt shed worked in for fourteen hours her back hurt her stomach was empty and she wanted what she struggled so hard to give her patients peace of mind well i interpret this little scene differently as a matter of fact i was promised my name would never be linked with this investigation got a problem letting people know youre cooperating with the police oh youre clever arent you as hell he returned fascinated by the complete annihilation of her control she paced as she spoke and her eyes had deepened to purple temper in her was rigid and icy unlike the venomspitting platethrowing sort he was more accustomed to it was all the more interesting either way i go youve got an answer did it ever occur to you detective that i might not care to have my patients my colleagues my friends question me about this case did it ever occur to you that i didnt want to take the case in the first place then why did you the pays lousy because i was persuaded to believe i could help if i didnt still think so id tell you to take your case and choke on it do you think i want to waste my time arguing with some narrowminded selfappointed judge about the morality of my profession i have enough problems in my life without you adding to them problems doc he took a slow sweep of the room the flowers the crystal the soft pastels things look pretty tidy around here to me you dont know anything about me my life or my work she walked over to her desk leaning her palms on it but still didnt regain control do you see these files these papers these tapes theres a fourteenyearold boys life there a boy whos already an alcoholic a boy who needs someone who can open him up enough to see his own worth his own place she whirled back again eyes dark and impassioned you know what it is to try to save a life dont you detective you know how it hurts how it frightens maybe i dont use a gun but thats just what im trying to do ive spent ten years of my life trying to learn how maybe with enough time enough skill enough luck ill be able to help him damn she stopped realizing how far shed allowed herself to be pushed by a few words i dont have to justify anything to you no you dont as he spoke he crushed out his cigarette in the little china dish im sorry i was out of line her breath came out with two hitches as she struggled to bring herself back what is it about what i do that makes you so bitter he wasnt ready to tell her to bring that old fleshedover scar out in the open for inspection and analysis instead he pressed his fingers to his own tired eyes its not you its the whole business makes me feel like im walking a very thin wire over a very long drop i guess i can accept that though it wasnt the whole answer or the one shed wanted its hard to stay objective right now lets take a step back for a minute i dont think much of what you do and i guess you dont think much of what i do she waited a minute then nodded agreed were stuck with it he walked over to her desk and picked up her half cup of coffee got any of this hot no i could make some never mind he brought his hand up to knead at the tension just above his eyebrows look i am sorry it seems like weve been running on this treadmill and the only progress weve made is a leak to the press i know you might not be able to understand but im as involved as you are now and i feel as responsible she paused again but this time she felt an affinity an empathy thats the hard part isnt it feeling responsible she was too damn good at her job ben thought as he leaned back against her desk ive got this feeling i cant shake that hes about through waiting to hit again were no closer to finding him doc we can bullshit the press some tomorrow but what we have to swallow is that were no closer you telling me why hes killing isnt going to help the next woman he homes in on i can only tell you what he looks like inside ben and i have to tell you i dont give a damn he turned away from her desk to face her she was calm again he could see it just by looking at her eyes when we get him and we will theyre going to take this psychiatric profile of yours theyre going to get other ones done then theyre going to put you or some other psychiatrist on the stand and hes going to get off hell be confined to a mental hospital thats not a picnic ben until a team of doctors diagnose him cured its not as simple as that you know the law better she dragged a hand through her hair he was right and so was she that only made things more difficult you dont lock someone up because he has cancer because he cant control the disintegration of his own body how can you punish someone without taking into consideration the disintegration of his mind ben schizophrenia alone disables more people for a longer time than cancer hundreds of thousands of people are confined to hospitals we cant turn our backs on them or burn them as witches because of a chemical imbalance in the brain he wasnt interested in statistics in reasons only in results you said it once doc insanitys a legal term crazy or not hes got his civil rights and hell be entitled to a lawyer and his lawyer will use that legal term id like to see you sit down with those three families after its done and talk about chemical imbalances see if you can convince them theyve gotten justice she had counseled victims families before knew too well the sense of betrayal and bitter helplessness it was a helplessness that without control could spill over to the healer youre the one with the sword ben not me i only have words yeah hed had them too and hed used them in a way he wasnt proud of he had to get out get home he wished he had a brandy and a woman waiting for him im setting up an appointment with monsignor logan tomorrow youll want to be there yes she crossed her arms and wondered why a bout of temper always left her so depressed i have appointments all day but i can cancel my four oclock not too crazy because hed made the effort so did she and smiled well let that pass ill see if i can schedule for fourthirty somebody will call you and set it up fine there seemed to be nothing left to say and perhaps more to say than either of them could deal with are you sure you dont want that coffee he did and more than that wanted to sit with her and talk about anything other than what was bringing them together no ive got to go the streets are a mess already oh she glanced toward the window and noticed the sleet working too hard doc when you dont see whats out your own window he walked to the door you havent gotten that dead bolt no i havent he turned with his hand on the knob he wanted to stay with her more than he wanted that brandy and imaginary woman bogart was okay the other night yes bogart was fine maybe we should do it again sometime maybe see you doc put on the chain he pulled the door closed but waited until he heard the rattle of the chain lock being fastened chapter ed tooled down sixteenth street at a sedate pace he enjoyed cruising as much well nearly as much as he enjoyed sending the tires screaming for a simple relatively easygoing man racing the streets in hot pursuit was a small vice beside him ben sat in silence normally ben would have had a few smart remarks to make about eds driving which was a departmental joke the fact that ben said nothing about it or the tanya tucker tape ed was playing were signs that his thoughts were elsewhere it didnt take a mind as methodical as eds to figure out where got papered on the borelli case ed listened to tanya wail about lying and cheating and was content hmm oh yeah got mine too looks like a couple of days in court next month da ought to nail him pretty quick hed better we worked our asses off to get the evidence silence trickled back like thin rain ed hummed along with tanya sang a few bars of the chorus then hummed again hear about lowensteins kitchen her husband flooded it disposal went out again thats what happens when you let an accountant go around with a wrench in his hand ben took the window down an inch so the smoke would trail out when he lit a cigarette thats fifteen ed said mildly you aint gonna get anywhere if you keep stewing about that press conference im not stewing about anything i like to smoke as proof he drew deep but resisted blowing the smoke in eds direction its one of the few great pleasures of mankind right up there with getting drunk and throwing up on your own shoes my shoes are clean jackson i remember someone toppling like a goddamn redwood when he downed a half a gallon of vodka and carrot juice i was just going to take a nap yeah right on your face if i hadnt caught you and nearly given myself a hernia in the process youd have broken that big nose of yours what the hell are you smiling at if youre bitching youre not feeling sorry for yourself you know ben she handled herself real good who said she didnt bens teeth ground into the filter as he took another drag and who said i was thinking about her anyway who less i never mentioned her name ed gunned the engine as a light turned amber and blinked through it as it switched to red dont play games with me and that light was red yellow it was red you colorblind sonofabitch and someone should take your license away i take my life in my hands every time i get in the same car with you i ought to have a suitcase full of commendations she looked good too ed commented great legs youre in a rut he turned the heater up as the air coming in through the crack of the window cut like a knife anyway she looked as though she could freeze a man at twenty paces clothes send out signals authority indecision composure looked like she was shooting for aloof authority seems to me she had those reporters in hand before she opened her mouth somebody should cancel your subscription to readers digest ben muttered the big old trees dotting the sides of the road were at their peak of color leaves were soft to the touch and vibrant in reds yellows and oranges in another week they would be dry littering the sidewalks and gutters making scratching empty sounds as they trailed along the asphalt ben pushed the cigarette through the crack then closed it tight okay so she handled herself problem is the press is going to have this meat to chew over for days media has a way of bringing out the loonies he looked at the old sedate buildings behind the old sedate trees they were the kind of buildings she belonged in the kind he was used to seeing from the outside and damn it she does have great legs smart too a man sure can admire a womans mind what do you know about a womans mind the last one you dated had the iq of a softboiled egg and what is this crap were listening to ed smiled pleased to have his partner back on track tanya tucker jesus ben slid down in the seat and closed his eyes you seem to feel much better today mrs halderman oh i do i really do the dark pretty woman didnt lie on the couch or sit in a chair but almost danced around tesss office she tossed a sable coat over the arm of a chair and posed what do you think of my new dress its very becoming it is isnt it mrs halderman ran a hand over the thin silklined wool red is so eyecatching i do love to be noticed youve been shopping again mrs halderman yes she beamed then her pretty china doll face drew into a pout oh dont be annoyed dr court i know you said maybe i should stay away from the stores for a little while and i did really i hadnt been to neimans for almost a week im not annoyed mrs halderman she said and watched the pout transform into another beaming smile you have wonderful taste in clothes which was fortunate as ellen halderman was obsessive she saw she liked she bought often tossing it aside and forgetting it after one wearing but that was a small problem mrs halderman also had the same routine with men thank you doctor like a little girl she twirled in a circle to show off the flare of the skirt i did have the most marvelous time shopping and youd have been proud of me i only bought two outfits well three she amended with a giggle but lingerie shouldnt count should it then i went down to have some coffee you know that marvelous restaurant in the mazza gallerie where you can look up at all the people and the shops yes tess was sitting on the corner of her desk mrs halderman looked at her caught her bottom lip between her teeth not in shame or anxiety but in suppressed delight then she walked to a chair and sat primly i was having coffee id thought about having a roll but if i didnt watch my figure clothes wouldnt be so much fun a man was sitting at the table beside mine oh dr court i knew as soon as i saw him why my heart just started to pound she put a hand to it as though even now its rhythm couldnt be trusted he was so handsome just a little gray right here she touched her forefingers to her temples as her eyes took on the soft dreamy light tess had seen too often to count he was tanned as though hed been skiing saint moritz i thought because its really too early for vermont he had a leather briefcase with his little initials monogrammed i kept trying to guess what they stood for mw she sighed over them and tess knew she was already changing the monogram on her bath towels i cant tell you how many names id conjured up to fit those initials what did they stand for maxwell witherspoon isnt that a wonderful name very distinguished why thats just what i told him so you spoke with him well my purse slid off the table she put her fingers to her lips as if to hide a grin a girls got to have a trick or two if she wants to meet the right man you knocked your purse off the table it landed right by his foot it was my pretty blackandwhite snakeskin maxwell leaned over to pick it up as he handed it to me he smiled my heart just about stopped it was like a dream i didnt hear the clatter of the other tables i didnt see the shoppers on the floors above us our fingers touched and oh promise you wont laugh doctor of course i wont it was as if hed touched my soul thats what shed been afraid of tess moved away from the desk to sit in the chair opposite her patient mrs halderman do you remember asanti him with a sniff mrs halderman dismissed her fourth husband when you met him at the art gallery under his painting of venice you thought he touched your soul that was different asanti was italian you know how clever italian men are with women maxwells from boston tess fought back a sigh it was going to be a very long fifty minutes when ben entered tesss outer office he found exactly what hed expected it was as cool and classy as her apartment calming colors deep roses smoky grays that would put her patients at ease the potted ferns by the windows had moist leaves as though theyd just been spritzed with water fresh flowers and a collection of figurines in a display cabinet lent the air of a parlor rather than a reception room from the copy of vogue left open on a low coffee table he gathered her current patient was a woman it didnt remind him of another doctors office one with white walls and the scent of leather he didnt feel the hitch in his gut or the sweat on the back of his neck as the door closed behind him he wouldnt be waiting for his brother here because josh was gone tesss secretary sat at a neat enameled desk working with a singlestation computer she stopped typing as ben and ed entered and looked as calm and easy as the room can i help you detectives paris and jackson oh yes dr courts expecting you shes with a patient at the moment if you wont mind waiting i could get you some coffee just hot water ed drew a tea bag out of his pocket the secretary didnt show even a flicker of reaction of course youre a constant embarrassment to me ben muttered as she slipped into a small side room im not pumping caffeine into my system just to be socially acceptable with his bag of herbs dangling from his hand he looked around the room how about this place classy yeah ben took another look around fits her i dont know why that gives you such a problem ed said mildly as he studied a monet print sunrise on the water all softly blurred colors with a touch of fire he liked it as he liked most art because someone had had the imagination and skill to create it his views on the human race were pretty much the same a goodlooking classy woman with a sharp mind shouldnt intimidate a man who has a strong sense of his own worth christ you should be writing a column just then the door to tesss office opened mrs halderman came out her sable tossed over one arm seeing the men she stopped smiled then touched her tongue to her top lip the way a young girl might when she spotted a bowl of chocolate ice cream hello ben hooked his thumbs in his pockets hello are you waiting to see dr court thats right she stayed where she was a moment then let her eyes widen as she studied ed my my youre a big one arent you ed swallowed a small obstruction in his throat yes maam im just fascinated by big men she crossed to him letting her eyes sweep up and flutter they always make me feel so helpless and feminine just how tall are you mister grinning with his thumbs still hooked in his pockets ben walked to tesss door and left ed to sink or swim she was sitting behind her desk head back eyes closed her hair was up again but she didnt look unapproachable tired he thought and not just physically as he watched she lifted a hand to her temple and pressed at the beginnings of a headache looks like you could use an aspirin doc she opened her eyes her head came up again as though she didnt find it acceptable to rest except in private though she was small the desk didnt dwarf her she looked completely suited to it and to the blackframed degree at her back i dont like to take pills just prescribe them her back angled a little straighten you werent waiting long were you i need my briefcase as she started to rise he walked over to the desk weve got a few minutes rough day a little you hardly shot anybody at all he picked up a chunk of amethyst from her desk and passed it from hand to hand i meant to tell you you did good this morning she picked up a pencil ran it through her fingers then set it down again apparently the next confrontation would be postponed thanks so did you he hitched himself on the corner of her desk discovering he could relax in her office psychiatrist or not there were no ghosts here no regrets how do you feel about saturday matinees open minded he had to grin figured you would be theyre playing a couple of classic vincent price films house of wax and the fly interested i might be now she did rise the headache was only a dull easily ignored throb in one temple if it included popcorn it even includes pizza after im sold tess he put a hand on her arm though he still found the trim gray suit she wore intimidating about last night i thought we both already apologized for that yeah she didnt look weary or vulnerable now but in control untouched untouchable he backed off still holding the chunk of amethyst in his hand it matched her eyes ever make love in here tess lifted a brow she knew he wanted to shock or at the very least annoy her privileged information she plucked her briefcase up from beside her desk and headed for the door coming he had an urge to slip the amethyst in his pocket annoyed he set it down carefully and followed her out ed stood beside the secretarys desk sipping tea his face was nearly as red as his hair mrs halderman she said to tess sending ed a sympathetic look i managed to nudge her along before she devoured him im terribly sorry ed but tesss eyes glistened would you like to sit down a minute no he sent his partner a warning look one word paris not me all innocence ben walked to the door and held it open as ed walked by ben fell into step beside him you are a big one though arent you keep it up monsignor timothy logan didnt look like bens childhood conception of a priest instead of a cassock he wore a tweed jacket over a pale yellow turteneck he had the big broad face of an irishman and dark red hair just beginning to go wiry with gray his office wasnt like the hushed quiet of a rectory with its somehow sanctified fragrances and old dark woods instead it smelled of pipe tobacco and dust like the den of an ordinary man there were no pictures of the saints or the savior on the walls no ceramic statues of the virgin with her sad understanding face there were books dozens and dozens of them some on theology some on psychiatry and several more on fishing instead of a crucifix there was a mounted silver bass on a stand rested an old bible with a carved cover a newer though more wellused one was open on the desk a rosary with fat wooden beads lay beside it its a pleasure to meet you monsignor logan tess held out her hand in a colleaguetocolleague manner that made ben uncomfortable the man was a priest tweed or not and priests were to be revered even feared a little and respected gods proxies he remembered his mother saying they handled the sacraments forgave sins and absolved the dying one had come to josh after he was already dead there had been words of comfort sympathy and kindness for the family but no absolution suicide the most mortal of the mortal sins and you dr court logan had a clear booming voice that could easily have filled a cathedral yet there was an edge to it a toughness that made ben think of an umpire calling strike three i attended the lecture you gave on dementia i wasnt able to speak to you afterward and tell you i thought you were brilliant thank you monsignor detective paris and jackson theyre heading the investigation team detectives ben accepted the handshake and felt foolish for expecting even for an instant something more than flesh and blood please be comfortable he gestured to chairs i have your profile and report on my desk dr court he swung around it with the free easy strides of a man on a golf course i read them this morning and found them both disturbing and intuitive you agree yes with the information from the investigators report i would have drawn up a reflecting profile the religious aspects are undeniable of course religious allusions and delusions are common in schizophrenia joan of arc heard voices ben murmured logan smiled and folded his broad capable hands as did any number of the saints and martyrs some might say fasting for forty days might have anyone hearing voices others might say they were chosen in this case we can all agree were not dealing with a saint but a very disturbed mind no argument there ed murmured his notebook in hand he remembered feeling a little well spiritual after a threeday fast as a doctor and a priest i look on the act of murder as a sin against god and as an act of extreme mental aberration however we have to deal with the mental aberration first in order to prevent the sin from being committed again logan opened tesss file and tapped his finger on it it would appear that the religious aspects and delusions are rooted in catholicism i have to concur with your opinion that the use of the amice as a murder weapon could be construed as a strike against the church or devotion to it tess leaned forward do you think he might be a priest or have been one perhaps wanted to be one i believe its more than possible he had training the frown came slowly and seemed to lodge between his eyes there are other articles of a priests habit that would be as effective for strangulation the amice is neckware and therefore grimly accurate and the use of white symbolizing absolution salvation unconsciously he spread his hands palms facing in the ageold gesture tess nodded agreement absolving a sin against himself perhaps but a sin that may have resulted in the death or spiritual loss of the woman he continues to save hes putting himself in the role of christ as savior ben demanded and casting the first stone because he was a man who took his time watched his footing logan leaned back and rubbed his earlobe he doesnt perceive himself as christ at least not yet hes a laborer of god in his mind detective and one who knows himself to be mortal he takes precautions protects himself he would realize that society would not accept his mission but he follows a higher authority voices again ben lit a cigarette voices visions to a schizophrenic they are as real often more so than the real world this is not split personality detective but a disease a biological dysfunction its possible that hes had the illness for years the murders started in august ben pointed out weve checked with homicide divisions all over the country there havent been any murders with this mo it started here detailed police work interested logan but didnt sway him perhaps he was in a period of recovery and some kind of stress brought the symptoms back resulting in violence at the moment hes torn between what is and what seems to be he agonizes and he prays and he kills ben said flatly i dont expect compassion logan with his dark priests eyes and capable hands spoke quietly thats my territory and dr courts and cant be yours with your dealings in this case none of us wants to see him kill again detective paris you dont think he has a christ delusion ed interrupted as he continued to make methodical notes is that just because he takes precautions christ was destroyed physically an excellent point the clear voice took on a richness there was nothing he liked better than to have one of his students question his theories logan looked from one detective to the other and decided they made a good pair still i dont see him as perceiving himself as anything but a tool religion the structure the barriers the traditions of it loom more predominantly than theology he kills as a priest whether he is one or not he absolves and forgives as gods proxy he continued and saw ben wince not as the son of god i developed an interesting theory you missed dr court she came to attention instantly oh he smiled again recognizing professional pride understandable enough youre not catholic are you no the investigation team overlooked it as well im methodist ed put in still writing im not trying for a conversion taking up his pipe he began to fill it his fingers were blunt and wide with the nails neatly trimmed a few flakes of tobacco fell on and clung to his yellow turtleneck the date of the first murder august fifteenth is a church holy day the assumption ben murmured before he realized it yes logan continued to fill his pipe and smiled ben was reminded of answering correctly in catechism i used to be catholic a common problem logan said and lit his pipe no lecture no pontifical frown ben felt his shoulders relaxing his mind started ticking i didnt put the dates together you think its significant meticulously logan removed tobacco from his sweater it could be im sorry monsignor tess lifted her hands youll have to explain august fifteenth is the day the church recognizes the virgins assumption into heaven the mother of god was a mortal but she carried the savior in her womb we revere her as the most blessed and pure among women pure tess murmured of itself i might not have paid too much attention to the date logan continued however it jogged my imagination enough to check the church calendar the second murder occurred on the day we celebrate marys birth hes picking the days shes excuse me marys honored by the church ed stopped writing long enough to look up for an acknowledgment the third murder falls on the feast of our lady of the rosary ive added a church calendar to your file dr court i dont think the odds for three out of three rate a coincidence no i agree tess rose anxious to see for herself she picked up the calender and studied the dates logan had circled dusk was falling logan switched on the light and the beam shot over the paper in her hands the next one you have here isnt until december eighth the immaculate conception logan puffed on his pipe that would put eight weeks between the murders ed calculated hes never gone more than four and we cant be sure hes emotionally capable of waiting that long tess added in a murmur he could change his pattern some incident could set him off he might pick a date personally important to him the date of birth or death of someone important to him ben lit another cigarette a female figure tess folded the calendar the female figure i agree that the stress hes under is building logan put his pipe down and leaned forward the need for release could be enough to make him strike sooner hes probably dealing with some sort of physical pain tess slipped the calendar into her briefcase headache nausea if it becomes too great for him to carry on his normal life exactly logan folded his hands again i wish i could be more helpful i would like to discuss this with you again dr court in the meantime we have a pattern ben crushed out his cigarette as he rose we concentrate on december eighth its only a crumb ben said as they stepped out into a chilled dusk but im ready to take it i didnt realize you were catholic tess buttoned her coat against the wind that was whipping up maybe thatll be an advantage used to be catholic and speaking of crumbs are you hungry starved good he slipped an arm around her then we can outvote ed youre not in the mood for yogurt and alfalfa sprouts are you ah benll want to stop and get a greasy hamburger what the man puts in his system is revolting how about chinese it was the best compromise she could come up with as she slipped into the car theres a great little place around the corner from my office told you she was classy ed said as he took the drivers seat he fastened his safety belt and waited with the patience of the wise and determined for ben to follow suit the chinese have the proper respect for the digestive system sure they keep it stuffed with rice ben glanced over his shoulder and saw tess already spread out on the backseat her file open come on doc take a break i just want to check over a couple of things ever treated a workaholic she glanced over the file then back again i may decide i have a craving for yogurt after all not tanya tucker ben pushed the reject button before the first bar of the song was out you had her this afternoon i wish degenerate im putting on some ah shit look at that the liquor store ed slowed down looks like a fiveohnine in progress a what tess straightened up in the back and tried to see robbery in progress ben was already unhooking his belt go back to work a robbery where wheres a black and white ben muttered as he reached for the radio dammit all i wants some sweet and sour pork porks poison ed unlatched his own belt ben snapped into the radio unit sixoh we have a fiveohnine in progress on third and douglas any available units we have a civilian in the car ah damn hes coming out requesting backup perpetrators heading south white male fiveten a hundred eighty black jacket jeans the radio squawked back at him yeah were on him ed revved the engine and rounded the corner from the backseat tess stared fascinated she saw the husky man in the black jacket come out of the liquor store and head up the street at a jog the minute he turned his head and saw the mustang he broke into a run shit he made us ben pulled out the kojak light just sit tight doc making for the alley ed said mildly he brought the car to a halt fishtailing it before tess could open her mouth both men were out of opposite sides and running stay in the car ben shouted at her she listened to him for about ten seconds slamming the door behind her she raced to the mouth of the alley herself ed was bigger but ben was faster as she watched the man they were chasing reached into his jacket she saw the gun and only had an instant to freeze before ben caught him at the knees and sent him sprawling into a line of garbage cans there was a shot over the clatter of metal she was halfway down the alley when ben dragged the man to his feet there was blood and the scent of rotting food from the metal cans which were emptied regularly but rarely cleaned the man didnt struggle probably because he saw ed and the police issue in his hand he spat a stream of blood tinged saliva it wasnt like television tess thought as she looked at the man who would have shot ben in the face if the timing had been a little different nor was it like a novel it wasnt even like the eleven oclock news where all the details were neatly tied up and delivered with rapidfire detachment life was full of smelly alleys and spittle her training and work had taken her there before but only emotionally she took a deep breath relieved that she wasnt frightened only curious and maybe a little fascinated with two snaps ben had the robbers hands cuffed behind his back havent you got more brains than to shoot at a police officer got grease on your pants ed pointed out as he secured his gun ben looked down and saw the long skid mark running from ankle to knee goddammit im with homicide jerk he announced in his prisoners face i dont like getting grease on my pants in fact getting grease on my pants really pisses me off disgusted ben passed him to ed as he brought out his badge youre under arrest sucker you have the right to remain silent you have tess dammit didnt i tell you to stay in the car he had a gun the bad guys always have guns as he looked at her wrapped in a powderblue cashmere coat he could smell the sweat from the petty thief she looked as though she were on her way to have cocktails on embassy row go back to the car you dont belong here ignoring him she studied the thief he had a goodsized scrape on his forehead where hed connected with concrete that explained the slightly glazed expression minor concussion his skin and the whites of his eyes had a yellow tinge there was sweat on his face though the wind cutting through the alley billowed his jacket looks like he might have hepatitis hell have plenty of time to recover he heard the sirens and looked over her shoulder here comes the cavalry well let the uniforms read him his rights when ben took her arm tess shook her head you were running after him and he had a gun so did i ben pointed out as he pulled her back up the alley he flashed his badge at the uniforms before continuing on to the car you didnt have it out he was going to shoot you thats whats the bad guys do they do the crime we go after them and they try to get away dont act like it was a game its all a game he was going to kill you and you were mad because you got your pants dirty reminded ben glanced down again departments going to get the bill too grease never comes out you re crazy is that a professional opinion there had to be a good reason why she wanted to laugh tess decided to analyze it later im working one up take your time the adrenaline from the collar was still pumping ben up as he reached the car he saw they had a threeunit backup for one twobit hood with hepatitis maybe they were all crazy come on sit down in here while i fill in the uniforms your mouth is bleeding yeah he wiped the back of his hand over it and looked at the smear yeah maybe i need a doctor she pulled a tissue out of her pocket and dabbed at the cut maybe you do behind them the man they had arrested began to swear and a crowd had gathered chapter over the next few days tess bent under her caseload eight and tenhour days stretched to twelve and fourteen she postponed her usual fridaynight dinner with her grandfather something she would never have done for a date only for a patient the press hounded her along with a few of her less sensitive associates such as frank fuller the fact that she was working with the police added just enough mystique to have him hanging around her office at five tess began to stay at her desk until six she had no new information only a nagging sense of worry it wouldnt be long before there was another victim the more she felt she understood the mind of the killer the surer she was of that but it was joey higgins who kept her awake and restless into early saturday morning when the streets outside were dark and empty and her eyes were burning from overuse she slipped off her glasses sat back and rubbed them why couldnt she get through to him why wasnt she making a dent the session that evening with joey his mother and stepfather had been a disaster there had been no temper tantrums no shouting no accusations she would have preferred that there would have been emotion in that the boy simply sat there giving his monosyllabic nonanswers his father hadnt called tess had seen the fury in the mothers eyes but only blank acceptance in the sons joey continued to insist in his lowkey unshakable way that he was spending a weekend thanksgiving weekend with his father he was going to be let down tess pressed her fingers against her eyes until the burning subsided to a dull ache and when he was let down this time it could be one time too many joey higgins was a prime candidate for drink drugs or destruction the monroes would only see so much only allow her to go so far at the mention of hospital care tess had been cut off joey just needed time he just needed family structure he just needed help tess thought desperately she was no longer convinced that a weekly session with her was going to lead to any kind of a breakthrough the stepfather she thought she might make him see she might be able to make him understand the necessity of protecting joey against himself the next step she decided was to get monroe into her office privately nothing more could be done tonight she leaned forward to close the file glancing out the window as she did on the empty streets a single figure caught her eye this part of georgetown with its tidy edgings of flowers along the sidewalks in front of aging brownstones didnt lend itself to street people or vagrants but the man looked as though he had stood there a long time in the cold alone looking up looking up at her window tess realized and drew back automatically silly she told herself but reached over to switch off her desk lamp no one would have a reason to stand on a street corner and stare at her window still with the lights off she got up and went to the edge of the window drawing the curtain slightly he was there just there not moving but looking she shuddered with the foolish idea that he was looking right at her though she was three stories up in a dark room one of her patients she wondered but she was always so careful to keep her home address private a reporter some of the fear eased with the thought it was probably a reporter hoping for a new angle on the story at two am she asked herself and let the curtain drop it was nothing she assured herself shed imagined he was looking at her window it was dark and she was tired it was just someone waiting for a ride or not in this neighborhood she started to reach for the curtain again but couldnt quite bring herself to draw it aside he was going to strike again soon hadnt that been the thought haunting her frightening her he had pain pressure and a mission blondes in their late twenties small to medium build she put a hand to her own throat stop it dropping it again she touched the hem of the curtain a bit of paranoia was easy to deal with no one was after her except a sexcrazed psychoanalyst and a few hungry reporters she wasnt out on the street but locked in her own home she was tired overworked and imagining things it was time to call it a night time to pour a glass of cool white wine turn on the stereo and sink into a hot tub filled with bubbles but her hand shook a little as she drew the curtain aside the street was empty as tess let the curtain fall she wondered why that didnt ease her mind shed looked out at him hed known somehow hed known the moment her eyes had focused on him as he stood on the street below what had she seen her salvation almost sobbing against the headache he let himself into his apartment the corridor was dark no one ever watched him come or go neither was he worried that shed seen his face it had been too dark and too distant for that but had she seen the pain why had he gone there he stripped off his coat and let it lie in a heap the next day he would hang it neatly and tidy the rest of the apartment as was his habit but tonight he could hardly think over the pain god always tested the righteous he found a bottle of excedrin and chewed two pills welcoming the dry bitter taste his stomach was rolling with a nausea that came every night now and lingered through the mornings he was dousing himself with overthecounter drugs just to keep functioning why had he gone there perhaps he was going mad perhaps it was all madness he held out his hand and watched the tremor if he didnt control himself they would all know in the aluminum range hood that he kept clean of grease and grime as hed been taught he saw his distorted reflection the priests collar was white beneath his haggard face if they saw him now they would all know perhaps that would be best then he could rest rest and forget pain sliced through the base of his skull no he couldnt rest he couldnt forget laura needed him to complete his mission so that she could finally find the light hadnt she asked begged for him to ask god for forgiveness judgment had been quick and harsh for laura hed cursed god lost his faith but hed never forgotten now all these years later the voice had come showing him the way to her salvation perhaps she had to die again and again through another lost one but it was quick and each time there was absolution soon it would be over for all of them going into the bedroom he lit the candles the light flickered on the framed picture of the woman hed lost and the women hed killed clipped neatly and lying beneath a black rosary was the newspaper picture of dr teresa court he prayed in latin as hed been taught ben bought her an allday sucker swirled with red and yellow tess accepted it at the door gave it a thorough study then shook her head you know how to keep a woman off balance detective most men go for chocolate too ordinary besides i figured youd probably be used to the swiss kind and i he broke off aware that he was going to start rambling if she kept smiling at him over the round hunk of candy you look different i do how your hairs down he wanted to touch it but knew he wasnt ready and youre not wearing a suit tess looked down at her wool slacks and oversized sweater i dont usually wear suits to a horrormovie double feature you dont look like a psychiatrist anymore yes i do i just dont look like your conception of one now he did touch her hair just a little she liked the way he did it in a gesture that was both friendly and cautious youve never looked like my conception of one wanting a moment to align her own thoughts she set the sucker down on the table beside a dresden platter then went to the closet for a jacket and what is your conception someone pale thin and bald hmmm the jacket was suede and soft as butter he held it for her as she slipped her arms in you dont smell like a psychiatrist either she smiled over her shoulder what does a psychiatrist smell like or do i want to know like peppermint and english leather aftershave she turned to face him thats very specific yeah your hairs caught he dipped his hand under the collar of her jacket and freed it he took a step forward almost without thinking and had her against the closet door her face tilted up and there was a wariness in her eyes hed noticed before she wore little makeup the sleek polished look that was so much a part of her image replaced by a warm accessibility a smart man would recognize as dangerous he knew what he wanted and was comfortable with the swift rush of desire the degree of it was another matter when you wanted too much too quickly he thought it was best to take things slow his mouth was close to hers his hand was still on her hair you like butter on your popcorn tess didnt know whether to laugh or curse deciding to do neither she told herself she was relaxed tons of it good then i dont have to spring for two boxes its cold outside he added leaning away from her youll need gloves he drew out his own scarred black leather ones before he opened the door id forgotten just how frightening those movies were it was dark when tess settled back in his car sated with pizza and cheap red wine the air was biting stinging her cheeks with the first brush of winter before she slid into bens car neither the cold nor the media was keeping washington indoors the saturdaynight stream of traffic rolled by on its way to clubs supper and parties ive always appreciated the way the cop gets the girl in the house of wax all vincent needed was a good analyst she said mildly as ben adjusted the radio sure and hed have dumped you in the vat coated you with wax and turned you into he turned his head for a narrowedeyed study helen of troy i think not bad she pursed her lips of course some psychiatrists might say you chose that subconsciously linking yourself with paris as a cop i wouldnt romanticize kidnapping pity she let her eyes half close not even aware of how easy it was for her to relax with him the heater hummed in accompaniment to the moody music from the car radio she remembered the lyrics and sang them in her head tired no comfortable as soon as the words were out she straightened ill probably have a few nightmares horror movies are a wonderful escape valve for real tensions i guarantee no one in that theater was thinking about their next insurance payment or acid rain he let out a breezy chuckle as he drove out of the parking lot you know doc some people might look at it as simple entertainment it didnt seem like you were thinking escape valve when you dug holes in my arm when our heroine was running through the fog it must have been the woman on the other side of you i was sitting on the aisle she had a long reach you missed the turn to my apartment i didnt miss it i didnt take it you said you werent tired im not she wasnt sure shed ever felt more awake more alive the song seemed to be playing just under her skin promising romance and exquisite heartache shed always thought the first was somehow incomplete without the second are we going somewhere a little place i know where the musics good and they dont water down the liquor she ran her tongue over her teeth id like that she was in the mood for music something bluesy maybe with the ache of a tenor sax i suppose in a professional capacity youre well acquainted with the local bars ive got a working knowledge he punched in his car lighter youre not the bar type interested she faced him his profile was in shadows struck intermittently by streetlights it was funny how sometimes he looked safe solid the kind of man a woman might run to if it were dark then the light struck his face another way and the planes and angles were highlighted a woman might run from him she shook off the thought shed made a policy not to analyze men she dated too often you learned more than you wanted to know is there a type yeah and he knew them all youre not it hotel lounge champagne cocktails at the mayflower or the hotel washington now whos doing psychological profiles detective youve got to be able to type people in my business doc he pulled up and maneuvered into a space between a honda threewheeler and a chevette hatchback before he turned off the key he wondered if he was making a mistake whats this this he pulled out the keys but left them jingling in his hand is where i live she looked out the window at a fourstory apartment building with faded red brick and green awnings oh i dont have any champagne her decision she understood him well enough to understand that but she understood little else about him the car was warm and quiet safe inside she didnt know what to expect she knew herself well enough to understand how seldom she took risks maybe it was time you have scotch she turned back to see his smile yeah thatll do the air snapped cold the moment she stepped from the car winter wasnt going to wait for the calendar she thought then shuddered thinking of another calendar one with the madonna and child on the cover the little twist of fear had her looking up and down the street a block away a truck let out a blast of exhaust come on ben stood in a pool of light from a streetlamp the light bounced from the planes of his face youre cold yes she shivered again when his arm went around her shoulders he led her inside there were about a dozen mail slots against one wall the pale green carpet was clean but almost threadbare there was no lobby no security guard at a desk only a dim set of stairs its certainly a quiet building she said as they climbed to the second floor everybody here pretty much minds their own business there was a faint scent of cooking in the hall when he stopped to unlock his door the light overhead winked weakly his apartment was tidier than shed expected it was more than just a general preconception of a man living alone tess realized ben seemed too relaxed and casual in other areas to bother clearing dust or old magazines then she decided she was wrong the room might be clean but it did reflect his style the sofa was the dominant piece of furniture low and far from new it was plumped with throw pillows a dagwood couch tess thought one that simply begged you to relax and take a nap there were posters rather than paintings toulouselautrecs cancan dancers a single womans leg standing in a four inch heel skimmed at the thigh with white lace there was a dieffenbachia thriving away in a plastic margarine bowl and books one wall was nearly filled with them delighted she pulled out a worn hardbacked copy of east of eden as bens hands went to her shoulders she opened the flyleaf to ben she read the spiky feminine handwriting kiss kiss bambi putting her tongue in her cheek she closed it bambi used bookstore he removed her jacket fascinating places never can tell what youll pick up did you pick up the book or bambi never mind he took the copy from her and stuck it back on the shelf do you know one gets an immediate mental image from certain names yeah scotch straight up right right a streak of gray whizzed by and landed on a red pillow a cat too amused tess strolled over to stroke it whats his name her she proved that by having kittens in the bathtub last year the cat rolled over so tess could scratch her belly i call her dc as in washington as in dumb cat its a wonder she doesnt have a complex running her hands over the rounded belly again tess wondered if she should warn him hed be getting another litter of gifts in a month or so she runs into walls on purpose i could refer you to an excellent pet psychologist he laughed but wasnt entirely sure she was joking id better get those drinks when he went into the kitchen she rose to look at his view from the window the streets werent as quiet as her neighborhood traffic moved by at a steady clip droning and grunting along he wouldnt take himself far from the action she thought and remembered she hadnt paid any attention to what direction hed taken she could be anywhere in the city she expected unease and instead felt a sense of freedom i promised you music she turned and looked at him the simple duncolored sweater and faded jeans he wore suited him shed thought once that he understood himself very well now it would be foolish to deny that she wanted to understand him yes you did he handed her a glass and thought about how different she was and how different she looked from any other woman hed brought here that quiet class of hers demanded that a man swallow his lust and take the whole person wondering if he was ready to he set down his own glass and flipped through his records when he set one on the turntable tess heard the brassy heat of jazz leon redbone she said he shook his head as he turned toward her you keep surprising me my grandfathers one of his biggest fans sipping her drink she walked over to pick up the album cover it seems the two of you have quite a lot in common me and the senator ben laughed before he sipped his vodka ill bet im serious youll have to meet him meeting a womans family was something he associated with wedding rings and orange blossoms hed always avoided it why dont we the phone rang and he swore setting down his glass id ignore it but im on call you dont have to explain those things to a doctor yeah he picked up the phone beside the couch paris oh yeah hi it didnt take a trained psychiatrist to understand there was a woman on the other end tess smiled into her drink and went back to the view no ive been tied up look sugar the minute the word was out he winced tess kept her back to him im on a case you know no i didnt forget about i didnt forget listen ill have to get back to you when things lighten up i dont know weeks maybe months you really ought to try that marine sure see ya he hung up cleared his throat and reached for his drink again wrong number it was so easy to laugh she turned leaned against the windowsill and gave in to it oh really enjoyed that didnt you immensely if id known youd get such a kick out of it id have invited her up ah the male ego with one hand crossed over her body she lifted the drink again she was still laughing at him the humor didnt fade when he walked over and took the drink from her hand the warm approachable look was back he felt the pull of it the danger of it the need for it im glad youre here so am i you know doc he let his fingers play through her hair the gesture was as friendly as before but not as cautious theres one thing we havent done together she withdrew at that he sensed it though she hadnt moved away he continued to toy with her hair as he drew her closer his breath brushed over her lips dance he murmured and laid his cheek against hers whether her sigh was of pleasure or relief he didnt know but she was nearly relaxed against him theres something ive noticed about you what you feel good his lips moved over her ear as they swayed hardly moving from one spot real good ben relax he made long slow strokes up her back and down again another thing ive noticed is that you dont relax much his body was hard against hers his lips warm against her temple at the moment it isnt easy good he liked the way her hair smelled fresh and rich without the overlay of scented shampoos gels and sprays from the easy way her body blended with his he knew she wore nothing but skin under the sweater he imagined away the layer of material and let the heat rise you know doc i havent been sleeping well her eyes were nearly closed but it wasnt because of relaxation youve got a lot on your mind with this case yeah but theres something else thats been on my mind what you he drew her back a little eyes open and on hers he teased her mouth i cant stop thinking about you i think i have a problem i my caseloads pretty heavy right now private sessions as hed wanted to all evening he slipped his hands under her sweater and let her skin warm him starting tonight she felt the ridge of callus below his fingers rub up her spine i dont think but he stopped her with a kiss a long slow melding of lips that had his own heart racing there was a hesitation in her that licked at his desire shed been a challenge from the beginning and maybe a mistake he was beyond caring stay with me tess ben she drew out of his arms wanting the distance and the control i think were rushing this ive wanted you from the start it wasnt his style to admit it but this wasnt the usual game she dragged a hand through her hair she thought of the inscription in the book the phone call i dont take sex lightly i cant im not taking you lightly i wish i could its probably a mistake he looked at her again fragile delicate elegant it would be could be no fling no easy romp in the sack with no morning repercussions i dont give a damn tess determined but somehow less sure of himself he took a step closer to frame her face in his hands i dont want to go another night without you he bent to kiss her stay he lit candles in the bedroom the music had stopped and it was so quiet she thought she could almost hear the echo of it she was trembling and no amount of lecturing herself on being an adult and making her own choices would stop it nerves shivered through her needs twisted with them until they were one and the same he came to her and gathered her close youre shaking i feel like a schoolgirl it helps he buried his face in her hair im scared to death are you there was a smile on her lips as she put her hands to his face and drew him back i feel i dont know like some kid in the backseat of his fathers chevy about to tackle his first bra snaps he put his hands to her wrists a moment to hold himself back from touching her theres never been anyone like you i keep worrying that ill make the wrong move nothing he could have said would have reassured her more she drew his face down to hers their lips met just a nibble just a test that threatened to grow to a hungry bite so far so good she murmured make love with me ben ive always wanted you to he kept his eyes on hers as he drew up the bulky sweater then her hair was pooled over naked shoulders there was moonlight and candlelight on her skin he traced his own shadows over it she was never sure of herself on this level with a man there was hesitation as she began to draw his sweater off beneath it his torso was lean and firm a st christophers medal dangled above his breastbone tess ran her finger over it and smiled its just for luck he told her saying nothing she pressed her lips to his shoulder youve a scar here its old he unfastened the snap of her slacks her thumb moved over it a bullet she realized there was a dull horror in her voice its old he repeated and drew her onto the bed she lay beneath him her hair flared out on the dark spread her eyes heavy lips parted ive wanted you here i cant tell you how much or how often she reached up and touched her fingertips to his face along his jawline was the beginnings of his beard beneath just above where his pulse beat the skin was smooth you can show me when he grinned she discovered she was relaxed and waiting for him his experience might have been greater but his need wasnt hers had been under tight control and was ripe and hungry now that it was set free they rolled over the bed damp and naked forgetting the civilized the ordinary the spread rumpled and tangled beneath them he swore at it then pulled her free and on top of him her breasts were small and pale he cupped one then both in his hands he heard her murmur of pleasure as he watched her eyes close with it then she was pulling him to her and her mouth was like a fever his intention to treat her as a lady with care and gentleness was abandoned when her arms and legs wrapped around him here she wasnt the cool and classy dr court but a woman as passionate and demanding as any man could want her skin was soft fragile to the touch but slicked with desire he skimmed his tongue over it thirsting for her she arched against him letting needs fantasies passions have their way here and now were all that mattered what was outside was removed distant he was real and vital and important the rest of the world could wait candlelight flickered gutted and went out hours later he awoke cold the spread was bundled at the foot of the bed tess was curled in a ball beside him naked her hair curtaining her face he rose and pulled the covers over her even the moonlight was gone now for a while he just stood over the bed looking down at her as she slept the cat padded into the room as ben walked quietly out chapter doctors and cops those in either profession know they will rarely have a day that begins at nine and ends at five they understand that theyve chosen a career where the divorce and burnout rates are high the demands many and the emotional toll extreme phone calls spoil dinner parties sex and sleep its part of the job description when the phone rang tess reached over automatically and picked up a candlestick on the other side of the bed ben swore knocked over an ashtray and found the phone yeah paris in the dark he ran a hand over his face as if to wipe away sleep where instantly awake he switched on the lamp the cat curled on tesss stomach growled a complaint then leaped aside as she braced herself on her elbows keep him there im on my way ben hung up the phone and stared at the light sheen of frost on the window he didnt wait did he the light fell harshly over his face as he turned to look at her she gave a quick involuntary shudder his eyes were hard not weary not regretful but hard no he didnt wait do they have him no but it looks like weve got a witness as he rolled out of bed he grabbed his jeans i dont know how long ill be but you can wait here get some more sleep ill fill you in when what are you doing she stood on the opposite side of the bed dragging on her sweater going with you forget it his legs disappeared into the jeans but he left the pants unsnapped as he pulled open a drawer for a sweater theres nothing you can do at a murder scene but get in the way in the mirror above his dresser he saw her head snap up its still shy of five for christs sake go back to bed ben im involved in this case he turned she wore only the sweater that skimmed her thighs he remembered the material had been thick and soft when hed drawn it off of her her slacks were balled in her hands and her hair was rumpled from the pillow but it was the psychiatrist facing him not the woman something inside of him curdled he yanked his own sweater on then walked to the closet for his shoulder holster this is a homicide its not like going to look at somebodys whos been painted up nice to lie in a casket im a doctor i know what you are he checked his gun then hitched the holster on ben its possible i could see something some detail that would give me a clue to his mind fuck his mind saying nothing she shook out her slacks stepped into them then fastened them in place i understand how you feel and im sorry yeah he sat down to pull on his boots but continued to watch her you think you know how i feel well let me tell you anyway theres a dead woman a few miles from here somebody put a scarf around her neck and pulled until she couldnt breathe anymore shed have kicked and pulled at the scarf with her hands and tried to scream but she wouldnt have been able to so shes dead but shes not a name on a list yet shes still a person for a little while longer shes still a person she would have reached out to him if shed thought there was a chance hed accept it instead she fastened her belt and kept her voice neutral dont you think i understand that im not sure you do they studied each other a moment longer each dedicated each frustrated each coming from different backgrounds and beliefs it was tess who accepted it first i either go with you now or i call the mayor and end up five minutes behind you sooner or later youve got to start working with me hed just spent the night with her hed poured himself into her three times during the night hed felt her body rock and buck and shudder now they were talking murder and politics the femininity the softness even the shyness hed taken to bed were still there but beneath was a core of toughness a selfpossession hed recognized from the first studying her he saw she would go no matter what he said what he did all right you go with me and get an upclose look maybe after you see her youll stop letting your heart bleed for the man who did her she bent for her shoes the bed was between them but it was as if theyd never shared it i suppose its no use reminding you im on your side he was reaching for his wallet and shield and said nothing tess saw her earrings on his nightstand a little thing of great intimacy she scooped them up and dropped them in her pocket where are we going an alley near twentythird and m twentythird and m thats only a couple of blocks from my place he didnt bother to look at her i know the streets were deserted the bars would have closed at one most private parties would have waned by three washington was a political town and though its night spots ranged from the elite to the sleazy it didnt have the energy of a new york or chicago drug deals around fourteenth and u were a lifestyle away even the hookers would have called it a night now and then the leaves that had fallen rushed along the sidewalk then stopped victims of the sporadic wind they drove past blank storefronts and boutiques with neon sweaters in the windows ben lit a cigarette and let the familiar taste of virginia tobacco ease some of the tension he didnt want her there doctor or no doctor he didnt want her to be a part of the hopeless ugliness of this part of his job she could share in the paperwork the fitting together of the puzzle the stepbystep logic of an investigation but she shouldnt be here she had to be here tess thought it was time to face the results and maybe just maybe get a better understanding of the motivation she was a doctor it was irrelevant that she wasnt the kind of doctor who prodded fingers in the human body she was trained she was capable and she understood death tess saw the blue and red lights of the first police car and began to school her breathing to long inhales slow exhales the alley and several feet on all sides were roped off though there was no one on the predawn streets cruisers sat with their lights blinking and their radios on a community of workers was already inside the official area ben pulled up to the curb you stay with me he told tess but still didnt look at her we have a policy against civilians wandering around homicide scenes i dont intend to get in your way i intend to do my job youll find im as good at it as you are at yours she pushed open her door and nearly collided with ed sorry dr court her hands were icy he patted them without thinking youre going to want your gloves he stuck his own in his pockets as he looked at ben what have we got lab boys are in there now slys getting pictures coroners en route his breath came out in a white puffy steam the tips of his ears were already red from the cold but hed forgotten to button his coat some kid stumbled across her about fourthirty uniforms havent got much out of him yet hes been pretty busy whooshing up about a half case of beer he glanced at tess again sorry dont apologize ben said briefly shell remind you shes a doctor captains coming in on this terrific ben shot the butt of his cigarette into the street lets get to work they started toward the alley passed a cruiser where someone sat in the backseat sobbing tess glanced over pulled toward the sound of despair then her arm brushed bens and she continued toward the alley a small man with hornrimmed glasses and a camera stepped out he took out a blue bandanna and rubbed it over his nose its all yours get him for christs sake i dont want to photograph any more dead blondes a mans got to have a little variety in his work youre a riot sly ben brushed by him leaving the photographer sneezing into the bandanna theyd taken only a few steps into the alley when the scent of death rose up they all recognized it that bitter fetid stench which was both offensive and eerily compelling to the living her body had emptied itself her blood had settled her arms had been folded neatly across her body but she didnt look at peace sightless her eyes were locked open there was a smear of dried blood on her chin her own tess thought sometime during the struggle to live she had sawed her teeth through her bottom lip shed worn a long serviceable wool coat in olive drab the white silk amice stood out starkly against it it had been taken from around her neck where bruises had already formed and smoothed over her breasts the note was pinned there the message the same her sins are forgiven her but this time the letters werent printed neatly they were wavery and the paper was crumpled a bit as though his hands had mashed it the word sins was printed larger than the rest the markings darker almost going through the paper tess crouched down beside the body for a closer look a cry for help she wondered was it a plea for someone to stop him from sinning again the shaky handwriting was a deviation however slight from his routine it meant to tess that he was losing his hold perhaps doubting himself even as he fulfilled his mission he hadnt been so sure this time she decided his mind was becoming a logjam of thoughts memories and voices he must be terrified she thought and almost certainly physically ill by now her coat had been left open rather than neatly arranged there wasnt enough of a breeze in the alley to have flapped it open so he hadnt tidied it as he had the clothing of the others perhaps he hadnt been able to then she saw the lapel pin against the green wool a gold heart with the name anne scrolled inside she had been anne a wave of pity washed over her for anne and for the man who had been driven to kill her ben saw the way she studied the body clinically dispassionately without revulsion hed wanted to shield her from the reality of death but also wanted to press her face into it until shed wept and ran the other way if youve gotten yourself a good look dr court why dont you back off and let us do our job she looked up at ben then rose slowly to her feet hes nearly finished i dont think hes going to be able to take much more tell that to her kid puked all over the place ed said lightly and breathed through his mouth to try to combat the stench with a pencil he flipped open the womans wallet which had spilled out of her purse anne reasoner he said reading her drivers license twentyseven lives about a block up on m a block up tess thought a block closer to her own apartment she pressed her lips together and looked out of the alley until the fear passed its a ritual she said clearly enough from everything ive read ritual rites traditions are an intricate part of the catholic church hes performing his own ritual here saving them then absolving them and leaving them with this she indicated the amice the symbol of that salvation and absolution he folds the amice exactly the same way each time he positions their bodies exactly the same way but this time he didnt tidy her clothes playing detective tess balled her hands in her pockets fighting to overlook bens sarcasm this is devotion blind devotion to the church obsession with ritual but the handwriting shows that hes beginning to question what hes doing what hes driven to do thats fine unreasonable anger rushed into him at her lack of emotional response ben turned his back to her and bent over the body why dont you go out to the car and write that up well be sure to pass on your professional opinion to her family he didnt see her face the quick hurt then the slow anger that came into her eyes but he heard her walk away little rough on her werent you ben didnt look at his partner either but at the woman who had been anne she stared back at him serve and protect no one had protected anne reasoner she doesnt belong here he murmured and thought as much of anne reasoner as of tess he shook his head still studying the almost saintlike pose of the body what was she doing in an alley in the middle of the night an alley that was close too damn close to tesss apartment maybe she wasnt drawing his brows together ben lifted up one of her feet shed worn loafers the kind that last through college your first marriage and divorce the leather fit her feet like gloves and was well polished the back of the heel was freshly scraped and scarred so he killed her on the street and dragged her in ben looked over at ed as his partner crouched and examined the other shoe he strangled her out on the fucking street we got streetlights about every ten goddamn feet in this neighborhood we got black and whites cruising every thirty minutes and he kills her on the street he looked at her hands her nails were medium length and well shaped only three of them were broken the coralcolored polish was unchipped doesnt look like she put up much of a fight the light was turning gray awashedout milky gray that promised overcast skies and cold autumn rain dawn floated over the city without any beauty sunday morning people were sleeping in hangovers were brewing the first church services would begin soon with raweyed weekenddazed congregations tess leaned against the hood of bens car the suede jacket wasnt warm enough in the chilled dawn but she was too restless to get inside the car she watched a round man with a medical bag and bluepaisley pajama bottoms under a flapping overcoat go into the alley the coroners day had started early from somewhere blocks away came the grinding metallic sound of a truck changing gears a single cab rode by without slowing down one of the uniformed cops brought a big styrofoam cup with steam and the scent of coffee rising off the top and handed it to the figure in back of the cruiser tess looked toward the alley again shed held up she told herself though her stomach was roiling now in reaction shed been professional as shed promised herself she would be but she wouldnt forget anne reasoner for a long time death wasnt a neatly printed statistic when you looked it in the face she would have kicked and pulled at the scarf with her hands and tried to scream tess took a long gulp of air that hurt her throat raw from swallowing nausea she was a doctor she repeated it over and over until the cramp in her stomach eased shed been trained to deal with death and she had dealt with it turning away from the alley she faced the empty street who was she trying to fool she dealt with despair with phobias neuroses even violence but shed never been facetoface with the victim of a murder her life was ordered protected because shed made certain of it pastel walls and questions and answers even her hours at the clinic were tame compared to the daytoday violence on the streets of the city where she lived she knew about ugliness violence and perversion but shed always been neatly separated from all of it by her own background the senators granddaughter the bright young student the coolheaded doctor she had her degree her successful practice and three published papers shed treated the helpless the hopeless and the pitiful but shed never knelt down beside murder dr court she turned back and saw ed instinctively she looked past him and spotted ben talking to the coroner i wrangled you some coffee thanks she took the cup and sipped slowly want a bagel no she laid a hand on her stomach no you did okay in there the coffee settled and seemed content to stay down looking over the cup she met his eyes he understood she realized and neither condemned nor pitied i hope i never have to do it again a black plastic bag was carried out of the alley tess found herself able to watch as it was loaded into the morgue van it never gets any easier ed murmured i used to wish it would not anymore no i figure if it gets easier it means youve lost the edge that makes you want to find out why she nodded common sense and common compassion in his quiet voice were soothing how long have you and ben been partners five almost six years you suit each other funny i was just thinking the same thing about you she gave a low humorless laugh theres a difference between attraction and suitability maybe theres also a difference between stubbornness and stupidity his look remained bland as her head came around anyway dr court he went on before she had a chance to react i was hoping you might talk to the witness for a couple of minutes hes pretty shook up and were not getting anywhere all right she nodded at the cruiser thats him in the car isnt it yeah names gil norton tess walked to the car and crouched at the open door he was hardly more than a boy she thought twenty maybe twentytwo while he shivered and gulped coffee his face was pale with a high flush of color over the cheekbones his eyes were puffed and red from weeping and his teeth clattered hed put dents with his thumbs in the sides of the styrofoam cup he smelt of beer and vomit and terror gil after a jolt he turned his head she hadnt any doubt he was stone sober now but she could see a bit too much white around his irises his pupils were dilated im dr court how are you feeling i want to go home ive been sick my stomach hurts there was a trace of the whining selfpity of a drunk whod had cold water dumped in his face under it was plain fear finding her must have been pretty dreadful i dont want to talk about it his mouth contracted into a thin white line i want to go home ill call someone for you if you like your mother tears began to squeeze out of his eyes again his hands trembled until the coffee sloshed in his cup gil why dont you step out of the car you might feel better if you stood up in the fresh air i want a cigarette i smoked all of mine well get some she held out a hand after a moments hesitation he took it his fingers closed over hers like a vice i dont want to talk to the cops why i should have a lawyer shouldnt i have a lawyer im sure you can if you like but youre not in trouble gil i found her yes here let me take that for you gently she took the halfempty cup before he could spill the remaining coffee over his pants gil we need you to tell us whatever you know so we can find out who killed her he looked around and saw the blue uniforms and impassive faces theyre going to dump it on me no she spoke calmly having anticipated him keeping close to his side she began to lead him toward ben they dont think you killed her i got a record he said it in a shaky whisper drug bust last year just petty shit a little grass but the copsll figure i got a record i found her i killed her its natural to be scared thats not going to go away until you talk about what happened try to be logical gil has anyone arrested you no has anyone asked you if you killed that woman no but i was there he focused on the alley with blank fascinated horror and she was thats what you need to get out gil this is detective paris she stopped in front of ben but kept her hand on gils arm hes with homicide and too smart to think you killed anyone beneath the words the message was clear go easy bens resentment communicated itself just as lucidly he didnt have to be told how to handle a witness ben gil could use a cigarette sure ben reached for his pack and shook one out rough morning he commented as he struck a match gils hands still shook but he drew greedily on the cigarette yeah his eyes darted over and up as ed approached this is detective jackson tess continued in a soothing introductory voice they need you to tell them what you saw will i have to go in well need you to sign a statement ben shook out a cigarette of his own man i just want to go home well get you home ben looked at tess through the haze of his smoke just take it easy and tell it from the beginning i was at a party he stopped dead and looked at tess she gave him an encouraging nod you can check it was over on twentysixth some friends of mine just got the apartment see and it was like a movingin party i can give you names thats fine ed had his notebook out well get them from you later when did you leave the party i dont know i had too much to drink and got into it with my girl she doesnt like it when i party too hard we had words you know he swallowed drew in smoke again then let it out on a shuddering breath she got pissed and left that was about onethirty took the car so i couldnt drive sounds like she was looking out for you ed put in yeah well i was too wasted to see it that way the rumblings of a heroic hangover were already beginning gil preferred it to the nausea what happened after she left ed prompted i hung around i think i crashed for a while the party was winding down when i woke up lee it was his apartment lee grimes he says i can sleep on the couch but i well i needed air you know i was going to walk home i guess i was already feeling pretty sick so i stopped just across the street there he turned and pointed my head was spinning and i knew i was going to toss up some beer i just rested there a minute and got it under control and i see this guy come out of the alley you saw him come out ben interrupted you didnt hear anything see him go in no i swear i dont know how long id been standing there not too long i think cause it was cold as hell even drunk i was thinking i had to move to keep warm i saw him come out then he leaned up against the lamppost for a minute like he was sick too i thought it was kind of funny two drunks weaving across the street from each other like something out of a cartoon and one of the drunks is a priest how do you know that ben paused in the act of offering gil another cigarette hes wearing this priests suit the black dress with the white collar i was laughing to myself you know looks like hes been hitting the communion wine anyway im standing there wondering if im going to piss in my pants or barf and he straightens himself up and walks away which way toward m yeah toward m street he went around the corner did you see what he looked like man i saw he was a priest gil pounced on the fresh cigarette he was white he pressed his fingers to his eyes yeah he was a white dude i think he had dark hair look i was wasted and he was standing with his face against the lamppost okay youre doing good ed flipped a page in his notebook how about build could you tell if he was short tall gil screwed his face up in concentration though he still consumed the cigarette in great gulps tess saw he was calming i guess he was pretty tall not a little guy anyhow he wasnt fat shit its like average you know about like you i guess he said to ben how about age ben put in i dont know he wasnt old and feeble his hair was dark he said it quickly as it flashed into his memory yeah im sure it was dark not gray or blond he had his hands in it like this he demonstrated pressing his hands against the side of his head like his head was hurting him pretty bad his hands were black but his face was white like he had gloves on you know it was cold he stopped again as the full implication hit him hed seen a murderer fear doubled back a personal thing if hed seen he was involved the muscles in his face began to tremble hes the one whos been doing all these women hes the one hes a priest lets finish this up ben said easily howd you find the body oh christ he closed his eyes and tess moved toward him gil try to remember its over what youre feeling is going to fade itll start to fade a little bit after you say it all out loud once you say it out loud itll be easier okay he reached for her hand and held on after the guy left i was feeling a little better like maybe i was going to keep everything down after all but id had a lot of beer and i had to get rid of some you know i still had myself together enough to know i couldnt just piss all over the sidewalk so i walked over to the alley i almost tripped over her he ran the back of his hand under his nose as it started to leak i had my hand in my pants and i almost tripped over her jesus there was enough light coming in from the street so that i saw her face real good i never saw anyone dead before not ever its not like the movies man it aint nothing like the movies he took a minute sucking on the cigarette and crushing tesss fingers i gagged i took a couple of steps trying to get out and i just started throwing up i thought my sides would bust before i stopped my head was going around again but i got out somehow i think i fell down on the sidewalk there were cops a couple of them stopped their car i told them i just told them to go in the alley you did good gil ben took his pack of cigarettes and stuffed it the boys pocket were going to have one of the officers take you home let you get cleaned up and eat something then we need you at the station can i call my girl sure if she hadnt taken the car shed have been walking home she mightve walked past here call your girl ben told him and ease off the beer whittaker ben signaled to the driver of the first cruiser take gil home will you and give him some time to clean up and pull it together before you bring him in he could use some sleep ben tess murmured he started to snap at her then cut himself off the kid looked ready to drop right drop him off whittaker well send a car for you about noon okay yeah he looked at tess then thanks i do feel better if what happens gives you some trouble and you want to talk about it call the station theyll give you my number before gil was in the car ben had tess by the arm leading her away the department doesnt approve of soliciting for patients at the scene tess shook off his arm yes youre welcome detective im glad i could help you get a coherent story out of your only witness wed have gotten it out of him ben cupped his hands around a match and lit a fresh cigarette out of the corner of his eye he saw harris arrive on the scene you really hate it that i helped dont you because im a psychiatrist i wonder or because im a woman dont psychoanalyze me he warned tossed his cigarette into the street and immediately wished it back i dont have to psychoanalyze to see resentment prejudice and anger she broke off realizing how close she was to losing control in public and creating a scene ben i know you didnt want me to come but i didnt get in the way get in the way he laughed and studied her face no youre a real pro lady thats it isnt it she murmured she wanted to shout to sit down to just walk away it took the rest of her control not to do any of those things whatever you begin you finish that too was part of her training i walked into that alley with you and stayed on the same level i didnt fall apart get sick run away i didnt get hysterical at the sight of a body and that really bothers you doctors are objective right thats right she said calmly though anne reasoners face flashed into her mind but maybe itll soothe your ego to know that it wasnt easy for me i wanted to turn around and walk out of there something inside him jerked but he ignored it you held up pretty good and that strips me of my femininity maybe even my sexuality you would have been happier if youd had to carry me out of that alley never mind the interference or inconvenience that would have been more comfortable for you thats bullshit he pulled out another cigarette cursing himself because he realized it was true i work with plenty of women cops but you dont sleep with them do you ben she said it quietly knowing shed hit a button eyes narrowed he drew in smoke long and deep watch your step yes thats just what i intend to do she pulled her gloves out of her pockets realizing for the first time that her hands were freezing the sun was up now but the light was still murky she didnt think shed ever been so cold tell your captain that hell have an updated report by tomorrow afternoon fine ill get someone to drive you home i want to walk no he took her arm before she could turn away youve mentioned that im a civilian enough times to know you cant order me press charges of harassment if you want but youre getting an escort home its two blocks she began and his grip tightened thats right two blocks two blocks and your name and picture have been in the paper with his free hand he gathered up her hair it was nearly the same shade as anne reasoners they both knew it use some of those brains youre so proud of and think im not going to let you frighten me fine but youre getting an escort home he kept his hand on her arm as he walked her to a cruiser chapter the five detectives assigned to the priest homicides logged better than two hundred sixty hours in legwork and paperwork in the week following anne reasoners murder one of them had a spouse who threatened divorce another worked through a nasty bout of the flu and another around a chronic case of insomnia the fourth in the series of murders was the top story on both the six and eleven oclock news beating out such items as the presidents return from west germany for the moment washington was more interested in murder than politics nbc planned a fourpart special incredibly manuscripts were being peddled to major publishers more incredibly offers were being made paramount was thinking miniseries anne reasoner in fact none of the victims had ever earned such attention alive anne had lived alone she had been a cpa attached to one of the citys law firms her apartment had shown a taste for the avant garde with neon freeformed enameled sculptures and dayglo flamingos her wardrobe had reflected her employer running to softly tailored suits and silk blouses shed been able to afford saks shed owned two jane fonda workout tapes an ibm personal computer and a cuisinart there was a mans picture in a frame beside her bed a quarter ounce of colombian in her bureau drawer and fresh flowers white zinnias on top of it shed been a good employee only three days out sick since the first of the year but her coworkers knew nothing about her social life her neighbors described her as friendly and described the man in the bedside picture as a frequent guest her address book had been neatly ordered and nearly full many of the names were passing acquaintances and distant family along with insurance brokers an oral surgeon and an aerobics instructor then they located suzanne hudson a graphic artist who had been annes friend and confidante since college ben and ed found her at home in an apartment above a boutique she was wearing a terrycloth robe and carrying a cup of coffee her eyes were red and swollen with bruising shadows down to the cheekbones the sound on the television was off but the wheel of fortune played on screen someone had just solved the puzzle when it rains it pours after she let them in she went to the couch and curled up her feet theres coffee in the kitchen if you want it im having a hard time making the effort to be sociable thanks anyway ben took the opposite end of the couch and left the chair for ed you knew anne reasoner pretty well did you ever have a best friend i dont mean someone you just called the best but someone who was her short red hair hadnt been tended to she combed a hand through it and sent it into spikes i really loved her you know i still cant quite grip the fact that shes she bit down on the inside of her lip then soothed the hurt with coffee the funerals tomorrow i know ms hudson its a hell of a time to bother you but we need to ask you some questions john carroll im sorry what john carroll suzanne repeated the name then spelled it meticulously when ed produced his notebook you wanted to know why anne would have been out walking alone in the middle of the night didnt you the grief and anger were there as she leaned forward and picked up an address book with the coffee still in her hand she used her thumb to page through it heres his address she passed the book to ed we have a john carroll a lawyer who was on staff at the firm ms reasoner worked for ed flipped back in his notes and coordinated the addresses thats right thats him he hasnt come into the office for a couple of days hiding she snapped he wouldnt have the courage to come out and face what hes done if he comes tomorrow if he dares to show his face tomorrow ill spit in it then she covered her eyes with her hand and shook her head no no its not right fatigue came through now as she lowered her hand again she loved him she really loved him theyve been seeing each other for almost two years ever since he joined the firm kept it quiet his idea she took a big gulp of coffee and managed to keep her emotions in check he didnt want office gossip she went along with it she went along with everything you cant imagine how much she swallowed for that man anne was the original miss independence ive made it on my own and like it single is an alternative lifestyle she wasnt militant if you know what i mean just content to carve out her own space until john they had a relationship ben prompted if you can call it that she didnt even tell her parents about him no one knew but me she rubbed her eyes mascara had been clumped on her lashes and came off in flakes she was so happy at first i guess i was happy for her but i didnt like the fact that she was well so controlled by him little things you know if he liked italian food she did if he was into french movies so was she suzanne struggled against the bitterness and grief for a moment her free hand began to clamp and unclamp over the lapel of her robe she wanted to get married she needed to marry him all she could think of was bringing their relationship out and registering at bloomingdales he kept putting her off not saying no just not yet not yet anyway she was sinking pretty low emotionally she made some demands on him and he dumped her just like that he didnt even have the guts to say it to her face he called her when did this happen suzanne didnt answer ben for several seconds she stared blankly at the television screen a woman spun the wheel and hit bankrupt tough break the night she was killed she called me that same night saying she didnt know what she was going to do how she was going to handle it it hit her hard he wasnt just another guy he was it for anne i asked her if she wanted me to come over but she said she wanted to be alone i should have gone she screwed her eyes closed i should have gotten in my car and gone over we couldve gotten drunk or high or ordered pizza instead she went out walking alone ben said nothing as she wept quietly tess would know what to say the thought came from nowhere and infuriated him ms hudson ben gave her a moment then continued do you know if anyone had been bothering her had she noticed anyone around the apartment around the office anyone who made her uneasy she didnt notice anyone but john shed have told me she let out a long breath and rubbed the back of her hand under her eyes wed even talked about this maniac a couple of times talked about being extra careful until he was caught she went out because she wasnt thinking or maybe because she had too much to think about shed have pulled herself out anne was tough she just never had the chance they left her on the couch staring at the wheel and went to see john carroll he had a duplex in a part of town that catered to young professionals there was a gourmet market around the corner a liquor store that would carry obscure brands and a shop specializing in athletic wear all tucked within reasonable walking distance of the residential area a dark blue mercedes sedan was parked in his driveway he answered the door after the third knock he was wearing an undershirt and jogging pants and carrying a fifth of chevas regal there was little resemblance to the young successful lawyer on his way up three days worth of beard shadowed his chin his eyes were swollen and the skin had folded into pockets that drooped beneath he smelled like a vagrant who had crawled into an alley on fourteenth to sleep it off he took a cursory look at the badges hefted the bottle for another swig and turned away leaving the door open ed closed it the duplex had wideplanked oak floors partially covered with a couple of aubussons in the living area the sofa was long and low the upholstery on it and the chairs ran to masculine colors grays and blues stateoftheart electronic equipment was displayed on one wall along another was a collection of toys antique slots banks trains carroll collapsed on the sofa in the center of the room two empty bottles and an overflowing ashtray were on the floor a blanket was tossed over the cushions ben calculated he hadnt moved much beyond that spot since hed been notified i can come up with a couple of clean glasses his voice was husky but not slurred as though the liquor had quit doing its job some time before but you cant drink can you on duty he lifted the bottle again and sucked im not on duty wed like to ask you some questions about anne reasoner mr carroll there was a chair behind him but ben didnt sit yeah i figured youd get around to it i told myself if i didnt pass out id talk to you he looked at the bottle that was barely threequarters full cant seem to pass out ed took the bottle from his fingers and set it aside doesnt help really does it somethings got to he pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes then began to search the littered smokedglass coffee table for a cigarette ben lit one for him thanks he drew hard and kept most of the smoke in his lungs i quit two years ago he said and drew again didnt gain any weight though because i cut out starch you and miss reasoner had a relationship ben began you were one of the last people to talk to her yes saturday night we were supposed to go to the national sunday in the park with george annes fond of musicals i prefer straight drama myself but you didnt go to the theater ben interrupted i was feeling pressured i called her to break the date and told her i wanted to let the relationship cool for a while thats how i said it he looked up over the cigarette and met bens eyes it should cool for a while it sounded reasonable did you have fight a fight he laughed at that and choked on smoke no we didnt fight we never fought i dont believe in it theres always a logical and reasonable solution to any problem this was a reasonable solution and it was for her own good did you see her that night mr carroll no he looked around absently for the bottle but ed had put it out of reach she asked me to come over to talk it out she was crying i didnt want to have one of those tearful scenes so i said no i told her i thought it best if we gave it a little time in a week or two we could have drinks after work and talk about it calmly in a week or two he stared straight ahead the ash from his cigarette fell on his knee she called me later she phoned you again ed balanced his notepad on his palm what time was that it was my clock radios right beside the bed i was annoyed with her i shouldnt have been but i was she was high i can always tell when shes had a joint she didnt have an outrageous habit just burned a joint now and then to ease tension but i didnt like it its so childish you know he added i figured shed done it to irritate me she told me shed come to some decisions she wanted me to know that she didnt blame me she was going to take responsibility for her own emotions and not to worry about her causing any scenes at the office when he sat back and closed his eyes his dark blond hair fell over his forehead i was relieved at that because i worried a bit about it she said she had a lot of thinking to do a lot of reevaluating before we talked again i said that was fine and id see her monday when i hung up it was thats seven minutes gil norton had seen the murderer come out of the alley sometime between four and fourthirty ed noted the times on his pad then put it in his pocket youre probably not in the mood for advice mr carroll but youd be better off if you went up to bed and got some sleep he focused on ed then looked at the litter of bottles at his feet i loved her how come i didnt know it until now ben stepped outside and hunched his shoulders against the cold christ i dont think suzanne hudson would feel like spitting in his face now so what have we got ben walked to the car and took the drivers seat a selfish selfindulgent lawyer who doesnt fit nortons description a woman trying to pull back from a bad affair who goes for a walk and a psychopath who just happens to be there when she does a psychopath who wears a cassock ben stuck the key in the ignition but didnt turn it you think hes a priest instead of answering ed sat back and stared at the sky through the windshield how many sort of tall darkhaired priests you figure there are in the city ed took out a plastic bag of trail mix enough to keep us busy for six months we havent got six months it wouldnt hurt to talk to logan again yeah he dipped his fingers into the plastic bag ed offered without thinking how about this a former priest one who dropped out because of some churchoriented tragedy logan might be able to get us a few names another crumb in her report dr court says hes cracking that this last murder probably left him disabled for a couple of days i read it what the hell is this bark and twigs ben twisted the key and pulled out from the curb raisins almonds some granola you ought to call her ben ill handle my personal life partner he turned the corner and went a block before he swore sorry no problem you know i saw this special it pointed out that in current society men really have it made women have taken the pressure off them to be the sole support the mr macho who has to handle all the problems and bring home the bacon women are generally waiting longer to look for marriage if they look for marriage at all which leaves men with more choices todays woman isnt looking for prince charming on a white charger the funny thing is a lot of men are still threatened by strength and independence he plucked out a raisin pretty amazing kiss ass dr court strikes me as being pretty independent good for her who wants a woman who hangs all over you bunny didnt hang exactly ed remembered she sort of draped bunny was comic relief ben muttered and bunny had been one of his standard threemonth affairs where you meet share a few dinners have a few laughs bounce around in the sheets and call it quits before anyone gets any ideas he thought of tess leaning back against his windowsill and laughing look when youre in our business you need a woman who doesnt make you think all the time who doesnt make you think about her all the time youre making a mistake ed leaned back but i figure youre smart enough to see it for yourself ben made the turn toward catholic university lets hit logan before we go back in at five pm all the detectives assigned to the priest homicides but bigsby were spread out in the conference room harris had a copy of all the reports in front of him but went over each point by point they traced anne reasoners movements on the final night of her life at pm she had left her regular beauty salon where shed had a trim color touchup blowdry and manicure shed been in excellent spirits and had tipped her operator ten dollars at fivefifteen she had picked up her dry cleaning one gray suit with vest two linen blouses and a pair of gabardine slacks at approximately fivethirty she had arrived home her nextdoor neighbor had spoken to her in the hall anne had mentioned going to the theater that evening shed carried fresh flowers at sevenfifteen john carroll had called her and broken their date and their relationship they had spoken for roughly fifteen minutes at eightthirty anne reasoner had called suzanne hudson shed been upset tearful they had talked for nearly an hour around midnight the nextdoor neighbor had heard reasoners television shed noticed it because she was coming in for the evening herself and hadnt expected reasoner to be home at reasoner had phoned carroll two roaches of marijauna had been found beside the phone they had talked until none of the neighbors heard reasoner leave the building sometime between four and fourthirty am gil norton had seen a man dressed as a priest exit the alley two blocks from reasoners apartment at norton attracted the attention of two patrolmen and reported the body those are the facts harris said behind him was a map of the city with the murder sights flagged with blue pins from the map we can see that hes confined himself to an area less than seven square miles all the murders have occurred between one and five am there is no sexual assault no robbery from the pattern monsignor logan established we expect him to hit again on december eighth street patrols will be working double shifts from now until then we know that he is a man of average or above average height that he has dark hair and dresses as a priest from dr courts psychiatric profile and reports we know that he is psychopathic possibly schizophrenic with religious delusions he kills only young blond women who apparently symbolize an actual person who is or was in his life dr court feels that due to the break in pattern of the murder and the disorder of the printing on the note left on the body that he is nearing a crisis in his psychosis the last murder may have cost him more than he can afford he dropped the file on the table thinking it was more than any of them could afford its her opinion that he would have had a physical reaction headaches nausea that would have debilitated him if he is still able to function on a normal level for periods of time its placing an enormous strain on him she believes it would show in fatigue loss of appetite inattention he paused a moment to make certain everyone in the room was taking it in the room was separated from the squad room by windows and venetian blinds that were yellowing with age beyond them could be heard the steady hum of activity phones footsteps voices there was a coffee machine in the corner and a jumbosized plastic cup for cops with a conscience to drop in twentyfive cents a shot harris walked over to it poured a cup and added a spoonful of the powdered cream he detested he drank and looked at his staff they were restless overworked and frustrated if they didnt start cutting down to an eighthour day he was going to lose some of them to the flu lowenstein and roderick were already popping decongestants he couldnt afford to have them off sick and he couldnt afford to pamper them we have in this room over sixty years of police experience its time we put those sixtyodd years on the line and catch one sick religious fanatic who probably cant keep his breakfast down in the morning anymore ed and i talked to logan again ben pushed aside his plastic cup of coffee since the guy dresses like a priest we thought wed start treating him like one as a psychiatrist logan talks to and treats fellow priests who are having any kind of emotional problems hes not going to give us a list of his patients but hes going through his files checking for anything anyone who might fit then theres a matter of the confessional he stopped for a moment confession was part of the catholic ritual that had always given him a problem he could remember well kneeling in that dark little room with the screened panel confessing repenting atoning go and sin no more but of course he had a priest has to confess to somebody and it has to be another priest if dr courts right and hes beginning to think of what hes done as a sin hes going to have to confess so we start interviewing priests lowenstein put in look obviously i dont know a lot about catholics but isnt there something about the sanctity of the confessional we probably wouldnt get a priest to finger anyone who came to him in the confessional ben agreed but maybe wed get another location chances are hed stick with his own parish tess dr court said he probably attended church regularly we might be able to find out what church if hes a priest or was one hed probably be drawn to his own church he rose and went to the map this area he said circling the blue flags includes two parishes im betting hes been to one or both of these churches maybe standing on the altar you figure hes going to show up on sunday roderick put in he clamped his thumb and forefinger on the bridge of his nose to relieve some pressure especially if dr court was right and he was too sick to make it last week hell need the support of the ceremony i think so masses run saturday evening too i thought that was our province lowenstein commented catholics are flexible ben dipped his hands in his pockets and they like to sleep late on sunday like everybody else the thing is im betting this guy is a traditionalist sunday morning is for mass the mass should still be said in latin and you dont eat meat on friday church rules i think courts got something when she says the guys obsessed with church rules so we cover the two churches on sunday in the meantime weve got a couple of days to interview priests harris looked at each of his detectives lowenstein you and roderick take one parish jackson and paris the other bigsby will where the hell is bigsby he said he had a lead on the amices captain roderick rose and poured a cup of ice water knowing there was too much coffee in his system already look i dont want to throw a wrench in the works but suppose he does show up during one of the masses on sunday what makes any of us think we can pick him out of the congregation the guy isnt a freak he isnt going to come in speaking in tongues or frothing at the mouth dr court points out that hes just like anyone else except for the fact that hes troubled its all weve got ben stated annoyed at having his own doubts stated by someone else weve got to go with whatever advantage we have at the moment its location we check out the men who come alone court also thinks hes a loner so hes not going to come in with the wife and kids logan takes it one step further and sees him as devout a lot of people come to mass and nod off or at least space out he wouldnt do either spending the day in church gives us the opportunity to try something else ed finished a note then looked up pray it couldnt hurt lowenstein said under her breath as bigsby swung into the room ive got something he held a yellow pad in his hand and his red and watery eyes were bulging hed been spending his nights with nyquil and a hotwater bottle one dozen white silk amices invoice number a ordered on june fifteenth from odonnelys religious suppliers boston massachusetts delivery july thirtyfirst reverend francis moore the address is a post office in georgetown howd he pay for it harriss voice was calm as he worked through the next steps money order track it down i want a copy of the invoice its on its way lowenstein get to the post office he checked his watch and nearly swore in frustration be there when it opens in the morning find out if he still has the box get a description yes sir i want to know if theres a priest in the city whose name is francis moore thered be a list of all the priests in the archdiocese we should be able to get it from their main office harris nodded at ben check it out then check out the rest of the francis moores he couldnt argue with basic police work but bens instincts told him to concentrate on the area of the murders he was there ben was sure of it and now maybe they had his name back in the squad room the detectives hit the phones an hour later ben hung up and looked at ed over the rubble on top of his desk we got one father francis moore in the archdiocese been here twoandahalf years hes thirtyseven and hes black ben reached for his cigarettes and found the pack empty we check him out anyway what have you got ive got seven ed looked down at his neatly detailed list someone sneezed behind him and he winced the flu was going through the station like brushfire a high school teacher a lawyer a clerk at sears a currently unemployed a bartender a flight attendant and a maintenance worker hes an excon attempted rape ben checked his watch hed been on duty just over ten hours lets go the rectory made him uncomfortable the scent of fresh flowers competed with the scent of polished wood they waited in a parlor with an old comfortable sofa two wing chairs and a statue of a bluerobed jesus with one hand raised in benediction there were two copies of catholic digest on the coffee table makes me feel like i shouldve polished my shoes ed murmured both men were conscious of the guns under their jackets and didnt sit from somewhere down the hall a door opened long enough to let out a few strains of strauss the door closed again and the waltz was replaced by footsteps the detectives looked over asreverend francis moore walked in he was tall and built like a fullback his skin was the color of glossy mahogany and his hair was clipped close around a round face against the black of his priests robe was a white sling his right arm was in a plaster cast riddled with signatures good evening he smiled apparently more curious than pleased to have visitors i apologize for not shaking hands looks like youve had some trouble ed could almost feel his partners disappointment even if gil norton had been off on the description there was no getting around that cast football a couple of weeks ago i should have known better wont you sit down we need to ask you a few questions father ben drew out his badge about the strangulation of four women the serial killings moore bowed his head a moment as if in prayer what can i do did you place an order with odonnelys religious supplies in boston last summer boston moores free hand toyed with the rosary at his belt no father jessup is in charge of supplies he orders what we need from a firm here in washington do you keep a post office box father why no all our mail is delivered to the rectory excuse me detective paris detective paris what is this all about ben hesitated a moment then decided to push whatever buttons were available your name was used to order the murder weapons he saw the fingers on the rosary tighten moores mouth opened then closed he reached out and gripped the left wing of a chair i you suspect me theres a possibility you know or have been in contact with the murderer i cant believe it why dont you sit down father ed touched him gently on the shoulder and eased him into the chair my name moore murmured its hard to take it in then he laughed shakily the name was given to me in a catholic orphanage in virginia its not even the one i was born with i cant tell you that one because i dont know it father moore youre not a suspect ben told him we have a witness who says the murderer is white and youve got your arm in a cast moore wriggled his dark fingers which disappeared into plaster a couple of lucky breaks sorry he drew a breath and tried to pull himself together ill be honest with you these murders have more than once been a topic of conversation here the press calls him a priest the police have yet to determine that ed put in in any case weve all searched our souls and strained our minds trying to find some answers i wish we had some are you close to your parishioners father moore turned to ben again i wish i could say yes there are some of course we have a church supper once a month then theres the youth group right now were planning a thanksgiving dance for the teen club im afraid we dont pack them in is there anyone who concerns you someone you might consider emotionally unstable detective im in the business of comforting the troubled weve had some drug and alcohol abuse and an unfortunate case of wife beating a few months ago still theres no one i would even consider capable of these murders your name might have been pulled out of a hat or it might have been used because the killer identified with you as a priest ben paused knowing he was stepping onto the hardpacked unmovable ground of the sanctified father has anyone come to you in the confessional and indicated in any way that he knew something about the murders again i can be honest and say no detective are you certain it was my name ed took out his notepad and read from it reverend francis moore not francis x moore no moore passed his hand over his eyes i hope relief isnt a sin when i was given my name and was old enough to learn to write it i always used the x for xavier i thought having a middle name that began with x was exotic and unique i never got out of the habit detectives every piece of identification i have uses my middle initial everything i sign includes it everyone who knows me knows me as reverend francis x moore ed noted it down if hed gone with instinct he would have said good night and gone on to the next address on the list procedure was more demanding and infinitely more boring than instinct they interviewed the three other priests in the rectory well it only took us an hour to come up with nothing ben commented as they walked back to the car we gave those guys something to talk about tonight we put in yet another hour of overtime this week accountings going to hit the roof yeah ed smiled a little as he eased into the passengers seat lousy bastards we could give them a break or we can go see the excon ed considered a moment then pulled out the rest of his trail mix it should hold him until he could get a meal ive got another hour there were no fresh flowers in the oneroom apartment in south east the furniture what there was of it hadnt been polished since it had been bought from the salvation army a murphy bed no one had bothered to tuck back into the wall took up most of the room the sheets werent clean the unpleasant odors of sweat stale sex and onions hung in the room the blonde had an inch of brown root showing in her frizzed mop of hair she opened the door with the slow wary stare of the knowing when ben and ed showed their badges she wore snug jeans over a wellshaped rear and a pink sweater that was cut low enough to show breasts that were starting to sag ben gauged her to be about twentyfive though there were lines already dug deep at the sides of her mouth her eyes were brown and the left one was set off by a bruise that had rainbowed into mauve yellow and gray he judged shed taken the hit three or four days earlier mrs moore no we aint married the blonde dug a cigarette out of a pack of virginia slims youve come a long way baby frank went out for beer hell be back in a minute is he in trouble we just need to talk to him ed gave her an easy smile and decided she needed more protein in her diet sure well i can tell you hes been keeping out of trouble ive seen to that she found a pack of matches lit her cigarette then used the pack to squash a small roach maybe he drinks a little too much but i make sure he does it here where he cant get in trouble she looked around the pitiful room and drew deep on the cigarette it dont look like much but im putting money aside franks got a good job now and hes dependable you can ask his super were not here to hassle frank ben decided against sitting you couldnt be sure what might be crawling under the cushions sounds like youve got him pretty much in line she touched her bruised eye i give as good as i get i bet what happened frank wanted another five for beer on saturday ive got a budget saturday ben came to attention the night of the last murder the woman facing him was a blonde of sorts i guess you two got into it then he stomped out so he could go down to the bar and bitch with the boys he didnt go anywhere she grinned and tapped her ash into a plastic dish that invited you to put your butt here he got a shot in and the neighbors downstairs were beating with that damn broomstick on the ceiling i got a shot right back she let the smoke trail lightly out of her mouth and up her nose frank respects that sort of thing in a woman he likes it you know so we made up he didnt think about beer anymore saturday night the door opened frank moore had arms like cinder blocks legs like tree trunks and stood maybe five feet five he was wearing a black trench coat that had moth holes in the shoulder and was carrying a sixpack of the king of beers who the hell are you he demanded his free arm was already flexed ben pulled out his badge homicide frank dropped his arm ben noticed the inchlong scratch on his cheek as he leaned over to read the badge it was scabbed over and looked every bit as nasty as the blondes bruise the system eats shit frank announced and slammed the sixpack onto the counter that slut tells the judge i tried to rape her i end up doing three years then when i get out i got cops hanging around i told you the system eats shit maureen yeah the blonde helped herself to a beer you told me why dont you just tell us where you were last sunday morning frank ben began about four am four in the morning jesus i was in bed like everybody else and i wasnt alone neither he jerked a thumb at maureen before he popped the top on a bud beer fizzled through the opening and added one more smell to the room you catholic frank frank wiped the back of his hand over his mouth belched and drank again do i look catholic franks daddy was baptist maureen supplied shut your face frank told her kiss ass she only smiled when he lifted an arm ed had taken only one step forward when frank dropped it again you want to tell the cops everything fine my old man was baptist no cards no drinking nofuckingaround baptist he kicked my ass plenty and i kicked his once before i left home that was fifteen years ago a twobit whore railroaded me into prison i did three years and if i ever saw her again id kick her ass too he pulled a pack of camels out of his shirt pocket and lit it with a battered zippo i got a job washing floors and cleaning toilets i come home every night so this bitch can tell me i only got five dollars for beer i aint done nothing illegal maureenll tell you he swung a loving arm around the woman hed just called a bitch thats right she took a swig from her beer he didnt fit the description not the physical one nor the psychiatric one still ben persisted where were you august fifteenth jesus how am i supposed to remember frank chugged the rest of the beer down and crushed the can you guys got a warrant to be in here we were in atlantic city maureen didnt blink when frank tossed the can and missed the trash bag by inches remember frank my sister works up there you know she got us a good deal at the hotel where she does housekeeping the ocean view inn it aint on the strip or nothing but its close we drove up on august fourteenth and spent three days its in my diary yeah i remember he dropped his arm and turned on her i was playing craps and you came down and started bitching at me youd lost twentyfive bucks idve won it back and twice that much if youd left me be you stole the money out of my purse borrowed it you cunt borrowed it ben jerked his head toward the door as the argument heated up lets get out of here as the door closed behind him they heard a crash over the screaming think we should break it up ben looked back at the door what and spoil their fun something solid and breakable hit the door and shattered lets go get a drink chapter mr monroe i appreciate you coming by to talk with me tess greeted joey higginss stepfather at the door to her office my secretarys gone for the day but i can fix us some coffee if you like not for me he stood uncomfortable as always in her presence and waited for her to make the first move i realize youve already put in a full day she began not adding shed put in one of her own i dont mind the extra time if it helps joey i know she smiled gesturing him to a chair i havent had many opportunities to speak to you privately mr monroe but i want to tell you that i can see how hard youre trying with joey it isnt easy he folded his overcoat on his lap he was a tidy man organized by nature his fingers were neatly manicured his hair combed into place his suit dark and conservative tess thought she understood how inscrutable he would find a boy like joey its harder on lois of course is it tess sat behind her desk knowing the distance and the impersonal position would make it easier for him mr monroe coming into a family after a divorce and trying to be a father figure to a teenage boy is difficult under any circumstances when the boy is as troubled as joey the difficulties are vastly multiplied id hoped by now well he lifted his hands then laid them flat again id hoped we could do things together ball games i even bought a tent though i have to admit i dont know the first thing about camping but hes not interested doesnt feel he can allow himself to be interested tess corrected mr monroe joey has linked himself with his father to a very unhealthy degree his fathers failures are his failures his fathers problems his problems the bastard doesnt even he cut himself off im sorry no dont apologize i know it appears that joeys rather doesnt care or cant be bothered it stems from his illness but that isnt what i wanted to speak with you about mr monroe you know ive tried to discuss intensifying joeys treatment the clinic i mentioned in alexandria specializes in emotional illness in adolescents lois wont hear of it as far as monroe was concerned it ended there she feels and i have to agree that joey would think wed abandoned him the transition would be difficult theres no denying that it would have to be handled by all of us in such a way that joey understands he isnt being punished or sent away but offered another chance mr monroe i have to be candid with you joey is not responding to treatment hes not drinking no hes not drinking how could she convince him that the alleviation of one symptom was far from a cure shed already seen in their family therapy sessions that monroe was a man who saw results much more clearly than he saw causes mr monroe joey is an alcoholic will always be an alcoholic whether he drinks or not hes one of twentyeight million children of alcoholics in this country one third of them become alcoholics themselves as joey has but hes not drinking monroe persisted no hes not she linked her fingers laid them on the blotter and tried again he is not consuming alcohol hes not altering his reality with alcohol but he has yet to deal with his dependency and more importantly the reasons for it he is not getting drunk mr monroe but the alcohol was a coverup and an offshoot of other problems he cant control or blanket those problems with liquor anymore and now theyre overwhelming him he shows no anger mr monroe no rage and very little grief though its all bottled inside of him children of alcoholics often take on the responsibility for their parents illness uncomfortable and impatient monroe shifted in his chair youve explained that before yes i have joey resents his father and to a great extent he resents his mother because both of them let him down his father with his drinking his mother with her preoccupation with his fathers drinking because he loves them hes turned this resentment onto himself lois did her best yes im sure she did shes a remarkably strong woman unfortunately joey doesnt have her strength joeys depression has reached a dangerous stage a critical stage i cant tell even you what was discussed or what was said in our recent sessions but i can tell you im more concerned than ever over his emotional state hes in such pain at this point im doing little more than soothing the pain so that he can get through the week until i can soothe it again joey feels his life is worthless that hes failed as a son as a friend as a person the divorce divorce batters the children involved the extent of which depends on the state of mind the children are in at the time the way the divorce is handled the emotional strength of the individual child for some it can be as devastating as a death theres usually a period of grief of bitterness even of denial selfblame is common mr monroe its been nearly three years since your wife separated from joeys father his obsession with the divorce and his part in it isnt normal its become a springboard for all of his problems she paused a moment and linked her hands together again his alcoholism is painful joey feels he deserves the pain in fact he appreciates it in the way a small child appreciates being disciplined for breaking the rules the discipline the pain makes him feel a part of society while at the same time the alcoholism itself makes joey feel isolated from society hes learned to depend on this isolation on seeing himself as different not quite as good as everyone else particularly you me i dont understand joey identifies with his father a drunk a failure both in business and in family life you are everything his father and therefore joey is not part of him wants to cut himself off from his father and model himself on you the rest of him simply doesnt feel worthy and hes afraid to risk another failure its gone beyond that even mr monroe joey is fast reaching a point where hes too tired to bother at all with life his fingers were clenching and unclenching when he spoke it was his calm board of directors voice i dont follow you suicide is the third highest cause of death among teenagers mr monroe joey has definite suicidal tendencies hes already playing with the idea circling around it with his fascination with the occult it would take very little at this point in his life to push him over the line an argument that leaves him feeling rebellious a test in school that makes him feel inadequate his fathers ambivalent behavior though her voice was calm the underlying urgency was communicating to him tess leaned forward hoping to take it to the next step mr monroe i cant stress how vital it is that joey begin structured intensified treatment you trusted me enough to bring him here to allow me to treat him you have to trust me enough to believe me when i say im not enough for him i have information here on the clinic she pushed a folder across the desk please discuss this with your wife ask her to come in and talk it over with me ill rearrange my schedule so that we can meet any time its convenient but please make it soon joey needs this and he needs it now before something pushes him over he took the folder but didnt open it you want us to send joey to a place like this but you didnt want us to have him change schools no i didnt she wanted to pull the pins out of her hair run her hands through it until the pressure at her temples was gone at that time i felt i hoped i could still reach him since september joeys been pulling away more and more he saw the change in schools as another failure didnt he yes im sorry i knew it was a mistake he let out a long breath when lois was making the arrangements to transfer him he looked at me it was as if he was saying please give me a chance i could almost hear him but i backed her up theres no blame here mr monroe you and your wife are dealing with a situation where there are no easy answers there is no absolute right or wrong ill take the papers home he rose then slowly as though the folder in his hand were weighty and leaden dr court lois is pregnant we havent told joey congratulations she offered her hand while her mind weighed how this news might affect her patient i think it would be nice if you told him together making it a family affair the three of you are expecting a baby it would be very important to joey to be made to feel included rather than replaced a baby the anticipation of a baby can bring a great deal of love into a family weve been afraid he might resent it us he might timing she thought emotional survival could so often depend on timing the more hes brought into the process into the planning the more hell feel a part of it do you have a nursery we have a spare bedroom we thought we might redecorate i imagine joey would be pretty good with a paintbrush given the chance please call me after youve discussed the clinic id like to go over it with joey myself perhaps take him there so that he can see it all right thank you doctor tess closed the door behind him then pulled out the pins in her hair the band of tension eased leaving only a dull ache she wasnt sure she could rest easy until joey was being treated in the clinic at least they were turning in the right direction she told herself monroe hadnt been enthusiastic about her suggestion but she believed he would push for it tess locked away joeys file and his tapes holding on to the cassette from their last session a moment longer hed spoken of death twice during the session both times in a matteroffact way he hadnt termed it as dying but as opting out death as a choice she kept the last tape out and decided to phone the director of the clinic in the morning when her phone rang she nearly groaned she could leave it her answering service would pick it up after the fourth ring and contact her if it was important then she changed her mind holding joeys tape in her hand as she crossed over and picked it up hello dr court in the silence that followed she heard labored breathing and the sounds of traffic automatically she pulled a pad over and picked up a pencil this is dr court can i help you can you the voice was only a whisper she heard not the panic she was half expecting but despair i can try would you like me to you werent there if youd been there it might have been different im here now would you like to see me cant she heard the deep gulping sob youd know i can come to you why dont you tell me your name and where you are she heard the click less than a block away the man in the dark coat leaned against the pay phone and wept in pain and confusion damn tess glanced down at the notes shed made of the conversation if hed been a patient she hadnt recognized his voice on the off chance that the phone would ring again she stayed another fifteen minutes then gathered up her work and left the office frank fuller was waiting in the hall well there she is he slipped his breath spray back into his pocket i was beginning to think youd moved out of the building tess glanced back at her door her name and profession were neatly printed on it no not yet working a bit late tonight frank oh you know how it goes actually hed spent the last hour trying to drum up a date he hadnt been successful apparently this policeconsultant business has kept you pretty tied up apparently even for someone whose manners were as ingrained as tesss small talk after the day shed put in was stretching things her thoughts drifted back to the phone call as she waited for the elevator you know tess he used his old trick of resting his hand against the wall and surrounding her you might find it beneficial professionally speaking to consult with a colleague on this id be glad to make some room on my calendar i appreciate that frank but i know how busy you are when the elevator doors slid open she stepped inside she pressed the button for the ground floor and shifted her briefcase as he stepped in beside her never too busy for you tess professionally or otherwise why dont we discuss it over drinks im afraid im not at liberty to discuss it at all we can find something else to discuss then i have this bottle of wine a cocky little zinfandel ive been saving for the right occasion why dont we go back to my place pop the cork and put up our feet so he could start nibbling her toes tess thought and sent up a quiet prayer of thanksgiving when the doors opened again no thanks frank she made tracks across the lobby but didnt shake him why dont we stop in at the mayflower then a quiet drink a little music and no shop talk champagne cocktails at the mayflower ben had told her that was her style perhaps it was time to prove to him and frank fuller that it wasnt the mayflowers a bit staid for my taste frank she flipped up her collar as they stepped into the chilly darkness of the parking lot but in any case i havent the time for socializing you should try that new club around the corner zeedos from what i hear its almost impossible not to score if you dig in for the evening she pulled out her keys and slipped one into the lock of her car door how do you know about frank she clucked her tongue then patted his cheek grow up delighted with herself and his astounded expression she slid into the car she glanced over her shoulder as she reversed but barely spared a glance at the man standing in the shadows at the edge of the lot shed hardly gotten through the door and shed her coat and shoes when someone knocked if it was frank shed stop being polite tess promised herself and give it to him right between the eyes senator jonathan writemore stood in his saville row overcoat holding a red cardboard box of chicken and a slim paper bag grandpa most of the tension tess hadnt been aware of having slipped away she drew a deep breath and all but tasted the spices i hope youre not on your way to a hot date im on my way right here he dropped the box of chicken into her hands its still hot little girl i got extra spicy my hero i was about to fix myself a cheese sandwich figures get the plates and plenty of napkins she slipped into the kitchen setting the chicken on the table as she went by does this mean im not invited to dinner tomorrow this means you eat two decent meals this week dont forget the corkscrew i have a bottle of wine here as long as its not zinfandel what never mind tess returned carrying plates linen napkins two of her best wineglasses and a corkscrew she set the table lit the candles then turned to give her grandfather a bear hug im so glad to see you how did you know i needed a boost tonight grandfathers are born knowing he kissed both her cheeks then scowled at her youre not getting enough rest im the doctor he gave her a swat on the rear just sit down little girl he turned his attention to the wine bottle when she obeyed tess lifted the lid while he dealt with the cork give me one of those chicken tits she giggled like a girl and placed the fast food on her mothers best english bone china think how shocked your constituents would be if they heard you talking about chicken tits she chose a drumstick and was delighted to discover a box of fries hows the senate business it takes a lot of shit to grow flowers tess he drew the cork im still lobbying to get the medicaid reform bill passed i dont know if i can pull off enough support before we adjourn for the holidays its a good bill it makes me proud of you flatterer he poured her wine then his own wheres the ketchup cant eat fries without ketchup no dont get up ill get it whens the last time youve been to the store he asked the minute he opened the refrigerator dont start she said and took a bite of chicken besides you know im the expert on takeout and eatins i dont like to think of my only granddaughter forever eating out of a carton he came back in with a bottle of ketchup easily ignoring the fact that they were both eating out of a carton if i wasnt here youd be over at that desk with a cheese sandwich and a stack of files did i say i was glad to see you tess lifted her wineglass and smiled at him youre overworking maybe how about i buy two tickets for saint croix and we take off the day after christmas have ourselves a week of fun in the sun you know id love to but the holidays are the roughest on some of my patients i have to be here for them ive been having second thoughts you bypassing the ketchup she began to nibble on fries and wondered if she had room for a second piece of chicken about what getting you involved with these homicides youre looking worn out its only partly that having a problem with your sex life privileged information seriously tess ive spoken with the mayor hes told me how involved you are with the police investigation all i had in mind was the profile maybe showing off my smart granddaughter a bit vicarious thrills huh the thrill takes on a different complexion after the fourth murder only two blocks from here grandpa that would have happened whether i was involved with the investigation or not the point now is i want to be involved she thought of ben his accusations his resentment she thought of her own wellordered life and the sudden small twinges of dissatisfaction maybe i need to be involved things have been pretty cut and dried for me up to now in my life and my career my part in this has shown me a different aspect of myself and of the system she took up her napkin but only kneaded it in her hands the police arent interested in the workings of his mind in his emotional motivation yet theyll use the knowledge to try to catch him and to punish him im not interested in seeing him punished yet ill use what i can learn of his mind his motivation to try to have him stopped and helped which of us is right grandpa is justice punishment or is it treatment youre talking to a lawyer of the old school tess every man woman and child in this country is entitled to representation and a fair trial the lawyer might not believe in the client but he has to believe in the law the law says that this man has the right to be judged by the system and usually the system works but does the system the law understand the diseased mind shaking her head she set the napkin down again recognizing her kneading as nerves not guilty by reason of insanity shouldnt it be not responsible grandpa he is guilty of murdering those women but responsible no hes not one of your patients tess yes he is he has been all along but i didnt understand that until last week the last murder he hasnt asked me for help yet but he will be asking for it grandpa do you remember what you said to me the day i opened my office he studied her seeing that even with her intense and troubled eyes the candlelight made her beautiful she was his little girl probably said too many things ive been alive a long time you said that id chosen a profession that would allow me into peoples minds and that i could never forget their hearts i havent forgotten i was proud of you that day i still am she smiled and picked up her napkin youve got ketchup on your chin senator she murmured and wiped it off three and a half miles away ben and ed had had more than one drink the club was decorated with wine bottles had its fair share of regulars and a blind piano player who sang lowkey rock his tip jar was only half full but the evening was young their table was roughly the size of a place mat squeezed in among a line of others ed worked his way through a pasta salad ben settled on the beer nuts you eat enough of those ben commented with a nod at eds plate you turn into a yuppie cant be a yuppie if you dont drink white wine sure absolutely taking him at his word ben plucked up a rotini noodle what was the word when you called in ben picked up his glass and watched a woman in a short leather skirt slide past their table bigsby went by the drugstore where he bought the money order nothing whos going to remember a guy buying a money order three months ago arent you going to put any salt on that are you kidding ed signaled for another round neither of them were drunk yet but not for lack of trying you going over to kinikees saturday to watch the game ive got to look at apartments ive got to be out by the first of december you should forget an apartment ben said as he switched to his fresh drink rent moneys money down the tube you ought to be thinking about buying your own place investing your money buying ed picked up a spoon and stirred his drink you mean a house sure youve got to be crazy to toss money out the window every month on rent buy you thinking of buying a house on my salary ben laughed and tipped the chair back the full inch he had last i looked i was bringing home the same as you i tell you what you need to do partner you need to get married ed said nothing but drained half his drink im serious you find a woman make sure she has a good job i mean like a career so she wont be thinking about dumping it after it would help if you found one you didnt mind looking at for long periods of time then you combine your salaries you buy a house and you stop throwing away rent money theyre turning my apartment building into condos so i have to get married thats the system lets ask an unbiased party ben leaned over to the woman beside him excuse me but do you believe with todays social and economic climate that two can live as cheaply as one in fact considering the buying power of a twoincome family that two can almost always live more cheaply than one the woman set down her spritzer and gave ben a considering look is this a pickup no this is a random poll theyre turning my partners apartment into a condo the dirty bastards did the same thing to me now it takes me twenty minutes on the metro to get to work you have a job sure i manage womens better dresses at woodies manage thats right here you go ed ben leaned toward him your future bride have another drink ben youre blowing a perfect opportunity why dont we switch places so you can he trailed off as he spotted the man approaching their table instinctively he straightened in his chair evening monsignor ed turned and saw logan just behind him wearing a gray sweater and slacks nice to see you again monsignor want to squeeze in yes if im not interrupting logan managed to draw a chair up to the corner of the table i called the station and they told me youd be here i hope you dont mind ben ran a finger up and down the side of his glass what can we do for you monsignor you can call me tim logan signaled to the waitress i think that would make us all more comfortable bring me a st pauli girl and bring another round for my associates logan glanced over as the piano player went into one of billy joels ballads i dont have to ask if you two have had a hard day ive been in contact with dr court and i had a brief discussion with your captain a couple of hours ago youre trying to pin down a francis moore tryings the word ed pushed aside his empty plate so the waitress would clear it when she served the drinks i knew a frank moore used to teach in seminary down here old school unshakable faith the kind of priest i imagine youre more accustomed to ben where is he oh in gods light im sure he picked up a handful of nuts he died a couple of years ago bless you child logan said when his beer was in front of him now old frank wasnt a raving fanatic he simply wasnt flexible today we have a lot of young priests who question and search who debate such horny you should forgive the pun issues as celibacy and a womans right to give the sacraments it was easier for frank moore who saw things in black and white a man of the cloth doesnt lust for wine women or silk underwear cheers he lifted his glass and drained what was left of the beer im telling you this because i thought i might tug on a few connections talk to some people who would remember frank and some of the students under him i did some counseling at the seminary myself but that was nearly ten years ago well take what we can get good now that thats settled i think ill have another beer he caught the waitresss eye then turned back to smile at ben how many years of catholic school ben dug for his cigarettes twelve the whole route im sure the good sisters gave you an admirable foundation and a few good shots across the knuckles yes bless them they arent all ingrid bergmans no i dont have much in common with pat obrien myself logan hefted his fresh beer of course were both irish lecheim father logan tim ed quickly corrected can i ask you a religious question if you must if this guy any guy came to you in the confessional and told you hed done someone murdered someone would you turn him in thats a question i can answer equally as a psychiatrist and as a priest theyre arent many he studied his beer a moment there were times when logans superiors considered him too flexible but his faith in god and in his fellow man was unwavering if someone who had committed a crime came to me in the confessional or sought my professional help i would do my best to persuade him to turn himself in but you wouldnt push the button ben persisted if someone came to me as a doctor or seeking absolution theyd be looking for help id see that they got it psychiatry and religion dont always see eye to eye in this case they do there was nothing ed liked better than a problem with more than one solution if they dont see eye to eye how can you do both by struggling to understand the soul and the mind in many ways seeing them as one in the same you know as a priest i could argue the subject of creation for hours i could give you viable reasons why genesis stands solid as a rock as a scientist i could do precisely the same thing with evolution and explain why genesis is a beautiful fairy tale as a man i could sit here and say what the hell difference does it make were here which do you believe ben asked him he preferred one solution one answer the right answer that depends in a matter of speaking on what suit im wearing he took a long drink and realized if he had a third beer hed be pleasantly buzzed while enjoying the second he began to look forward to the third unlike what old francis moore used to teach there are no blacks and whites ben not in catholicism not in psychiatry and certainly not in life did god create us out of his goodness and generosity and perhaps a sense of the ridiculous or did we invent god because we have a desperate innate need to believe in something larger more powerful than ourselves i argue with myself often he signaled for another round none of the priests i knew ever questioned the order of things ben swallowed the rest of his vodka it was right or it was wrong usually it was wrong and you had to pay for it sin in its infinite variety the ten commandments were very clear thou shalt not kill yet weve been warriors since before we could speak the church doesnt condemn the soldier who defends his country ben thought of josh josh had condemned himself to kill onetoone is a sin to drop a bomb with an american flag on it on a village is patriotic we are ridiculous creatures arent we logan said comfortably let me use a more simplistic example of interpretation i had a young student a couple of years ago a bright young woman who im embarrassed to say knew her bible better than i could ever hope to she came to me one day on the question of masturbation he turned a little in his chair and jogged the waitresss elbow excuse me dear he turned back she had a quote im sure i wont get it quite right but it had to do with it being better that a man cast his seed into the belly of a whore than to spill it onto the ground a pretty strong stand one might say against ah selfservicing mary magdalene was a whore ed mumbled as the booze began to catch up with him so she was logan beamed at him in any case my students point was that the female has no seed to cast anywhere or to spill on the ground therefore it must only be a sin to masturbate if youre a male ben remembered a couple of sweaty terrifying sessions during puberty i had to say the whole damn rosary he muttered i had to say it twice logan put in and for the first time saw ben relax with a grin what did you tell her ed wanted to know i told her the bible often speaks in generalities that she should search her conscience then i looked up the quote myself he took a comfortable drink damned if i didnt think she had a point chapter the greenbriar art gallery was a small fussy pair of rooms near the potomac that stayed in business because people always buy the ridiculous if the price tag is high enough it was run by a crafty little man who rented the ramshackle building for a song and promoted his eccentric reputation by painting the outside puce he favored long unstructured jackets in rainbow hues with half boots to match and he smoked pastel cigarettes he had an odd moonshaped face and pale eyes that tended to flutter when he spoke of the freedom and expression of art he tucked his profits tidily away in municipal bonds magda p carlyse was an artist who became trendy when a former first lady had purchased one of her sculptures as a wedding present for the daughter of a friend a few art critics had suggested that the first lady must not be too fond of the newlyweds but magdas career had been launched her showing at the greenbriar gallery was a huge success people crammed into the room dressed in furs denim spandex and silks cappuccino was served in thimblesized cups along with mushroom quiches the size of quarters a sevenfoot black man wrapped in a purple cloak stood mesmerized by a sculpture of sheet metal and feathers tess took a long look at it herself it made her think of the hood of a truck that had passed through a migration of unfortunate geese a fascinating combination of mediums isnt it tess rubbed a finger over her bottom lip before she glanced up at her date oh absolutely powerfully symbolic frightening she agreed and lifted her cup to disguise a giggle shed heard of greenbriar of course but had never found the time or the energy to explore this trendy little gallery tonight she was grateful for the distraction this gathering provided you know dean im really delighted you thought of this im afraid ive been neglecting my interest in popular ah art your grandfather tells me youve been working too hard grandpa worries too much she turned away to study a twofoot phallic tube that strained toward the ceiling but an evening here certainly takes your mind off everything else such emotion such insight a man in yellow silk bubbled to a woman in sable as you can see the use of the broken light bulb symbolizes the destruction of ideas in a society that is driven toward a desert of uniformity tess shifted away as the man gestured dramatically with his cigarette then glanced at the sculpture he raved about it had a ge seventyfivewatt bulb with a jagged hole just off center the bulb was screwed into a plain wooden base of white pine that was it except for the fact that the little blue sticker indicated it had been sold the price had been twelve hundred seventyfive dollars amazing tess murmured and was rewarded by a generous beam from mr yellow silk it is quite innovative isnt it dean smiled down at the bulb as if hed created it himself and daringly pessimistic words escape me i know just what you mean the first time i saw it i was struck dumb deciding against making the obvious comment tess merely smiled and moved on she could do a paper she thought on the psychological implications mass hysteria that prompted people to actually pay for esoteric junk she stopped by a glass square that had been filled with various size and colored buttons square round enameled and cloth covered they huddled and bumped together in the sealed box the artist had called it population tess figured a girl scout could have put it together in about three and a half hours the price tag read a whopping seventeen hundred fifty with a shake of her head she started to turn back to her date when she saw ben he was standing by another display his hands in his back pockets and a look of unconcealed amusement on his face his jacket was open under it he wore a plain gray sweatshirt and jeans a woman in fivethousanddollars worth of diamonds swept up beside him to study the same piece of sculpture tess saw him mumble something under his breath just before he glanced up and saw her they stared as people passed between them the woman in diamonds blocked the way for a moment but when she walked on neither of them had moved tess felt something loosen inside her then grow tight and uncomfortable again before she made herself smile at him and nod in a friendly casual greeting dont you agree what she jerked herself back to dean im sorry my mind was wandering a man who lectured hundreds of college students a year was used to being ignored i said dont you think this particular sculpture shows the true conflict and eternal cycle of the manwoman relationship hmmm what she saw was a jangle of copper and tin that may or may not have been welded into metallic copulation im thinking of buying it for my office oh he was a sweet and absolutely harmless english professor whose uncle played an occasional game of poker with her grandfather tess felt an obligation to lead him away from the sculpture as a mother might lead a child whose allowance was hot in his hand away from a shelf of plastic overpriced model cars dont you think you should look around a bit consider some of the other what did one call them pieces first the stuffs selling like hotcakes i dont want to miss out he glanced around the sardinepacked room then began to edge toward the owner greenbriar was hard to miss in an electricblue suit with headband to match excuse me just a minute hello tess cautious calm she looked up at ben the fingers around the miniscule handle of her cup dampened tess told herself it was the body heat in the overcrowded room hello ben how are you terrific he was lousy had been lousy for exactly one week she stood in the midst of what he considered the pomp and the pompous and looked as cool and virginal as a vase of violets among a forest of orchids interesting gathering at least then her gaze slid over to the woman at his side dr court trixie lawrence trixie was an amazon in red leather in heeled boots she stood an inch over ben with a mane of improbable red hair that exploded around her head in spikes corkscrews and kinks the army of bracelets on her arm jingled as she shifted on her left breast was a tattoo of a rose that peeked out from the low v of her vest hello tess smiled and offered her hand hi so youre a doctor for all her size trixies voice was only a breathless squeak im a psychiatrist no shit no shit tess agreed as ben made a business of clearing his throat trixie took one of the quartersized quiches and swallowed it like an aspirin i had a cousin in the loony bin once ken launderman maybe you know him no i dont think so yeah i guess you see a lot of people with their batteries low more or less tess murmured and glanced over at ben no trace of embarrassment there she noted he was grinning like a fool her own lips twitched before she lifted her cup im surprised to see you here ben rocked back on the heels of worn tennis shoes just impulse i busted greenbriar about seven years ago little artistic business with checks when he sent me the invitation i thought id drop in and find out how he was doing he glanced over to see his host embrace the woman in diamonds seems to be doing just fine tess tasted her cooling cappuccino and wondered if ben kept on such friendly relations with everyone hed arrested so what do you think of the show ben looked over at the case of buttons such blatant mediocrity in a society that has singles night at the supermarket is bound to be rewarded with tremendous financial gain he watched the light bloom in her eyes wishing he could touch her just once just for a moment thats what makes america great you look terrific doc he yearned it was the first time he believed he understood the true meaning of the word thanks with the clearminded intensity she hadnt felt since childhood she wished she looked terrific ive never been to singles night at the supermarket trixie put in as she inhaled a plateful of quiches youll love it bens smile faded a bit when he looked over tesss shoulder and saw the man shed been standing with before friend of yours tess turned her head then waited until dean worked his way through the crowd her neck was long slender circled by pearls that made her skin seem only more delicate ben could smell her cool quietly sexual scent over everything else dean id like you to meet ben paris and trixie lawrence bens a detective with the local police ah one of the citys finest dean gave him a hearty handshake the guy looked like a cover of gentlemens quarterly and smelled like a brut commercial ben had an irrational urge to grip his hand indianwrestle style and go a round you one of tesss colleagues no actually im on the staff at american university college professor it figured ben stuck his hands in his pockets again and took a small telling step away from tess well trix and i just walked in we havent had a chance to absorb yet its almost too much to take in in one evening dean cast a proprietary eye at the mangle of copper beside him ive just bought this piece its a bit risque for my office but i couldnt resist yeah ben looked at it then stuck his tongue in his cheek you must be thrilled im going to stroll around and see if i can pick up something for my den nice meeting you he slipped an arm around trixies sturdy waist see you doc good night ben it was still shy of eleven when tess stepped into her apartment alone the headache shed used as an excuse to cut the evening short had only been half a lie normally she enjoyed her occasional dates with dean he was an undemanding uncomplicated man the kind of man she deliberately dated in order to keep her personal life equally undemanding and uncomplicated but tonight she just hadnt been able to face a late supper and discussion of nineteenth century literature not after the art gallery not after seeing ben she made herself admit and slipped out of her shoes two feet inside the door whatever progress shed made in soothing her ego and alleviating the tension since that last morning shed seen him had been blown quite simply to smithereens so shed start from scratch a hot cup of tea she took off her fur jacket and hung it in the hall closet shed spend the evening in bed with kurt vonnegut camomile and beethoven the combination would take anyones mind off their problems what problems she asked herself as she stood listening to the quiet of the apartment she came home to night after night she had no real problems because shed made certain she wouldnt a nice apartment in a good neighborhood a dependable car a light and consistently casual social life that was precisely how shed planned things shed taken step a and made certain it led to step b and so on until shed reached the plateau that satisfied her she was satisfied she took off her earrings and dropped them on the dining room table the sound of stone hitting wood echoed dully in the empty room the mums shed bought earlier in the week were beginning to go bronzed petals lay fading against the polished mahogany absently tess picked them up their scent sharp and spicy went with her to the bedroom she wouldnt look at the files on her desk tonight she told herself as she pulled down the zipper of her ivory wool dress if she had a problem it was that she didnt allow herself enough time tonight she would pamper herself forget about the patients who would come to her office on monday morning forget about the clinic where she would have to face the anger and resentment of drug withdrawal two afternoons next week shed forget about the murder of four women and shed forget about ben in the fulllength mirror inside the closet her reflection leaped out at her she saw a woman of average height slim build in an expensive and conservatively cut white wool dress a choker of three strands of pearls and fat amethyst lay against her throat her hair was caught back at the temples with pearltrimmed ivory combs the set had been her mothers and as quietly elegant as the senators daughter had been her mother had worn the choker as a bride tess had pictures in the leatherbound album she kept in her bottom dresser drawer when the senator had given the pearls to his granddaughter on her eighteenth birthday they had both wept every time tess wore them she felt both a pang and pride they were a symbol of who she was where she had come from and in some ways what was expected of her but tonight they seemed too tight around her throat she slipped them off and the pearls lay cool in her hand even without them the image changed little studying herself she wondered why she had chosen such a simple such a suitable outfit her closet was full of them she turned to the side and tried to imagine how she would look in something daring or outrageous like red leather she caught herself shaking her head she slipped out of the dress and reached for a padded hanger here she was a grown woman a practical even sensible woman a trained psychiatrist standing in front of a mirror and imagining herself in red leather pitiful what would frank fuller say if she went to him for analysis grateful she could still laugh at herself she reached for her warm floorlength chenille robe on impulse she bypassed it and took out a flowered silk kimono a gift rarely worn tonight she was going to pamper herself silk against her skin classical music and it would be wine not tea she took to bed with her tess put the choker on her dresser then pulled out the combs and lay them beside it she turned down the bed and fluffed the pillows in anticipation another impulse had her lighting the scented candles beside her bed she drew in a whiff of vanilla before she headed toward the kitchen the phone stopped her tess sent it an accusing glance but went to her desk and picked it up on the third ring hello you werent home ive waited such a long time and you werent home she recognized the voice hed called her before at her office on thursday the thought of a selfindulgent evening at home slipped away as she picked up a pencil you wanted to talk to me we didnt finish talking before did we its wrong for me to talk she heard him draw in a painful breath but i need its never wrong to talk she said soothingly i can try to help you you werent there that night you never came you never came home i waited i watched for you her head jerked up so that her gaze was frozen to the dark window beyond her desk watched she shivered but deliberately moved closer to look out at the empty street you watched for me i shouldnt go there shouldnt go his voice trailed off as if he were talking to himself or someone else but i need youre supposed to understand he blurted out quickly accusingly and ill try to would you like to come to my office and talk to me not there theyd know its not time for them to know i havent finished what havent you finished there was only silence as he dragged his breath in and dredged it out again i could help you more if youd meet with me i cant dont you see even talking to you is oh god he began to mumble tess couldnt understand she strained her ears perhaps latin she thought and put a question mark on the pad circling it youre in pain id like to help you deal with the pain laura was in pain terrible pain she was bleeding i couldnt help her she died in sin before absolution the hand on the pencil faltered tess found it necessary to ease herself into the chair when she found herself staring blindly at the window she forced herself to look down at her pad again and her notes training clicked into place and she schooled herself to breathe deeply and keep her voice calm who was laura beautiful beautiful laura i was too late to save her i hadnt the right then now ive been given the power and the duty the will of god is hard so hard he almost whispered here then his voice became strong but just the lambs are sacrificed and the clean blood washes sin away god demands sacrifices demands diem tess moistened her lips what kind of sacrifices a life he gave us life and he takes it your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother when suddenly a great wind came across the desert and smote the four corners of the house it fell upon the young people and they smote them and i alone have escaped to tell you i alone he repeated in the same terrible blank voice he had used to quote but after the sacrifices after the trials god rewards those who remain innocent as if she would be graded on them tess concentrated on making her notes clear and even her heart hammered away in her throat does god tell you to sacrifice the women save and absolve i have the power now i lost faith after laura turned my back on god it was a blind terrible time of selfishness and ignorance but then he showed me that if i were strong if i sacrificed we would all be saved my soul is tied to hers he said quietly were bound together you didnt come home that night his mind was swinging back and forth tess could hear it in the shifts of his voice as much as in the content of his words i waited i wanted to talk to you to explain but you spent the night in sin tell me about that night the night you waited for me i waited i watched for the light in your window it never came i walked i dont know how long where i thought it was you coming toward me or laura no i thought it was you but it wasnt then i i knew she must be the one i put her in the alley out of the wind so cold it was so cold put her out of sight he said in a terrible hiss put her out of sight before they could come and take me away they are ignorant and defy the ways of the lord his breath came in jagged gasps now pain sick my head such enormous pain i can help the pain tell me where you are and ill come can you a frightened child being offered a nightlight during a storm no his voice boomed out suddenly powerful do you think you can tempt me to question gods will i am his instrument lauras soul is waiting for the remaining sacrifices only two more then well all be free dr court it isnt death thats to be feared but damnation ill watch for you he promised almost humbly ill pray for you tess didnt move when the phone clicked in her ear but sat perfectly still outside the stars were clear and close and bright cars moved by on the street at a sedate pace streetlights pooled onto the sidewalk she saw no one but wondered as she sat near the window if she was seen there was sweat on her forehead cold and sticky she took a tissue from the corner of the desk and carefully dried it hed been warning her she wasnt sure if even he was fully aware of it but hed called to warn her as much as to ask for help she would be next her fingers trembled as they lifted to where the pearl choker had lain she couldnt swallow slowly and with infinite care she drew the chair back and eased out of it and out of the sight of the window shed put a hand to the curtain to draw it closed when the knock on her door made her slam back against the wall in an animal panic shed never before experienced terror swam into her as she looked around for a means of defense a place to hide a way to escape she fought it back as she reached for the phone she had only to dial it give her name and address but when the knock came again she looked at the door and saw shed forgotten to put on the chain she was across the room in seconds heaving her weight against the door and fumbling with the chain which suddenly seemed too big and unwieldly to fit into the slot half sobbing she threw it home tess the knock came again louder more demanding tess whats going on ben ben oh god her fingers were even clumsier as she pulled to release the chain her hand slipped on the knob once then she yanked open the door and threw herself against him what is it he felt her fingers dig into his coat as he tried to draw her back are you alone instinct had him reaching for his weapon closing a hand over it as he looked around for someone anyone who might have tried to hurt her what happened close the door please keeping one arm around her he closed it and dealt with the chain its closed youd better sit down youre shaking let me get you a drink no just hold me a minute i thought when you knocked i thought come on you need some brandy youre like ice trying to soothe to stroke he started to steer her toward the sofa he called me the fingers on her arm tightened as he turned her around to face him her cheeks were white her eyes enormous her right hand still gripped his coat he didnt have to ask who when just now he called me at the office before but i didnt realize it was him not then hes been outside i saw him one night on the corner just standing on the corner i thought i was being paranoid a good psychiatrist knows the symptoms she laughed then covered her face with her hands oh god i have to stop this sit down tess he relaxed his fingers on her arm and kept his voice calm the same tone hed use to interrogate a shaky witness you got some brandy around here what oh its in the buffet there the right door when she was sitting he went to the buffet what his mother would have called a server and found a bottle of rimy martin he poured a double into a snifter and brought it to her drink some of this before you start over okay she was already pulling herself back but drank to help things along the brandy shot into her system and dulled the remaining fear fear had no place in her life tess reminded herself only clear thought and careful analysis when she spoke again her voice was level without the bubble of hysteria she gave herself only a moment to be ashamed of it thursday night i had a late appointment at the office when it was over and i was packing up for the day i got a call he sounded very troubled and though i didnt think it was a current patient i tried to draw him out a bit i didnt get anywhere he just hung up brandy sloshed gently as she moved the bowl of the snifter around and around in her hands i waited a few minutes but when he didnt call back i filed it away and went home he called back tonight youre sure it was the same man yes im sure the same man who called before the same man youve been looking for since august she sipped the brandy again then set the snifter down hes falling apart rapidly what did he say to you tess tell me everything you remember i wrote it down you he stopped and made a quick movement with his head of course you did lets have a look she rose steady again and went to the desk tess brought the yellow pad over and handed it to ben here was something positive something constructive as long as she could think of it as a case she wouldnt fall apart again i may have skimmed on a few words when he was talking quickly but i got most of it its in shorthand yes oh ill read it to you she started at the beginning making sure her voice was detached words were there to give the psychiatrist a clue to the mind she remembered that and pushed back the horror of knowing theyd been directed at her after the biblical quote she stopped it sounds like the old testament i imagine monsignor logan could place it job what its out of job his gaze was on the far wall as he lit a cigarette twice hed read the bible through when josh had been sick looking for answers ben remembered to questions he hadnt even formed you know the guy who had everything going for him and then god tested him yeah he thought of josh again then shook his head josh had everything going for him before nam too happy job how about some boils i see though it was painfully obvious she didnt know the bible as well as he she saw the parallel yes it makes sense his life was well set he was content in all likelihood a good catholic never had his faith tested ben murmured yes then it was tested in some way and he failed the some way would have to do with this laura he glanced down at the pad again frustrated not to be able to read it himself lets have the rest as he listened to her read ben fought to think like a cop and not a man caught between infatuation and something deeper a killer had been watching her bens stomach tightened into a maze of tiny knots hed been waiting for her the night anne reasoner was killed the night tess had spent in his own bed the cop recognized the warning as quickly as the doctor had hes focused on you yes that seems to be the situation abruptly cold she tucked her legs up under her before she set the yellow tablet aside it was a case tess knew it was vital to think of it to analyze it as a case hes drawn to me because im a psychiatrist and part of him knows how desperately he needs help and hes drawn to me because i fit the physical description of laura it had been the voice she remembered that had been the most frightening the way it had swung from pitiful to powerful in quietly determined madness she folded her hands together tight ben what i want you to understand is that it was like talking to two people one of them was weepy desperate almost pleading the other the other was aloof fanatical and determined hes only one person when he strangles women he rose and walked toward the phone im calling in well want to put a tap on your phone here and at your office at the office ben i often talk to patients over the phone i cant jeopardize their right to confidentiality dont give me grief on this tess you have to understand no he whirled to face her you have to understand theres a maniac out there killing women and he decided to call you your phones get wired with your permission or with a court order but they get wired four other women didnt have the chance captain this is paris we got a break it took less than an hour two cops in suits and ties came in did what seemed to be a few minor adjustments to her phone and politely refused the offer of coffee one of them picked up the receiver punched a few numbers and tested the tap they took tesss spare key to her office and went out again thats it she asked when she and ben were alone again these are the days of the microchip ill take some of that coffee oh sure with a last glance at the phone she went into the kitchen it makes me feel exposed knowing that whenever the phone rings someone with a set of headphones is listening to everything i say its supposed to make you feel protected when she came back in with the coffee ben was standing by the window looking out she saw him deliberately close the curtain when he heard her behind him i cant be sure hell call back i was frightened im sure he sensed it and dammit i didnt handle it very well i guess you lose your standing as supershrink he took the coffee and her hand arent you having any no im already too wired up youre tired he rubbed his thumb over her knuckles she looked so fragile all at once so pale and beautiful look why dont you go in get some rest ill bunk out on the couch police protection just part of our campaign to improve community relations im glad youre here so am i he released her hand to run a fingertip down the closure of her silk kimono nice ive missed seeing you the movement of his finger stopped he looked at her again and remembered that earlier in the evening shed worn earrings and a stone at her throat that had matched her eyes and hed wanted to touch her so badly that it had hurt bone deep now as he had before ben backed off got an extra blanket she knew withdrawal when it smacked her in the face as he had she took a step back yes ill get it when shed gone he swore at himself and stood straining against his own contradictions he wanted her he didnt want to get involved with anyone like her she pulled at him he pushed back she was cool and lovely in the way of pinkandwhite delicacies behind bakery store windows hed already had a taste of her and knew certain delicacies could be habitforming even if he had room for her in his life which he didnt she would never fit but he remembered again how shed leaned against his windowsill laughing she carried a blanket and pillow back in and began to make up the sofa you dont act like you want an apology for what for last week though shed been determined not to mention it herself tess had wondered if hed bring it up why would i want an apology he watched her tuck the ends of the blanket neatly under the cushion we had a pretty fair argument going most of the women i most women i know want to hear the old im sorry i was a jerk were you was i what a jerk he had to admit shed maneuvered him very nicely no then it would be foolish for you to say you were just to hold up tradition there that should do she added as she gave the pillow a final fluff all right dammit i feel like an idiot about the way i acted the last time you were an idiot tess turned from the sofa to smile at him but its all right i meant a lot that i said i know you did so did i opposite sides ben thought opposite ends so where does that leave us if shed known she wasnt sure she could have told him instead she kept her voice friendly why dont we just leave it that im glad youre here with all this her gaze drifted to the phone dont dwell on that now let me take it from here youre right she linked her hands together then pulled them apart if you think about something like this too much you go crazy he suggested to use a loose inaccurate term she moved away then tidying the desk to keep her hands busy i was surprised to see you tonight at the gallery i know its a small town but it struck her then the confusion and panic had obscured it before what are you doing here tonight i thought you had a date i did i told her i had an emergency i wasnt far off what about yours my what your date oh dean i ah told him i had a headache i almost did but you didnt tell me why you came by he shrugged that off and picked up her paperweight a crystal pyramid that ran with colors as he turned it looked like a real upstanding citizen college professor huh yes something began to settle inside of her it took tess a moment to recognize it as pleasure your trixie her name was trixie wasnt it thats right she looked charming loved her tattoo which one tess only lifted a brow did you enjoy the show im fond of pretentious bullshit apparently sos your professor great suit and that natty little tie bar with the little gold chain was so distinguished he set the paperweight down hard enough to make her pencils jump i wanted to push his nose into his forehead she beamed at him thanks dont mention it after a gulp of coffee he set the cup on the desk it would leave a ring but she said nothing i havent been able to think of anything but you for days got a name for that she met his angry look with a smile i like obsession such a nice ring she walked closer there was no need for nerves any longer or for pretenses when his hands came up and took her shoulders she continued to smile i guess you think this is pretty damn funny i guess i do and i guess i could take a calculated risk and tell you ive missed you ive missed you a great deal would you like to tell me why youre angry no he pulled her against him felt her lips curve then soften then yield against his the silk of her kimono rustled as his arms went around her if he could have walked away then he would have without a backward glance but hed known when he found himself at her door that it was already too late i dont want to sleep on that frigging couch and im not leaving you alone she made the effort to open her eyes but for the first time in memory she would have been willing to be swept away ill share the bed with you on one condition which is that you make love with me he drew her against him so that he could smell her hair feel the way it brushed over his skin you drive a hard bargain doc chapter the scent of coffee woke her tess turned from her side to her back and lay dozing with the homey comforting smell how many years had it been since shed woken to the scent of coffee already brewing when shed lived in her grandfathers house with its high ceilings and tiled foyer she would come down the arching staircase in the mornings to find her grandfather already behind a huge plate of eggs or hotcakes the newpaper open and the coffee already poured miss bette the housekeeper would have set the table with the everyday dishes the ones with the little violets around the edges flowers would have depended on the season but they would always be there jonquils or roses or mums in the blue porcelain vase that had been her greatgrandmothers there would have been the quiet whoosh of troopers tail her grandfathers old golden retriever as he sat beneath the table hoping for a windfall those had been the mornings of her youth steady secure and familiar of her young womanhood just as her grandfather had been the strong central figure in her life then she had grown up moved into her own apartment into her own practice she brewed her own coffee with a sigh she turned lazily hoping for another dream then she remembered and sat up straight in bed it was empty but for her pushing her hair out of her eyes she touched the sheet beside her hed stayed with her and kept the bargain they had rolled and tossed and loved each other into the night until exhausted sleep had been the only alternative no questions no words and the only answer had been what they had both needed each other and oblivion hed needed that too shed understood that hed needed a few hours without tension without puzzles without responsibilities now it was morning and each had a job to face tess rose then slipped into the kimono that had been discarded onto the floor she wanted a shower a long hot one but she wanted the coffee more she found ben in the little el of her dining room with a map of the city a tangle of notes and her own yellow tablet spread over the table good morning hi he said it absently then glanced up and focused though he smiled she saw that his eyes were shadowed and intense as they studied her face hi he repeated i was hoping youd sleep longer its after seven its sunday he reminded her then rose as if to separate her from what he was doing at the table hungry are you cooking are you squeamish not particularly then you can probably stomach one of my omelettes game yeah im game she went with him into the kitchen and poured a cup of coffee from the look of the pot hed already had several have you been up long little while how often do you shop for food she glanced behind him into the now open refrigerator when my backs to the wall consider it there he pulled out a carton of eggs that was less than half full and a miserly chunk of cheddar we can still manage the omelettes just ive got an omelette pan second shelf in the cabinet to your right he sent her a mild pitying glance all you needs a hot skillet and a light hand i stand corrected she sipped coffee while he cooked impressive she thought and certainly better than she could do with gourmet utensils and a detailed recipe in front of her interested she leaned over his shoulder and earned a silent stare tess split an english muffin popped it in the toaster and left the rest up to him its good she decided when they sat at the table and shed swallowed the first bite im pretty pathetic in the kitchen which is why i dont keep a lot of food around that obliges me to deal with it he shoveled into his own with the easy enthusiasm of a man who considered food one of lifes top physical pleasures living alones supposed to make you selfsufficient but it doesnt perform miracles he cooked kept a tidy apartment was obviously proficient at his job and apparently had little trouble with women tess topped off her coffee and wondered why she was more tense now than when shed gone to bed with him because she wasnt as handy with men as he was with women and because she thought she wasnt in the habit of sharing a casual breakfast after a frantic night of sex her first affair had been in college a disaster now she was nearly thirty and had kept her relationships with men carefully in the safe zone the occasional side trip had been pleasant but unimportant until now apparently youre selfsufficient you like to eat you learn how to cook he moved his shoulders i like to eat youve never married what no he swallowed hard then reached for his half of the muffin it tends to get in the way of philandering among other things he grinned at her you butter a great muffin yes thats true id say another reason youve never lets say settled is that your work comes first she glanced at the papers hed pushed to the end of the table police work would be demanding timeconsuming and dangerous the first two anyway homicides sort of the executive end desk work puzzle work executive she murmured remembering very clearly the ease with which he had once strapped on his gun most of the guys wear suits hed nearly polished off his omelette and was already wondering if he could talk tess out of some of hers generally you come in after the deeds been done and then put pieces together you talk to people make phone calls push paper is that how you got that scar tess scooted the rest of her omelette around her plate pushing paper i told you before thats old news her mind was too analytical to let it go at that but you have been shot and probably shot at more than once sometimes you go into the field and people arent too happy to see you all in a days work when he realized she wasnt going to let it drop he set down his fork tess it isnt like the flicks no but it isnt like selling shoes either okay im not saying you never run into a situation where things might get hot but basically this kind of police work is on paper reports interviews head work there are weeks months even years of incredible drudge work even boredom as opposed to moments of actual physical jeopardy a rookie in a uniform is likely to deal with more heat in a year than i am i see then you arent likely to encounter a situation in the normal scheme of things where you use your gun he didnt answer for a moment not liking where the conversation was going what are you getting at im trying to understand you weve spent two nights together i like to know who im sleeping with hed been avoiding that sex was easier if it wore blinders benjamin james matthew paris thirtyfive in august single six feet onehalf inch a hundred seventytwo pounds she rested her elbows on the table setting her chin on her linked hands as she studied him you dont like to talk about your work whats there to talk about its a job no not with you a job is where you clock in every morning monday through friday you dont carry your gun like a briefcase most briefcases arent loaded you have had to use it ben drained his coffee his system was already primed i doubt many cops get around to collecting their pensions without drawing their weapons at least once yes i understand that on the other hand as a doctor id deal more with the results afterward the grief of the family the shock and trauma of the victim ive never shot a victim there was an edge to his voice that interested her perhaps he liked to pretend to her even to himself that the violent aspects of his job were occasional an expected side effect hed consider anyone he shot in the line of duty as hed put it the bad guy and yet she was sure there was a part of him that thought of the human the flesh and blood that part of him would lose sleep over it when you shoot someone in selfdefense she said slowly is it like in a war where you see the enemy as a symbol more than a man you dont think about it i dont see how thats possible take my word for it but when youre in a situation that calls for that kind of extreme defensive action you aim to wound no on the flat answer he rose and picked up his plate listen you draw your weapon youre not the lone ranger theres no grazing your silver bullet over the bad guys gun hand your life your partners life some civilians life is on the line its black and white he took the plates away she didnt ask if hed killed hed already told her she glanced at the papers hed been working on black and white he wouldnt see the shades of gray she saw there the man they sought was a killer the state of his mind his emotions perhaps even his soul didnt matter to ben maybe they couldnt these papers she began when he came back is there something i can help with just drudge work im an expert drudge maybe we can talk about it later right now ive got to get moving if im going to make nine oclock mass mass he grinned at her expression i havent gone back to the fold we think our man might show up at one of two churches this morning weve been covering the masses at both of them since sixthirty i got a break and drew the nine ten and eleventhirty services ill go with you no dont she said even as he opened his mouth i really could help i know the signs the symptoms there was no point in telling her hed wanted her to come let her think shed talked him into it dont blame me if your knees give out she touched a hand to his cheek but didnt kiss him give me ten minutes the church smelled of candle wax and perfume the pews worn smooth by the sliding and shifting of hundreds of clothcovered haunches were less than half full for the nine oclock service it was quiet with the occasional cough or sniffle echoing hollowly a pleasant religious light came through the stainedglass windows on the east wall the altar stood at the head of the church draped with its cloth and flanked by candles white for purity above it hung the son of god dying on the cross ben sat with tess in the back pew and scanned the congregation a few older women were scattered among the families toward the front a young couple sat in the pew across from them choosing the rear ben thought because of the sleeping infant the woman carried an elderly man who had come in with the help of a cane sat alone two private feet away from a family of six two young girls in their sunday best sat and whispered together and a boy of about three knelt backward on the pew and ran a plastic car quietly over the wood ben knew he was making the sounds of the engine and screeching tires in his head there were three men sitting alone who fit the general description one was already kneeling his thin dark coat still buttoned though the church was warm another sat passing idly through the hymnal the third was in the front of the church and sat unmoving ben knew roderick had the front and the rookie pilomento was situated in the middle a movement beside tess had ben stiffening logan slid in beside her patted her hand and smiled at ben thought id join you his voice was a bit wheezy he coughed quietly into his hand to clear it nice to see you monsignor tess murmured thank you my dear ive been a little under the weather lately and wasnt sure id make it i was hoping youd be along youd have a sharp eye his gaze traveled around the halfempty church mostly the old and young he thought those in the middle of their lives rarely thought god needed an hour of their time after digging a sucret out of his pocket he looked at ben again i hope you dont mind my volunteering if you happen to get lucky i might be of help after all i have what we might call house advantage for the first time since ben had met him logan wore the white clerical collar seeing it ben only nodded the priest entered the congregation rose the service began entrance rite the celebrant in green vestments stole alb the amice worn harmlessly under the flowing robes the gangly altar boy in black and white ready to serve lord have mercy a baby five pews up began to cry lustily the congregation murmured the responses in unison christ have mercy the old man with the cane was working his way through the rosary the young girls giggled and tried desperately to stop the little boy with the plastic car was shushed by his mother a man with a white silk amice next to his skin felt the drumming in his head ease with the familiar flow of celebrant and congregation his palms were sweaty but he kept them clasped in front of him the lord be with you and with your spirit it was the latin he heard the latin of his childhood of his priesthood it soothed and the world stayed steady the liturgy the congregation sat with shuffles murmurs and creaks ben watched not really hearing the priests words hed heard them all so many times before one of his earliest memories was of sitting on a hard pew his hands between his knees the starched collar of his best shirt rubbing against his neck hed been five or perhaps six josh had been an altar boy the man in the thin black coat was slumped back in his seat as if exhausted someone cheerfully blew his nose for the wages of sin is death the priest intoned but gods gift is eternal life in christ jesus our lord the amice was cool against his skin against his heart as he murmured the response thanks be to god they rose for the gospel matthew be on your guard against false prophets isnt that what the voice had told him his head began to ring with the power of it as he sat very still excitement fresh and clean sang through his tired body yes be on your guard they wouldnt understand they wouldnt let you finish she pretended to understand dr court but she only wanted to have him put in a place where he couldnt finish he knew the kind of place white walls all those whitewalls and white nurses with their bored and wary looks a place like his mother had been those last terrible years take care of laura she breeds sin in her heart and listens to the devil his mothers skin had been pasty her cheeks flaccid but her eyes had been so dark and bright bright with madness and knowledge youre twins if her souls damned so is yours take care of laura but laura had already been dead he heard the last of the gospel it spoke to him lord lord who will enter into the kingdom of heaven but he who does my heavenly fathers will he bowed his head accepting praise to you o christ they sat for the sermon ben felt tesss hand slip over his he linked fingers aware that she knew he was uncomfortable hed resigned himself to sitting through mass again but it was a different story when a priest sat a foot away it reminded him clearly of the few times hed gone to church as a boy and discovered to his embarrassment sister mary angelina sitting in the pew ahead of his family nuns werent as tolerant as mothers when little boys played with their fingers and hummed to themselves during mass you were daydreaming during mass again benjamin he remembered the trick sister mary angelina had had of slipping her white hands into the black sleeves of her habit so that she looked like one of those eggshaped bottomheavy toys you couldnt knock down you should try to be more like your brother joshua ben hmmm the man there tesss voice was light as a feather near his ear the one in the black coat yeah i saw him before hes crying the congregation stood for the creed the man in the black coat continued to sit weeping silently over his rosary before the prayer was finished he rose unsteadily then hurried out of the church stay here ben ordered and slipped out to follow when she made a move to go with him logan pressed her hand relax tess he knows his job he didnt come back through the offertory prayers or the washing of hands tess sat with her hands clasped in her lap and her spine trembling ben knew his job she agreed silently but he didnt know hers if theyd found the man she should be out with him hed need to talk she stayed where she was acknowledging fully for the first time that she was afraid ben returned his expression grim as he leaned over the back of the pew and touched logans shoulder could you come out here a minute logan went without question tess found herself taking a deep breath before she followed them into the vestibule the guys sitting out there on the steps his wife died last week leukemia id say its been a pretty rough time im going to check him out anyway but yes i understand logan glanced toward the closed doors of the church ill take care of him let me know if anything changes he smiled at tess and patted her hand it was lovely seeing you again goodbye monsignor they watched him walk outside into the crisp bite of the november morning in silence they went back into the church on the altar was the consecration fascinated tess sat to watch the ritual of the bread and wine for this is my body heads bowed accepting the symbol and the gift she found it beautiful the priest his vestments making him large and wide at the altar held the round white wafer up then the gleaming silver chalice was consecrated and lifted as offering as sacrifice tess thought he had spoken at length of sacrifice the ceremony she found beautiful even a little pompous would only mean sacrifice to him his god was the old testament god righteous harsh and thirsty for the blood of submission the god of the flood of sodom and gomorrah he wouldnt see the lovely ceremony as a bond between the congregation and a god of mercy and kindness but as a sacrifice to the demanding she reached for bens hand i think hed feel full here what she shook her head not sure how to explain from the altar came the solemn words as you were pleased to accept the offering of holy abel and the sacrifice of our father abraham and that of your high priest melchisedec a holy sacrifice a spotless victim a spotless victim tess repeated white for purity she looked at ben with a dull horror not saving not saving so much as sacrificing and when hes here he twists all this so that it reinforces what hes doing he wouldnt fall apart here not here he feeds off this in the most unhealthy way she watched the priest consume the wafer then after the sign of the cross drink the wine symbols she thought but how far had one man taken them beyond symbols to flesh and blood the priest held up the host and spoke in a clear voice behold the lamb of god behold him who takes away the sins of the world lord i am not worthy that you should come under my roof speak but the word and my soul will be healed members of the congregation began to shift out of pews and shuffle down the aisle to receive communion do you think hed take communion ben murmured watching the slowmoving line i dont know she suddenly felt cold cold and unsure i think hed need to its renewing isnt it the body of christ yeah thats the idea the man whod been paging through the hymnal rose to go to the altar the other man ben had watched kept his seat with his head bent either in prayer or a light doze there was another who felt the need and the longing rise up urgently inside him his hands nearly trembled with it he wanted the offering the flesh of his lord to fill him and wash away all stain of sin he sat as the church filled with voices youre born in sin his mother had told him youre born sinful and unworthy its a punishment a righteous one all of your life youll fall into sin if you die in sin your soul is damned restitution father moore had warned him you must make restitution for sin before it can be forgiven and absolved restitution god demands restitution yes yes he understood hed begun restitution hed brought four souls to the lord four lost seeking souls to pay for the one laura had lost the voice demanded two more for full payment i dont want to die laura in delirium had gripped his hands i dont want to go to hell do something oh please god do something he wanted to clasp his hands over his ears to fall on his knees at the altar and take the host into himself but he wasnt worthy until his mission was finished he wouldnt be worthy the lord be with you the priest said clearly et cum spiri tutuo he murmured tess let the freshening breeze outside play on her face and revive her after over three hours of services the frustration was back as she watched the stragglers from late mass stroll to their cars frustration and a vague nagging feeling that hed been close all along she linked her arm with bens what now im going into the station make a few calls heres roderick roderick came down the steps nodded to tess then sneezed three times into his handkerchief sorry you look terrible ben commented and lit a cigarette thanks pilomentos checking out a license plate said a guy across from him mumbled to himself through the last service he tucked the handkerchief away and shivered a bit in the wind i didnt know youd be here dr court i thought i might be able to help she looked at his reddened eyes sympathizing when he was wracked with a fit of coughing that sounds bad have you seen a doctor no time half the departments down with flu ben put in eds threatened to wear a face mask thinking of his partner he looked back at the church maybe they had better luck maybe roderick agreed wheezing you going in yeah ive got some calls to make do me a favor go home and take something for that your desks upwind from mine ive got a report screw the report ben said then shifted as he remembered he stood a couple of yards from the church keep your germs home for a couple of days lou yeah maybe give me a call if ed came up with anything sure take it easy and see a doctor tess added he managed a weak smile and headed off sounds to me like its heading into his lungs she murmured but when she turned back to ben she saw his mind was already on other things look i know youre anxious to make calls ill take a cab home what i said ill take a cab home why tired of me no to prove it she brushed her lips over his i know youve got work you want to do so come with me he wasnt ready to let her go yet or give up whatever private uncomplicated time might be left of the weekend after i tie things up we can go back to your place and he bent down and nipped her earlobe ben we cant make love all the time with his arm around her he walked to the car sure we can ill show you no really there are biological reasons trust me im a doctor he stopped by the car door what biological reasons im starving oh he opened the door for her then went around to the drivers side okay so well make a quick stop at the market on the way you can fix lunch i can i fixed breakfast oh so you did she settled back finding the idea of a cozy sunday afternoon appealing all right ill fix lunch i hope you like cheese sandwiches he leaned close so that his breath feathered over her lips then ill show you what people are supposed to do on sunday afternoons tess let her eyes flutter half closed and whats that drink beer and watch football he kissed her hard and started the car as she laughed he watched them huddled together in the car hed seen her in church his church it was a sign of course that she should come to pray in his church at first it had upset him a little then hed realized shed been guided there she would be the last one the last before himself he watched the car pull out caught a glimpse of her hair through the side window a bird landed in the branch of the denuded tree beside him and looked down with bright black eyes his mothers eyes he went home to rest chapter i think i found a place ed sat solidly at his desk hammering away two fingerstyle at his typewriter oh yeah ben sat at his own the map of the city in front of him again patiently he drew lines with a pencil to connect the murder scenes a place for what to live ummhmm someone opened the refrigerator and complained loudly that their a w had been stolen no one paid any attention the staff had been whittled down by the flu and a double homicide near georgetown university someone had taped a cardboard turkey onto one of the windows but it was the only outward sign of holiday cheer ben put a light circle around tesss apartment building before he glanced over at ed so when are you moving depends ed frowned at the keys hesitated then found his rhythm again have to see if the contract goes through you having someone killed so you can rent their apartment contract of sale shit this typewriters defective sale ben dropped his pencil and stared youre buying a place buying thats right ed patiently applied liquid paper to his last mistake blew on it then typed the correction he kept a can of lysol spray at his elbow if anyone who looked contagious walked by he sprayed the area you suggested it yeah but i was only buying to cover his tracks ben pushed some excess paper into his trash basket on top of the empty can of a w what kind of dump can you afford on a detectives pay some of us know how to save im using my capital capital ben rolled his eyes before folding the map he wasnt getting anywhere the man has capital he said to the station at large next thing you know youll be telling me you play the market ive made a few small conservative investments utilities mostly utilities the only utilities you know about is the gas bill but he studied ed with an uncertain eye where is this place got a few minutes ive got some personal time coming ed pulled his report out of the typewriter cast a wary glance over it then set it aside lets take a drive it didnt take long the neighborhood was on the outer and rougher edges of georgetown the row houses looked more tired than distinguished the fall flowers had simply given up for lack of interest and stood faded among tangles of unraked leaves someone had chained a bike to a post it had been stripped down of everything portable ed pulled up to the curb here it is cautious ben turned his head to his credit he didnt groan the house was three stories high and narrow with its front door hardly five paces from the sidewalk two of the windows had been boarded up and the shutters that hadnt fallen off tilted drunkenly the brick was old and softly faded except for where someone had spray painted an obscenity ben got out of the car leaned on the hood and tried not to believe what he was seeing something isnt it yeah something ed there arent any gutters i know half the windows are broken i thought i might replace a couple of them with stained glass i dont think the roofs been reshingled since the depression the real one im looking into skylights while youre at it you ought to try a crystal ball ben stuck his hands in the pockets of his jacket lets have a look inside i dont have a key yet jesus with a mutter ben walked up three broken concrete steps pulled out his wallet and found a credit card the pitiful lock gave without complaint i feel like i should carry you over the threshold get your own house the hall was full of cobwebs and droppings from assorted rodents the wallpaper had faded to gray a fat hardbacked beetle crawled lazily across it when does vincent price come down the steps ed glanced around and saw a castle in the rough it just needs a good cleaning and an exterminator are there rats in the basement i imagine ed said carelessly and walked into what had once been a charming parlor it was narrow and high ceilinged with the openings of what would be two fivefoot windows boarded up the stone of the fireplace was intact but someone had ripped out the mantel the floors under a coating of dust and grime might very well have been oak ed this place terrific potential the kitchen has a brick oven built into the wall you know what bread tastes like out of a brick oven you dont buy a house to bake bread ben walked back into the hall watching the floor for any signs of life christ theres a hole in the ceiling back here its fucking four feet wide thats first on my list ed commented as he came to join him they stood for a moment in silence looking up at the hole youre not talking about a list youre talking about a lifetime commitment as they watched a spider the size of a mans thumb dropped down and landed at their feet with a noticeable plop more than a little disgusted ben kicked it aside you cant be serious about this place sure i am a man gets to a point he wants to settle down you didnt take me seriously about getting married too a place of his own ed continued placidly a workroom maybe a little garden theres a good spot for herbs in the back a place like this would give me a goal i figure on fixing up one room at a time itll take you fifty years i got nothing better to do want to see upstairs ben took another look at the hole no i want to live how much he asked flatly seventyfive seventyfive seventyfive thousand dollars real estates at a premium in georgetown georgetown christ on a raft this isnt georgetown something bigger than the spider skuddled in the corner he reached for his weapon the first rat i see is going to eat this just a field mouse ed put a soothing hand on bens shoulder rats stick to the basement or the attic what do they have a lease but he left his weapon secured listen ed the realtors and developers push back the borders so they can call this georgetown and take idiots like you for seventyfivethousand dollars i only offered seventy oh thats different you only offered seventy he started to pace but ran into a magnificent cobweb swearing he fought himself free ed its those sunflower seeds you need red meat you feel responsible ed smiled terrifically pleased before he strolled into the kitchen no i dont ben jammed his hands into his pockets yes dammit i do thats the yard my yard ed pointed out when ben trailed after him i figure i can grow basil some rosemary maybe some lavender in that little spot right outside the window ben saw a patch of kneehigh grass nearly wide enough for two swipes of a lawn mower youve been working too hard this case is making us all loony ed listen carefully to these words see if they ring a bell dry rot termites vermin im going to be thirtysix so ive never owned a house hell everybodys going to be thirtysix once but not everybody has to own a house shit i never even lived in one we always had apartments the kitchen smelled of decades of grease but this time ben said nothing theres an attic the kind you see in shows where therere trunks and old furniture and funny hats i like that im going to do the kitchen first ben stared out at the pitiful clump of grass steam he said thats the best way to strip this old wallpaper steam yeah ben pulled out a cigarette and grinned youre going to need plenty of it i dated this woman who worked at a paint store marli yeah i think her name was marli shed probably still give me a discount date anyone who works at a lumberyard ill check come on i have to make a call they stopped at a phone booth a few miles away ben found a quarter and dialed tesss office number while ed went into the eleven dr courts office detective paris yes detective just a moment there was a click then silence then another click ben how are you doc im fine as she spoke she was clearing her desk just on my way out to the clinic what time do you finish there usually fivethirty maybe six he glanced at his watch and shifted the rest of his schedule fine ill pick you up but you dont need yes i do whos on you today i beg your pardon whos watching you at the office ben explained and tried to find a corner in the phone booth where the wind wouldnt reach oh sergeant billings good he cupped his hands around a match as he lit a cigarette and wished like hell hed remembered his gloves have billings drive you to the clinic there was silence in it he heard her temper and was tempted to smile at it i dont see any reason why i cant drive myself to the clinic as ive done every week for the last several years im not asking you to see a reason tess ive got plenty of them see you at six he hung up knowing shed hold the phone and her temper until she could replace it quietly she wouldnt want to do something as childish and typical as slamming it down he was right tess counted backward from five slowly then quietly replaced the receiver shed hardly set it down when kate buzzed her again yes it took effort not to bite the word off you have another call on line two he wont give his name all right i the nerves in her stomach tangled and she knew ill take it kate she stared at the slowly blinking button her finger was steady when she pushed it this is dr court i saw you in church you came yes the instructions shed been given raced through her head try to keep him on the line keep him calm and on the line i was hoping to see you there so we could talk again how are you feeling you were there now you understand what do i understand you understand the greatness his voice was calm a decision reached faith confirmed the sacrifices were asked to make are so small compared to the rewards of obedience im glad you were there so that you understand i had doubts what kind of doubts about the mission his voice dropped as if even whispering of doubt was a sin but not anymore tess took a chance where is laura laura she could hear the tears laura waits in purgatory suffering until i atone for her sins shes my responsibility she has no one but me and the blessed mother to intercede for her so laura was dead now she could be sure of it you must have loved her very much she was the best part of me we were joined before birth now i must make restitution for her before we can be joined after death you understand now you came your soul will join the others i will absolve you in the name of the lord you cant kill again laura wouldnt want you to kill again there was silence three four five seconds i thought you understood tess recognized the tone the accusation the betrayal she was going to lose him i think i do if i dont i need you to explain things to me i want to understand i want you to help me understand thats why i want to come talk to you no its lies youre full of sin and lies she heard him begin to mumble the lords prayer before the connection was broken when ben walked back into the squad room lowenstein was standing by her desk she signaled to him cradling the phone against her ear so her hands would be free she cant keep away from me ben told ed he started to slip an arm around her not aiming for her waist but for the bag of chocolatecovered raisins on her desk he called court again lowenstein told him his hand froze when call came through at the trace yeah she lifted a pad from her desk and handed it to him they pinned it to that area had to be within those four blocks goldman said she did real good christ we were just there he tossed the pad back on her desk we might have driven right past him the captains sent out bigsby mullendore and some uniforms to comb the area and look for witnesses well give them a hand ben ben wait he stopped turning back with impatience lowenstein pressed the mouthpiece of the phone against her shoulder theyre sending up a transcript of the call for the captain i think youll want to see it fine ill read it when i get back i think youll want to see it now ben a few hours work at the donnerly clinic was enough to take tesss mind off her own nerves the patients there ranged from manicdepressive businessmen to street junkies who were withdrawing once a week twice if her schedule permitted she came to the clinic to work with the staff doctors some of the patients she would only see once or twice others she would see week after week month after month she gave her time there when she could because it wasnt an elite hospital where the rich came when their problems or addictions became too much to cope with neither was it a streetside clinic run by idealists on a shoestring it was a struggling and capable institution which took in the emotionally and mentally ill from all walks of life there was a woman on the second floor with alzheimers disease who sewed dolls for her grandchildren then played with them herself when she forgot she had grandchildren there was a man who thought he was john kennedy and spent most of his day harmlessly writing speeches the more violent patients were kept on the third floor where security was tighter thick glass doors were locked and windows were barred tess spent most of the afternoon there by five she was nearly wrung dry for the better part of an hour shed been in session with a paranoid schizophrenic who had hurled obscenities then his lunch tray at her before hed ultimately been restrained by two orderlies tess had given him an injection of thorazine herself but not without regret hed be on medication for the rest of his life when he was quiet again tess left him to catch a few moments of quiet in the staff lounge she still had one more patient to see lydia woods a thirtysevenyearold woman who had run a household with three children held down a fulltime job as a stock broker and worked as president of the pta she had cooked gourmet meals attended every school function and had been named businesswoman of the year the new woman who could have and handle it all two months before she had fallen violently apart at a school play there had been convulsions and a seizure many of the horrified parents had taken for epilepsy when shed been taken to the hospital it was discovered shed been in a withdrawal as serious as one from heroin addiction lydia woods had held together her perfect world with valium and alcohol until her husband had threatened divorce to prove her strength shed gone cold turkey and had ignored her physical reactions in a desperate attempt to keep her life as she had structured it now though the physical illness was well under control she was being forced to deal with the causes and the results tess took the elevator down to the first floor where she requested lydias file after studying it tess tucked it under her arm her room was at the end of the hall lydia had left the door open but tess knocked before going in the curtains were drawn the room dim there were flowers beside the bed pink carnations their scent was light and sweet and hopeful lydia herself was on the bed curled up to face the blank wall she didnt acknowledge tesss presence hello lydia tess set the file on a small table and glanced around the room the clothes lydia had worn the day before were heaped in a corner its dark in here she said and moved to the curtain i like it dark tess glanced at the figure on the bed it was time to push i dont she said simply then drew the curtain open when light spilled in lydia rolled over and glared she hadnt bothered with her hair and makeup there was a drawn bitter look around her mouth its my room yes it is from what i hear youve been spending too much time alone in it and what the hell are you supposed to do around this place weave baskets with the fruits and nuts you might try going for a walk on the grounds tess sat but didnt touch the file i dont belong here i dont want to be here youre free to go any time tess watched her sit up and light a cigarette this isnt a prison lydia easy for you to say you signed yourself in when you feel youre ready you can sign yourself out lydia said nothing smoking in brooding silence i see your husband was in to see you yesterday lydia glanced at the flowers then away so how did you feel about seeing him oh i loved it she snapped i loved having him come in here to see me looking like this she grabbed a handful of her unwashed hair i told him he should bring the kids so they can see what a pitiful hag their mother is did you know he was coming i knew you have a shower in there shampoo makeup arent you the one who said i was hiding behind things using prescription drugs and alcohol as a crutch isnt the same as making the effort to look nice for your husband you wanted him to see you this way lydia why so hed go away feeling sorry for you guilty the arrow hit home and started the blaze as shed hoped just shut up its none of your business did your husband bring you those flowers theyre lovely lydia looked at them again they made her want to cry lose the edge of bitterness and failure that was her defense now picking up the vase she hurled it and the flowers against the wall from out in the hall where hed been told to wait ben heard the crash he was out of his chair and heading toward the open door when a nurse stopped him im sorry sir you really cant go in dr courts with a patient blocking his way she went to the door herself oh mrs rydel ben heard tesss voice cool and unruffled would you bring a dustpan and a mop so mrs woods can clean this up i wont lydia shouted at her its my room and i wont clean it up then id be careful where i walked so i didnt cut my feet on the glass i hate you when tess didnt even wince lydia shouted it more loudly i hate you did you hear me yes i hear you very well but i wonder if youre shouting at me lydia or yourself who the hell do you think you are her hand worked up and down like a jack hammer to crush out her cigarette you come in here week after week with your smug selfrighteous looks and your pretty upscale suits and wait for me to strip my soul well i wont do you think i want to talk to some ice maiden who has her life all worked out miss perfect society who treats basket cases as a hobby then goes to her justso home and forgets about them i dont forget about them lydia tesss voice was quiet a direct contrast but in the hall ben heard it you make me sick lydia heaved herself off the bed for the first time that day i cant stand the sight of you with your italian shoes and little gold pins and that i never sweat perfection im not perfect lydia none of us is none of us has to be to earn love and respect the tears started but tess didnt rise to offer comfort it wasnt time what do you know about mistakes what the hell do you know about how i lived dammit i made things work i did yes you did but nothing works forever if you refuse to allow for flaws i was as good as you i was better i had clothes like yours and a home i hate you for coming in here and reminding me get out just get out and leave me alone all right tess rose taking the file with her ill be back next week sooner if you ask for me she walked to the door and turned you still have a home lydia the nurse stood in the doorway holding the dustpan and mop tess took them and set them against the inside wall ill have them send down a fresh vase for those flowers tess walked out the door and shut her eyes a moment that kind of violent dislike even when it came from illness and not from the heart was never easy to take doc tess shook herself back and opened her eyes ben was there a few steps away youre early yeah he came to her and wrapped a hand around her arm what the hell are you doing in a place like this my job youll have to wait a minute i have to enter some things in this file she walked down to the nurses station checked her watch and began to write ben watched her right now she seemed totally unaffected by the nasty little scene hed overheard her face was calm as she wrote in what he was sure was a very professional hand but hed seen that one quick unguarded moment when shed stepped into the hall not unaffected but impossibly controlled he didnt like it just as he didnt like this place with its clean white walls and blank miserable faces she handed the file back to the nurse in an undertone said a few things he assumed referred to the woman whod just berated her then glanced at her watch again im sorry you had to wait tess said when she came back i have to get my coat why dont you meet me outside when she came out he was standing at the edge of the grass smoking steadily you never gave me a chance on the phone to tell you i didnt want you to bother with all this ive been getting myself to and from the clinic for a long time he dropped the cigarette and carefully crushed it why did you take all that crap from her tess drew a long breath before she linked her arm with his where are you parked thats psychiatrist shit answering questions with questions yes yes it is look if she didnt attack me i wouldnt be doing my job its the first time weve really gotten anywhere since ive started seeing her now where are you parked its cold over here more than happy to leave the clinic behind he began to walk with her he called you again yes right after you did she wanted badly to treat that with the same professional ease she had the patients in the clinic were they able to trace it narrowed it down to a couple blocks no one saw anything were still working on it his laura is dead i figured that much out he put his hand on the car door then released it again the same way i figured out youre his next target she didnt grow pale or shudder he hadnt expected her to she simply nodded accepting then put her hand on his arm would you do me a favor i can give it a shot lets not talk about it tonight at all tess please i have to go to the station with you tomorrow and meet with captain harris isnt that soon enough to hash all this over he put cold ungloved hands on her face im not going to let anything happen to you i dont care what i have to do she smiled lifting her hands to his wrist then i dont have anything to worry about do i i care about you he said carefully it was as close to a declaration as hed ever come with a woman i want you to know that then take me home ben she turned her lips into his palm and show me chapter the maintenance man was glumly mopping up a mudcolored puddle in the hallway outside the squad room under the heavy scent of pine cleaner hung trails of more human odors the machine that dispensed coffee black coffee light and when its mood was generous hot chocolate leaned like a wounded soldier against its companion which handled hershey bars and baby ruths a platoon of styrofoam cups littered the tile ben steered tess around the worst of it coffee machine blow up again the man with dusty gray overalls and dusty gray hair looked over the handle of his mop you guys gotta quit kicking these machines look at that dent he slopped more coffee and lysol as he gestured criminal yeah ben sent a look of dislike at the candy machine hed added a fresh dent there himself after hed lost another fifty cents the day before somebody ought to investigate watch your shoes doc he led her into the squad room where at eight oclock phones were already shrilling paris lowenstein chucked a paper cup toward her trash basket where it caught the rim and flipped in captains daughter had her baby last night last night he stopped by his desk to look for messages the one from his mother reminded him that it had been nearly a month since hed checked in at pm shit couldnt she have waited a couple of days i had the fifteenth in the pool there was still a chance he figured if shed cooperated and had a boy whatd she have girl seven pounds seven ounces jackson hit it on the nose figures she rose giving tess a quick professional sweep lowenstein judged the price of the snakeskin bag in the ballpark of a hundred fifty and felt a small harmless tug of envy good morning dr court good morning ah if youd like coffee or anything were getting it out of the conference room until things are cleared up well be meeting in there in a few minutes the perfume was french the real stuff lowenstein deduced as she took a quick discreet sniff thanks ill wait why dont you have a seat until the captains ready ben suggested glancing around for a clean chair ive got to return a couple of these calls there was a sudden spurt of obscenities from the hall then a metallic crash tess turned to see the dirty water from the bucket stream down the hall then all hell broke loose a stringy black man with his hands cuffed behind him got as far as the doorway when a man in an overcoat caught him in a headlock look at my floor almost dancing with fury the maintenance man jumped into view he swung his mop spraying everything im going to the union see if i dont the prisoner bucked and squirmed like a landed trout while the officer in charge tried to hang on get that wet mop out of my face panting and a bit redfaced he tried to avoid the next shower while the black man sent up a high keening wail shit mullendore cant you control your prisoners without hurry ben walked over to assist when the black man managed to sink his teeth into mullendores hand there was a low growl of a curse before the prisoner burst free and ran headlong into ben jesus give me a hand will you this guys an animal mullendore made a grab sandwiching the prisoner between them for a moment they looked as though they were ready to rhumba then all three men lost their footing on the damp floor and went down in a heap beside tess lowenstein watched with her hands comfortably on her hips shouldnt you break it up tess wondered aloud the guys cuffed and weighs maybe a hundred pounds theyll just be a minute you aint putting me in a cell the black man rolled and squirmed and screamed and managed to bring his knee solidly into bens groin in reflex ben jerked his elbow and caught him under the chin as his body went limp ben collapsed on it with mullendore panting beside them thanks paris mullendore held up his wounded hand to study the teeth marks christ im probably going to need a shot the guy went crazy when we walked into the building ben managed to rise to his hands and knees his breath whistled as he sucked it in and left a hole burning in his gut he tried to speak dragged in another whistling breath and tried again sonofabitch put my balls into my stomach im real sorry about that ben mullendore took out a handkerchief and wrapped it around the bite he looks real peaceful now though with a grunt ben pushed himself off to sit on the floor braced by the wall for christs sake get him into holding before he comes to he sat there as mullendore hefted the unconscious prisoner the cold coffeestained wash water had soaked through the knees and thighs of his jeans and splattered his shirt even when it soaked through the seat he continued to sit wondering why the knee that had connected with his pride had been so bony as he headed down the hall for a fresh batch of soapy water the maintenance man rattled his mop in his bucket im talking to the shop steward i had that floor almost finished tough break ben spared him a look as the pain between his legs sang its way up to his head dont worry about it paris lowenstein leaned on the doorway carefully avoiding the small river chances are youre still a stallion kiss my ass honey you know my husbands a jealous man tess crouched down beside him giving him a sympathetic tuttut her hand was gentle as she patted his cheek but her eyes were lit with laughter are you all right oh im terrific i like absorbing my coffee through my skin executive branch right yeah right want to get up no he resisted reaching a hand between his legs to make certain everything was in place the laugh wasnt quite muffled as she pressed a hand to her mouth the long narrowed look he gave her only made it worse her voice hitched and bubbled you cant sit here all day youre sitting in a puddle and you smell like the floor of a cafe that hasnt been washed over the weekend great bedside manner doc he took her arm as she fought a losing war against laughter one good tug and youre down here with me then youd have all those guilt ramifications to deal with not to mention the cleaning bills ed walked down the hall still bundled in his outdoor gear as he avoided the worst of the wet he dug the rest of his breakfast yogurt out of the carton licking the spoon he stopped in front of his partner morning dr court good morning she rose still swallowing laughter nice day yes a little cold though weatherman said it should hit fifty this afternoon oh you two are a riot ben told them a real riot tess cleared her throat ben ben had a little accident eds bushy brows lifted as he looked at the stream running down the hall just keep your sophomoric humor to yourself ben warned sophomoric ed rolled the word around on his tongue impressed he handed his empty carton to tess then hooking his hands under bens armpits hauled his partner effortlessly to his feet your pants are wet i was restraining a prisoner yeah well things like this happen in the midst of all that tension and excitement im going to my locker he muttered make sure the doctor hasnt hurt herself laughing he sloshed a little spreadlegged down the hall ed took the empty carton and plastic spoon from tess want some coffee no she managed strangling a bit on the word no i think ive had enough give me just a minute and ill take you in to captain harris they met in the conference room though the heater sent out a hopeful mechanical buzz the floors remained chilly harris had lost his annual campaign for carpet the blinds were closed in a fruitless attempt to insulate the windows someone had tacked up a poster urging america to conserve energy tess sat at a table with ed lounging beside her the light scent of jasmine steamed out of his tea lowenstein balanced on the edge of a small desk idly swinging one leg bigsby hunched in a chair an economysized box of kleenex on his lap every few minutes he blew his already red nose rodericks flu had him in bed harris stood beside a green chalkboard on which the names and other pertinent information on the victims had been aligned in neat columns a map of the city stretched over the wall pierced with four blue flags there was a corkboard beside that blackandwhite glossies of the murdered women were tacked to it we all have transcripts of the phone calls dr court received it sounded so cold so businesslike she thought transcripts they couldnt hear the pain or the sickness in transcripts captain harris tess shifted her own notes in front of her ive brought you an updated report with my own opinions and diagnosis but i feel it might be helpful if i explained these phone calls to you and your officers harris with his hands linked behind his back only nodded the mayor the media and the commissioner were snapping at his ankles he wanted it over long over so he could spend some time doting on his new granddaughter seeing her behind the nursery window had almost made him believe that life had its points the man who contacted me called because he was frightened of himself he is no longer controlling his life but is being controlled by his illness the last her gaze was drawn to the photograph of anne reasoner the last murder was not part of the plan she moistened her lips glancing over only briefly as ben walked in he was waiting for me me specifically we cant be certain how he focused in on the other victims in the case of barbara clayton we can be all but certain it was coincidence her car broke down he was there in my case its much more finetuned hes seen my name and picture in the paper she paused a moment expecting ben to slip into the chair beside her instead he stayed back leaning against the closed door separated from her by the table the rational part of his mind the part that keeps him functioning on a daily basis was drawn here was help someone who hasnt condemned him out of hand someone who claims to understand at least some of the pain someone who looks enough like his laura to trigger feelings of love and complete despair i think its accurate to say that he waited for me the night of anne reasoners murder because he wanted to talk to me to explain why before he before he did what hes being driven to do from your own investigations i think its also accurate to say that he didnt feel this need to explain with any of the others in your transcripts youll see that time and time again he asks me to understand im a hinge at this point his door is swinging both ways she put her palms together moving them back and forth to demonstrate hes asking for help then his illness takes over and he only wants to finish what hes started two more victims she said calmly or in his mind two more souls to be saved me then himself ed made small neat notes in the margin of his transcripts whats to stop him from going off taking someone else down because he cant get to you he needs me at this point hes contacted me three times hes seen me in church he deals in signs and symbols i was in church his church i resemble his laura ive told him i want to help the closer he feels to me the more necessary it would be for him to complete his mission with me you still think hell target for december eighth lowenstein had the transcript in her hands but she wasnt looking at it yes i dont think he could break pattern again anne reasoner took too much out of him the wrong woman the wrong night tesss stomach shuddered once before she drew herself straight and controlled it isnt it possible ed began that because hes homed in on you this way that he could go for you sooner its always possible mental illness has few absolutes well be continuing our twentyfour hour protection harris put in youll have the wire on your phone and the guards until hes caught in the meantime we want you to continue your office and personal routine hes been watching you so hell know what they are if you look accessible we might draw him out why dont you give her the bottom line from the door ben spoke quietly his hands were in his pockets his voice relaxed tess only had to look in his eyes to see what was going on inside you want her for bait harris stared back his voice didnt change in volume or tone when he spoke again dr court has been singled out what i want doesnt matter as much as what the killer wants thats why shes going to have people on her at home in her office and at the damn grocery store she should be in the safe house for the next two weeks thats been considered and rejected rejected ben pushed himself away from the door who rejected it i did tess folded her hands on her file then sat very still ben barely glanced at her before he poured his rage on harris since when do we use civilians as long as shes in the open shes in jeopardy shes being guarded yeah and we all know how easily something can go wrong one misstep and youll be tacking her picture up there ben lowenstein reached out for his arm but he shook her off weve got no business taking chances with her when we know hes going to go for her she goes in the safe house no tess gripped her hands together so tight the knuckles whitened i cant treat my patients unless i go to my office and the clinic you cant treat them if youre dead either he spun to her slamming both palms flat on the table so take a vacation buy yourself a ticket to martinique or cancun i want you out of this i cant ben even if i could walk away from my patients for a few weeks i cant walk away from the rest paris ben harris amended in a quieter tone dr court is aware of her options as long as shes here shell be protected its dr courts own opinion that hell seek her out since shes decided to cooperate with the department well be able to keep her under tight surveillance and cut him off when he makes his move we get her out and we plant a policewoman in her place no this time tess rose slowly im not going to have someone die in my place again not again and im not going to find you in some alley with a scarf around your neck he turned his back on her youre using her because the investigations stalled because weve got one jerky witness a religious outlet in boston and a ream of psychiatric guesswork im accepting dr courts cooperation because weve got four dead women it was the burning in his own stomach that kept harris from raising his voice and i need every one of my officers at top level pull yourself together ben or youll be the one out of it tess gathered up her papers and quietly slipped out ed was less than ten seconds behind her want some air he asked when he found her standing miserably in the hall yes thanks he took her elbow in a way that would normally have made her smile as he pushed open the door the blast of november wind buffeted them the sky was a hard cold blue without a cloud to soften it both of them remembered it had been august hot steamy august when it had begun ed waited while tess buttoned her coat i think we might get some snow by thanksgiving he said conversationally i suppose she dipped into her pocket and found her gloves but only stood running them through her hands i always feel sorry for the turkeys what the turkeys ed repeated you know thanksgiving i dont guess theyre very grateful to be a tradition no she found she could smile after all no i guess not hes never been tangled up with a woman before not like this not like you tess let out a long breath wishing she could find the answer shed always been able to find the answer it just gets more complicated ive known ben a long time ed pulled a peanut out of his pocket cracked it and offered the meat to tess when she shook her head he popped it into his mouth hes pretty easy to read if you know how to look right now hes scared hes scared of you and hes scared for you tess looked out over the parking lot one of the cops wasnt going to be happy when he came out and found his rightfront tire flat i dont know what to do i cant run away from this though part of me deep down is terrified of the phone calls or ben im beginning to think you should be in my business she murmured if youre a cop long enough you learn a little bit of everything im in love with him it came out slowly like a test once it was said she took a shaky breath that would be hard enough under normal circumstances but now i cant do what he wants he knows that thats why hes scared hes a good cop as long as hes looking out for you youre going to be okay im counting on it hes got a problem with what i do for a living she turned to face him you know about that you know why lets say i know enough to say hes got his reasons and when hes ready hell let you know about them she studied his wide windreddened face hes lucky to have you im always telling him bend down a minute when he did she brushed her lips over his cheek thanks his color rose a little higher dont mention it ben watched them through the glass door a moment before he pushed it open hed used up most of his temper on harris all that was left was a dull ache in the center of his gut he knew enough of fear to recognize it moving in on my time he asked mildly if youre stupid enough to make room ed smiled down at tess and handed her some peanuts take care of yourself tess jiggled the nuts in her hand and said nothing as ed disappeared inside his jacket unzipped ben stood beside her looking as she did out over the parking lot the wind sent a small brown bag racing across the asphalt ive got a neighbor wholl look after my cat for a while when tess remained silent he shifted i want to move in with you she stared hard at the flat tire more police protection thats right and more a whole lot more he wanted to be with her day and night he couldnt explain not yet that he wanted to live with her when hed never lived with another woman that kind of commitment had been dangerously close to a permanency he didnt consider himself ready for tess studied the peanuts in her hand before slipping them into her pocket as ed had said he was easy enough to read if you knew how to look ill give you a key but i wont cook breakfast how about dinner now and then sounds reasonable tess yes if i told you i wanted you to go because he hesitated then put his hands on her shoulders because i dont think i could handle it if anything happened to you would you go would you come with me i cant you know i have to he broke off struggling with frustration as she looked up at him all right i should know better than to argue with someone who plays pingpong with brain cells youll do what youre told though right down the line i have a vested interest in making this case easier for you ben until its over ill do what im told that has to do he backed off just enough for her to realize it was the cop now much more than the man who stood with her two uniforms are following you to your office weve arranged for the guard in the lobby to take a vacation and have already replaced him with one of ours well have three men taking turns in your waiting room whenever it can be arranged ill pick you up and take you home when it cant the uniforms will follow you were using an empty apartment on the third floor as a base but when you get in your door stays locked if you have to go out for any reason you call in and wait until its cleared it sounds thorough he thought about the four glossies on the corkboard yeah if anything i mean anything happens a guy cuts you off at a light somebody stops you on the street for directions i want to know about it ben its no ones fault that things have taken this turn not yours not harriss not mine we just have to see it through thats what i intend to do therere the uniforms youd better get going all right she went down the first step then stopped and turned back i guess it would be improper conduct for you to kiss me here while youre on duty yeah he bent down and in the way that never failed to make her limbs weak cupped her face in his hands eyes open and on hers he lowered his mouth her lips were chilled but soft generous her free hand gripped the front of his coat for balance or to keep him there an extra moment he watched in fascination as her lashes fluttered then lowered slowly to shadow her cheeks can you remember just where you were for about eight hours tess murmured ill make a point of it he drew away but kept her hand in his drive carefully we wouldnt want the uniforms to be tempted to give you a ticket id just have it fixed she smiled see you tonight he let her go i like my steak mediumwell i like mine rare he watched her get into her car then pull competently out of the lot the uniforms stayed a car length behind tess knew she was dreaming just as she knew there were solid and logical reasons for the dream but it didnt stop her from knowing fear she was running the muscles in her right calf were knotted with the effort in sleep she whimpered quietly in pain corridors sprang up everywhere confusing her as much as she was able she kept to a straight route knowing there was a doorway somewhere she had only to find it in the maze her breathing bounced back heavily the walls were mirrored now and threw dozens of her reflections at her she was carrying a briefcase she looked down at it stupidly but didnt set it aside when it became too heavy for one hand she dragged it with both and continued to run as she lost her balance she thrust out a hand and connected with a mirror panting she looked up anne reasoner stared back at her then the mirror melted away into another corridor so she ran on taking the straight path the weight of the briefcase hurt her arms but she pulled it with her muscles strained and burned then she saw the door almost sobbing with relief she dragged herself to it locked she looked desperately for the key there was always a key but the knob turned slowly from the other side ben weak with relief she reached out a hand for him to help her over that final step to safety but the figure was black and white the black cassock the white collar the white silk of the amice she saw it come up knotted like pearls and reach for her throat then she started to scream tess tess come on baby wake up she was gasping reaching up for her throat as she dragged herself out of the dream relax his voice came calm and soothing out of the dark just breathe deep and relax im right here she clung hard with her face pressed into bens shoulder as his hands moved up and down her back she fought to focus on them and let the dream fade im sorry she managed when she caught her breath it was just a dream im sorry must have been a beaut gently he brushed the hair from her face her skin was clammy ben pulled the covers up and wrapped them around her want to tell me about it just overwork she drew her knees up to rest her elbows on them want some water yes thanks she rubbed her hands over her face as she listened to the tap run in the bathroom he left the light on so that it slanted through the door here you go you have nightmares often no she sipped to ease her dry throat i had some after my parents died my grandfather would come in and sit with me and fall asleep in the chair well ill sit with you after he got into bed again he put an arm around her better a lot i guess i feel stupid wouldnt you say psychiatrically speaking that under certain circumstances its healthy to be scared i suppose i would she let her head rest on his shoulder thanks what else is bothering you she took a last sip of water before setting the glass aside i was making an effort not to let it show didnt work what is it tess sighed and stared at the slant of tight on the bedroom floor i have a patient or i had one anyway this young boy fourteen alcoholic severe depression suicidal tendencies i wanted his parents to put him into a clinic in virginia they wont go for it not only that but he missed his session today i called got the mother she tells me that she feels joeys progressing just fine she didnt want to discuss the clinic and shes going to let him take a breather from his sessions theres nothing i can do nothing it was that most of all that had slapped her down she wont face the fact mat he isnt progressing she loves him but shes put blinders on so she doesnt have to see anything that isnt in straight focus ive been slapping a bandaid on him every week but the wounds not healing you cant make her bring the boy in maybe a breather will help let the wound get some air i wish i could believe that it was the tone of her voice that made him shift and bring her closer when hed woken to her screams his blood had run cold now it was pumping warm again look doc both of us are in the business where we can lose people its the kind of thing that wakes you up at three in the morning has you staring at walls or out windows sometimes youve just got to turn it off just turn the switch i know rule number one is professional detachment his hair brushed her cheek as she turned her face to his what turns the switch best for you in the shadowed light she saw him grin you really want to know yes she ran a hand down his side until it rested comfortably at his hip right now i especially want to know this usually works in one easy move he rolled her on top of him he felt the give of firm breasts pressing against him smelled the fragrance of her hair as it curtained his face he took a handful and brought her mouth down to his how well she seemed to fit the thought ran through his head the brush of her fingertips on his skin was like a blessing there was something about her hesitancy that had his own excitement drumming if he ran his own fingers along her inner thigh she shivered just enough to let him know she wanted him but was still unsure he didnt know why or how it should seem so fresh with her each time he found himself holding her in the dark in the quiet it was like the first time she was bringing something to him he hadnt known hed missed and was no longer certain he could do without her mouth moved lightly over his face he wanted to roll her over on her back pump himself into her until they both exploded with most women it had always been that last split second of insanity that had washed everything else away with tess it was a touch a murmur a quiet brush of lips so he pushed back that first rage of desire and let them both drift he could be so gentle she thought hazily at times when they made love it was all speed all urgency and then when she least expected it he would be tender almost lazy until her heart was ready to break from the sweetness of it now he let her touch the body she had come to know as well as her own there were sighs sighs of contentment there were murmurs murmurs of promises he buried his hands in her hair as she tasted almost shyly at first then with growing confidence there were muscles to be discovered she found them taut and delighted in the knowledge that she caused the tension there were bones in his hips long and narrow when her tongue glided over diem he arched like a bow the trail of her finger along the crease of his thigh had his long body shuddering she sighed as her lips followed the path there was no more thought of nightmares hed had women touch him maybe too many women but none of them had made his blood hammer like this he wanted to lie there for hours and absorb each separate sensation he wanted to make her sweat and shake as he was he sat up grabbing her hands at the wrist for a moment a long moment they stared at each other in the narrow beam of light his breath came in pants his eyes were dark glazed with passion the scent of desire hung heavy in the room he lowered her slowly until she lay on her back with his hands still gripping her wrists he used his mouth to drive her to the edge narrow delicate her hands strained against his hold her body twisted arched not in protest but in a delirium of pleasure his tongue slid over her into her until she thought her lungs would balloon and explode from the pressure he felt her go rigid and call out as she came her scent spilled into the room she was limp boneless when he filled her im going to watch you go up again he braced himself over her and though each muscle trembled with the effort went slowly exquisitely slowly she moaned then opened her eyes as the sensations and pleasure began to build again her lips trembled open as she started to say his name then her fingers dug into the rumpled sheets ben buried his face in her hair and cut himself loose chapter i appreciate your making time to see me monsignor tess took a seat in the front of logans desk and had a quick not entirely comfortable flash of how her patients must feel during their initial consultation its my pleasure he was settled comfortably his tweed jacket draped over the back of his chair his shirtsleeves rolled up to reveal sturdy forearms sprinkled with hair just beginning to gray she thought again that he seemed to be a man more accustomed to the rugby field or racquetball court than vespers and incense would you like some tea no nothing thank you monsignor since were colleagues why dont you call me tim yes she smiled ordering herself to relax starting with her toes that would make things easier my call to you today was on impulse but when a priest is troubled he seeks out another priest when an analyst is troubled as he trailed off tess found her conscious effort to relax was working exactly the fingers on her purse loosened their grip i guess that means you get hit from both ends it also means i have two roads to choose from when i have problems of my own thats a matter which has its pros and cons but you didnt come to discuss christ versus freud why dont you tell me whats troubling you at this point a number of things i dont feel like ive found the key to the mind of of the man the police are looking for and you think you should have i think being as involved as i am now i should have more she lifted one hand in a gesture that spoke of frustration and uncertainty ive talked to him three times it bothers me that i cant get through my own fear maybe my own selfinterest to push the right buttons do you think you know those buttons its my job to know them tess we both know the psychotic mind is a maze and the routes leading to the core can shift and shift again even if we had him under intensive therapy in ideal conditions it might take years to find the answers oh i know logically medically i know that but emotionally is a different story emotionally she dealt with other peoples emotions on a daily basis it was different and much more difficult she discovered to open her own to someone else i know its unprofessional and that worries me but im past the point where i can be objective monsignor logan tim that last woman who was killed was meant to be me i saw her in that alley i cant forget his eyes were kind but she saw no pity in them transferring guilt wont change what happened i know that too she rose and went to the window below a group of students rushed across the grass to make their next class may i ask you a question naturally im in the answer business does it bother you that this man may be or may have been a priest on a personal level you mean because im a priest to consider it he sat back with his hands steepled as a young man hed boxed both in and out of the ring his knuckles were fat and spread i cant deny a certain discomfort certainly the idea of the man being a priest rather than say a computer programmer makes the entire business more sensational but the simple truth is that priests are not saints but as human as a plumber a right fielder or a psychiatrist when hes found will you want to treat him if i were asked logan said slowly if i believed i could be of use then perhaps i wouldnt feel obliged or responsible as i believe you do you know the more afraid i am the more essential it becomes to me to help him she turned to the window again i had a dream last night a rather dreadful one i was lost in these corridors this maze and i was running even though i knew i was dreaming i was still terrified the walls became mirrors and i could see myself over and over again unconsciously she put a hand to the glass of the window as she had to the mirror in the dream i was carrying my briefcase dragging it really because it was so heavy i looked in one of the mirrors and it wasnt my reflection but anne reasoners then she was gone and i was running again there was a door i just had to get on the other side of that door when i got there it was locked i looked frantically for the key but i didnt have it then the door opened on its own i thought i was safe i thought then i saw the priests frock and the amice she turned back but couldnt bring herself to sit oh i could sit down and write a very detailed and comprehensive analysis of that dream my fear of being out of control in this situation overwork and my refusal to cut down on that workload guilt over anne reasoner my frustration at not finding the key to this case and my ultimate my very ultimate failure she hadnt mentioned fear for her life logan considered it a very interesting and telling omission either she had not yet brought herself to face it or she linked the possibility with her dread of failing youre so sure youre going to fail yes and i detest the idea the admission brought a selfdepreciating smile tess ran her fingers over the cover of the antique bible and found the carving deep and smooth theres something in here about pride going before a fall i tend to think that depends on the pride youve given the police everything a trained psychiatrist could tess you havent failed i never have you know not really not on a personal level i did well in school played hostess very properly for my grandfather until my practice cut back on my free time as far as men were concerned after one minor disaster in college i always made sure i called the shots things have been very safe and tidy until well until a few months ago tess as far as this case is concerned you were brought in as a consultant its the police departments responsibility to find this man maybe i could have left it at that maybe she murmured running a hand through her hair im not totally sure but now how can i hes turned to me when he spoke to me there was a desperation a plea how could i how could any doctor try not to answer that treating him at some later date isnt the same thing as feeling responsible for the results of his illness a frown of concern entered his eyes as he linked his fingers and rested them on the desk if i had to speculate out of hand before a thorough reading of this report i would say hes drawn to you because he senses compassion and a certain vulnerability you have to be careful not to give so much of the first that you fall victim to the second its difficult for me to follow the rules on this one ben detective paris wanted me to go out of town when he suggested it for a minute i thought ill go ill get on a plane and go down to i dont know mazatlan and when i come back this will all be over and my life will be as neat and tidy as it used to be she paused and met logans quiet patient gaze i really detest myself for that dont you consider it a normal reaction to the stress of the situation for a patient she said and smiled not for me there is such a thing as overachievement tess i dont smoke im a very light drinker she came back to sit i figure im entitled to a vice i dont have sex logan said contemplatively i suppose thats why i feel entitled to smoke and drink he looked back pleased that she seemed more at ease confession he knew well was good for the soul so youre staying in georgetown and cooperating with the police how do you feel about that nervous she told him immediately its an uneasy feeling to know someones watching you all the time i dont mean just shaking her head she broke off i have such a difficult time knowing what to call him most people would call him a killer yes but hes also a victim in any case its not just knowing he might be watching that unnerves me its knowing the police are at the same time i feel satisfied that its the right thing i didnt cut and run i want to help this man its become very important to me to help him in the dream when i was faced with him i fell apart therefore i failed him and myself im not going to let that happen no i dont think you will logan picked up his letter opener running the hilt through his hands it was old and a bit tacky a souvenir from a trip to ireland during his youth he was fond of it as he was of many foolish things though he didnt consider tess foolish he was becoming fond of her as well tess i hope you dont take offense if i suggest that after all this is over you do get away for a while stress and overwork can break even the strongest of us i wont take offense but i might take it as doctors orders good girl tell me how is ben when she gave him a blank stare he smiled oh come even a priest can smell romance in the air i suppose you could say ben is another problem romance is supposed to be a problem he put the letter opener down are you calling the shots this time tess it doesnt seem as though either of us is were just fumbling around he i think we care for each other a great deal we just havent gotten around to trusting each other yet trust takes time if its going to be solid ive had a couple of professional discussions with him and one rather drunken meeting at a little bar downtown oh really he didnt mention it my dear a man doesnt like to mention he got drunk with a priest in any case would you like my opinion of detective paris yes i think i would id say hes a very good man dependable the kind of man who probably calls his mother once a month even when hed rather not men like ben bend rules but very rarely break them because they appreciate structure they understand the concept of law theres an anger in him he keeps well buried he didnt give up the church because of laziness but because he found too many flaws he gave up the church tess my dear but hes catholic right down to his toes tim sat back pleased with himself sixtysecond analysis is my speciality i believe it she pulled a file out of her briefcase i hope you have as much luck with this i cleared it with captain harris this is my updated report youll also find the transcripts of my phone calls id appreciate a miracle ill see what i can do thanks for listening any time he rose to go to the door with her tess if you have any more nightmares give me a call it never hurts to ask for a little help where have i heard that before logan watched her go through the outer office before he closed the door he watched her exit the building it was dangerous to follow her but he knew the time for caution was almost over she paused by her car looking for her keys her head was bent as if in prayer the need billowed up inside him until his head rang groping he found the white silk in his coat pocket cool soft it steadied him tess pushed the key into the lock if he was quick enough sure enough it could be over in minutes his fingers clutched and undutched on the amice while his heart thudded in his throat a few forgotten leaves dry as dust rustled around her ankles he saw the wind blow wisps of hair around her face she looked troubled soon very soon she would be at peace they would all be at peace he watched her get into her car heard the door close then the sound of the engine a puff of smoke spurted out of the tailpipe the car made a gentle sweep of the parking area then turned onto the road he waited until the police car made the turn before he went to his own car she would go to her office now and he would continue the vigil the moment hadnt arrived there was still time to pray for her and himself tess hung up the phone leaned back in her chair and shut her eyes she was batting about in her game that wasnt nearly good enough joey higgins how could she treat the boy if she couldnt talk to him his mother had taken a stand joey was no longer drinking therefore joey was fine and no longer needed the embarrassment of a psychiatrist it had been a painful and ultimately fruitless conversation she had one more shot she had to make it good leaning forward tess buzzed her secretary kate how much time do i have before the next appointment ten minutes all right please get donald monroe on the line for me right away while she waited tess looked over joeys file their last session remained very clear in her mind dyings not such a big deal why do you say that joey cause its not people are always dying youre supposed to deaths inevitable but that doesnt make it an answer even very old people very sick people cling to life because its precious people say when someone dies theyre at peace yes and most of us believe there is something after life but each of us is here for a reason our life is a gift not always easy certainly not always perfect making it better for ourselves and for the people around us takes some effort whats your favorite thing to eat he gave her a blank look spaghetti i guess meat balls or meat sauce the smile was quick but it was there meat balls suppose youd never tasted spaghetti and meat balls the sky would probably still be blue christmas would still come once a year but youd be missing something pretty terrific and if you werent here say youd never been born wed still have the sky and christmas but something pretty terrific would be missing her buzzer brought her back to the present mr monroe on one thank you kate mr monroe dr court is there a problem yes mr monroe i feel theres a big problem im strongly opposed to joey withdrawing from treatment withdrawing what do you mean mr monroe are you aware that joey missed his last session there was a pause before she caught just a whisper of a weary sigh no i suppose he decided to take off on his own ill discuss it with lois mr monroe ive already spoken to your wife shes decided to take joey out of therapy i take it you werent informed no i wasnt another pause then he drew a long breath dr court lois wants joey to resume a normal life and he does seem a great deal better we told him about the baby and his reaction was encouraging hes going to help me paint the nursery im glad to hear that mr monroe my feeling is however that hes far from ready to pull out of therapy in fact i still believe he would be helped a great deal by some time in the clinic we discussed lois is completely opposed to the clinic im sorry dr court and i do appreciate your concern but i have to back her on this anger surged barely controlled couldnt he see it was the boy he had to back up that they both had to back up i understand that you feel you should show joey a united front but mr monroe i cant stress enough how vital it is for joey to continue to receive consistent professional help and dr court theres also the risk of overanalyzing joey isnt drinking he isnt hanging around with the same crowd he was when he was drinking he hasnt even mentioned his father in two weeks the last statement had alarm bells ringing in her head the fact that he hasnt mentioned his father only means hes repressing his feelings his emotional state at this point is very tenuous can you understand when there is little selfesteem suicide becomes almost easy im afraid no im terrified of what he might do dr court i cant help but think youre overreacting i promise you im not mr monroe i dont want to see joey become a statistic what i want more than anything is for his therapy to stop when hes ready its both my professional opinion and my gut instinct that hes not ill see if i can convince lois to bring him back for another session but even as he said it tess recognized the dismissal some other boy might slash his wrists or swallow a bottle of pills but not joey mr monroe has anyone asked joey if he wants to continue seeing me dr court i can only promise to look into this impatience came through now with a trace of annoyance ill use whatever influence i have to see that joey comes back for at least one more session i think youll see for yourself how much better he is youve been very helpful doctor but if we feel joey is well then the sessions should be stopped please before you do anything would you get a second opinion perhaps youre right not to take my word for it i can recommend several excellent psychiatrists in the area ill talk to lois well consider it thank you dr court i know youve helped joey a great deal not enough she thought as the connection broke not nearly enough dr court mr grossman is here all right kate send him in she took joeys file but didnt put it away instead she set it aside on her desk within easy reach it was nearly five when the last patient left for the day kate stuck her head in the door dr court mr scott didnt schedule his next appointment he doesnt need one really kate relaxed against the door you did good work there dr court i like to think so you can take his file out of current patients its a pleasure do it tomorrow kate if you hurry you can get out of here exactly one minute early watch me good night dr court good night kate when the phone rang she reached for it herself ive got it go on home kate with her hand on the receiver she took a long breath dr court hi doc ben a layer of tension dissolved she heard background noises of phones voices and typewriters still at work yeah i wanted you to know id be a while yet you sound tired did something happen he thought of the day hed put in and the stench he wasnt sure would ever wash off his skin its been a long one look why dont i pick up some pizza or something things should be wrapped up here in another hour or so okay ben im a good listener ill keep that in mind go straight home and lock the door yes sir see you later smartass it wasnt until she hung up that tess realized how quiet the office was normally she would have appreciated an hour in the evening to herself her desk could be put in order paperwork could be finished up now the quiet seemed too close and too thick calling herself a fool she picked up the scott file to close it out success was satisfying she took the files and tapes from her lateafternoon patients and locked them away joey higginss file remained on her desk knowing she was spinning her wheels tess put it in her briefcase to take home three times she caught herself looking toward her door with her pulse throbbing ridiculous determined not to be a fool she checked the next days appointments there were two policemen outside she reminded herself and one in the lobby she was perfectly safe but each time she heard the elevator hum in the hall outside she felt a jolt if she went home now the apartment would be empty she didnt want to face solitude there now not now that she was sharing the apartment with ben what was she getting into sighing she began to gather the rest of her things she was over her head with ben paris just how did the eminent dr court deal with falling in love very poorly she decided as she went to the closet for her coat if it were spring shed have an excuse for daydreaming and smiling at nothing in particular smart people fell in love in spring she thought when everything was fresh and seemed as though it would stay that way she stopped at the window the trees that marched along the street in front of the buildings were dark and naked what patches of grass could be seen were already yellowed and tired people huddled inside their coats heads bowed against the wind it wasnt spring she thought feeling foolish and everyones hurrying home then she saw him he stood very still in his black coat just in back of a group of young trees her breath caught her knees trembled watching he was waiting and watching instinctively she swung around for the phone grabbing it from her desk shed call downstairs she thought as she began to punch buttons shed call and tell the police that he was outside watching then shed go down too shed go because shed promised herself that much but when she turned back to look he was gone she stood there a moment the phone in her hand the number half dialed he was gone just someone on his way home tess told herself a doctor or lawyer or bank executive walking home to keep fit she forced herself to walk back to her desk and calmly replace the phone she was jumping at shadows because her legs were still unsteady she sat on the edge of the desk layer by layer she rebuilt control diagnosis acute paranoia prescription hot bath and quiet evening with ben paris feeling better she drew on her cashmere coat hefted her briefcase and tossed her purse strap over her shoulder after locking her office she turned and saw the knob on the receptionarea door turn the keys in her hand slipped out of nerveless fingers she took a step back into the door shed just locked the door opened an inch the scream backed up in her throat bubbling hot frozen she stared as the door opened a bit more there was no maze to run through no place to go she took a deep breath knowing she was on her own anybody home oh jesus frank her knees felt like butter as she braced herself against her office door what are you doing sneaking around the halls i was walking down to the elevator and saw the light under your door he smiled delighted to find her alone dont tell me youre taking work home again tess he stepped inside strategically closing the outer door at his back no i keep my laundry in here she bent to retrieve her keys furious enough with herself to let him feel the backlash look frank ive had a long day im not in the mood for your fumbling attempts at seduction why tess his eyes widened and so did his smile i had no idea you could be so so aggressive if you dont get out of my way youre going to get a closeup view of the nap of this carpet how about a drink oh for gods sake she pushed past him took hold of the freshly pressed sleeve of his jacket and yanked him into the hall dinner at my place setting her teeth tess switched off the light closed the door and locked it frank why dont you take your sexual delusions and write a book it might keep you out of trouble she whipped past him and punched the button for the elevator you could be chapter one she took a long breath counted backward from ten and discovered to her amazement that it did nothing to calm her when the doors slid open she stepped inside turned and blocked the opening if you like the shape of your nose frank dont try to get on this elevator with me how about dinner and a hot tub he said as the doors started to close i know a great place for chicken kiev stuff it she muttered then leaned against the back wall she was nearly home before she started to laugh it was possible if she put her mind to it to forget about the police car behind her to block out the fact that on the third floor of her building cops were drinking coffee and watching the early news a twocar accident on twentythird held her up an extra fifteen minutes but didnt spoil the mood she was building she was humming when she unlocked the door to her apartment after wishing briefly that shed thought to pick up fresh flowers she went straight to the bedroom and stripped she chose the silk kimono again then dumped a double shot of bubble bath under the stream of water pulsing into the tub she took the time to put an album on the stereo phil collins bounced out happy to be alive and in love so was she tess thought as she lowered herself into the steaming water and tonight she was going to enjoy every minute of it when ben used his key to get in he felt he was home the furniture wasnt his and he hadnt picked out the paintings but he was home the cardboard box was warm on the bottom where he held it he set it on the dining room table on top of the linen placement he imagined had taken some little french nun the better part of a week to embroider and wished he could crawl into bed and sleep around the clock he put the paper bag he carried next to the pizza before he stripped out of his coat and let it fall over the back of a chair peeling off his shoulder holster he dropped it on the seat he could smell her even here barely three steps inside the door he could smell her soft subtle elegant drawing her in he found fatigue warring against a need hed yet to find a way to curb tess back here im in the tub ill be out in a minute he followed her scent and the sound of water hi when she glanced up at him he believed he saw her color rise a bit funny lady he thought as he moved over to sit on the edge of the tub she could make a man pant in bed but she blushed when he caught her in a bubble bath i didnt know how long youd be she stopped herself from sinking farther under the cover of bubbles just had to tie up a few things embarrassment faded as quickly as it had come it was a rough one wasnt it you look exhausted lets just say it was one of the less pleasant days on the job want to talk about it he thought of the blood even in his business you didnt often see that much no not now she sat up to reach over and touch his face theres room in here for two if youre friendly why dont you take dr courts reliable prescription for overwork the pizzall get cold i love cold pizza she began to unbutton his shirt you know i had a rather strange day myself ending with an invitation for chicken kiev and a hot tub oh he rose to unsnap his pants the feeling that went through him was ugly and unrecognizable to a man whod never experienced basic jealousy before doesnt seem too smart to turn that down for cold pizza and bubbles more fool me for refusing an evening with the handsome successful and excruciatingly boring dr fuller more your type ben muttered sitting on the john to pull off his shoes borings more my type tess lifted a brow as she leaned back thank you very much i mean the doctor the threepiece suits the gold american express card i see amused she began to soap her leg you dont have a gold card im lucky sears still lets me charge my underwear well in that case i dont know if i should invite you into my tub he stood naked but for the jeans riding low at his hips im serious tess i can see that she took a handful of bubbles and studied them i guess that means you see me as a shallow materialistic statusminded woman whos willing to slum it occasionally for good sex i dont mean anything like that frustrated he sat on the lip of the tub again look ive got a job that means i deal with slime almost on a daily basis her hand was wet and very gentle when she set it on his it was a filthy day wasnt it that has nothing to do with it he took her hand in his a moment studying it it was rather small and narrow delicate at the wrist my father sold used cars in a dealership that was barely on the right side of the tracks in the suburbs he owned three sport coats and drove a desoto my mother baked cookies if a cookie could be baked she did it their idea of a night on the town was the knights of columbus hall i punched my way through high school crammed my way through college for a couple of years then the academy and ive spent the rest of my life looking at dead bodies are you trying to convince me that youre not good enough for me because of cultural educational and genealogical differences dont start that shit with me all right lets try another approach she pulled him into the tub what the hell are you doing he spit out bubbles im still dressed i cant help it if youre slow before he could regain his balance she slid her arms around him and closed her mouth over his often even a psychiatrist knows its action rather than words that gets to the core she felt the tension ebb and flow before he reached for her ben hmm do you think its relevant at the moment that your father sold used cars and mine didnt no good she drew back and laughing brushed bubbles from his chin now how are we going to manage to get your pants off the pizza was stone cold but they didnt leave a crumb ben waited until shed dumped the carton i bought you a present you did surprised and foolishly pleased she looked at the paper bag he offered why questions always questions then he drew it back as she reached for it you really want to know yes he moved closer close enough to slip an arm around her waist the scent of the bath was on both of them her hair was pinned up and damp well i think im going out of my head yes i think im going out of my head over you she let her eyes close slowly for the kiss little anthony she murmured playing the tune over in her head was it i figured you being a shrink youd fall for that approach youre right dont you want your present ummhmm but i think you have to let me go so i can open the bag then dont take too long he gave it to her watching her expression as she looked inside it couldnt have been better the blank frown the surprise then the amusement a dead bolt god ben you know how to sweep a woman off her feet yeah its a real talent her lips curved as she pressed them against his ill always treasure it if it was a little less bulky id wear it next to my heart its going to be in your door in less than an hour i put my tools in the kitchen closet the other day handy too why dont you see if theres something you can do for a while otherwise ill make you watch ill come up with something she promised and left him to it while he worked tess edited a lecture she was to give at george washington university the following month the buzz of the drill and clank of metal against wood didnt disturb her she began to wonder how she had ever tolerated the total silence of her life before him when her lecture was in order and the files shed brought home dealt with she turned to see him just finishing up the lock looked bright and secure that should do it my hero he shut the door held up a pair of keys then set them on the table just use it ill put my tools away and wash up you can sweep the floor sounds fair as she walked toward the door she paused to turn on the television for the news though there seemed to be more mess than the small lock warranted tess swept the sawdust into the pan without complaint she was straightening up the pan and broom still in her hands when the top story came on police discovered the bodies of three people in an apartment in north west responding to the concern of a neighbor police broke into the apartment late this afternoon the victims had been stabbed repeatedly while bound with clothesline identified were jonas leery kathleen leery his wife and paulette leery their teenaged daughter robbery is thought to be the motive well switch to bob burroughs on the scene for more details a husky athleticlooking reporter appeared on the screen holding a microphone and gesturing at the brick building behind him tess turned and saw ben just outside the kitchen doorway she knew immediately that hed seen the inside of the building himself oh ben it must have been dreadful theyd been dead ten maybe twelve hours the kid couldnt have been more than sixteen the memory of it had the acid burning in his stomach theyd carved her up like a piece of meat im sorry she set everything aside and went to him lets sit down you get to a point he said still watching the screen you get to a point where its almost almost routine then you walk into something like that apartment today you walk in and your stomach turns over you think god its not real it cant be real because people cant do that kind of thing to each other but you know deep down you know they can sit down ben she murmured easing them both onto the couch do you want me to turn it off no but he rested his head in his hands for a minute then dragged them through his hair before he straightened the onthescene reporter was talking to a weeping neighbor paulette used to babysit my little boy she was a sweet girl i cant believe this i just cant believe it those bastardsll go down ben said half to himself there was a coin collection a fucking coin collection worth eight hundred maybe a thousand fenced it might bring half that they butchered those people for a bunch of old coins she glanced back at the lock now firmly in her door and understood why hed brought it to her tonight she drew him close and in the way women have of offering comfort rested his head against her breast theyll pawn the coins then youll trace them weve got a couple other leads well have them tomorrow the day after at the latest but those people tess sweet christ as long as ive been in this i still cant believe anything human could do that i cant tell you not to think about it but i can tell you im here for you knowing it knowing it was just that simple dulled the horror of the day she was there for him and for tonight for a few hours he could make that all that mattered i need you he shifted bringing her over into his lap so that he could nuzzle at her throat it scares the hell out of me i know chapter tess i dont know im not at my best with senators ben sent lowenstein a snarl as she grinned over at him then turned his back cradling the phone between shoulder and jaw hes my grandfather ben and really rather sweet ive never heard anyone call senator jonathan writemore a sweetheart pilomento called him from across the room so ben nodded and gestured with a finger to hold him off thats because im not doing his pr in any case its thanksgiving and i dont want to disappoint him and you did tell me your parents live in florida theyre over sixtyfive parents are supposed to move to florida when they hit sixtyfive so you dont have any family to have thanksgiving dinner with im sure grandpa would like to meet you yeah he tugged at the neck of his sweater look ive always had this policy about going to meet family which is i dont do it oh why is that questions he muttered under his breath when i was younger my mother always wanted me to bring the girl i was seeing home then my mother and the girl would get ideas i see he could hear the smile in her voice anyway i made a policy i dont take women to see my mother and i dont go to see theirs that way nobody gets the idea to start picking out silver patterns im sure you have a point i can promise that neither my grandfather nor i will discuss silver patterns if you join us for dinner miss bette makes a terrific pumpkin pie fresh absolutely a smart woman knew when to back off youve got some time to think about it i wouldnt have bothered you with it now but with everything thats been going on id forgotten the whole thing myself until grandpa called a few minutes ago yeah ill give it some thought and dont worry if you decide against it ill still bring you a piece of pie ive got a patient waiting tess yes nothing nothing he repeated see you later paris sorry he hung up the phone and turned what you got pilomento handed him a sheet of paper we finally tracked down that name the neighbor gave us the guy who was hanging around the leery girl right amos reeder not much of a description because the neighbor only saw him come by once creepy looking was about the upshot but she admitted she only saw him go to the leerys once and there wasnt any trouble ben was already picking up his jacket we always check out creepy looking i got an address and rap sheet before he stuffed his pack of cigarettes into his pocket he noted with some disgust that he only had two left whatd he do time for when he was seventeen he carved another kid up for pocket money reeder had a nickle bag of pot in his pocket and a line of needle marks on his arm other kid pulled through reeder was tried as a minor got drug rehab harris said you and jackson should have a talk with him thanks taking the papers he headed to the conference room where ed had his head together with bigsby on the priest homicide saddle up ben said briefly and started toward the door ed lumbered beside him already bundling into his coat whats up got a lead on the leery case young punk who likes knives was hanging around the girl thought we might chat awhile sounds good ed settled comfortably in the car how about tammy wynette kiss ass ben punched in a cassette of goats head soup tess called a few minutes ago ed opened one eye he considered it best to handle the rolling stones blind problem no well yeah i guess she wants me to have thanksgiving dinner with her grandfather whoa turkey with senator writemore think he needs a caucus to decide whether its going to be oyster or chestnut dressing i knew i was going to get grief on this more for spite than out of desire ben pulled out a cigarette its okay i got it out of my system so youre going to have thanksgiving dinner with tess and her granddaddy whats the problem first its thanksgiving then before you know it its sunday brunch then aunt mabels coming over to check you out ed dug in his pocket decided to save the yogurtcovered raisins for later and settled for sugarless gum does tess have an aunt mabel try to follow the trend here ed he downshifted and brought the car to a halt at a stop sign you turn around twice and youre invited to her cousin lauries wedding and her uncle joe is punching you in the ribs with his elbow and asking when youre going to take the plunge all that because of mashed potatoes and gravy ed shook his head amazing ive seen it happen i tell you its scary ben youve got bigger things to worry about than if tess has an aunt mabel scarier things oh yeah like what do you know how much undigested red meat is clogging up your intestines jesus thats disgusting youre telling me my point here ben is that you can worry about nuclear waste acid rain and your own cholesterol intake keep these things in the front of your mind and join the senator for dinner if he starts looking like hes ready to welcome you into the family do something to throw him off such as eat your cranberry sauce with your fingers heres the place ben pulled up at the curb then tossed his cigarette through the crack of his window youve been a big help ed thanks any time how do you want to handle this from the car ben studied the building it had seen better days much better days there were a couple of broken windows with newspapers clogging the holes graffiti was splashed lavishly on the east wall cans and broken bottles were in more profusion than grass hes in fire escapes on the third floor if he bolts i dont want to chase him all over his own territory ed dug a dime out of his pocket we flip to see who goes in and who covers the back fine heads i go in tails i climb up the fire escape and cover the window oh no not in here ben put a hand on eds arm before his partner could flip the coin last time you flipped in here i ended up having bean sprouts for lunch we do it outside where weve got some room in agreement they got out and stood on the sidewalk ed took off his gloves pocketing them before he flipped the coin heads he announced showing the coin give me time to get in position lets go ben kicked the glass neck of a beer bottle out of his way and started into the building inside it smelled like baby puke and old whiskey ben unzipped his jacket as he climbed to the third floor he took a long slow look up and down the hall before he knocked on the door was opened a crack by a teenager with matted hair and a missing front tooth even before he got the first whiff of pot ben saw by his eyes that he was high amos reeder who wants him ben flipped open his badge amos aint here hes out looking for work okay ill talk to you man you got a warrant or something we can talk in the hall inside or downtown you got a name i dont have to tell you nothing im in here minding my own business yeah and i smell enough grass coming through this door to show probable cause want me to come in and take a look around vice is having a special this week for every ounce of pot i turn in i get a free tshirt kevin danneville ben saw sweat begin to pearl on the kids forehead look i got rights i dont have to talk to no cops you look nervous kevin ben pressed a hand to the door to keep the crack open how old are you im eighteen if its any of your fucking business eighteen you look more like sixteen to me and youre not in school i might have to take you down to juvie why dont you tell me about a little girl whose daddy had a coin collection it was the shifting of kevins eyes that saved bens life he saw the change of expression and on instinct whirled the knife came down but instead of severing his jugular made a long slice through his arm as he fell against the door and crashed into the apartment christ amos hes a cop you cant kill a cop kevin rushing to get out of the way crashed into a table and sent a lamp shattering to the floor reeder flying on the pcp hed just scored only grinned im going to cut the motherfuckers heart out ben had time enough to see that his assailant was barely old enough to be out of high school before the knife swung toward him again he dodged fighting to free his weapon with his left hand as blood poured out of the right kevin scooted over the floor like a crab and whimpered behind them the window crashed in police ed stood outside the window legs spread revolver level drop the knife or ill shoot spittle ran out of the side of amoss mouth as he focused on ben incredibly he giggled gonna slice you up slice you into little pieces man hefting the knife over his head he made a leap the caliber bluntnosed wadcutter caught him in the chest and jerked his body back for a moment he stood eyes wide blood pumping out of the hole in his chest ed kept his finger wrapped around the trigger guard then reeder went down taking a folding table with him the knife slipped out of his hand with a quiet clatter he died without a sound ben stumbled and went down to his knees by the time ed climbed through the broken window hed managed to free his gun flinch ben said between gritted teeth as he aimed his service revolver at kevin just one good flinch is considered resisting arrest amos did it amos did all of them kevin said as he began to blubber i just watched i swear i just watched thats all just one good flinch you little sonofabitch and ill blow your balls off before you learn how to use them ed made a routine and unnecessary check of amos before he crouched beside ben how bads the arm the pain was incredibly hot and had already made a trip into his stomach to trigger nausea i had to pick heads next time i toss fine lets have a look just call someone in to clean up this mess and get me to the hospital didnt hit an artery or youd be gushing out a positive oh thats okay then he sucked in his breath as ed revealed the wound how about a round of golf just keep this on it hold the pressure steady ed took bens gun then clamped his hand onto the bandanna hed put on the gash the smell of his own blood drifted up to him where he sat his feet were only inches from amoss thanks its okay its an old bandanna ed ben spared a glance at kevin whod curled into the fetal position with his hands over his ears hes got a picture of charles manson over the bed i saw it ben sat on the edge of the table in emergency and counted nurses to keep his mind off the needle going in and out of his flesh the doctor who stitched him up chatted amiably about the redskins chances against the cowboys on sunday in the curtained enclosure beside them a doctor and two nurses worked on a nineteenyearold girl fighting off a crack overdose ben listened to her sobbing and wished for a cigarette i hate hospitals he muttered most people do the doctor sewed as neatly as a maiden aunt the defensive lines like a brick wall if we keep it on the ground dallas is going to be standing around sucking their thumbs by the third quarter not a pretty sight bens concentration wavered long enough for him to feel the pull and tug on his flesh he focused his attention on the sounds behind the curtain the kid was hyperventilating a sharp authoritative voice was ordering her to breathe into a paper bag you get many like her in here more every day the doctor knotted off another suture we put them back on their feet if theyre lucky so they can go to the first street corner and buy another vial there thats a very nice seam if i say so myself what do you think ill take your word for it tess rushed through the automatic glass doors of emergency after a quick glance around the waiting area she headed toward the examining rooms she stopped staring blankly as an orderly wheeled away a gurney with a shrouded figure on top her blood drained down to her feet a nurse came out of a curtained area and took her by the arm im sorry miss you dont belong back here detective paris stabbing hes getting his arm stitched up back there the nurse kept her grip firm now why dont you go back to the waiting room and im his doctor tess managed and tore her arm away she didnt run there was enough control left so that she walked steadily enough past a broken arm a seconddegree burn and a mild concussion an old woman lay on a gurney in the hall trying miserably to sleep tess passed the last curtained area and found him why tess the doctor looked over pleased and surprised what are you doing here oh john hello hello yourself its not often i get beautiful women to visit me at the office he began then saw the way she looked at his patient oh i see his considerable ego took only a slight bruise i take it you two know each other ben shifted on the table and would have stood if the doctor hadnt held him still what are you doing in here ed called me at the clinic he shouldnt have now that her images of him bleeding to death were put to rest her knees went weak he thought i might be concerned and didnt want me to hear about it on a news bulletin john how bad is it its no big deal ben answered ten stitches the doctor added as he secured the bandage no apparent muscle damage some blood loss but nothing major to quote the duke its just a scratch the guy had a goddamn butcher knife ben muttered annoyed at having someone else downplay his injury fortunately john went on as he turned to the tray beside him the detectives jacket and fancy footwork prevented the wound from being any deeper without it wed have been stitching up both sides of his arm this will sting a bit what will automatically ben shot out a hand to grab the doctors wrist just a little tetanus shot john said soothingly after all we dont know where that knife has been come on now bite the bullet he started to protest again but tess took his hand the sting in his arm came then dulled there now john left the tray for a nurse to deal with that ties things up forgive the pun no tennis or sumo wrestling for a couple of weeks detective keep the area dry and come back for a return visit the end of next week ill yank those stitches out for you thanks a lot your good health and medical insurance are thanks enough nice seeing you tess give me a call the next time youre in the mood for said and sea urchin bye john john huh ben eased himself off the table did you ever date anyone but doctors whatever for a light answer seemed best when shed spotted the bloodsoaked linen on the tray heres your shirt let me help you i can do it but his arm was stiff and painful he managed one sleeve its all right youre entitled to be cranky after ten stitches cranky he shut his eyes as she eased his shirt on jesus christ fouryearolds are cranky if they dont have a nap yes i know here ill button it she intended to she told herself she would button his shirt keep the conversation brisk shed nearly done two before she dropped her forehead on his chest tess he brought his hand to her hair what is it nothing she drew herself away and with her head bent finished buttoning his shirt tess with a hand under her chin he lifted her face tears swam in her eyes he brushed one from her lashes with his thumb dont im not going to but her breath hitched before she pressed her cheek to his just a minute okay yeah he put his good arm around her and absorbed the basic pleasure of being cared about some women had been turned on by his job others repulsed by it but he wasnt sure hed ever had anyone who just cared i was scared she admitted her voice muffled against him me too later will you tell me about it if i have to a guy hates to admit to his woman that he was a jerk were you i was sure the little sonofabitch was inside ed had the window i had the door very simple when he drew away he saw her gaze go to his ripped and bloodstained shirt you think this is bad you should see my jacket i just bought it two months ago in control again she took his arm and led him down the hall well maybe santa will bring you a new one for christmas do you want me to drive you home no thanks ive got a report to file and if the other kid hasnt spilled his guts by now i want to be in on the interrogation so there were two theres only one now she thought of the shrouded figure on the gurney because she could smell the dried blood on bens shirt tess said nothing theres ed oh god hes reading ed glanced up gave his partner a quick but very thorough study then smiled at tess hi dr court i must have missed you when you came in he didnt mention the fact that when shed arrived hed been donating a pint of blood both he and ben were a positive setting the magazine aside he gave ben his jacket and hol ster too bad about the coat it should only take the department till april to process the papers and replace it aint it the truth with eds help ben managed to heft on his holster and the damaged jacket you know i just read this fascinating article about kidneys save it ben advised and turned to tess you going back to the clinic yes i left in the middle of a session it wasnt until that moment that tess fully realized she had put him ahead of a patient speaking as a doctor id advise you to go home and rest after youve filed your report ill be home around sixthirty and could probably be persuaded to pamper you define pamper ignoring him she turned to ed why dont you come to dinner ed initially he looked perplexed by the invitation then pleased well i thanks eds not used to articulating to women come on over ed tessll fix you bean curds he stepped outside grateful for the rush of cold air his arm was no longer numb but beginning to throb like a toothache where are you parked he was already scanning the lot for the black and white just over there walk the lady to her car will you ed taking her by the front of her coat he kissed her hard thanks for coming by youre welcome she waited until hed started toward the mustang before she turned with ed youll look out for him sure digging her keys out of her pocket she nodded the man who stabbed ben is dead yeah he took the keys from her and in a gesture she found sweet unlocked the car himself tess looked at his face and saw as clearly as if hed spoken who had fired the shot her values the code she lived by warred briefly with a new awareness putting a hand on his collar she drew him down and kissed him thanks for keeping him alive she got in the car smiling up at him before she shut the door see you at dinner half in love with her himself ed walked back to his partner you dont go to thanksgiving dinner youre one dumb sonofabitch ben shook off grogginess as ed slammed the car door what and you shouldnt need her uncle joe to punch you in the ribs ed started the engine with a roar ed did you get a bad piece of granola you better start looking at whats in front of your face partner before you end up tripping over the saw saw what saw farmers sawing wood ed began as he drove off the lot city slickers watching him dinner bell rings and the farmer starts moving but he trips over the saw he just picks himself up and starts cutting wood again slicker asks him why he doesnt go in to dinner and the farmer says since he tripped over the saw its no use going in there wont be anything left ben sat in silence for a full ten seconds that explains it why dont you turn back around well go into the hospital and have them take a look at you the point is if you fuck around when opportunity is staring you in the face you miss it you got a hell of a woman ben i think i know that then you better be damn careful you dont trip over the saw chapter it was just beginning to snow when joey walked out of the back door knowing the storm door rattled he pulled it carefully closed until it latched hed remembered to take his gloves and had even pulled his blue ski cap over his head rather than changing to boots he kept on his high tops they were his favorite no one saw him leave his mother was in the den with his stepfather he knew theyd been arguing about him because their voices had been pitched low and had carried that thin nervous tone their voices carried whenever they argued about him they didnt think he knew his mother had roasted a turkey with all the trimmings throughout the meal she had chatted brightly too brightly about it being nice to have thanksgiving with just the family donald had joked about leftovers and bragged about the pumpkin pie hed baked himself thered been cranberry sauce and real butter and the little crescent rolls that popped up fluffy in the oven it had been the most miserable meal of joeys life his mother didnt want him to have any problems she wanted him to be happy do well in school and go out for basketball normal that was the word joey had heard her use in an urgent undertone to his stepfather i just want him to be normal but he wasnt joey guessed his stepfather sort of understood that and thats why they argued he wasnt normal he was an alcoholic just like his father his mother said his father was no good joey understood that alcoholism was a disease he understood addiction and that there was no cure only a continuing period of recovery he also understood that there were millions of alcoholics and that it was possible to be one and live the normal life his mother wanted so badly for him it took acceptance and effort and change sometimes he got tired of making the effort if he told his mother he was tired she would get upset he knew too that alcoholism could often be inherited hed inherited his from his father the same way hed inherited the no good the streets were quiet as he headed out of the nice tidy neighborhood snowflakes fluttered in the beam of streetlights like the fairy dancers in storybooks he remembered his mother reading him years before he could see the illumination in windows where people were eating their thanksgiving meal or resting after the effort in front of the tv his father hadnt come for him he hadnt called joey thought he understood why his father didnt love him anymore he didnt like to be reminded about the drinking and the fighting and the bad times dr court said his fathers disease hadnt been joeys fault but joey figured if hed gotten the sickness from his father then maybe somehow his father had gotten the sickness from him he remembered lying in bed knowing it was late and hearing his father shout in that thick nasty voice he used when hed been drinking a lot all you think about is that kid you never think about me everything changed after we had him then later he had heard his father cry big wet sobs which were somehow even worse than the temper im sorry lois i love you i love you so much its the pressure that makes me like this those bastards at work are always on my back id tell them all to get fucked tomorrow but joey needs a new pair of shoes every time i turn around joey waited for a car to rumble past then crossed the street and headed for the park snow was falling thickly now a white curtain buffeted by the wind the air whipped healthy pink into his cheeks once hed thought if he hadnt needed new shoes his father wouldnt need to get drunk then hed realized things would be easier on everyone if he just wasnt there so hed run away when hed been nine it had been scary because hed gotten lost and it had been dark and thered been noises the police had found him in a few hours but to joey it had seemed like days his mother had cried and his father had held him so tight everyone had made promises they had meant to keep for a while things had been better his father had gone to aa and his mother had laughed more that was the christmas joey had gotten his twowheeler and his father had spent hours running beside the bike with his hand hooked under the seat he hadnt let joey fall not even once but just before easter his father had started coming home late again joeys mothers eyes had stayed red and the laughter had stopped one night joeys father had taken the turn into the driveway too wide and hadnt seen the twowheeler his father had come in the house shouting joey had woken up to the swearing the accusations his father had wanted to get joey out of bed and take him outside to show him what his negligence had done his mother had blocked the way that was the first night hed heard his father strike his mother if hed put the bike away instead of leaving it on the lawn beside the driveway his father wouldnt have hit it then his father wouldnt have gotten so angry his father wouldnt have hit his mother and given her a bruise on her cheek she tried to hide with makeup that was the first night joey tried alcohol he hadnt liked the taste it had hurt his mouth and made his stomach rise up uncomfortably but when hed sipped from the bottle three or four times he felt strangely as if hed slipped on a thin plastic shield he didnt feel like crying anymore there had been a nice quiet buzz in his head as he climbed back into his bed hed fallen dreamlessly to sleep from that night joey had used alcohol as an anesthetic whenever his parents fought then the divorce had come in a horrible culmination of arguments shouting and name calling one day his mother had picked him up at school to drive him to a small apartment there she explained to him as gently as possible why they wouldnt be living with his father any longer hed been ashamed horribly ashamed because hed been glad theyd started their new life his mother had gone back to work she cut her hair and no longer wore her wedding ring but joey noticed from time to time the thin circle of white skin the band had covered for over a decade he could still remember how anxious how pleading her eyes had been when shed explained to him about the divorce shed been so afraid he would blame her so shed justified a move that left her riddled with guilt and uncertainty by telling him what he already knew but hearing it from her had shattered whatever thin defenses hed had left he could remember too how hard shed cried the first time she came home from work to find her elevenyearold son drunk the park was quiet on the ground a thin pretty layer of white had already formed in another hour no one would notice his footprints joey thought that was the way it should be snow was falling now in big soft flakes which clung to the branches of trees and lay glistening and fresh on bushes flakes melted on his face making his skin damp but he didnt mind he wondered only briefly if his mother had gone up to his room yet and discovered him gone he was sorry she was going to be upset but he knew what he was doing would make things easier for everyone especially himself he wasnt nine years old this time and he wasnt afraid hed gone to alateen and alanon meetings with his mother they didnt reach him he didnt let them reach him because he didnt want to admit he was ashamed to be like his father then donald monroe had come along joey wanted to be glad his mother was happy again then felt guilty because he was so close to accepting a replacement for his father his mother was happy again and joey was glad because he loved her so much his father grew more and more bitter and joey resented the change because he loved his father so much his mother married and her name changed it was no longer the same as joeys they moved into a house in a quietly affluent neighborhood joeys room overlooked the backyard his father complained about the childsupport payments when joey had begun to see tess he was finding a way to get drunk every day and hed already begun to contemplate suicide he hadnt liked going to see her at first but she hadnt pulled at him or pressured or claimed to understand shed just talked when he stopped drinking she gave him a calendar what she had called a perpetual calendar that he could use forever you have something to be proud of today joey and every day when you get up in the morning youll have something to be proud of sometimes hed believed her she never gave him that quick sharp look when he walked into the room his mother still did dr court had given him the calendar and believed in him his mother still waited for him to disappoint her thats why shed taken him out of his school thats why she wouldnt let him hang around with his friends youll make new friends joey i only want the best for you she only wanted him not to be like his father but he was and when he grew up he might have a son and his son would be like him it would never stop it was like a curse hed read about curses they could be passed from generation to generation sometimes they could be exorcised one of the books he kept under his mattress explained the ceremony for exorcizing evil hed followed it point by point one night when his mother and stepfather had been at a business dinner when he was finished he didnt feel any different it proved to him that the evil the no good inside of him was stronger than the good thats when hed begun to dream of the bridge dr court wanted to send him to a place where people understood dreams about death hed found the brochures his mother had thrown away it looked like a nice place quiet joey had saved the brochures thinking it might be a better place than the school he hated hed nearly worked up the nerve to talk to dr court about it when his mother said he didnt need to see the doctor anymore hed wanted to see dr court but his mother had that bright nervous smile on now they were home arguing about it about him it was always about him his mother was going to have a new baby she was already picking out colors for the nursery and talking about names joey thought it might be nice to have a new baby in the house hed been glad when donald asked him to help paint the nursery then one night hed dreamed that the baby had been dead he wanted to talk to dr court about it but his mother said he didnt need to see her anymore the surface of the bridge was slippery with its coating of snow joeys footprints were long sliding marks he could hear the rush of traffic below but walked on the side that overlooked the creek and the trees it was a high exhilarating feeling to walk up here above the tops of the trees with the sky so dark above his head the wind was frigid but the walk had kept his muscles warm he wondered about his father the night this last thanksgiving night had been a test if his father had come if hed been sober and had come to take joey with him for dinner joey would have tried one more time but he hadnt come because it was too late for both of them besides he was tired of trying tired of seeing those sharp uncertain looks on his mothers face of seeing the anxious concern on donalds he couldnt stand being to blame anymore for any of it when he was finished there wouldnt be any reason for donald and his mother to fight about him he wouldnt have any reason to worry that donald would leave his mother and the new baby because he couldnt tolerate joey any longer his father wouldnt have to make childsupport payments the rail of the calvert street bridge was slick but he got a good purchase with his gloves all he wanted was peace dying was peaceful hed read all about reincarnation about the chance of coming back to something better as someone better he was looking forward to it he could feel the wind tossing snow cold almost sharp snow against his face he could see his breath puff out slow and steady in the dark below him now were the whitetipped trees and the icy flow of rock creek hed decided quite calmly against other forms of suicide if he slashed his wrists the sight of his own blood might make him too weak to finish hed read where people who tried to overdose on pills often vomited them up and just got sick besides the bridge was right it was clean for a moment for one long moment it would feel like flying he balanced himself a moment and prayed he wanted god to understand he knew that god didnt like people to make a choice to die he wanted them to wait until he was ready well joey couldnt wait and he hoped god and everyone else would understand he thought of dr court and was sorry that she was going to be disappointed joey knew his mother would be upset but she had donald and the new baby it wouldnt take her long to see that it was all for the best and his father his father would just get drunk again joey kept his eyes open he wanted to see the trees rush up at him he took a long breath held it and dove miss bette has outdone herself again tess sampled the rich dark meat her grandfather had carved everythings spectacular as always nothing the woman likes better than to fuss with a meal the senator added steaming gravy to a mound of creamy white potatoes ive been barred from my own kitchen for two days did she catch you sneaking in for samples again threatened to make me peel potatoes he swallowed a healthy forkful then grinned miss bette has never subscribed to the notion that a mans home is his castle have some more dressing detective its not every day a man gets to indulge himself thanks because the senator held the bowl over his plate ben had little choice but to take it hed already had two helpings but it was difficult to resist the senators cheerful insistence after an hour in the company of senator writemore ben had discovered the old man was vibrant both in looks and speech his opinions were hard as granite his patience slim and his heart undeniably lay in his granddaughters hands what relieved ben was that after that hour he wasnt nearly as uncomfortable as hed been prepared to be initially the house had made him uneasy from the outside it had merely been quietly elegant distinguished inside it had been like a trip around the world in a firstclass cabin turkish rugs faded just enough to show their age and durability were spread over blackandwhite checkerboard tile on the hall floor an ebony cabinet high as a mans shoulders and magnificently painted with peacocks stood under a long curve of stairs in the parlor where a silent oriental had served beforedinner drinks two louis quinze chairs flanked a long rococo table a cabinet fronted with etched glass held a treasure trove venetian glass almost thin enough to read through was stained with color a glass bird caught and reflected the light from the fire guarding the white marble hearth was a porcelain elephant the size of a terrier it was a room that reflected the senators background and ben realized tesss comfortable wealth a knowledge of art and style shed sat on the dark green brocade of the sofa in a pale lavender dress that had made her skin glow the pearl choker lay against her throat its glinting center stone pulsing with light and the heat from her body to ben shed never looked more beautiful there was a fire in the dining room as well this one had been banked to simmer and pop through the meal light came from the prisms of the tiered chandelier above the table wedgwood plates delicately tinted georgian silver heavy and gleaming baccarat crystal waiting to be filled with cool white wine and sparkling water irish linen soft enough to sleep on bowls and platters were heaped oysters rockefeller roast turkey buttered asparagus fresh crescent rolls and more their scents mixed into a delightful potpourri with candles and flowers as the senator carved the turkey ben had thought back on the thanksgivings hed experienced as a child because they had always eaten at midday rather than evening hed woken to the enticing smells of roasting fowl sage cinnamon and the sausage his mother had browned and crumbled into the stuffing the television had stayed on through the macys parade and football it was one of the few days of the year when he or his brother hadnt been drafted to set the table that was his mothers pleasure shed take out her best dishes the ones used only when his aunt jo visited from chicago or his fathers boss came to dinner the flatware hadnt been sterling but a more ornate stainless shed always taken pride in arranging the napkins into triangles then his fathers sister would arrive with her husband and brood of three in tow the house would be full of noise arguments and the scent of his mothers honey bread grace would be said while ben ignored his cousin marcie who became more disagreeable every year and who for reasons of her own his mother would insist on seating next to him bless us o lord with these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through christourlordamen the last of the prayer always ran together as greed became overwhelming the minute the sign of the cross was completed hands began to reach out for whatever was closest there had never been a silent oriental seeing the glasses were full of pouillyfuisse im glad you could join us tonight detective writemore helped himself to another serving of asparagus i often feel guilty about keeping tess all to myself over the holidays i appreciate the invitation otherwise id probably be eating a taco in front of the television a profession like yours doesnt leave time for many quiet meals id imagine im told youre a rare breed detective being dedicated when ben only lifted a brow the senator gave him a bland smile and gestured with his wineglass the mayors been keeping me informed on the ins and outs of your case as my granddaughters involved what grandpa means is that he gossips with the mayor that too writemore agreed easily apparently you didnt approve of tess being brought in to consult blunt ben decided is best met with blunt i still dont try some of these pear preserves on that roll genially the senator passed the dish miss bette puts them up herself do you mind if i ask if you disapproved of consulting with a psychiatrist or of consulting with tess grandpa i dont think thanksgiving dinner is an appropriate place for a grilling nonsense im not grilling the boy just trying to see where he stands taking his time ben spread the preserves on the bread i didnt see the point in a psychiatric profile that involved more time and paperwork i prefer basic police work interviews legwork logic he glanced over at tess and saw her studying her wine as far as law enforcement is concerned it doesnt matter to me if hes psychotic or just mean this dressings incredible yes miss bette has quite a hand as if to corroborate writemore took another forkful im inclined to see your opinion detective without wholly agreeing thats what we in politics call diplomatic bullshit we call it the same thing in law enforcement then we understand each other you see im of the opinion that its always wise to understand your opponents mind insofar as it helps you stay a step ahead of him ben turned his attention to writemore the senator sat at the tables head in a black suit and stiff white shirt the dark tie was held in place by a single unadorned diamond his hands were big and rough looking against the elegant crystal it surprised ben to note that his own grandfathers hands the old butchers hands had been much the same worked thick at the knuckle wide backed he wore a plain gold band on his left hand the sign of a commitment to the wife who had died more than thirty years before then you dont feel tesss work as a psychiatrist has helped you in this particular case as if she were sublimely unconcerned tess continued to eat id like to say that ben answered after a moment because if i did it might be easier to convince her or to convince you to convince her to stay out of it from here on but the fact is shes helped us establish a pattern and a motive would you pass me the salt tess smiled as ben lifted the lead crystal dish thank you youre welcome he said but grudgingly that doesnt mean i approve of her being involved then i take it youve come to realize that my granddaughter is both a dedicated and stubborn woman ive gotten the picture i consider it an inheritance tess said and covered the senators big hand with hers from my grandfather ben saw the hands link and hold thank god you didnt get my looks then in the same genial tone im told youve moved in with my granddaughter detective thats right preparing for the inquisition hed been expecting all evening ben fell back on the pear preserves i wonder if youre charging the city overtime tess laughed and sat back in her chair grandpas trying to see if he can make you sweat here darling she passed the senator more turkey indulge yourself the next time you gossip with the mayor tell him that im receiving the very best in police protection what else should i tell him youre receiving whatever else im receiving is none of the mayors business writemore dropped another slab of turkey on his plate before he reached for the gravy and i suppose youre going to tell me its none of mine either i dont have to tess spooned cranberry sauce onto his plate youve just said so yourself at five feet and a hundred forty pounds miss bette shuffled into the room and cast an approving eye on the dent made in the feast shed prepared she wiped small pudgy hands on her apron dr court theres a call for you oh thank you miss bette ill take it in the library after she rose she leaned down to kiss the senators cheek dont be a nuisance grandpa and make sure i get a piece of that pie writemore waited until tess was out of the room a beautiful woman yes she is you know when she was younger people often underestimated her because of her looks her size her sex after youve lived more than half a century you dont take much on face value she was just a bit of a thing when she moved in here with me we only had each other people would assume that i got her through the rough times the truth was ben she got me through i think i would have crumbled up and died without tess im closing in on three quarters of a century writemore smiled as if the thought pleased him when you do that you start to look at each day in sharp focus you start to appreciate little things like feeling your feet on the ground in the morning ben murmured then catching the senators look shifted uncomfortably something my grandfather said obviously an astute man yes like feeling your feet on the ground in the morning holding his wineglass he leaned back studying ben it relieved him that he liked what he saw human nature forces a man to appreciate those things even after hes lost his wife and his only child tess is all i have left besides those small pleasures ben ben discovered he was no longer uncomfortable no longer waiting to be backed into a corner im not going to let anything happen to her not just because im a cop and its my duty to shield and protect but because she matters when he leaned away from the table the diamond in writemores tie glinted from the light you follow football borne when neither of us have to worry about tess you come to a game with me ive got season tickets well have a few beers and you can tell me about yourself things i didnt learn from copies of your departmental record he grinned showing a white set of teeth which were almost all his own shes all ive got detective i could tell you what your score was last week at target practice amused ben polished off his wine howd i do good enough writemore told him damn good enough surprisingly in tune both men turned as tess entered the room again ben only had to see her face to be out of his chair whats wrong im sorry her voice was calm without a tremor but her cheeks were very pale she stretched out a hand as she walked to her grandfather ive got to go grandpa i have an emergency at the hospital i dont know if ill make it back because her hand was cold her grandfather covered it with both of his better than anyone he understood how much emotion she kept locked inside a patient yes attempted suicide hes been taken to georgetown but it doesnt look good her voice was cool and flat a doctors voice ben studied her carefully but other than the lack of color he could see no emotion im sorry to leave you like this dont you worry about me the senator had already risen his arm was draped around her as he walked her from the room you give me a call tomorrow let me know how you are something inside her trembled and shook but she held steady she pressed her cheek to his wanting to draw a bit of his strength i love you i love you too little girl as they walked into the snowswathed night ben took her arm to keep her from slipping on the stairs can you tell me what happened a fourteenyearold boy decided life was too much to handle he jumped off the calvert street bridge chapter the surgical floor smelled of antiseptic and fresh paint with the staff halved for the holiday the halls were almost empty someone had covered a mincemeat pie in saran wrap and left it at the nurses station it looked cheerful and miserably out of place tess stopped there as the nurse on duty filled out a report im dr teresa court joseph higgins jr was admitted a short time ago yes doctor hes in surgery whats his condition massive trauma hemorrhaging he was comatose when they took him up dr bittermans operating joeys parents down the end of the hall and to the left in the waiting area doctor thank you steeling herself tess turned to ben i dont know how long this might take and it wont be pleasant im sure i can arrange for you to wait in the doctors lounge youd be more comfortable ill go with you all right unbuttoning her coat as she went tess started down the hall their footsteps sounded like gunfire in the tiled silence of the corridor as she approached the door to the waiting area she heard the muffled sobs lois monroe was huddled close against her husband though it was overwarm in the room neither of them had taken off their coats she cried quietly with her eyes open and unfocused a thanksgiving special danced soundlessly from the television mounted high on the wall tess motioned for ben to stay back mr monroe at the sound of her voice his eyes shifted from the wall to the door for a moment he stared at her as if he didnt know who she was then a seizure of pain ran through him reflecting briefly poignantly in his eyes she could almost hear the thoughts i didnt believe you i didnt understand i didnt know responding to that even more than to the weeping tess went to them to sit beside lois monroe she went up to see if he wanted some more pie monroe began he he was gone there was a note because she understood need tess reached out and held his free hand he gripped it tight swallowed then went on it said he was sorry that he he wished he could be different it said everything would be better now and that he was going to come back in another life someone saw him monroes fingers viced on hers while he closed his eyes and fought for control someone saw him jump and called the police they came they came to the house just after we realized he was gone i didnt know what to do so i called you joeys going to be just fine with her hands kneading together lois shifted farther away from tess ive always taken care of him hes going to be fine then were going to go home together maintaining the distance she turned her head enough to look at tess i told you he didnt need you anymore joey doesnt need you or any clinic or more treatment he just needs to be left alone for a little while hes going to be fine he knows i love him yes he knows you love him tess murmured as she took loiss hand the pulse was rapid and thready joey knows how hard youve tried to make things good for him i have everything ive done has been to try to protect him to try to make things better all ive ever wanted was for joey to be happy i know that then why you tell me why this happened tears dried up her voice went from wavery to venomous lois struggled away from her husband to grab tess by the shoulders you were supposed to heal you were supposed to make him well you tell me why my boys bleeding on that table you tell me why lois lois dont already grieving monroe tried to gather her close but she sprang up dragging tess with her instinctively ben started forward but was stopped by a furious shake of tesss head i want an answer damn you i want you to give me an answer rather than block the fury tess accepted it he was hurting mrs monroe and the hurt was deep deeper than i could reach i did everything i could though her voice was quiet almost level loiss fingers dug deep into tesss flesh bruises would show the next day i did everything he wasnt drinking she said with a hitch in her voice he hadnt had a drink in months no he wasnt drinking you should sit down lois tess tried to ease her back on the sofa i dont want to sit fury that was fear spewed out until each word was like a bullet i want my son i want my boy all you did was talk and talk week after week just talk why didnt you do something you were supposed to make him better make him happy why didnt you i couldnt in a wave the grief washed over her i couldnt lois sit down strengthened by her need monroe took her by the shoulders and brought her to the sofa as his arm went around her again he looked at tess you told us this could happen we didnt believe you we didnt want to if its not too late we can try again we can then the door swung open and they all knew it was too late dr bitterman still wore his surgical scrubs hed pulled down his mask so that it hung by its strings the sweat on it hadnt dried though his time in the operating room had been relatively brief there were lines of strain and fatigue around his eyes and mouth before he spoke before he moved over to the monroes tess knew they had both lost a patient mrs monroe im sorry there was nothing we could do joey she looked blankly from the doctor to her husband one hand was already clawing at monroes shoulder joeys gone mrs monroe because the hour hed spent trying to sew the boy back together had left him sick and defeated bitter man sat beside her he never regained consciousness he had a massive head injury there was nothing that could be done joey joeys dead im sorry the sobbing started harsh guttural sounds that poured out of her into the room she cried with her mouth open her head back in an agony of grief that twisted tesss stomach no one could truly understand the measure of joy a mother received from giving birth to a child no one could truly understand the devastation a mother experienced upon losing one an error in judgment a desire to keep her family whole with her own strength had cost her her son there was nothing tess could do for her now there was no longer anything she could do for joey with her own grief clogging her lungs she turned and walked from the room tess ben caught her arm as she started down the hall you arent staying no her voice was strong and icy as she continued to walk seeing me now only makes it more painful for her if possible she pushed the button for the elevator then jammed her hands into her pockets where they curled and uncurled thats it dull and centered in his gut the anger began to spread you just cross it off theres nothing more i can do here she stepped into the elevator fighting to breathe calmly it was snowing hard on the way home tess didnt speak tasting bitterness in his own throat ben remained as coldly silent as she though the car heater poured out warmth she had to struggle not to shiver failure grief and anger were so twined together that it made one hard knot of emotion that wedged in her throat she could taste it control was often hard won but never so vital as it seemed to her at that moment by the time they stepped into her apartment the pressure in her chest was so strong she had to consciously school every breath im sorry you got dragged into this she said carefully she needed to get away away from him from everyone until shed pulled herself back together the throbbing in her head was building to a roar i know it was difficult you seem to be handling it just fine after yanking off his jacket he tossed it into a chair you dont have to apologize to me im in the business remember yes of course listen she had to swallow the bubbling heat in her throat im going to have a bath sure go ahead he walked to the liquor cabinet and reached for the vodka hed stored im going to have a drink she didnt bother to go into the bedroom to change when the door was closed quietly behind her ben heard the sound of water rushing against porcelain he hadnt even known the kid ben told himself as he splashed vodka into a glass there was no reason for him to feel this ugly squeeze of resentment it was one thing to feel sorrow pity even anger at the useless loss of a life a young life but there was no reason for this helpless shaking rage shed been so detached so goddamned untouched just like joshs doctor the bitterness lodged deep for years swirled into his throat ben lifted the vodka to wash the taste away then slammed it untouched onto the cabinet not sure what he was going to do he went down the hall and pushed the bathroom door open she wasnt in the tub like thunder the water hit the porcelain full force then whirled down the drain she hadnt bothered to close steam was rising already sweating on the mirror fully dressed using the sink for support tess wept violently into her hands for a moment ben stood silently in the open doorway too stunned to go in too shocked to close the door and leave her the privacy shed sought hed never seen her as the helpless victim of her own emotions in bed there were times she seemed utterly guided by her own passion occasionally hed seen her temper flare teetering briefly on full blossoming then she snapped it back always now it was grief and the grief was total she hadnt heard him open the door slowly her body rocked back and forth in a rhythm of mourning selfcomfort bens throat tightened driving back the bitterness he started to touch her then hesitated it was harder he discovered unbelievably harder to comfort someone who really mattered tess when he did touch her she jolted when his arms went around her she went board stiff he could feel her fighting to block off the tears and him come on you should sit down no humiliation washed through her already weakened system shed been caught in her lowest and most private moment stripped naked without the strength to cover herself she wanted only solitude and the time to rebuild please just leave me alone for a while it hurt her resistance her rejection of the comfort he needed to give it hurt enough that he started to draw away then he felt the shudder pass through her a shudder more poignant more pitiful than even the tears in silence he moved over and shut off the tap shed uncovered her face to wrap her fingers around the lip of the sink her back was ramrod straight as if she were braced to ward off a blow or a helping hand drenched her eyes met his her skin was already streaked and reddened from tears he didnt say a word didnt think of the angles as he lifted her into his arms and carried her from the room he expected a struggle some fierce and furious words instead her body went limp as she turned her face into his throat and let herself cry he was just a child ben sat on the edge of the bed and gathered her closer the tears were hot on his skin as if they had burned behind her eyes for too long i know i couldnt reach him i should have been able to all the education all the training the selfanalysis the books and lectures and i couldnt reach him you tried thats not good enough the anger sprang out fullblown and vicious but it didnt surprise him hed been waiting for it hoping for it im supposed to heal im supposed to help not just talk of helping i didnt just fail to complete his treatment i failed to keep him alive are psychiatrists required to have godlike egos like a slap in the face his words jarred her away from him in an instant she was on her feet the tears were still drying on her face her body still trembling but she didnt look as though she would collapse how dare you say that to me a young boy is dead hell never have a chance to drive a car to fall in love to start a family hes dead and the fact that im responsible hasnt anything to do with ego doesnt it ben rose as well and before she could turn away took her shoulders youre supposed to be perfect always in control always having the answers the solutions this time you didnt have them and you werent quite indestructible you tell me could you have stopped him from going to that bridge i shouldve been able to the sob was dry and shaky as she pressed the heel of her hand between her brows no no i couldnt give him enough with his arm around her again he drew her back to the bed for the first time in their relationship he felt needed leaned on in the normal course of events it would have been his cue to make for the door instead he sat with her taking her hand as her head rested on his shoulder complete it was odd and a little frightening to feel complete tess this is the boy you told me about before isnt it she remembered the night of her dream the night shed woken to find ben warm and willing to listen yes ive been worried about what he might do for weeks and you told his parents yes i told them but they didnt want to hear it it shouldnt have made any difference i should have been able to she broke off when he turned her face to his no she said on a long breath they didnt want to hear it his mother pulled him out of therapy and cut the strings it might have pushed him a bit farther inward but i dont think it was the final factor that drove him to suicide the grief was still there cold and hard in her stomach but her mind was clearing enough for her to see past her own involvement i think something else happened tonight and you think you know what it was maybe she rose again unable to sit ive been trying to contact joeys father for weeks his phones disconnected i even went by his apartment a few days ago but hed moved without leaving a forwarding address he was supposed to spend this weekend with joey tess rubbed tears from her cheeks with the backs of her hands joey had been counting on it too heavily when his father didnt come for him it was another brick on his back maybe the last one he could carry he was a beautiful boy a young man really fresh tears started but this time the grief loosened and came clean hed had such a tough time and yet there was this warmth just under the surface this great need to be loved he just didnt believe he deserved to have anyone really care about him and you cared yes maybe too much it was strange but the small hard ball of resentment coated with a thin layer of bitterness that hed carried in his gut since his brothers death began to break apart he looked at her the aloof the objective psychiatrist the poker and prodder of minds and saw the real and human scars of grief not just for the patient but for the boy tess what his mother said back at the hospital it doesnt matter yes it does she was wrong tess turned away and in the dim light from the hallway saw her own reflection in the mirror above her dresser only partly you see ill never know that if id pushed in a different direction tried another angle whether it would have made a difference she was wrong ben repeated a few years ago i said some of those same things maybe i was wrong too in the glass her gaze shifted and met his he was still sitting on the bed in the shadows he looked alone it was strange because she had considered him a man constantly surrounded by friends good feelings his own selfconfidence she turned but not certain he wanted her to reach out remained where she was ive never told you about josh my brother no youve never told me much about your family i didnt know you had a brother he was almost four years older than me it didnt take the use of the past tense to tell her josh was dead shed known it as soon as ben had said the name he was one of those people who have gold on the ends of their fingers no matter what he did he did it better than anyone else when we were kids we had this set of tinker toys id built a little car josh would build a sixteenwheeler in school id maybe pull a b if i studied until my eyes dropped out josh would ace a test without opening a book he just absorbed my mother used to say he was blessed she kept hoping hed be a priest because once he was ordained hed probably be able to perform miracles it wasnt said with the resentment many siblings might have felt but with a trace of humor and more than a little admiration you must have loved him very much sometimes i hated him it was said with a shrug from a man who understood that hate was often the heat that tempered real love but mostly yes i thought he was terrific he never bullied me not that he couldnt have he was a hell of a lot bigger but he just didnt have that kind of temperament not that he was holy or anything he was good just basically deep down good we shared a room when we were growing up once mom found my stash of playboys she was prepared to whale the lust as well as the tar out of me josh told her they were his that he was doing a report on pornography and its sociological effects on teenagers unable to resist tess laughed and she bought it yeah she bought it even now remembering made him grin josh never lied to cover his own ass only when he thought it was the best thing to do in high school he was quarterback on the football team the girls all but threw themselves on the ground in front of him he was healthy enough to get some pleasure out of that but he fell hard for one girl it was like him to focus in on one instead of well picking the tree dry still she was the one big mistake i ever thought he made she was gorgeous smart and from one of the better families she was also shallow but he was crazy in love and in his senior year he took his savings and bought her a diamond not just a little chip but a real rock she used to go around flashing it to make the other girls drool they fought about something he never would say what it was but it was a real fallout josh had an academic scholarship to notre dame but the day after graduation he enlisted in the army kids were protesting nam smoking pot and wearing peace signs but josh decided to give his country a few years of his time for the first time since hed begun ben reached for and lit a cigarette the tip glowed red in the shadowed light that fell over him my mother cried buckets but my father was bustbutton proud his son wasnt a draft dodger or a potheaded college student but a real american my fathers a simple man thats the way he thought for myself i leaned more toward the left id be starting high school myself in the fall so i figured i already knew about everything i needed to know i spent an allnight session with josh trying to talk him out of it of course the papers were signed and it was too late but i figured there must be a way out i told him he was stupid to toss three years of his life away because of a girl the trouble was it had gone beyond that as soon as josh had enlisted hed decided he was going to be the best soldier in the united states army theyd already talked to him about officers training the way johnson was escalating things over there we needed smart capable officers leading the troops thats how josh saw himself she heard it then the splinter of pain that worked its way into his voice leaving the light for the shadows tess went to him he hadnt realized hed needed it but when her hand touched his ben held on so he went he drew deep on his cigarette and let smoke out with a sigh he got on the bus young i guess you could say beautiful idealistic confident from his letters it seemed he was thriving in basic it was the discipline the challenge the camaraderie he made friends easily and it wasnt any different there he got his orders for nam less than a year later i was in high school bluffing my way through algebra and finding out how many cheerleaders i could rack up josh shipped out a second lieutenant he lapsed into silence tess sat beside him his hand in hers waiting for him to go on my mother went to church every day he was over there she used to go in and light a candle then pray to the blessed virgin to intercede to her son for joshs safety every time she got a letter shed read it until she knew every word but it didnt take long for the letters to change they got shorter the tone was different he stopped mentioning his friends we didnt know until later that two of his best buddies had been splattered all over the jungle we didnt know that until hed come back and started having nightmares he didnt get killed over there my mother must have lit enough candles for that but he died the part of him that made him what he was died i need a drink before he could rise tess put a hand to his arm ill get it she left him and wanting to give him the time he needed poured two warming brandies when she went back in hed lit another cigarette but hadnt moved thanks he drank and found that while the brandy didnt fill the hole grief had left it no longer had to bypass that ball of bitterness nobody was giving heros welcomes back then the war had turned sour josh came back with medals commendations and a time bomb in his head it seemed okay for a while he was quiet withdrawn but we figured nobody could come through that without some change he moved back into the house got a job he didnt want to talk about going back to school we all figured well he just needs some time it took almost a year before the nightmares started hed wake up screaming and sweating he lost his job he told us hed quit but dad found out hed picked a fight and gotten himself fired it took about another year before things really deteriorated he couldnt keep a job for more than a few weeks he started coming home drunk or not coming home at all the nightmares got violent one night i tried to bring him out of one and he knocked me across the room he started shouting about ambush and snipers when i stood up and tried to calm him down he came at me when my father came in josh was strangling me oh god ben dad managed to bring him out and when he realized what hed done what hed almost done josh just sat down on the floor and cried ive never seen anyone cry like that he couldnt stop we took him to the va they assigned him a psychiatrist the ash on his cigarette had grown long crushing it out ben went back to the brandy i was in college by then so id drive him sometimes when i had a light afternoon schedule i hated that office it always made me think of a tomb josh would go in sometimes you could hear him crying other times you couldnt hear anything at all fifty minutes later hed come out i kept waiting for him to walk out that door one day and be the way i remembered sometimes its as hard even harder on the family than it is on the one whos ill tess said keeping her hand near his letting him take or reject the contact you feel helpless when you want so badly to help confused when you need so badly to think clearly my mother broke down one day it was a sunday shed been fixing a pot roast all of a sudden she just dumped it all in the sink if it was cancer she said theyd find a way to cut it out of him cant they see whats inside him is eating him up why dont they find a way to cut it out of him he stared down into his brandy the image of his mother standing over the sink sobbing as clear as if it had happened yesterday for a while he really seemed to get better because he was under psychiatric care and his job record was shaky it was hard for him to find work our pastor applied a little pressure some good oldfashioned catholic guilt and got him a job at a local gas station as a mechanic hed had a scholarship to notre dame five years before and now he was changing spark plugs still it was something the nightmares slowed down none of us knew he was eating barbituates to keep them that way then it was heroin that got by us too maybe if id been home more but i was in college and for the first time in my life serious about making it work my parents were totally naive about drugs it got by the doctor too he was a major regular army had done a tour of korea and nam but he didnt see that josh was pumping himself full of smack to get through the night ben dragged a hand through his hair before he finished off the brandy i dont know maybe the guy was overworked or maybe he burned out anyway the upshot was after two years of therapy after thousands of candles and prayers to the blessed virgin josh went up to his room put on his combat fatigues and his medals and instead of picking up his syringe loaded his service revolver and ended it ben saying im sorry isnt enough isnt nearly enough but theres nothing else i can say he was only twentyfour and youd have been only twenty she thought but rather than say it put her arm around him i thought about blaming the whole us army better yet the entire military system i figured it made more sense to focus on the doctor who was supposed to be helping him i remember sitting there when the police were upstairs in the room id shared with josh and thinking that the bastard was supposed to do something he was supposed to make him better i even thought about killing him for a while then the priest came and distracted me he wouldnt give josh last rites i dont understand it wasnt our pastor but this young straightoutoftheseminary rookie who turned green at the thought of going upstairs to josh he said josh had willingly and knowingly taken his life dying in mortal sin he wouldnt give him absolution thats wrong worse its cruel i threw him out my mother stood there tightlipped dryeyed then she went up to the room where her sons brains were splattered on the wall and she prayed for his absolution herself your mothers strong she must have tremendous faith all shed ever done was cook he drew tess closer needing the soft feminine scent i dont know if i could have walked up those stairs a second time but she did when i watched her do that i realized that no matter how much she hurt no matter how much shed grieve she believed and would always believe that what happened to josh was gods will but you didnt no it had to be someones fault josh had never hurt anyone in his life not until nam then what hed done there was supposed to be right because he was fighting for his country but it wasnt right and he couldnt live with it anymore the psychiatrist was supposed to show him that no matter what hed done over there he was still decent still worthwhile as she had been supposed to show joey higgins he was worthwhile did you ever talk to joshs doctor afterward once i think i still had it in my head i should kill him he sat there behind his desk with his hands folded ben looked down at his own watching them curl into fists he didnt feel anything he said he was sorry explained how extreme delayed stress syndrome could be then he told me while he kept his hands folded on the desk and his voice just two shades away from being involved that josh hadnt been able to cope with what had happened in nam that coming home and trying to live up to what hed been before had created more and more pressure until finally the lid had blown off im sorry ben probably a great deal of what he told you was true but he could have done it in a different way it could have meant a damn to him ben im not defending him but a lot of doctors medical or psychiatric hold themselves back dont let themselves in too close because when you lose someone when you arent able to save them it hurts too much the way losing joey hurt you that kind of grief and guilt rips at you and if it rips at you too often theres nothing left not for you or for the next patient maybe he understood that or was beginning to but he couldnt see joshs regular army shrink closing himself in the bathroom and sobbing why do you do it i guess i have to look for answers the same way you do turning she touched his face it does hurt when its too little or too late she remembered how hed looked when hed told her about three strangers whod been murdered for a handful of coins were not as different as i once thought he turned his lips into her palm comforted by it maybe not when i saw you tonight i felt the same way i did when i saw you looking at anne reasoner in that alley you seemed so detached from the tragedy of it so completely in control just the way that major had been with his hands folded on the desk telling me why my brother was dead being in control isnt the same as being detached youre a cop you have to know the difference i wanted to know you felt something sliding his hand down to her wrist he held it firm while he looked into her eyes i guess what i really wanted was for you to need me and that was perhaps one of the most difficult confessions of his life then when i walked into the bathroom and saw you crying i knew you did and it scared the hell out of me i didnt want you to see me like that why because i didnt trust you enough he dropped his gaze long enough to study his hand over her slender impossibly delicate wrist ive never told anyone but ed about josh until now hes the only one ive trusted enough he brought her fingers to his lips brushing them lightly so what happens now what do you want to happen a laugh even when quiet and reluctant can be cleansing psychiatrists copout thoughtfully he fingered the pearls around her neck he unhooked them her throat was fragrant and silky tess when this is over if i asked you to take off for a few days a week and go somewhere with me would you yes amused and more than a little surprised he looked at her just like that i might ask where when the time comes so id know whether to pack a fur coat or a bikini she took the pearls from him to set them on the bedside table they should be in a safe im sleeping with a cop her voice was light but she saw him brooding and thought she understood where his thoughts had taken him ben it will be over soon yeah but when he brought her close when he began to fill himself with her he was afraid it was november twentyeighth chapter you dont step foot out of the apartment until i give you the okay absolutely not tess agreed while ben watched her pin up her hair i have enough work at home to keep me chained to my desk all day you dont even take out the garbage not even if the neighbors write up a petition tess i want you to take this seriously i am taking it seriously she chose ribbed gold triangles and clipped them to her ears im not going to be alone for a minute today officer pilomento will be here at eight ben looked at the dovegray slacks and soft cowlnecked sweater she wore is that who youre getting all dressed up for of course when he came to stand behind her she smiled at their twin reflections ive developed a penchant for the police lately it has all the earmarks of becoming an obsession is that right he bent to brush his lips over the back of her neck im afraid so he dropped his hands to her shoulders wanting to remain close touching worried about it no still smiling she turned into his arms im not worried a bit not about that or anything else because there was a frown between his brows tess lifted a ringer to smooth it away i wish you werent its my job to worry for a moment he just held her knowing it was going to be hard unreasonably hard to walk out the door that morning and trust her to someone elses care pilomentos a good man he told her as much to appease himself as her hes young but hes bythebook nobodys going to get in the door while hes here i know come on lets have some coffee youve only got a few more minutes lowenstein relieves him at four as they walked into the kitchen he ran over the schedule though they both knew every move shes the best she might look like a nice suburban wife but theres nobody id rather have backing me up in a hairy situation i wont be alone at all tess took down two mugs cops will still be taking shifts on the third floor the phones wired therell be a unit parked across the street at all times it wont be a black and white if he makes his move we dont want to scare him off bigsby roderick and mullendore will switch off with ed and me on surveillance ben im not worried after handing him his coffee she took his arm to walk to the dining room table ive thought this through believe me ive thought this through nothing can happen to me as long as im inside and inaccessible he wont know youre being guarded when i return at midnight ill come in the back and use the stairs he has to make his move tonight that im sure of when he does youll be there i appreciate the confidence but i tell you id feel a little less edgy if you were a little more so look no grandstanding he took her arm for emphasis before she could lift the coffee when weve got him he goes back to the station for interrogation you dont ben you know how important it is to me to talk to him to try to get through no you can only block me on this so long as long as it takes tess backed off and tried another tack one that had woken her in the early hours and kept her awake ben i think you understand this man better than you know you know what it is to lose someone whos an intricate part of your life you lost josh he lost his laura we dont know who she was but we can be sure that she mattered a great deal to him you told me that when you lost josh you considered killing his doctor wait she said before he could speak you wanted to blame someone to hurt someone if you hadnt been a strong man emotionally you might very well have done so still the resentment and the pain stayed with you the words and the truth behind them made him uncomfortable maybe they did but i didnt start killing people no you became a cop maybe part of the reason you did was because of josh because you needed to find answers to make things right youre healthy selfconfident and were able to turn what might have been the biggest tragedy in your life into something constructive but if you werent healthy ben if you didnt have a strong selfimage a strong sense of right and wrong something might have cracked inside you when josh died you lost your faith i think he lost his over laura we dont know how long ago it might have been a year five years twenty but hes picked up the pieces of his faith and put them back together only the pieces arent fitting true the edges are jagged he kills sacrifices to save laura lauras soul what you told me last night made me wonder perhaps she died in what the church considers mortal sin and was refused absolution hes been taught all of his life to believe that without absolution the soul is lost in his psychosis he murders sacrifices women who remind him of laura but he still saves their souls everything you say may be right none of it changes the fact that hes killed four women and is aiming for you black and white ben sometimes thats all there is it frustrated him more because he was beginning to understand even to feel some of what she was saying he wanted to continue to look at it straighton without any angles dont you believe that some people are just born evil does a man tell his wife hes going out to hunt humans then drive to the local mcdonalds and shoot kids because his mother beat him when he was six does a man use a college campus for target practice because his father cheated on his mother no but this man isnt the kind of mass murderer youre talking about she was on her own ground here and knew her steps he isnt killing randomly and motivelessly an abused child is as likely to become a bank president as a psychotic and neither do i believe in the bad seed were talking about an illness ben something more and more doctors are coming to believe is caused by a chemical reaction in the brain that destroys rational thought weve come a long way since the days of demon possession but even sixty years ago schizophrenia was treated by tooth extraction then it was injections of horse serum enemas and in the last quarter of the twentieth century were still groping whatever triggered his psychosis he needs help the way josh did the way joey did not for the first twentyfour hours he said flatly and not until the paperwork clears he might not want to see you ive thought of that but i believe he will none of this matters until we get him when the knock came bens hand reached slowly for his weapon his arm was still stiff but usable hed have no problem holding his police special he moved toward the door but stood beside it you ask who it is as she started to move forward he held up a hand no ask from over there you dont stand in front of the door though he doubted the means would change from amice to bullet he wasnt taking chances who is it detective pilomento maam recognizing the voice ben turned and pulled the door open paris pilomento knocked snow from his shoes before he stepped inside the roads are still a mess we got about six inches morning dr court good morning let me take your coat thanks freezing out there he said to ben mullendores in position out front hope he wore his long underwear dont get too comfortable watching game shows ben reached for his own coat as he took a last look around the room there was only one entrance and pilomento would never be more than about twentyfive feet from her still even as he bundled into his coat he didnt feel warm ill be in periodic contact with the surveillance teams now why dont you go into the kitchen and pour yourself some coffee thanks i just had one in the car on the way over have another oh he looked from ben to tess yeah sure whistling between his teeth he walked off that was rude but i dont mind with a low laugh tess slipped her arms around bens waist be careful i make a habit of it see that you do he drew her close and the kiss was long and lingering you going to wait up for me doc count on it youll call if well if anything happens count on it taking her face in his hands he held it a moment then pressed a kiss to her forehead youre so lovely it was the quick surprise in her eyes that made him realize that he hadnt made use of all his clever and slick compliments with her as he had with other women the realization caught him off balance to cover it he tucked her hair behind her ear then backed away lock the door he pulled it shut behind him wishing he could shake the uneasy feeling that things werent going to go as neatly as planned hours later he was huddled inside the mustang watching tesss building two kids were putting the finishing touches on an elaborate snowman ben wondered if their father knew theyd copped his fedora the day had gone even slower than hed imagined daysre getting shorter ed commented sprawled in the passengers seat he was warm as a bear in a union suit corduroys flannel shirt sweater and an ll bean parka the cold had long since numbed its way through bens boots theres pilomento the detective came out of the building paused only a heartbeat on the sidewalk and flipped up the collar of his coat it was the signal that lowenstein was inside and things were tight bens muscles relaxed only fractionally shes fine you know ed stretched a bit and began isometric exercises to keep his legs from cramping lowensteins mean enough to hold off an army he isnt going to move until dark because his face froze if he cracked the window for too long ben substituted a milky way for the cigarette he wanted you know what that sugars doing to the enamel of your teeth never one to give up the battle ed drew out a small plastic container inside was a homemade snack of raisins dates unsalted nuts and wheat germ hed made enough for two you gotta start reeducating your appetite ben took a large deliberate bite of his candy bar when roderick relieves us were stopping by the burger king on the way in im getting a whopper please not while im eating if roderick bigsby and half the station had a proper diet they wouldnt have been down with the flu i didnt get sick ben said over a mouthful of chocolate blind luck by the time you hit forty your systems going to revolt it wont be pretty whats this ed sat up straight as he watched the man across the street his long black coat was buttoned high he walked slowly too slowly too cautiously both detectives had one hand on their weapons and one on the door handles when the man suddenly broke into a run ben had already pushed the car door open when the man scooped up one of the little girls playing in the snow and tossed her high she let out a quick ringing laugh and called out daddy as the breath pushed out of his body ben sat back down feeling foolish he turned to ed youre as jumpy as i am i like her im glad you decided to risk eating turkey with her granddaddy i told her about josh eds brows lifted disappearing into the seamans cap hed pulled over his head that he knew was more of a commitment than even hed believed ben could make and and i guess im glad i did shes the best thing thats happened in my life god that sounds corny yeah content ed began to munch a date people in love tend to be corny i didnt say i was in love that came out quickly the reflex action on the trap door i just mean shes special certain people have difficulty admitting to emotional commitment because they fear failing in the long haul the word love becomes a stumbling block that once uttered is like a lock blocking off their privacy their singleness and obliging them to perceive themselves as one half of a couple ben tossed the candy wrapper on the floor redbook no i made it up maybe i should write an article look if i was in love with tess with anybody i wouldnt have any trouble saying it so are you i care about her a lot euphemism shes important to me evasions okay im crazy about her not quite there paris this time he did crack the window and pull out a cigarette all right so im in love with her happy now have a date youll feel better he swore then heard himself laugh tossing out the cigarette he bit into the date ed handed him youre worse than my mother thats what partners are for inside tesss apartment time went just as slowly at seven she and lowenstein shared a supper of canned soup and roast beef sandwiches for all her talk about not being worried tess managed to do little more than stir the chunks of beef and vegetables around in her bowl it was a cold miserable night no one who didnt have to would want to be out in it but the fact that she couldnt move beyond her own door left her with a feeling of being caged you play canasta lowenstein asked im sorry what canasta lowenstein glanced at her own watch and figured her husband would be giving their youngest a bath roderick would be in position out front ben and ed would be sweeping the area before they returned to the station and her oldest daughter would be complaining about being stuck with the dishes im being lousy company lowenstein set half a sandwich back on the pale green glass plate shed admired youre not supposed to entertain me dr court but tess pushed her plate aside and made the effort you have a family dont you a mob actually its not easy is it managing a demanding career and taking care of a family ive always thrived on complications i admire that ive always avoided them can i ask you a personal question okay if i can ask you one afterward fair enough with her elbows on the table tess leaned forward does your husband find it difficult being married to someone whose job is not only demanding but potentially dangerous i guess its not easy i know its not lowenstein corrected she took a pull from the diet pepsi tess had served in thin scrolled glasses lowenstein would have kept on display weve had to work through a lot of it a couple of years ago we had a trial separation it lasted thirtyfourandahalf hours the bottom line is were nuts about each other that usually cuts through everything else youre lucky i know even when i feel like pushing his head in the toilet i know my turn all right lowenstein gave her a long measuring look where do you get your clothes she was only too surprised to laugh for a few seconds for the first time all day tess relaxed outside roderick and a stocky black detective known as pudge shared a thermos of coffee a bit cranky with a head cold pudge shifted every few minutes and complained i dont think were going to see a sign of this dude mullendores got the late shift if anyone makes the collar itll be him well just sit here freezing our asses off it has to be tonight roderick poured pudge another cup of coffee before going back to study tesss windows why pudge let out a huge yawn and cursed the antihistamines that left his nose and his mind clogged because it was meant to be tonight christ roderick no matter what shitshoveling duty you pull you never complain on another yawn pudge slumped against the door god i can hardly keep my eyes open goddamn medication whips you roderick took another sweep of the street up then down no one stirred why dont you sleep awhile ill watch predate it already half there pudge closed his eyes just give me ten lou mullendore takes it in an hour anyway with his partner snoring lightly roderick kept watch tess was learning the fine points of canasta from lowenstein when the phone rang the relaxed girl talk ended with a snap okay you answer it if its him keep calm stall if you can agree to meet him if you have to see if you can pin him down to a location all right though her throat dried up tess picked up the receiver and spoke naturally dr court doctor this is detective roderick oh detective her muscles went limp as she turned and shook her head at lowenstein yes is there any news weve got him dr court ben picked him up less than two blocks from your building ben is he all right yes dont worry its nothing serious he wrenched his shoulder some during the arrest he asked me to call you and let you know you can relax eds taking him to the hospital hospital she remembered the tray with the bloodsoaked bandages which one i want to go hes being taken to georgetown doctor but he didnt want you to bother no its no bother ill leave right away remembering the woman breathing down her neck tess turned to lowenstein you should talk to detective lowenstein i appreciate you calling were all just glad its over yes she squeezed her eyes shut a moment then handed the phone to lowenstein hes been caught then she dashed into the bedroom for her purse and car keys when she hurried back in for her coat lowenstein was still pulling details out of roderick impatient tess tossed her coat over her arm and waited sounds like a clean collar lowenstein said when she hung up ben and ed decided to do a few more sweeps of the area and saw this guy come out of an alley and head toward your building he had his coat open they could see he was wearing a cassock he didnt protest when they stopped him but when ben found the amice in his pocket he apparently lost it started fighting and calling for you oh god she wanted to see him talk to him but ben was on his way to the hospital and ben came first lou said ben got a little banged up doesnt sound serious ill feel better when i see for myself i know what you mean do you want me to take you to the hospital no im sure you want to get back to the station and tie up the loose ends it doesnt look as though i need police protection any longer no but ill walk you down to your car anyway tell ben i said good work as ben crossed the parking lot to the station house logan pulled in behind him and hurried out of his car ben hatless gloveless dressed as he rarely was in a cassock he caught up with them on the steps i was hoping id find you here not a good night for priests to go walking around tim we got a lot of nervous cops out tonight you could find yourself cuffed i was saying late mass for the sisters and didnt have time to change i think i have something inside ed said pushing open the door your fingers are going to fall off i was in such a hurry absently logan began to rub his fingers together for warmth for days ive been going over everything i knew you were fixed on the use of the name reverend francis moore and were checking it out but i couldnt get my mind off the frank moore id known at the seminary were still digging there impatient ben looked at his watch i know but i was with him you see i knew that he bordered between being a saint and a fanatic then i remembered a seminarian whod been under him and had left after a celebrated row with moore i remembered him because the young man had gone on to become a wellknown writer stephen mathias ive heard of him as excitement began to drum ben edged closer you think mathias no no frustrated by his inability to speak quickly or coherently enough logan took a deep breath i didnt even know mathias personally since i was already established in the university when all that went on but i remembered the gossip that there was nothing and no one mathias didnt know about in the seminary in fact he used plenty of inside stuff for his first couple of books the more i thought about that the more things clicked and i remembered reading one novel in particular that mentioned a young student who had suffered a breakdown and had left the seminary after his sister his twin sister had died as the result of an illegal abortion apparently there was a tremendous scandal it was discovered that the boys mother was confined to an institution and that he had been treated himself for schizophrenia lets track down mathias ben was already heading down the hall when logan stopped him ive already done that it only took me a few calls to locate him hes living in connecticut and he remembered the incident perfectly the seminarian had been unusually devout as devout to moore as he was to the church in fact he served as his secretary mathias said his name was louis roderick it was possible for the blood to freeze for the heart to stop pumping and for the body to remain alive are you sure yes mathias was positive but when i asked he went back through his old notes and checked on it hes willing to come down and give you a description with that and a name you should be able to find him i know where he is ben spun around into the squad room and grabbed the first phone he reached you know him logan grabbed on to ed before he lost him as well hes a cop hes one of us and right now hes heading up the outside surveillance on tesss building sweet god as the room in front of him humped into action logan began to pray units were dispatched to rodericks address others to back up tesss apartment logan was on bens heels as they headed to the door i want to go with you this is police business seeing a priest might calm him dont get in the way they hit the glass door and nearly ran over lowenstein what the hells going on here half wild with fear ben caught her by the collar of her coat why arent you with her why did you leave her alone whats wrong with you once lou called to verify it had gone down there was no reason for me to hang around when did he call twenty minutes ago but he said you were on your way though her mind rejected it the expression on bens face told her everything oh god not lou but hes a cop a friend lowenstein kicked herself back he called twenty minutes ago telling me there had been a clean arrest and to pull off the guard and come in i never questioned it god ben i never thought to verify with headquarters it was lou weve got to find him she grabbed bens arm before he could push past her georgetown hospital he told her youd been taken to emergency nothing else was needed to have him streaking down the steps to his car tess pulled up in the parking lot after a frustrating twentyminute drive the roads were all but clear but that hadnt stopped the fender benders she told herself the good part was that ben was already fixed up and waiting and it was over slamming her door she dropped her keys into her pocket on the way home they were going to pick up a bottle of champagne two bottles she corrected then they were going to spend the rest of the weekend in bed drinking them the idea was so pleasant she didnt notice the figure melt out of the shadows and into the light dr court alarm came first with her hand flying up to her throat then with a laugh she lowered it and started forward detective roderick i didnt know youd the light glinted on the white clerical collar at his throat it was like the dream she thought in a moment of blank panic when shed thought herself only a step away from safety only to find her worst fears confirmed she knew she could turn and run but he was only an arms span away and would catch her she knew she could scream but she had no doubt hed silence her completely there was only one choice to face him you wanted to talk to me no it wouldnt work she thought desperately not if her voice was shaking not when her head was filled with the rushing echo of her own fear ive wanted to talk to you too ive wanted to help you once i thought you could you had kind eyes when i read your reports i knew you understood i wasnt a murderer then i knew youd been sent to me youd be the last one the most important one you were the only one the voice said by name tell me about the voice lou she wanted to back up just edge back one foot but saw by his eyes that even that small movement would trigger the violence when did you first hear it when i was a boy they said i was crazy like my mother i was afraid so i blocked it out later i realized it was a call from god calling me to the priesthood i was happy to be chosen father moore said only a few are chosen to carry out the lords work to celebrate the sacraments but even the chosen are tempted to sin even the chosen are weak so we sacrifice we do penance he taught me how to train my body to fight off temptation flagellation fasting and one more piece to the puzzle fell into place an emotionally disturbed boy enters the seminary to be trained by an emotionally disturbed man he would kill her following the path he saw laid out for him he would kill her the parking lot was all but empty the doors of the emergency room two hundred yards away how did you feel about becoming a priest lou it was everything my whole life was formed do you understand formed for that purpose but you left it no he lifted his head as if scenting the air as if listening to something only for his ears that was like a blank spot in my life i didnt really exist then a man cant exist without faith a priest cant exist without purpose she saw him reach in his pocket saw the snatch of white in his hand her eyes were almost as wild as his when they met again tell me about laura hed come a step closer but the name stopped him laura did you know laura no i didnt know her he had the amice in both hands now but seemed to have forgotten it treat she told herself to hold back a scream treat talk listen tell me about her she was beautiful beautiful in that fragile way that makes you worry if such things can last my mother worried because laura enjoyed looking at herself in the mirror brushing her hair wearing pretty clothes mother could sense the devil drawing always drawing laura into sin and bad thoughts but laura only laughed and said she didnt care for sackcloth and ashes laura laughed a lot you loved her very much we were twins we shared life before life thats what my mother said we were bound together by god it was for me to keep laura from spurning the church and everything wed been taught it was for me but i failed her how did you fail laura she was only eighteen beautiful delicate but there wasnt any laughter the tears began sobless to glisten on his cheeks shed been weak i hadnt been there for her and shed been weak backstreet abortion gods judgment but why did gods judgment have to be so harsh his breathing quickened and became painfully loud as he pressed a hand to his forehead a life for a life its fair and just a life for a life she begged me not to let her die not to let her die in such sin that would send her to hell i had no power to absolve her even as she lay dying in my arms i had no power the power came later after the despair the dark blank time i can show you i have to show you he stepped forward and even as tesss instincts had her pull back he slipped the scarf around her lou youre a police officer its your job your function to protect protect his fingers trembled on the scarf a policeman hed had to drug pudges coffee it would have been wrong to do more to hurt another officer protect the shepherd protects his flock i didnt protect laura no it was a terrible loss a tragedy but now youve tried to give something back havent you isnt that why you became a police officer to give something back to protect others i had to lie but after laura it didnt seem to matter maybe with the police i could find what id been looking for in the seminary that sense of purpose vocation mans law not gods law yes you swore to uphold the law the voice came back so many years later it was real yes to you it was real it isnt always inside my head sometimes its a whisper in the other room or it comes like thunder from the ceiling over my bed it told me how to save laura and myself were bound together weve always been bound together her hands clenched over the keys in her pocket she knew if the scarf tightened she would use them to gouge his eyes for survival the need to live surged through her i will absolve you from sin he murmured and you will see god taking a life is a sin he hesitated a life for a life a holy sacrifice the pain rushed through his voice taking a life is a sin she repeated as the blood pounded in her ears to kill breaks gods law and mans you understand both laws as a police officer as a priest when she heard the siren her first thought was that it was an ambulance coming into emergency she wouldnt be alone she didnt take her eyes from his i can help you help me it was only a whisper part question part plea yes though it trembled she lifted her hand and placed it on his her fingers brushed over the silk doors slammed behind them but neither of them moved get your hands off her roderick take your hands off her and move aside keeping her fingers around rodericks tess turned to see ben no more than ten feet behind them spreadlegged his gun held in both hands beside him and to the left ed mirrored his position sirens still screamed and lights flashed as cars poured into the lot ben im not hurt but he didnt look at her his eyes never left roderick and in them she saw that core of violence he strapped down she knew if she stepped aside now hed cut it loose ben i said im not hurt he wants help move out of the way if hed been certain roderick wasnt armed he would have rushed forward but tess turned her body and used it as a shield its over ben after a quick hand signal ed walked forward i have to search you lou then i have to cuff you and take you in yes dazed and docile he lifted his arms to make it simpler thats the law doctor yes no ones going to hurt you you have the right to remain silent ed began when hed removed rodericks police issue from under his coat thats all right i understand as ed snapped on the handcuffs rodericks attention focused on logan father did you come to hear my confession yes would you like me to go with you as he spoke logan put his hand over tesss and squeezed yes im so tired you can rest soon come with us now and ill stay with you with his head bowed he began to walk between ed and logan bless me father for i have sinned ben waited until theyd passed him tess stood where she was watching him not certain her legs would carry her if she moved forward she saw him holster his gun before he was across the pavement to her in three strides im all right im all right she repeated over and over as he crushed her against him he wasnt going to go through with it he couldnt ben only drew her away to yank the scarf from around her and toss it in a mound of snow he ran his own hands over her throat to make certain it was unmarked i could have lost you no she pressed herself against him again he knew i think he knew all along i could stop him as tears of relief began she tightened her arms around him the trouble was i didnt ben ive never been so frightened you stood between us and blocked me sniffling she drew away only far enough to find his lips with hers protecting a patient hes not your patient she had to take the chance that her legs would hold her a few minutes longer stepping back she faced him yes he is and as soon as the paperwork clears ill start tests he grabbed her by the front of her coat but when she touched a hand to his face he could only drop his forehead on hers damn you im shaking me too lets go home oh yeah with arms hooked tight around waists they walked to the car she noticed but didnt comment that hed run over the curb inside the car she huddled against him again no one had ever been so solid or so warm he was a cop hes ill tess linked her fingers with his hes been one step ahead of us all along hes been suffering she closed her eyes a moment she was alive this time she hadnt failed im going to be able to help him for a moment he said nothing he would have to live with this her need to give herself to people maybe someday hed come to believe that both the sword and words could bring about justice hey doc mmmm do you remember talking about us getting away for a few days yes sighing she imagined an island with palm trees and fat orange flowers oh yes ive got some time coming how soon do you want me packed he laughed but continued to jiggle the keys nervously in his hand i was thinking we could go down to florida for a while i want you to meet my mother slowly not wanting to take a leap when a step was indicated she lifted her head from his shoulder to look at him then he smiled and his smile told her everything she needed to know id love to meet your mother
