the icedemon clark ashton smith quanga the huntsman with hoom feethos and eibur tsanth two of the most enterprising jewelers of iqqua had crossed the borders of a region into which men went but seldom and wherefrom they returned even more rarely travelling north from iqqua they had passed into desolate mhu thulan where the great glacier of polarion had rolled like a frozen sea upon wealthy and farfamed cities covering the broad isthmus from shore to shore beneath fathoms of perpetual ice the shellshaped domes of cerngoth it was fabled could still be seen deep down in the glaciation and the high keen spires of oggonzhai were embedded therein together with fernpalm and mammoth and the square black temples of the god tsathoggua all this had occurred many centuries ago and still the ice a mighty glittering rampart was moving south upon deserted lands now in the path of the embattled glacier quanga led his companions on a bold quest their object was nothing less than the retrieval of the rubies of king haalor who with the wizard ommumvog and many fullcaparisoned soldiers had gone out five decades before to make war upon the polar ice from this fantastic expedition neither haalor nor ommumvog had come back and the sorry ragged remnant of their menatarms returning to iqqua after two moons had told a dire tale the army they said had made its encampment on a sort of knoll carefully chosen by ommumvog in full sight of the vanward ice then the mighty sorcerer standing with haalor amid a ring of braziers that fumed incessantly with golden smoke and reciting runes that were older than the world had conjured up a fiery orb vaster and redder than the southwardcircling sun of heaven and the orb with blazing beams that smote from the zenith torrid and effulgent had caused the sun to seem no more than a daylight moon and the soldiers had almost swooned from its heat in their heavy panoply but beneath its beams the verges of the glacier melted and ran in swift rills and rivers so that haalor for a time was hopeful of reconquering the realm of mhu thulan over which his forefathers had ruled in bygone ages the rushing waters had deepened flowing past the knoll on which the army waited then as if by a hostile magic the rivers began to give forth a pale and stifling mist that blinded the conjured sun of ommumvog so that its sultry beams grew faint and chill and had power no longer on the ice vainly the wizard had put forth other spells trying to dissipate the deep and gelid fog but the vapor drew down evil and clammy coiling and wreathing like knots of phantom serpents and filling nens marrows as if with the cold of death it covered all the camp a tangible thing ever colder and thicker numbing the limbs of those who groped blindly and could not see the faces of their fellows at armslength a few of the common soldiers somehow reached its outer confines and crept fearfully away beneath the wan sun seeing no longer in the skies the wizard globe that had been called up by ommumvog and looking back presently as they fled in strange terror they beheld instead of the lowlying mist they had thought to see a newly frozen sheet of ice that covered the mound on which the king and the sorcerer had made their encampment the ice rose higher above the ground than a tall mans head and dimly in its glittering depth the fleeing soldiers saw the imprisoned forms of their leaders and companions deeming that this thing was no natural occurrence but a sorcery that had been exerted by the great glacier and that the glacier itself was a live malignant entity with powers of unknown bale they did not slacken their flight and the ice had suffered them to depart in peace as if to give warning of the fate of those who dared to assail it some there were who believed the tale and some who doubted but the kings that ruled in iqqua after haalor went not forth to do battle with the ice and no wizard rose to make war upon it with conjured suns men fled before the everadvancing glaciations and strange legends were told of how people had been overtaken or cut off in lonely valleys by sudden diabolic shiftings of the ice as if it had stretched out a living hand and legends there were of awful crevasses that yawned abruptly and closed like monstrous mouths upon them that dared the frozen waste of winds like the breath of boreal demons that blasted mens flesh with instant utter cold and turned them into statues hard as granite in time the whole region for many miles before the glacier was generally shunned and only the hardiest hunters would follow their quarry into the winterblighted land now it happened that the fearless huntsman iluac the elder brother of quanga had gone into mhu thulan and had pursued an enormous black fox that led him afar on the mighty fields of the icesheet for many leagues he trailed it coming never within bowshot of the beast and at length he came to a great mound on the plain that seemed to mark the position of a buried hill and iluac thought that the fox entered a cavern in the mound so with lifted bow and a poised arrow at the string he went after it into the cavern the place was like a chamber of boreal kings or gods all about him in a dim green light were huge glimmering pillars and giant icicles hung from the roof in the forrn of stalactites the floor sloped downward and iluac came to the caves end without finding any trace of the fox but in the transparent depth of the further wall at the bottom he saw the standing shapes of many men deepfrozen and sealed up as in a tomb with undecaying bodies and fair unshrunken features the men were armed with tall spears and most of them wore the panoply of soldiers but among them in the van there stood a haughty figure attired in the seablue robes of a king and beside him was a bowed ancient who wore the nightblack garb of a sorcerer the robes of the regal figure were heavily sewn with gems that burned like colored stars through the ice and great rubies red as gouts of newly congealing blood were arranged in the lines of a triangle on the bosom forming the royal sign of the kings of iqqua so iluac knew by these tokens that he had found the tomb of haalor and ommumvog and the soldiers with whom they had gone up against the ice in former days overawed by the strangeness of it all and remembering now the old legends iluac lost his courage for the first time and quitted the chamber without delay nowhere could he find the black fox and abandoning the chase he returned southward reaching the lands below the glacier without mishap but he swore later that the ice had changed in a weird maoner while he was following the fox so that he was unsure of his direction for a while after leaving the cavern there were steep ridges and hummocks where none had been before making his return a toilsome journey and the glaciation seemed to extend itself for many miles beyond its former limits and because of these things which he could not explain or understand a curious eery fear was born in the heart of iluac never again did he go back upon the glacier but he told his brother quanga of that which he had found and described the location of the cavernchamber in which king haalor and ommumvog and their menatarms were entombed and soon after this iluac was killed by a white bear on which he had used all his arrows in vain quanga was no less brave than iluac and he did not fear the glacier since he had been upon it many times and had noticed nothing untoward his was a heart that lusted after gain and often he thought of the rubies of haalor locked with the king in eternal ice and it seemed to him that a bold man might recover the rubies so one summer while trading in iqqua with his furs he went to the jewelers bibur tsanth and hoom feethos taking with him a few garnets that he had found in a northern valley while the jewelers were appraising the garnets he spoke idly of the rubies of haalor and inquired craftily as to their value then hearing the great worth of the gems aod noting the greedy interest that was shown by hoom feethos and eibur tsanth he told them the tale he had heard from his brother iluac and offered if they would promise him half the value of the rubies to guide them to the hidden cave the jewelers agreed to this proposition in spite of the hardships of the proposed journey and the difficulty they might afterward encounter in disposing surreptitiously of gems that belonged to the royal family of iqqua and would be claimed by the present king ralour if their discovery were learned the fabulous worth of the rubies had fired their avarice quanga on his part desired the complicity and connivance of the dealers knowing that it would be hard for him to sell the jewels otherwise he did not trust hoom feethos and eibur tsanth and it was for this reason that he required them to go with him to the cavern and pay over to him the agreed sum of money as soon as they were in possession of the treasure the strange trio had set forth in midsummer now after two weeks of journeying through a wild subarctic region they were approaching the confines of the eternal ice they travelled on foot and their supplies were carried by three horses little larger than muskoxen quanga an unerring marksman hunted for their daily food the hares and waterfowl of the country behind thern in a cloudless turquoise heaven there burned the low sun that was said to have described a loftier ecliptic in former ages drifts of unmelting snow were heaped in the shadows of the higher hills and in steep valleys they came upon the vanward glaciers of the icesheet the trees and shrubs were already sparse and stunted in a land where rich forests had flourished in olden time beneath a milder climate but poppies flamed in the meadows and along the slopes spreading their frail beauty like a scarlet rug before the feet of perennial winter and the quiet pools and stagnantflowing streams were lined with white waterlilies a little to the east they saw the fuming of volcanic peaks that still resisted the inroads of the glaciers on the west were high gaunt mountains whose sheer cliffs and pinnacles were topped with snow and around those nether slopes the ice had climbed like an inundating sea before them was the looming crenelated wall oe the realmwide glaciation moving equally on plain and hill uprooting the trees and pressing the soil forward in vast folds and ridges its progress had been stayed a little by the northern summer quanga and the jewelers as they went on came to turbid rills made by a temporary melting that issued from beneath the glittering bluegreen ramparts they left their packhorses in a grassy valley tethered by long cords of elfthong to the dwarfish willows then carrying such provisions and other equipment as they might require for a two days journey they climbed the iceslope at a point selected by quanga as being most readily accessible and started in the direction of the cave that had been found by iluac quanga took his bearings from the position of the volcanic mountains and also from two isolated peaks that rose on the sheeted plain to the north like the breasts of a giantess beneath her shining armor the three were well equipped for all the exigencies of their search quanga carried a curious pickax of finely tempered bronze to be used in disentombing the body of king haalor and he was armed with a short leafshaped sword in addition to his bow and quiver of arrows his garments were made from the fur of a giant bear brownblack in color hoom feethos and eibur tsanth in raiment heavily quilted with eiderdown against the cold followed him complainingly but with avaricious eagerness they had not enjoyed the long marches through a desolate bleakening land nor the rough fare and exposure to the northern elements moreover they had taken a dislike to quanga whom they considered rude and overbearing their grievances were aggravated by the fact that he was now compelling them to carry most of the supplies in addition to the two heavy bags of gold which they were to exchange later for the gems nothing less valuable than the rubies of haalor would have induced them to come so far or to set foot on the formidable wastes of the icesheet the scene before them was like some frozen world of the outer void vast unbroken save for a few scattered mounds and ridges the plain extended to the white horizon and its armored peaks nothing seemed to live or move on the awful glistening vistas whose nearer levels were swept clean of snow the sun appeared to grow pale and chill and to recede behind the adventurers and a wind blew upon them from the ice like a breath from abysses beyond the pole apart from the boreal desolation and drearness however there was nothing to dismay quanga or his companions none of them was superstitious and they deemed that the old tales were idle myths were no more than fearborn delusions quanga smiled commiseratively at the thought of his brother iluac who had been so oddly frightened and had fancied such extraordinary things after the finding of haalor it was a singular weakness in iluac the rash and almost foolhardy hunter who had feared neither man nor beast as to the trapping of haalor and ommumvog and their army in the glacier it was plain that they had allowed themselves to be overtaken by the winter storms and the few survivors mentally unhinged by their hardships had told a wild story ice even though it had conquered half of a continent was merely ice and its workings conformed invariably to certain natural laws iluac had said that the icesheet was a great demon cruel greedy and loth to give up that which it had taken but such beliefs were crude and primitive superstitions not to be entertained by enlightened minds of the pieistocene age they had climbed the rampart at an early hour of morning quanga assured the jewelers that they would reach the cavern by noon at the latest even if there should be a certain amount of difficulty and delay in locating it the plain before them was remarkably free of crevasses and there was little to obstruct their advance steering their way with the two breastshaped mountains for landmarks before them they come after three hours to a hilllike elevation that corresponded to the mound of iluacs story with little trouble they found the opening of the deep chamber it seemed that the place had changed little if at all since the visit of iluac for the interior with its columns and pendant icicles conformed closely to his description the entrance was like a fanged maw within the floor sloped downward at a slippery angle for more than a hundred feet the chamber swam with a cold and glaucous translucency that filtered through the domelike roof at the lower end in the striated wall quanga and the jewelers saw the embedded shapes of a number of men among which they distinguished easily the tall blueclad corpse of king haalor and the dark bowed mummy of ommumvog behind these the shapes of others lifting their serried spears eternally and receding downward in stiff ranks through unfathomable depths were faintly discernible haalor stood regal and erect with wideopen eyes that stared haughtily as in life upon his bosom the triangle of hot and bloodbright rubies smouldered unquenchably in the glacial gloom and the colder eyes of topazes of beryls of diamonds of chrysolites gleamed and twinkled from his azure raiment it seemed that the fabulous gems were separated by no more than a foot or two of ice from the greedy fingers of the hunter and his companions without speaking they stared raptly at the farsought treasure apart from the great rubies the jewelers were also estimating the value of the other gems worn by haalor these alone they thought complacently would have made it worth while to endure the fatigue of the journey and the insolence of quanga the hunter on his part was wishing that he had driven an even steeper bargain the two bags of gold however would make him a wealthy man he could drink to his full content the costly wines redder than the rubies that came from far uzuldaroum in the south the tawny slanteyed girls of iqqua would dance at his bidding and he could gamble for high stakes all three were unmindful of the eeriness of their situation alone in that boreal solitude with the frozen dead and they were oblivious likewise to the ghoulish nature of the robbery they were about to commit without waiting to be urged by his companions quanga raised the keen and highly tempered pick of bronze and began to assail the translucent wall with mighty blows the ice rang shrilly beneath the pick and dropped away in crystal splinters and diamond lumps in a few minutes he had made a large cavity and only a thin shell cracked and shattering remained before the body of haalor this shell quanga proceeded to pry off with great care and soon the triangle of monstrous rubies more or less encrusted still with clinging ice lay bare to his fingers while the proud bleak eyes of haalor stared immovably upon him from behind their glassy mask the hunter dropped the pick and drawing his sharp leafshaped sword from its scabbard he began to sever the fine silver wires by which the rubies were attached cunningly to the kings raiment in his haste he ripped away portions of the seablue fabric baring the frozen and deadwhite flesh beneath one by one as he removed the rubies he gave them to hoom feethos standing close behind him and the dealer brighteyed with avarice drooling a little with ecstasy stored them carefully in a huge pouch of mottled lizardskin that he had brought along for the purpose the last ruby had been secured and quanga was about to turn his attention to the lesser jewels that adorned the kings garments in curious patterns and signs of astrological or hieratic significance then amid their preoccupation he and hoom feethos were startled by a loud and splintering crash that ended with myriad tinklings as of broken glass turning they saw that a huge icicle had fallen from the caverndome and its point as if aimed unerringly had cloven the skull of eibur tsanth who lay amid the debris of shattered ice with the sharp end of the fragment deeply embedded in his oozing brain he had died instantly without knowledge of his doom the accident it seemed was a perfectly natural one such as might occur in summer from a slight melting of the immense pendant but amid their consternation quanga and hoom feethos were compelled to take note of certain circumstances that were far from normal or explicable during the removal of the rubies on which their attention had been centered so exclusively the chamber had narrowed to half of its former width and had also closed down from above till the hanging icicles were almost upon them like the champing teeth of some tremendous mouth the place had darkened and the light was such as might filter into arctic seas beneath heavy floes the incline of the cave had grown steeper as if it were pitching into bottomless depths far up incredibly far the two men beheld the tiny entrance which seemed no bigger than the mouth of a foxs hole for an instant they were stupefied the changes of the cavern could admit of no natural explanation and the hyperboreans felt the clammy surge of all the superstitious terrors that they had formerly disclaimed no longer could they deny the conscious animate malevolence the diabolic powers of bale imputed to the ice in old legends realizing their peril and spurred by a wild panic they started to climb the incline hoom feethos retained the bulging pouch of rubies as well as the heavy bag of gold coins that hung from his girdle and quanga had enough presence of mind to keep his sword and pickax in their terrordriven haste however both forgot the second bag of gold which lay beside eibur tsanth under the debris of the shattered pendant the supernatural narrowing of the cave the dreadful and sinister closingdown of its roof had apparently ceased at any rate the hyperboreans could detect no visible continuation of the process as they climbed frantically and precariously toward the opening they were forced to stoop in many places to avoid the mighty fangs that threatened to descend upon them and even with the rough tigerskin buskins that they wore it was hard to keep their footing on the terrible slope sometimes they pulled themselves up by means of the slippery pillarlike formations and often quanga who led the way was compelled to hew hasty steps in the incline with his pick hoom feethos was too terrified for even the most rudimentary reflection but quanga as he climbed was considering the monstrous alterations of the cave which he could not aline with his wide and various experience of the phenomena of nature he tried to convince himself that he had made a singular error in estimating the chambers dimensions and the inclination of its fioor the effort was useless he still found himself confronted by a thing that outraged his reason a thing that distorted the known face of the world with unearthly hideous madness and mingled a malign chaos with its ordered workings after an ascent that was frightfully prolonged like the effort to escape from some delirious tedious nightmare predicament they neared the cavernmouth there was barely room now for a man to creep on his belly beneath the sharp and ponderous teeth quanga feeling that the fangs might close upon him like those of some great monster hurled himself forward and started to wriggle through the opening with a most unheroic celerity something held him back and he thought for one moment of stark horror that his worst apprehensions were being realized then he found that his bow and quiver of arrows which he had forgotten to remove from his shoulders were caught against the pendant ice while hoom feethos gibbered in a frenzy of fear and impatience he crawled back and relieved himself of the impeding weapons which he thrust before him together with his pick in a second and more successful attempt to pass through the strait opening rising to his feet on the open glacier he heard a wild cry from hoom feethos who trying to follow quanga had become tightly wedged in the entrance through his greater girth his right hand clutching the pouch of rubies was thrust forward beyond the threshold of the cave he howled incessantly with halfcoherent protestations that the cruel iceteeth were crunching him to death in spite of the eery terrors that had unmanned him the hunter still retained enough courage to go back and try to assist hoom feethos he was about to assail the huge icicles with his pick when he heard an agonizing scream from the jeweler followed by a harsh and indescribable grating there had been no visible movement of the fangs and yet quanga now saw that they had reached the cavernfloor the body of hoom feethos pierced through and through by one of the icicles and ground down by the blunter teeth was spurting blood on the glacier like the red mist from a winepress quanga doubted the very testimony of his senses the thing before him was patently impossible there was no mark of cleavage in the mound above the cavernmouth to explain the descent of those awful fangs before his very eyes but too swiftly for direct cognition this unthinkable enormity had occurred hoom feethos was beyond all earthly help and quanga now wholly the slave of a hideous panic would hardly have stayed longer to assist him in any case but seeing the pouch that had fallen forward from the dead jewelers fingers the hunter snatched it up through an impulse of terrormingled greed and then with no backward glance he fled on the glacier toward the lowcircling sun for a few moments as he ran quanga failed to perceive the sinister and illboding alterations comparable to those of the cave whicb had somehow occurred in the sheeted plain itself with a terrific shock which became an actual vertigo he saw that he was climbing a long insanely tilted slope above whose remote extreme the sun had receded strangely and was now small and chill as if seen from an outer planet the very sky was different though still perfectly cloudless it had taken on a curious deathly pallor a brooding sense of inimical volition a vast and freezing malignity seemed to pervade the air and to settle upon quanga like an incubus but more terrifying than all else in its proof of a conscious and malign derangement of natural law was the giddy poleward inclination that had been assumed by the level plateau quanga felt that creation itself had gone mad and had left him at the mercy of demoniacal forces from the godless outer gulfs keeping a perilous foothold weaving and staggering laboriously upward he feared momently that he would slip and fall and slide back for ever into arctic depths unfathomable and yet when he dared to pause at last and turned shudderingly to peer down at the supposed descent he saw behind him an acclivity similar in all respects to the one he was climbing a mad oblique wall of ice that rose interminably to a second remote sun in the confusion of that strange bouleversement he seemed to lose the last remnant of equilibrium and the glacier reeled and pitched about him like an overturning world as he strove to recover the sense of direction that had never before deserted him everywhere it appeared there were small and wan parhelia that mocked him above unending glacial scarps he resumed his hopeless climb through a topsyturvy world of illusion whether north south east or west he could not tell a sudden wind swept downward on the glacier it shrieked in quangas ears like the myriad voices of taunting devils it moaned and laughed and ululated with shrill notes as of crackling ice it seemed to pluck at quanga with live malicious fingers to suck the breath for which he had fought agonizingly in spite of his heavy raiment and the speed of his toilsome ascent he felt its bitter mordant teeth searching and biting even to the marrow dimly as he continued to climb upward he saw that the ice was no longer smooth but had risen into pillars and pyramids around him or was fretted obscenely into wilder shapes immense malignant profiles leered in bluegreen crystal the malformed heads of bestial devils frowned and rearing dragons writhed immovably along the scarp or sank frozen into deep crevasses apart from these imaginary forms that were assumed by the ice itself quanga saw or believed that he saw human bodies and faces embedded in the glacier pale hands appeared to reach dimly and imploringly toward him from the depths and he felt upon him the frostbound eyes of men who had been lost in former years and beheld their sunken limbs grown rigid in strange attitudes of torture quanga was no longer capable of thought deaf blind primordial terrors older than reason had filled his mind with their atavistic darkness they drove him on implacably as a beast is driven and would not let him pause or flag on the mocking nightmare slope reflection would have told him only that his ultimate escape was impossible that the ice a live and conscious and maleficent thing was merely playing a cruel and fantastic game which it had somehow devised in its incredible animism so perhaps it was well that he had lost the power of reflection beyond hope and without warning he came to the end of the glaciation it was like the sudden shift of a dream which takes the dreamer unaware and he stared uncomprehendingly for some moments at the familiar hyperborean valleys below the rampart to the south and the volcanoes that fumed darkly beyond the southeastern hills his flight from the cavern had consumed almost the whole of the long subpolar afternoon and the sun was now swinging close above the horizon the parhelia had vanished and the icesheet as if by some prodigious legerdemain had resumed its normal horizontality if he had been able to compare his impressions quanga would have realized that at no time had he surprised the glacier in the accomplishment of its bewildering supernatural changes doubtfully as if it were a mirage that might fade at any moment he surveyed the landscape below the battlements to all appearances he had returned to the very place from which he and the jewelers had begun their disastrous journey on the ice before him an easy declivity fretted and runneled ran down toward the grassy meadows fearing that it was all deceitful and unreal a fair beguiling trap a new treachery of the element that he had grown to regard as a cruel and almighty demon quanga descended the slope with hasty leaps and bounds even when he stood ankledeep in the great clubmosses with leafy willows and sedgy grasses about him he could not quite believe in the verity of his escape the mindless prompting of a panic fear still drove him on and a primal instinct equally mindless drew him toward the volcanic peaks the instinct told him that he would find refuge from the bitter boreal cold amid their purlieus and there if anywhere he would be safe from the diabolical machinations of the glacier boiling springs were said to flow perpetually from the nether slopes of these mountains great geysers roaring and hissing like infernal cauldrons filled the higher gullies with scalding cataracts the long snows that swept upon hyperborea were turned to mild rains in the vicinity of the volcanoes and there a rich and sultrycolored flora formerly native to the whole region but now exotic flourished throughout the seasons quanga could not find the little shaggy horses that he and his companions had left tethered to the dwarf willows in the valleymeadow perhaps after all it was not the same valley at any rate he did not stay his flight to search for them without delay or lingering after one fearful backward look at the menacing mass of the glaciation he started off in a direct line for the smokeplumed mountains the sun sank lower skirting endlessly the southwestern horizon and flooding the battlemented ice and the rolling landscape with a light of pale amethyst quanga with iron thews inured to protracted marches pressed on in his unremitting terror and was overtaken gradually by a long etherealtinted twilight of northern summer somehow through all the stages of his flight he had retained the pickax as well as his bow and arrows automatically hours before he had placed the heavy pouch of rubies in the bosorn of his raiment for safekeeping he had forgotten them and he did not even notice the trickle of water from the melting of crusted ice about the jewels that seeped upon his flesh from the lizardskin pouch crossing one of the innumerable valleys he stumbled against a protruding willowroot and the pick was hurled from his fingers as he fell rising to his feet he ran on without stopping to retrieve it a ruddy glow from the volcanoes was now visible on the darkening sky it brightened as quanga went on and he felt that he was nearing the farsought inviolable sanctuary though still thoroughly shaken and demoralized by his preterhuman ordeals he began to think that he might escape from the icedemon after all suddenly he became aware of a consuming thirst to which he had been oblivious heretofore daring to pause in one of the shallow valleys he drank from a blossombordered stream then beneath the crushing load of an unconsciously accumulated fatigue he flung himself down to rest for a little while among the bloodred poppies that were purple with twilight sleep fell like a soft and overwhelming snow upon his eyelids but was soon broken by evil dreams in which he still fled vainly from the mocking and inexorable glacier he awoke in a cold horror sweating and shivering and found himself staring at the northern sky where a delicate flush was dying slowly it seemed to him that a great shadow malign and massive aod somehow solid was moving upon the horizon and striding over the low hills toward the valley in which he lay it came with inexpressible speed and the last light appeared to fall from the heavens chill as a reflection caught in ice he started to his feet with the stiffness of prolonged exhaustion in all his body and the nightmare stupefaction of slumber still mingling with his halfawakened fears in this state with a mad momentary defiance he unslung his bow and discharged arrow after arrow emptying his quiver at the huge and bleak and formless shadow that seemed to impend before him on the sky having done this he resumed his headlong flight even as he ran he shivered uncontrollably with the sudden and intense cold that had filled the valley vaguely with an access of fear he felt that there was something unwholesome and unnatural about the cold something that did not belong to the place or the season the glowing volcanoes were quite near and soon he would reach their outlying hills the air about him should be temperate even if not actually warm all at once the air darkened before him with a sourceless bluegreen glimmering in its depths for a moment he saw the featureless shadow that rose gigantically upon his path and obscured the very stars and the glare of the volcanoes then with the swirling of a tempestdriven vapor it closed about him gelid and relentless it was like phantom ice a thing that blinded his eyes and stifled his breath as if he were buried in some glacial tomb it was cold with a transarctic rigor such as he had never known that ached unbearably in all his flesh and was followed by a swiftly spreading numbness dimly he heard a sound as of clashing icicles a grinding as of heavy floes in the bluegreen gloom that tightened and thickened around him it was as if the soul of the glacier malign and implacable had overtaken him in his flight at times he struggled numbly in halfdrowsy terror with some obscure impulse as if to propitiate a vengeful deity he took the pouch of rubies from his bosom with prolonged and painful effort aod tried to hurl it away the thongs that tied the pouch were loosened by its fall and quanga heard faintly as if from a great distance the tinkle of the rubies as they rolled and scattered on some hard surface then oblivion deepened about him and he fell forward stiffly without knowing that he had fallen morning found him beside a little stream starkfrozen and lying on his face in a circle of poppies that had been blackened as if by the footprint of some gigantic demon of frost a nearby pool formed by the leisurely rill was covered with thin ice and on the ice like gouts of frozen blood there lay the scattered rubies of haalor in its own time the great glacier moving slowly and irresistibly southward would reclaim them
