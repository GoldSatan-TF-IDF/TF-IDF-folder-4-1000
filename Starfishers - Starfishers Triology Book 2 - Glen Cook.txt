disposable they were as brilliant and ephemeral as the butterflies of old earth one day someone on the marches of science might burst the pale and wrest from nature a golden universerocking secret a bold naval officer might shatter the moments enemy either could be a hero a legend for a fleeting hour and then he would become one with the dust of sumer and akkad who remembered on the seventh day who remembered jupp von drachaus raid in the hell stars mention his name blank stares would turn your way or someone would say assuming memory hes too old meaning too long gone von drachau had been relegated to the historical toy box with the caesars bonapartes and hitlers half a year confederation standard had passed the now people had abandoned him the yesterday people the archaicists would not pick him up for a hundred years luckily benrabi thought jupp did not need the adulation the now people the downplanet people who rode the screaming rockets of technological and social change bought their values plasticpacked to be disposed when their usefulness was done benrabi found no satisfaction in that he could hold on to nothing long enough to wear the rough edges off to make it comfortable with time like an old couch after years of use he thought those things as toolcase in hand he wandered toward the gate of carsons blake city spaceport the name he wore felt a size too small yet it could become a burden heavier than the cross the christian god had borne he was going to hate this he loathed pipes and plumbing he wore a unionprescribed commercial spacer liquids transfer systems technicians uniform it consisted of tight dull grey coveralls with green and yellow piping his sleeves boasted three red hashmarks where servicemen wore chevrons they indicated that his union rated him a master he did have the training though his acquisition of it lay nearly forgotten amid that of countless exotic skills his teachingcouch days seemed part of another age still in his thirties he felt the weight of a thousand years lifetimes worth of knowledge had been pressureinjected into his skull and the education would never end the bureau was his surrogate mother father and wife it insisted he be ready for anything just in case the bureau was a family without love it left him with dissatisfactions that could easily grow into hatreds the things they did to him they never justified they never explained but lately he had been dissatisfied with everything the image of the gun had become merciless he had developed a crying socket of soulneed into which nothing seemed to fit and there were the aches and pains he hurt within him he bore a second set of nerves they had implanted a complete instel radio powered by bioelectricity a small dying pain surrounded a knot behind his left ear that was the largest lump of the radio he had other pains his ulcer a little finger he had bruised playing handball a hint of the headache that had been with him most of his life each slow step drove spikes of agony up the bones of his legs they had been lengthened six centimeters hastily his arm bones felt no better the skin on his stomach itched where they had trimmed off twenty pounds his fingers toes and eyes itched too his fingerprints toeprints and retinal patterns had been too quickly changed carsons was as back of beyond a world as he had ever seen the damned ulcer the fastpush to carsons had reawakened it it was a hurryup job from the go but then they all were how long had it been since he had had time to catch his breath to relax play with his collections or just loaf around that house he owned unshared on the quiet government retirement planet called refuge or to tinker with his literary opus all who were before me in jerusalem there was no time to loaf nor to plan operations in advance in a rush of maddening changes civilization seemed to be hurtling toward an apocalyptic crisis nothing was permanent there were no fixed points on which to anchor moyshe benrabis life had become like the flash floods of sierran rivers in thaw time roaring and cascading past too swiftly too liquidly for any part to be seized and intimately known but wait in the river of life apassing there were a few solid rocks they were the longlived legends lying heavy on his mind like the boulders in the turbulence they had endured a forever compared to anything else of his age something was missing fixtures solids foundations for his life there had to be something for him something real i want he cried to the corners of his soul and here came the image of the gun that sprang to mind at the oddest time bow howitzer rifle pistol whatever always unmanned usually in profile and firing what did it mean a goal some sexual symbol an expression of his sometime want for heroism a sign of a secret urge to kill memories returned of the day he had entered academy he had been nervous and polished and proud to be part of navy proud to be one of the rare old earth appointees and scared they would hold that against him a bee of uncertainty had buzzed his butter soul even then he had taken his oath with private reservations he had devoted a quarter of his short life to winning the appointment and success had left him with the feeling that something was missing but navy had seemed to promise what his want demanded the academy years had not been bad hard work hard play not much time for introspection but the first few months of line service had brought the hurt back stronger than ever casting about desperately he had put in for intelligence training without understanding his own motivation he had told his wardroom acquaintances that he wanted more adventure even then his words had rung false there was adventure enough in the line hunting sangaree and mcgraws all of which had come to a head in the now with moyshe benrabi a flying knight being sent to find a dragon hiding behind the eyes of the night ahead he spotted his small brown oriental manchumustached partner mouse making no sign he entered the gate behind the man he slowed momentarily staring across the field the lighter from the raggedyassed freehauler that had brought them in from blackworld was still on the ground it should have lifted last night they had caught the freehauler at the end of a fastshuffle through a procession of ships designed to cover their backtrail mouse saw it too nothing escaped mouses little devil eyes he shrugged lengthened his stride so benrabi would not overtake him they were not supposed to be acquainted this time that left moyshe without any anchor at all he did not need lots of people but he felt desolate when he had no one he daydreamed about stars end and the high seiners the unchanging boulders that had ghosted across his mind before he had become distracted by his own past sheer mystery was stars end a fortress planet beyond the galactic rim bristling with automatic invincible weapons that slaughtered everyone fool enough to come in range not one of a dozen expeditions had produced a shred of why in the lulls the deep fearful lulls when there was nothing to say and nothing being said people seized on stars end as strange country to explore in litanies meant to exorcise the dreadful silence they were intrigued by the godlike power there theirs were the eyes of the godless seeking gods in a majestically powerful unknown a technological equivalent of an old testament jehovah or if stars end was momentarily pass√© they turned to the high seiners the starfishers the starfishers should have been no mystery they were human stars end was just a dead metal machine voice babbling insanities in nonhuman tongues the toy of guntoting pyramid builders so long gone no extant race remembered them but because of their humanness the seiners had become the greater more frightening puzzle landsmen did not comprehend the quiet fixed culture of the starfishers at all they yearned for the starfishers obvious peace yet hated them for their blissful stasis the seiner trail was a perilous one wending tortuously among yinyang pitfalls of envy and jealousy his thoughtful mood departed work came first he had to be alert lives could hinge on his slightest misstep and the life at the head of the list was his own he entered the blake port terminal it was a massive plastic glass and steel cavern its vast floor was a crossroads of color and movements its entrances and exits the mouths of tunnels opening on other worlds moyshe had wanted to be a poet once a spacefaring homer like czyzewski a childs dream that had been like the one about having secret powers if only he could find their handle an instructor had made him read czyzewski critically then had forced him to examine his own secret images of space and night and the womb that had been a broomstick fly strictly from hunger the backs of beyond in the shadowy reaches of his mind were lands of corruption and horror he would never journey again his muse had abandoned him for brighter skies now he played with prose all who were before me in jerusalem this mission should give him time to polish it light surrounded him human scent hung heavy around him people rushed hither and thither like swarming bees who had lost track of their queen their effluvia was too much for the air fresheners it was the same in every terminal he had ever visited the citizens were there in their multitudes dancing atoms pursuing the rituals of terminals the costumes of a dozen worlds mixed in a kaleidoscopic choreography a small subdued crowd occupied one backwater of the waiting room floor a long table had been set up there behind it a halfdozen men in offwhite undecorated jumpsuits fiddled with forms and questionnaires a girl at tables end armed with an arsenal of secretarial gizmos reduced the forms for microstorage she was pale had blondish hair that hung to her shoulders he noticed her because her hair was unusually long for a spacegoer the men though conformed to the spacer stereotype their hair was cropped to a centimeters length like induction day at boot camp moyshe muttered these people would be his new employers the ones he had been sent to betray mouse passed small and brown with a wink why he had that name benrabi did not know he had carried it for years and seemed to like it though for lookalikes weasel would have done better a weird one my partner benrabi thought but we get along because of commensality of obsession in some areas mouse was a mad collector too postage stamps from the days when they had been used coins bottles mugs wroughtiron almost anything old but the ends they were after varied benrabi collected for escape for relaxation as a means of learning mouse had gone mad archaicist during his recent stay in luna command his collecting had become a means of slipping into the gestalt of departed life styles he had fallen in love with the twentieth century the last with a real spectrum of class ethnic and cultural differentiations benrabi did not comprehend archaicists at all his opinion of them was to use mouses words lower than a snakes butt the old distinctions had changed race sex wealth style and manner of speech no longer set a person apart prejudices pivoted round origins and profession with old earthers the niggers of the age and service personnel the aristocracy benrabi under his other names had known mouse a long time but he just did not know the man professional acquaintance and even a budding friendship had done nothing to break down mouses defenses benrabi was old earther mouse was outworlds and third generation service that was a barrier across which little could trickle benrabi studied other faces saw bewilderment determination malaise a lot of these people were not sure why they were here but he was looking for the nonchalant ones the ones who did know they would be the competition and beekies the bureau was far from unique in its interest in starfish half these people probably were spies uhn excuse me please he turned a small blue nun had paused beside him startled by his grunt pardon sister just thinking out loud the ulantonid woman wobbled off wearing a perplexed frown perhaps wondering what sort of mind thought in dull monosyllables benrabi frowned himself what had become of the human need for faith the christians he encountered were almost always conquered aliens his curiosity faded he returned to that disturbing face yes it was marya though she had changed as much as he her hair skin and eyes had all been darkened she had put on twenty pounds there were other changes too they were subtler but did not prevent his recognizing her she had not disguised her ways of moving speaking listening she never was much of an actress he reflected she did have a talent essential to their profession she survived despite the odds she noticed him looking her eyebrows rose a millimeter then puckered in consternation then she smiled a wicked iron smile she had recognized him too how big a demotion had she earned for failing on the broken wings how much had it cost beyond the cruel slow deaths of her children frost mites danced between his shoulder blades she would be doing scoreevening calculations already she nodded ever so slightly politely it was a vast universe there was no way he should have run into her again ever he was too stunned for rational thought nothing could have shaken him more than her presence he did not fear her not in a cold sweat way she would see mouse she would know she had to let be or die or make damned sure she got them both with the same hit several other faces teased his memory trace recognitions trickled back from his studies of bureau files none of them were outright enemies they were competitors beekies from the corporations or possibly mcgraws he tried to view the crowd as an organism to judge its composition and temper it was smaller than he had expected not more than two hundred the seiners had advertised for a thousand offering bonuses and pay scales that approached the outrageous they would be disappointed he supposed there werent many techs romantic enough or hungry enough to plunge into an alien society for a year that might mean returning to a home changed beyond recognition after the lighters lifted there would be no turning back no one would be able to quit because he did not like his job moyshe shuffled into the checkin line four places behind his partner mouse was shaking moyshe never ceased to be amazed glacial glassteel conscienceless stonedeath he had thought mouse many cold hard things yet there were unpredictable moments when the man let slip the humanity behind the facade of adamant benrabi watched as if witnessing a miracle this might be the only time during the operation that mouse would let the hardness fall and that only because he was poised on the brink of a shuttle fly liftoffs terrified him dr niven a whisper warmth caressed benrabis arm he looked down into eyes as hard and dark as sangaree gunmetal coins pardon maam he put on his disarming smile names benrabi moyshe benrabi how quaint she smiled a gunmetal smile candy even she must be more widely read than he had suspected moyshe benrabi was the protagonist of czyzewskis sole and almost unknown trial of the novel a cartoon caricature painted in broad strokes of gargantua and don quixote the critics had said too much so stopping only on the edge of accusations of plagiarism strange that a sangaree should be familiar with his banners bright and golden sangaree he had to remind himself he had shared her bed there had been feeling in it during those hungry days on the broken wings she might willingly share beds again but in the end she would drink his blood sangaree nursed their hatreds forever for generations if rumor was true and the rat too eh meaning mouse she would have a special hell set aside for him but the feeling was mutual benrabi knew mouse would plain love a date with her in a medieval torture chamber all you confies and beekies and mcgraws pretending you need seiner money orbit in an hour gun see you upstairs more gunmetal smiles as she took her gunmetalhard body toward the ladies she would see him upstairs no doubt he wondered if he could conjure up a mark xiv combat suit real quick or spiders eyes so he could watch his back this mission was going to be roman candle all the way and he had hoped for a vacation operation for nothing to do but loaf and work on jerusalem two ad the olden days angel city a whisper swifted on lightning feet through angel citys underworld it said the starduster was on the broken wings a private yacht had slipped into angel port after making a surreptitious worldfall it was registered to a dr gundaker niven the cognoscenti in the outfit remembered that name in connection with a blowup on borroway that had set the sangaree back a billion stellars port workers with connections started the excitement the bounty on gundaker niven was immense the sangaree would not sit still for a billionstellar burn from god himself the dock workers passed the word that the lady of merit boasted just two passengers one was caucasian the other a small oriental that got their attention downtown niven had something to do with the starduster he might even be the starduster under an alias and the stardusters numberone man was an oriental one john li piao these men though looked like old earth shooters not the masters of a shadow empire rivaling that managed by the sangaree nevertheless heads nodded in the board rooms of crime orders went out to the soldiers the starduster was a unique creature he was a man in limbo a crime czar who had built a kingdom independent of the established syndicates he preyed on his own kind rather than pay a single credit for sangareeproduced stardust his was the most feared name on the sangaree hate list sentences of death had been pronounced on a dozen worlds open often redundant contracts approaching a hundred million stellars existed time and success had made of him an almost mythic devil he had been claimed killed a half dozen times but he kept coming back like a thing undead like a dying wizards curse hardly would the jubilation end before his invisible hand would again strike swiftly and viciously ripping the guts from another syndicate pipeline of profit was there more than one starduster the sangaree heads to whom most organized crime could be traced sometimes suspected that he was not a man at all but a role perhaps piao was the real starduster the handful of men who had been pinned with the starduster name were as diverse a group as could be selected from a goodsized crowd short tall thin fat white black the sangaree family dictators knew only one thing for certain the starduster was human sangaree might be contentious piratical greedy and short on conscience but only a human who hated would slash at them as bloodily as the starduster did even his motives were obscure the narcotic he stole did not always find its way back into trade channels greed had no obvious hold on him the yachtsmen rented a groundcar and vanished into angel citys warehouse district gundaker niven was a chunky man of medium height he had hard dark eyes of the sort that intimidated civilians he had thick heavy hands he jabbed with forefingers for emphasis whenever he spoke a wide scar poured from his right ear down over his cheekbone to the corner of his mouth take it out with a kilo of d he growled punching a finger at a dilapidated warehouse his words came out slurred the right side of his mouth did not move burn them and run his driver was a small man with fu manchu mustaches he had the same cold eyes but this aint no shatter run all that would do is show us how good they die working for beckhart is getting a meter too tall for me mouse this underworld stuff isnt my specialty its too rough too complicated suppose the real starduster has people here the smaller man laughed he does you can count on it oh christ hey working for the old man is an honor when he asks for you it means youve made it didnt you get sick of that military attach√© dodge no i was drafted into this come on engineering coups in the outbacks how dull can you get theres no rise to give it spice when things go broomstick you go hide in the embassy you think its all champagne and ballroom conspiracy i got my spleen burned out on shakedowns inside the embassy still aint the same yeah the starduster has people here but by the time the word floats up and the shit comes down well be long gone thats what you told me on gorki and new earth was supposed to be a piece of cake this was their third mission teamed admiral beckharts specialized secretive division of the bureau of naval intelligence had found that they complemented one another well so you should be used to it maybe gundaker niven what the hell kind of name is that you take what they give you this aint the diplomatic service youre in the big time now you keep telling me but they dont job you you stay mouse every go they never crank you through the medical mill they dont have the psychs scramble your brain they dont need to im not the front man im just around to drag your ass out of the fire when it gets hot i dont like the feel of this one mouse somethings wrong theres going to be trouble man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward holy shit im looking for toilet paper and he throws the bible at me its sour mouse because we got no backup hang tight doc we dont need it the sangaree outfit here wouldnt make a pimple on the ass of a family like the norbon theyve only got five or six people on the whole damned planet they get the work done with local talent stickers can burn you just as dead as any homeworld shooter beyondtheresurrection whats out here anyway got to go with you there doc not a million people on this rat hole three lousy domes and enough swamp to supply the rest of confederation it even stinks in here its in your head going to circle the block they idled on learning the warehouse districts tight twisty outoftheways first hand street maps and eidetic holomemories had been given them but only exploration made a place real every city had its feel its color its smell its style psychs familiarization tapes could not capture the intangibles of reality knowledge and preparation were the corner and keystones of their trade i need a bath niven complained i can smell swamp muck on me lets head back to the marcos my stomachs okay now im hungry and a game or two would get me back in the groove tomorrows soon enough to take the case the marcos was the broken wings best hotel and one of the best in the arm and that despite the limits imposed by the space and conservation regulations of a dome city dome cities are planetbound space vessels which translates as uncomfortable the lobby of the marcos had been decoratorengineered to provide an illusion of openness the wall facing the entrance was masked by a curving hologramic panorama from another world mouse froze whats the matter the smaller man stared straight ahead he did not reply the thunder mountains seen from edgeward city on blackworld niven murmured recognizing the scene it was a stark view of black mountains limned by the raging star winds of a prenova sun blackworld was one of the least hospitable and most dramatically beautiful of the outworlds just surprised me doc mouse glanced around the lobby it was the cathedral forest on tregorgarth when we checked in people stared the two gave the impression of being invaders instead of guests their appearance labeled them hardcases barely able to get by on their wits men of that breed belonged in the warehouse district not at the watering hole of the genteel the wateryeyed bellhop who watched them stroll through the hologram to the elevators did not belong either he limped when he walked but he was too solid too macho to be staff his uniform was a size too small his stance was a centimeter too assertive somethings gone broomstick mouse said the elevator doors closed with startling severity as though issuing a declaration of war meticulous preliminary research characterized a beckhart operation they had seen holos of and reports on all regular hotel staff i saw him what do we do cut out a floor short why not just get the hell out niven wondered well take the stairs well catch them from behind youre taking a lot for granted anything to save a kick in the teeth their floor was the fifth the penthouse level it contained four suites only theirs was occupied the empty car will tip them niven remarked after mouse had punched four yeah youre right so tell you what lets slide down and see if we can snatch the gimp shoot him with nobullshit and see what hes got to say that was pure mouse thinking niven reflected running was an alien concept they were both in old earther role holonet stereotype old earther role but they had not received a full psychbrief their speech patterns tended to meander between that appropriate to the role and that of academy graduates their missionprep had included only a limited psychbrief they remembered who they were they had to think to maintain consistent images were getting sloppy niven observed lets tighten up the elevator stopped on three they exchanged glances better stand back doc mouses eyes and face blanked a subtle air of crouch of tenseness enveloped him he seemed to have gone to another world he had entered assassins mind which meant that he had become a biochemical killing robot mouse was a physical combat specialist a dowdy blubbery woman with two poodles and a makebelieve fortune in cultured firestones waddled aboard five please and before niven caught the wrong note youre new offworlders niven responded with an affirmative grunt he had to think of some way to distract the woman while mouse relaxed how marvelous let me guess one of the inner worlds niven grunted again he stared at the door hoping rudeness would be distraction enough he took mouses arm gently as the door opened on four stay where you are a tiny needlegun peeped from a fat hand the woman sloughed the dowager character suddenly she was as hardedged as they move together the doors closed thank you niven looked beyond costume and props and saw the enemy she was the sangaree resident for the broken wings sexon splez christ youre slow he told himself the fat alone shouldve warned you plez was suspected of being a proctor of the sexon which was one of the first families of the sangaree that would make her the equal of a planetary senator the assignment of a heavyduty resident to a backwater world was what had stimulated luna command into sending in its shock troops how had she gotten onto them so fast niven wondered two nervous heavies in illfitting hotel livery awaited the car on floor five they were a tall pale gingerhaired pair who had to be brothers which ones niven the older asked out the woman gestured with her weapon wavering guns peered from all the brothers four hands careful niven thought he raised his hands slowly these men were amateurs they might start panicshooting chunkys niven the gook must be piao the stardusters associates were as shadowy as he but one of the few names known was john li piao reputed numbertwo man and chief bonebreaker the face of the man who wore that name though was as much an enigma as the stardusters i dont want you should get upset niven said trying to project terrified and outraged innocence and having no trouble with the fear but i think youve got the wrong stuff it animal the woman snarled the old earth cant is catching niven thought the brothers eyes narrowed their lips tightened the insult included them animal was the sangarees ultimate racial slur niven put on a bewildered face whats going on anyway im just a social researcher studying the effects of dome constriction the brothers laughed tightly one said crap mouse had gotten caught in the limbo between normalcy and assassins mind the state was one of semiconsciousness it would take him time to push himself one way or the other niven knew which way mouse would go his stomach knotted to study the effects of dome constriction on immigrant workers mouse needed a distraction for ubichi corporation this man is my secretary were not carrying any cash that was the course he thought protesting innocence of a connection with the trade would cause laughter protesting being robbed might make them hesitate the instant mouse needed he did not feel that mouse was doing the right thing but mouse did not know how to back down he was a hitter it would get him killed someday it might get them both killed but he could not change mouses ways the older gunman wavered the yacht was a ubichi charter cover the woman began too late mouse exploded flying with a scream that froze them an additional second a fist disarmed the woman her weapon dribbled into the elevator one foot then the other pistoned into the older brothers face he triggered needles stitched the wall over nivens head the younger brother managed only a half turn mouse bounced into him he chopped weapons away with his left hand his right went for the mans throat a gurgling scream ripped through a shattered windpipe knowing what would happen did not help niven mouse was fast the woman was running before niven recovered her weapon he crouched trying to aim he was too sick to hold his target she had kneed him savagely the agony numbed his mind he hit the button for one left the brothers to mouse maybe he could get her in the lobby reason returned before the doors opened there was nothing he could do not in front of fifty witnesses aching helpless he watched the fat woman collect her limping accomplice and depart he began shaking it had been close too damned close mouse was human again when niven reached five he was shaking too get her in the lobby with fifty witnesses from the elevator they couldnt see you through the holo oh that had escaped him what about those guys got to do something with them hell turn them loose wont make any difference he took another look his sickness returned centered higher did you have to defiantly yeah mouse was driven by a murderous hatred of everything sangaree it splashed over on anyone who cooperated with them he refused to explain better get them out of the hall staff might come through he grabbed a leg started dragging mouse dabbed at bloodstains the outfit wont like this niven said as he hauled the second corpse into the suite numbers going to be on us now so weve been on the bulls eye before anyway we bought some time theyll want to salvage the fat broad before they move and theyll bring in somebody new theyre careful that way well hustle them meanwhile how the numbers on wholl talk anybody who knows anything is going to know that were dead you aint dead till they close the box mouse i dont feel right about this one doc you worry too much let it stew we keep our heads in and our backs to the wall maybe a little something will blow our way just be on your toes like they said in the olden days when you get handed a lemon make lemonade i dont think the hardcase course took niven said youre right i mean i shouldnt be so worried know what your problem is you aint happy unless youve got something to worry about youre spookier than an old maid with seven cats three ad operation dragon blake city starport the terminals sounds crowded benrabi the smells and swirling colors dazzled him the nervousness started it always did at the mouth of the lions den or this time the dragons lair the briefing tapes had claimed that starfish seen in space resembled dragons two hundred kilometers long he shuffled forward with the line finally reached the table one of the seiner men asked a few questions he replied numbly sign and thumbprint this please mr benrabi give it to the lady with the rest of your paperwork shaking he completed his contract the seiner girl at tables end smiled as she shoved his papers into the maw of her reducing machine she said just through that door and take a seat please the shuttle will be ready shortly he went bemused that pale seiner girl with her pale hair and harsh cheekbones reminded him of alyce his academy love that was not good more than a decade had passed and still the pain could penetrate his armor was that why he had trouble with women every affair since had inevitably fallen into emotional chaos each had become a duel with swords of intentional hurt but there had been no prior affairs to stand comparison maybe he was just consistent in picking unstable women he took a chair in the waiting room out came the tattered notebook a traveling companion of many years this time he swore he would finish jerusalem the unbreakable fetters which bound down the great wolf fenrir had been cunningly forged by loki from these the footfall of a cat the roots of a rock the beard of a woman the breath of a fish the spittle of a bird the prose edda yes the more he thought about it the more he was sure that was the best possible opening quote it had an indisputable universality every life had its loki capable of binding it with chains as tenuous but strong those wormwood memories of academy returned they were indestructible memorabilia of an affair with a fellow midshipman who had been the daughter of the vice commandant and the granddaughter of the chief of staff navy he had been an idiot a pigiron chocolateplated fool how had he made it through in the context of alyce he still thought his survival a miracle and the cost what if he had not as ordered dropped the affair what if he had persisted she had demanded that he do so defying what to him had been terrifying concentrations of authority to her those people had been family mother and grandfather to him they had appeared as behemoths of power and the night beast with guiltfangs longer than any of his other haunts what of the child come on he grumbled at himself what is this lets ditch the memories and romantic nonsense he was a grown man he should get back into jerusalem that would be a blow against the dread empire of his soul one of his favorites from popes dunciad lo thy dread empire chaos is restored light dies before thy uncreating word ladies and gentlemen he looked up what now ah a lastchancetogetout briefing it was conducted by an officer with a voice so infuriatingly scratchy that it had to be technically augmented we dont want you on our ship youre not our kind of people the officer said for openers whyre you here what are your motives good questions benrabi thought two reasons youre either bemused by the seiner myth which is a holonet fabrication or youre here spying ill let you in on the secret now this isnt going to be any romantic adventure and youre not going to get at any information all were going to give you is a lot of hard work inside a culture unlike any youve ever known were not going to ease you into our world were not going to coddle you we dont have the time the man was deliberately trying to upset them moyshe wondered why weve assembled you for one reason its the only way we can meet next years harvest quotas benrabi had a sudden feeling a premonition he thought the man had more than harvests on his mind some worry or fear was racketing around his brain something terrible and big had him half spooked admiral beckhart liked using benrabi because he had these intuitions moyshe also sensed a ghost of disappointment in the speaker along with a taint of distaste for landsmen he spoke as if tasting the sour flavor of betrayal it was inarguable that these seiners were desperate they would never have sought outside technicians otherwise benrabi quelled a surge of compassion the speakers home was a harvestship somewhere out in the big dark to survive it needed a massive input of competent technicians the man was sour because of all of confederations billions only two hundred people had come forward and most of those could be considered suspect the seiner fumbled in the pockets of his antiquated tweed jacket benrabi wondered if the man was an archaicist his preconceptions of the seiners did not include the possibility that they were faddists too the man produced a curious little instrument he thrust it between his teeth he gripped it with his right thumb and forefinger puffing while he held a small flame over its bowl only after he had begun expelling noxious clouds did benrabi realize what was happening a pipe he muttered what the hell tobacco stench assailed his nostrils i cant believe this much bad taste he shuddered his reaction was not unique his companions buzzed a woman rose and started to leave then gagged and returned to her seat even mouse looked appalled how many of these crude horrors lay in ambush ahead this was carrying archaicism to the point of boorishness much as the pipe disgusted him benrabi applauded the psychology behind its appearance the man was easing them in after all the impact of later cultural shocks would be blunted a little as i said the seiner continued once his pause had his audience squirming therere spies here spy is a nasty word i know and spying is a nasty business but a realist recognizes the existence of espionage and were all realists here arent we espionage is all around us today were drenched in it up to our heinies in it because almost anybody with any power at all will do almost anything to get control of a starfish herd he assayed a little smile it mocked them all he was doing a show putting on the pompous ass to prod somebody into reacting benrabi sensed a quiet selfassured competence behind the showmanship in fact there was something about the man that screamed security officer you spies wont learn a thing till your contracts terminate youll see nothing but the guts of a ship even then youll see only what we want you to see when we want you to see it everybody hear this security rules will be observed at all times thats the eleventh commandment engrave it on your souls if you have any even a slight irregularity might spook us into hasty reaction since were not sure what information the spymasters would consider valuable were going to do our damnedest not to give away anything at all benrabi grimaced was the fool trying to impress them with seiner paranoia and xenophobia he could rave for a week and not intimidate the professionals i reiterate outside agents simply wont be given a chance to contact anybody who might possess critical information therell be penalties for trying to reach such people am i making myself clear someone made a snide remark the speaker responded youve got to realize that we consider ourselves a nation unto ourselves were not confederation we dont want to be confederation we dont give a damn about confederation all we ever asked from it was to be left alone which is what we ask of any gang of strongmen archaicism is our way of life not just a crackpot hobby just for example we still execute people once in a while that blockbuster fell into an ocean of silence benrabi wondered how many times confederation had tried coaxing these strange fiercely independent people into the government fold dozens at least luna command was persistent it was a longtoothed hound that did not turn loose of a bone and for a century and a half the starfishers had managed to evade luna commands protection mostly by remaining so damned hard to find but also by making it clear they were willing to fight luna command had never given up it never would even these people had to recognize that benrabi thought they had to recognize the governments stake nervousness pervaded the waiting room fogging in like some unexpectedly conjured demon the briefing officer met pairs of eyes one by one the romantic flinched before his stare they were finding their legend had teeth and claws no one executed people anymore even the barbarians beyond confederations pale recycled their human garbage if only through cyborg computation systems the civilians were learning what people in benrabis trade learned early adventures were more fun when it was somebody else getting the excelsior ripped out of his crate in view of what ive said and knowing that your futures may not be exactly what you anticipated when you applied the man said anybody who wants to do so can opt out now well cover expenses as advertised benrabi smiled at his lap thought thats where you were headed he whispered trying to spook the weaklings eh there was a stir in response but no one volunteered to go home the weaklings seemed scared that they would look foolish the starfisher shrugged collected his notes and said all right ill see you all upstairs he left the room time to sit to wait for the shuttle benrabi returned to his notebook and jerusalem he was having trouble with the story his mind seemed to be too ordered and mundane to produce the chaotic nonobjective symbolism of a mcguhan or potty welkin his maliciously intentional obscurantisms refused to remain obscure that could have been because he knew what he wanted to say maybe he should do the story as straight narrative moyshe thought he could strive for what the archaicist reviewers called a refreshingly anachronistic flavor it might then survive the archaicist marketplace where the unsophisticated arts of the past still had appeal jkadabar station is six months long and two years wide fifteen minutes high and a quarter of nine forever there are songs in its skies and trumpets in its walls the roads have neared their ends was he wrong was he alone in his feeling that all people were exiles in time no matter what could he do about it not a damned thing that was the passion that should drive the story raging impotence people began moving excitedly the volume of conversation picked up benrabi dragged himself back to reality he muttered shuttle must be ready yes his companions had begun filing onto the field already these seiners were frugal they had not bothered to lease an attached landing bay the air outside was cool and on the move a raindrop touched his cheek trickled like a tear a ragged guerilla band of clouds hurried over firing off a few scattered waterbullets that made little mud balls in the dust lying thick on the tarmac an omen rainy weather at blake city was almost a nevertime thing water was too scarce in this part of carsons he laughed nervously omens what was the matter with him into the shuttle caveman he mumbled the ship had been an antique when his grandfather was wetting diapers it was no commercial lighter and never had been broomstick from century one it was a gopowered coffin with no comforts from strictlyforgunpower days he saw nothing but stark functionalism and metal painted black or grey it appeared to be navy surplus probably from the ulantonid war the part of him that was still line officer noted that she was well maintained not a spot of dirt or corrosion showed anywhere the ship had that used but keptup look sometimes seen in rare antiques these seiners were lovingly careful of their equipment the passenger compartment was the antithesis of luxury benrabi had to suspend disbelief to credit it as suitable for human use yet the converted cargo bay did have ranks of new acceleration couches and soothing music came from hidden speakers it was old stuff quiet perhaps something by brahms it put a comforting gloss over the unsteady whine of the idling drives they would lift blind he saw weedlike clumps of colorcoded wiring hung where viewscreens had been removed they were taking no chances this seemed to be taking security a bit far what the hell could the screens show if the seiners kept them switched off for that matter what could they betray if turned on he knew where he was he knew where he was going at least for the short run was it some subtle psychological trick a maneuver to accustom them to flying blind he dithered over a choice of couches the knot behind his ear containing the nondispersible parts of the insteltracer seized him with iron spiked fingers he had been switched on by the bureau why now he wondered staggering with the pain they were supposed to wait till the lighter made orbit the thin pale girl who had done the form reductions rushed toward him are you sick her expression was one of genuine concern he was more shaken by that than by this bureau treachery he had lived under the gun for years now he was unaccustomed to strangers caring her concern was not the bland commercially dispensed pablum of a professional hostess either she wanted to help i want fired across his mind yes a migraine attack and my medicine is packed she steadied him sit down here ill get you something he dropped onto the couch a devil kicked the back of his skull with a steeltoed boot it was a vicious little critter it kept hammering away he could not restrain a groan the headache became a bass drumbeat overshadowing his other pains he looked up into the girls pale blue eyes they were perfectly suited to her pale complexion and colorless hair he tried a smile of gratitude be back in a minute she told him hang on off she hurried her hips moving in a languorous way that belied her haste benrabis head left him no time to appreciate the nicety his frayed nerves jumped they had migraine tablets on hand that was strange and her curiosity why was she interested in his health she had become intrigued and apprehensive the instant he had mentioned migraine he had stretched the truth this time but he had had headache trouble all his life he had gobbled kilos of painkillers in his time still he had not been bothered recently the susceptibility was noted in his medical file as a cover for the pain his tracer would cause why the hell switch him on now his headaches were a mental thing psych had declared they were caused by unresolved conflicts between his old earth origins and the demands of the culture into which he had climbed he did not believe it he had never met a psych he trusted heaving distance anyway he had had headaches even before he had begun to consider enlisting for at least the hundredth time he asked himself why the bureau had implanted an imperfect device he answered himself as always with the observation that the tracer was the only way they had to follow a seiner ship to a starfish herd completely nonmetal the tracer was the only device that could be smuggled aboard without being detected there was no satisfaction in knowing the answers not when they were so damned unpleasant he wished to hell that he could take a vacation a real vacation away from anything that would remind him of who and what he was he needed time to go home and get involved in something with known realizable and comfortable challenges he longed for the private universe of his stamp collection the seiner girl returned with another of those big warm smiles she carried a water bottle in one hand a paper pillbox in the other this should put that right she said that damned smile tried to eat him up i brought you a dozen that should last the whole trip he frowned how long would they be aboard this piece of flying junk i asked if i could stay with you till we make orbit jarl turned me down too much else for me to do she smiled felt his forehead he had had a feeling she would report him to somebody it was the way she had reacted to his mention of migraine what was so remarkable about a headache even a migraine something was wobbling on its axis and he could not get a grip the pain just would not let him think hell he was probably just feeling the first ground tremors of culture shock fly with it moyshe he told himself youve raced a sunjammer in the starwinds of the crab what could the lady do that was less predictable or more terrifying she was leaving he did not want her to go wait she turned his heart did a teenagers flop thank you my names benrabi moyshe benrabi now wasnt that a gimp way of feeling for an opening but she responded with a quick little smile i know moyshe i remember from your papers mines coleridge amaranthina amaryllis isolte galadriel de coleridge y gutierez she yielded a halflaugh because of his rising eyebrows mother was a reader amys good for everyday there was a long unsure moment it was that period of uncertainty preluding potential relationship where he did not know if he dared open up a little more she said im in liquids systems too he nodded she had left the door open a crack it was plain that it was up to him to use or ignore it some words finally came but too late she was walking away maybe later then i want returned to his mind stimulated by the girls invitation could a woman be his need no not all of it though having one around might be oil on the seas of his mind he had been hunting his grail for a long time though he believed himself a cripple when dealing with them the occasional woman had fallen his way none of them had been panaceas alyces ghost usually got in the way the bureau supported his quest knowing he was searching psych did not miss much they might even know what he needed whatever his masters were certain they would show a return on their investment few of the bureaus agents were sane in the accepted sense it recruited obsessives intentionally benrabi did not think that sane men would make good operatives it took a madman to want into intelligence in the first place he smiled mocking himself the lighter shuddered rocked shoved against his back he was on his way to the orbiting starfisher he watched mouse who was three rows ahead of him the small man trembled as if suffering from a palsy the getting off the ground part of space travel seemed to be the only terror his universe held his reactions to everything else seemed as intense as those of a stone so the rats chicken the sangaree woman was on the other side of the aisle smiling he had not seen her sit down did he have to take this and the pain too four ad the olden days the broken wings mouse was right the outfit didnt whisper for days nivens tension dissolved he started living his cover he began reviewing psychiatric statistics at angel citys medical center bureau planners had calculated the cover mission both to gather information of potential interest and to keep the opposition undecided on the surface there was no logical reason for a prime agent to spend all his time developing a mentalillness profile for an outpost city and even less sense in it for the starduster he found the data intriguing he began enjoying it then he met the woman she materialized at the edge of his vision for an instant she was long willowy darkhaired high large firm breasts locked a stunning holographic picture into his mind forever she vanished before he could get a better look his papers hit the floor he grabbed wondering if wishful thinking had bitten him those knockers it was lust at first sight then she was peeking back around a grey metal cabinet in openmouthed curiosity niven looked up into dark eyes he dropped his notes again bewilderment danced across her features is something wrong just clumsy you startled me he had never been comfortable with women especially those who attracted him so strongly so suddenly it had been years since a woman had aroused him instantaneously he considered himself with amazement the tough program did not keep his stomach from knotting or his hands from shivering it was silly adolescent and he could not help himself he knew that he would bitterly recriminate himself for his weakness later he always did he fumbled with the papers again she smiled better let me do that she knelt shuffled his notes together mona lisa he thought as he peered down her deeply cut blouse her mouth is exactly the same and her face has the same shape but freckled she wore no makeup and didnt use anything but shampoo on her hair she wore it brushed straight down it hung wild and free and had a hint of natural curl shes turned me into gelatin he thought he wanted to say something anything he could think of nothing that did not sound juvenile or insipid but he wanted to know her wanted her you work here he gobbled his throat was tight and dry he expected her to laugh he knew she was no employee he had spent two days in records already she was the first person he had encountered excepting the ratty old nurse who had explained the system and who stole through now and then to make sure he did not leave obscene graffiti or drop a grenade down the toilet while he was keeping the cover mouse was alleyprowling searching for the key that would open the operation prepared sound tapes made it seem he was hard at work in their suite no i came in to do some research how about you research a project for ubichi corporation oh gundaker niven doctor social psychology not medicine really she smiled it made her that much more desirable i guess youve heard it before you dont look it yeah he did not have to force much sour into his reply he was a born homeworlder that much of the cover was easy to keep youre from old earth everyone thinks the social handicap of an old earth birth properly exploited could be converted to a powerful asset for no logical reason outworlders felt guilty about what had become of the motherworld yet earths natives had made it the hell it was escape was available to the willing the willing were few people with adventure in their genes had gotten out in the first centuries of space travel around world commonweals fail point during first expansion and other early migrations modern departures came primarily through the colonial draft as earths planetary government sold huge blocks of conscripted labor in return for forgiveness of indebtedness those few natives who wanted out usually chose military service niven did not suspect that she might be sangaree he thought he had scored the old earth point you must be an exceptional man excuse me thats rude thats prejudice she handed him his notes huffed i said i was sorry forgiven i dont expect an outsider to understand old earth i dont understand it myself wont you introduce yourself oh yes marya strehltsweiter im a chemopsychiatrist im doing my internship here im originally from the big rock candy mountain for an instant she fell back inside herself i have one more year to go ive been there niven said its magnificent oops he thought that was a screwup dr gundaker niven had never visited the big rock candy mountain i miss it i thought the broken wings would be exotic and romantic because of the name you know what i mean and i thought id get a chance to know myself i never had time at home niven frowned his response he wanted to keep her talking to hold her but did not know what to say the old story i got pregnant young got married dropped out of school had to find work when he took off did that and went back to school both she smiled conspiratorially winked it didnt do any good to get away the pain came with me friend of mine told me you cant run away because the things you want to get away from are always inside you an old earther said that were not neanderthals sorry dont be youre right its down the chute if it werent for luna command and corporation center it would be back in the dark ages ive had it want to duck out for lunch he surprised himself he was seldom that bold why not sure its a chance to talk to somebody who hasnt spent their whole life in this sewage plant you know what i mean i can guess you on expense account dont get me wrong im not trying to be mercenary but it seems like forever since i ate in a decent place well find one anything lady just dont fade away before i get organized and start talking my talk where the hell have you been mouse demanded niven had wandered in after midnight i was getting scared theyd burned you sorry mom wont happen again sheeit doc found him a girlfriend hey you dont have a copyright on all right i know be cool but give me a yell next time just so i dont get hemorrhoids from worrying i got it what the clap why were here its stardust we knew that why else this sillyass double cover not little stardust not smalltime stardust stardust big enough to rate a family proctor in an outback residency you mean the fat broad yeah she was here because angel city depots distribution traffic for this whole end of the arm im talking a billion stellars worth a month youre talking out your butt there isnt enough ship traffic to handle that kind of smuggling yes there is if you dont really smuggle it if you send it out from a legit source labeled as something legit if you own the customs people and the ships and crews and shippers start over you skipped chapter one whats stink city known for besides the smell organic pharmaceuticals point for the bright boy all the good organics they dredge out of the muck outside the main reason angel city is here the sangaree have gotten control of the whole industry and most of the local officials they parachute the raw stardust into the swamp the dredgers bring it in the field traffic controllers are paid to ignore strange blips on their detection systems the stuff gets refined here in the best labs then they ship it out along with the finest label organics their people at the other end intercept it and get it into the regular stardust channels how did you dig that out ran into a man who knew i convinced him he should tell me now figuring how the old man works he probably guessed most of it before he sent us out so what does he want the source us to find out where the stuff comes from before it gets here niven frowned over the drink he had mixed while talking it is big then so huge it would take a cartel of families and you tried to tell me the sangaree outfit here was the biggest doc we just might be on the trail of the first families themselves and i know what i said i was wrong im thinking about retiring were really in it and thats the only way out the sangaree were a race few in number they had no government in the human sense their major form of organization was the family which could be described as a corporation or boundaryless nation led by persons who were related socalled possessionless sangaree formed the working class the family was strongly elitist and laissezfaire capitalist sangaree cut one anothers throats almost as gleefully as they chopped up the animal races a family head was an absolute dictator his followers fortunes depended upon his competence succession was patrilineal the existence of proctors only mildly ameliorated the medieval power structure the first families were the five or six most powerful families intelligence had never accurately determined their number as a consortium they determined racial policy and insured their own preeminence among their species very little was known of the sangaree that the sangaree did not want known oh hey mouse enthused dont even joke about getting out not now not when weve got an opportunity like this this might be our biggest hit ever its worth any risk thats subject to interpretation it is worth anything doc to you maybe niven nursed his drink and tried to regain the mood he had had on arriving mouse would not let be so tell me about your friend who is she where did you meet her she goodlooking she give you any whats she do i aint telling you nothing you birddog your own hey dont get that way how long you known me since academy i ever take your girl i never caught you he mixed another drink whats that supposed to mean jupp did mouse flashed him a black look who he shook his head indicated his ear the room might be bugged carlotta you mean she came after me remember and he didnt give a damn jupp von drachau had given a damn their mutual acquaintance and academy classmate had been crushed he had hidden it from his wife and mouse though niven had been the receptacle into which he had poured all his pain niven had never told mouse that he was the reason that von drachau had abandoned wife and son and had thrown himself into his work so wholeheartedly that he had been promoted ahead of men far senior navy was the one institution that von drachau trusted implicitly he was not alone in that trust the services were the foreign legion of the age their people shared a hardy camaraderie based on their conviction that they had to stand together against the rest of the universe service was a place to belong for people like yon drachau it became a cult niven never would tell mouse the evil had been done let the pain fade away it was not what carlotta had done faithful tilldeathdouspart marriage was an archaicist fantasy it was the way the hurt had been done carlotta had made a public execution of it flaying jupp with a dull emotional flensing knife with clear intent to injure and humiliate she had paid the price in coventry she was still one of the social outcasts of luna command even her son hated her niven still did not understand what had moved the woman she had seemed suddenly to become psychotic to collapse completely under the weight of her aristocratic resentment of her nouveauriche husband von drachau like niven was old earther even before the collapse of his marriage he had been climbing meteorically surpassing his wifes oldline fourthgeneration navy relatives that seemed to have been what had cracked her well dont get in too deep mouse warned interrupting nivens brooding we might not hang around long later as he drifted on the edge of sleep trying to forget the trials of life in luna command niven wondered why mouse had discussed their mission openly yet had stifled any mention of von drachau protecting their secondlevel cover associates of the starduster certainly should not be personal friends of a navy line captain or maybe mouse knew something that admiral beckhart had not mentioned to his partner niven thought the old man liked working that way the bastard probably both he muttered what talking to myself go to sleep beckhart always used him as the stalking horse or moving target he blundered around stirring things up for mouse or vice versa as mouse claimed he wondered if anybody had been listening they had found only one bug in their sweeps it had been inactive it had been one of those things hotel managers used to keep track of towel thieves but it was good tradecraft to assume that they had missed something live niven was not in love with his profession it never allowed him a moment to relax he did not perceive himself as being fast on his mental feet so tended to overpress himself preplotting his situational reactions he could not like mouse just fly easy rolling with the blows of fate like some samurai of destiny for him every venture out of luna command was an incursion into enemy territory he wanted to go out thoroughly forewarned and forearmed life had not been so complicated in his consular residency days back then friend and foe alike had known who and what he was and there had been a complex set of rituals for playing the game seldom had anyone done anything more strenuous than watch to see who visited him and who else was watching on st augustine he had worn his uniform there were different rules for scalp hunters beckharts friends and enemies both played by the war rules the blood rules and for reasons niven did not understand beckharts command was involved in a war to the death with the sangaree niven had had all the indoctrination he had endured the uncountable hours of training and hypopreparation he even had the benefit of a brutal old earth childhood but somehow his academy years had infected him with a humanism that occasionally made his work painful a tendency to prolonged introspection did not help he told himself wryly the campaign against the sangaree could be justified stardust destroyed countless minds and lives sangaree raidships pirated billions and slaughtered hundreds through front men the sangaree families obtained control of legitimate business organizations and twisted them to illegitimate purposes the humanoid aliens had become a deadly virus in the corpus of human civilization yet the very viciousness of navys counterattacks caused niven grave doubts where lies justice he wanted to know when we are more barbarous than our enemies mouse was fond of telling him that he thought too much and felt too little the issue was entirely emotional morning brought an indifferent mood a depression he simply abdicated all responsibility to mouse whats the program today he knew his partner meant to break routine mouse had had room service send up real coffee niven nursed his cup how are you going to get this past the auditors my accounts go straight to the old man he stamps the accepted must be nice to be the numberone boy it has its moments but most of them are bad i want you to hit the med center again business as usual but try to audit their offworld drug traffic if you can theres got to be records of some kind even if they only give us a side view i think most of it is going out of the center labs so its got to leave some kind of paper trace if we cant find the source maybe we can pinpoint the ends of the pipes what about you im going to spend some of the old mans money for hidey holes for tickets out you know the insurance that new resident will show up pretty soon weve got to be ready when it hits the ventilation are you getting close feelings warred within niven he wanted out of angel city and the mission but not right now there was marya to get to know no like i said just buying insurance ive got the feeling thisll get tight fast when they have somebody to tell them what to do what do you mean get tight it already is i had sticktights all day yesterday some of them stayed so close we could have worn the same shoes thats what they get for using local talent but i think thats part of their camouflage wed figure a place this important would have a battalion of highpowered types babysitting it if somebody hadnt gotten onto splez they might have rolled along forever ive got a feeling too mouse and it aint a good one what happens if we get caught in a crunch between them and the starduster mouse whipped a finger to his lips lets not get back to tertiary cover yet he breathed then he grinned going to suicide look if you have trouble make the fallbacks if i cant make them myself ill drop you a note somewhere otherwise ill catch you here tonight it should be our last here anyway niven hit the lobby convinced that mouse knew a lot more than he was telling but that would be typical mouse was beckharts fairhaired boy his perfectly expendable fairhaired boy he glanced back at the holorama it was portraying one of the furious electrical storms in ginunga gap on camelot a herd of windwhales quartered toward him through the rain and lightning for beckhart the bureaus work was a game a vastly recomplicated form of the chess to which mouse was addicted the universe was his board he would sacrifice his most precious pawn for a minuscule advantage he had been taking on the entire sangaree race for a generation and with the implacability of a glacier he was winning the prices of little victories left niven appalled it took some sweet talk on his part to get to the med centers commercial records he never was quite sure what made the old nurse give in somewhere along the line he said the right things pretty soon her death mask fell apart and reassembled itself in imitation of a smiling face then she fell all over herself explaining the dataretrieval system the information was there a bonanza and only thinly disguised more than mouse could have prayed for this was the data center from which the whole operation was controlled and it was not guarded by so much as a data lock the sangaree were notoriously sloppy administrators they had entered the interstellar community as predators and had never really adapted to the demands of modern commerce actionoriented they tended to ignore boring details especially on worlds they believed safely in their pocket like making sure no one without an absolute need had access to their records there had been a time when the need for protection would not have occurred to them at all just as certain hues might not occur as existing to a colorblind man who had spent his entire life among others with the same affliction but they were learning beckhart was teaching them via the pavlovian method the weakness was his favorite angle of attack the sangaree did keep one secret they wrote it down nowhere and defended it to the death the need to protect it was the one thing that could bring all the families together even families in vendetta would set aside their enmity long enough to keep homeworlds location from becoming known on borroway sangaree children had murdered their younger brothers and sisters and had then committed suicide rather than face human interrogation and that just because they had been afraid they might know something the human animals would find useful the hospital records were perfect niven unearthed few names but did gather business intelligence pinpointing critical distribution points on more than two dozen worlds crimped there the pipelines would require years of healing he found it incredible that a people could be so ingenious in marketing and so inept in administration but the sangaree were pure power people they provided the muscle money guns and merchandise they let human underlings take most of the risks and lumps from the sangaree viewpoint their human associates did not much matter the tips of the krakens tentacles were nothing but ignorant expendable animals they could be replaced by others just as ignorant greedy and expendable only one or two people on a market world could point toward angel city only from the back of the beast itself could the entirety of the monster be seen and the beast was solidly in sangaree pay marya caught him before he finished what in the world she demanded when she found him immersed in the data far from his usual orbit five ad operation dragon lifting off sorry i startled you a shewolfs grin made it plain that the sangaree woman felt no remorse whatsoever im maria elana gonzalez atmosphere systems distributions methods sometimes i do a little hydroponics ecology i dont have a masters for either though too busy with other things she smiled her gunmetal smile yes benrabi thought the lady has other interests stardust and murder moyshe benrabi he replied in case she had forgotten an unusual name she smiled that smile jewish so im told ive never been in a synagogue in my life you wouldnt be a writer she knew damned well that he was or that he pretended to be he had whispered to her about it the name sounds so literary somehow i try yes was she going to expose the pale imperator no she did not push it nor did she thrust with anything from her arsenal of needles what made you decide to sign up she asked unemployment a space plumber youre kidding you must be on the blacklist yeah sort of somebodys what about you the money the vibrations of hatred had begun mellowing out she was controlling herself superbly benrabi let it flow he hurt too much to fence or to probe about her mission the armed truce persisted till the lighter reached the starfisher moyshe did not forget that she was sangaree that she would drink his blood happily he simply tabled the facts for the time being hundreds of her people had died because of him her children were dying she would do something the sangaree tradition of honor of family responsibility would compel her but she would not act right away she had come here on a mission she would complete that first he could relax for a while as introspective and moralitystricken as he sometimes became he could not feel guilty about the broken wings nor about its aftermath humanity and sangaree were at war and the sangaree had fired the opening shot that it was a subterranean war fought at an almost personal level did not matter nor did the fact that only humanity perceived a war that the sangaree were just in business battles were battles casualties were casualties no matter how or why they went down most of his associates and contemporaries hated the sangaree but to him they were just people people he had to hurt sometimes because of what they did and represented he snorted the most bigoted man alive could say the same thing and mean it the whole stardust trade turned his stomach the trouble with me is i dont love or hate anything he murmured what sorry thinking with my mouth in gear his mood left nothing counting nothing could move him the pain tablets had kicked him into nirvana or into a depthless black pit where the light of emotion simply could not shine he was not sure which he did not care he did not give a damn about anything instead he immersed himself in the mystery he called mouse benrabi believed he knew mouse better than did anyone but the admiral a lot of one another had leaked across during their teamed operations these little flareups in the secret war were slowly melting them molding them and still mouse remained a mobile enigma mouse scared hell out of benrabi mouse was the only man he knew who had killed someone with his bare hands killing had not become a social dodo but the personal touch had been removed murder had become mechanized its soul and involvement eliminated it had been that way for so long that most civilians could not endure the emotions they suffered if they entered a killing rage their brains shorted they went zombie and nothing happened anybody could push a button and hurl a missile to obliterate a ship of a thousand souls a lot of timid little anybodies had the same anybody could sleep without dreaming the following night the involvement was with the button not the bang ample opportunities arose in nice remote space battles with sangaree mcgraw pirates or in the marqueandreprisal antics of minor governments for that kind of killing but to do a man face to face with hands or knife or gun it was too personal confederation men did not like to get too close to anyone not even to end a life a man knew he was in too deep if the urge arose the people of now wanted no faces on their haunts benrabi was freeassociating and unable to escape the flight of his thoughts mouse interpersonal relationships the two joined forces to kick him into a pit of fear he had known mouse as early as their academy days they had shared their moments then both in training and the play typified by sunjammer racing in the wild starwinds of an old supernova they had crewed their sunjammer victoriously and had shared celebrations during leave but they had refused persistently to become anything more than acquaintances friends were strange creatures they became responsibilities they became walking symbols of emotional debits and personal obligations he was getting too close to mouse growing too fond of the strange little man and he suspected that mouse was having the same trouble friendship would be bad for their professional detachment it could get them into trouble the bureau had promised that they would not be teamed again after the operation on the broken wings the bureau had lied as it always did or this really was a critical hurryup topman job he wondered the admiral apparently would do or say or promise anything to get the work done always there was a rush but he had no good reason to complain hurry was inherent in the modern social structure change came about so swiftly that policy operational and emotional obsolescence developed overnight decision and action had to be sudden to be effective the system shuddered constantly under the thundering impact of precipitous error benrabi was now involved in one of the bureaus few old stable programs catching a starfish herd had been a prime mission before his birth he suspected it would continue to be one long after his death he might die of boredom here he now saw little hope that he and mouse would be recalled early the presence of sangaree altered all the rules he had abandoned all hope of enjoying the mission somehow sometimes because of the sangaree woman or otherwise he or mouse would get hurt a clang rang through the shuttle the vessel shuddered benrabi ceased flaying himself with the tiny dull knives of the mind the lighter nosed into its mother ship like a piglet to a sows belly moyshe followed the crowd moving to board the starship he worked his way close to the pale seiner girl could he pick up where he had left off he wondered why she intrigued him so just because she had been kind guides led the way to a common room where several highpowered command types awaited them another lecture moyshe thought some more shocks set off by a lot of boredom he was half right even before they were comfortable one of the heavyduty lads said im eduard chouteau your ships commander welcome aboard number three service ship from danion a harvestship of paynes fleet that was enough ceremony evidently he continued weve contacted you as emergency replacements for technicians danion lost in a shark attack two months ago frankly fishers havent ever liked or trusted outsiders thats because outsiders have given us reason but for danions sake well do right by you till we get our own people from the schools all we ask is that you do right by us benrabi felt that little feather tickle again halftruths were fluttering around like untamed butterflies the man had something on his mind there was a smoke screen rolling tall and wide and behind it something he and mouse just might find interesting he made a mental note the seiner schools were unique most groundsiders knew a little about them they made romantic remote settings for holonet dramas those shows naturally had borne little relation to reality the seiner creches were hidden in dead planetoids somewhere in deep space the old and the young of the fisher fleets dwelt there teaching and learning only healthy seiners of working age spaced with the fleets and hazarded themselves against disasters of the sort that had overtaken danion unlike confederation parents starfishers yielded their children to professional surrogates out of love they did not see their young as dead weight that might hamper them as they shot the rapids of life benrabi had never seen enough of his father to have developed an emotional attitude toward him and what could he think about his mother she could not help being what she was his mother was the child of her society shaped by a highpressure environment the years and prejudice had devoured their tenuous umbilical link they were of alien tribes now the barrier between them could no longer be breached even with the best will on both sides visiting her had been a waste of leave time but then there was the kid how was greta doing christ he might not know for one hell of a long time why had his mothers behavior so horrified him he should have known better than to have gone he had come out of that world all old earth was a screaming rat warren packed with people seeking new thrills and perversions as escapes from the grim realities of narrow little lives lights the ships commander snapped benrabi returned from introspection a hologram took form in the center of the darkening common room it developed like some fantasy magicians uncertain conjuration flickering for several seconds then jerking into sudden aweinspiring solidity the stars you see here we retaped off a standard second level astrogation training module our holo people dubbed the ships from models used in an engineering status display at ships engineering control aboard danion this is danion your home for the next year the name danion rolled off his tongue freighted with everything the ship meant to him home country refuge responsibility a ship formed against the imaginary stars it was a weird thing making moyshe think of octopi entwined no he decided it looked like a citys utilities systems after the buildings and earth and pavement had been removed with the leavings flung mad among the stars there were vast tangles of tubing here and there lay a ball a cone a cube or an occasional sheet of silverness stretched taut as if to catch the starwinds vast nets floated between kilometerslong pipelike arms the whole mad construct was raggedly bearded with thousands of antennae of every conceivable type the totality was spectacularly huge and dreadful in its strangeness in theory a deepspace vessel need not be confined in a geometric hull most small specialized vessels were not a ship did not have to have any specific shape though the complex relationships between drive inertialnegation mass increase effect reduction temporal adjustment and artificial gravity induction systems did demand a directionoftravel dimension slightly more than twice that of dimensions perpendicular to lineofflight in vessels intended to operate near or above the velocity of light but this was the first truly large asymmetric ship benrabi had ever seen it was a flying iron jungle the streamlined ship had been preferred by mankind since space travel had been but a dream even now designers felt more comfortable enclosing everything inside a skin capable of generating an allaround defensive screen even the wildest imaginings of noveltyhunting holo studios had never produced a vessel as knotted and strewn as this mass of tangled kittens yarn benrabis astonishment was not unique silence died a swift death in that room how the hell does that bastard keep from breaking up someone demanded what i want to know is how do you build something like that without a crew from every holonet in the universe turning up someone more technically smitten asked ships commander what sort of system do you use to synchronize drives youd have to have hundreds on a ship that big even with superconductor or pulse laser control systems your synch systems would be limited to the velocity of light the lag between the more remote units benrabi lost the thread another surprise had jumped on him wearing hobnailed boots on all four feet he was aboard a ship he and mouse had studied from the surface of carsons she was a typical interstellar vessel of an obsolete class now common only among the rim run freehaulers a similar vessel had appeared in the hologram it was approaching the harvestship the surprise was in their relative sizes the starship became a needle falling into an expanding cosmic ocean of scrap the service ship retained its holo dimensions danion swelled till she attained epic proportions moyshe could not begin to guess her true dimensions his most conservative estimate staggered him she had to be at least thirty kilometers in crosssection twenty thick and sixty long that was impossible there were countries on old earth smaller than that and stretching far beyond the dense central snarl of the ship were those spars spreading silvery sails and nets did she sunjam on stellar winds she couldnt the starfish stayed away from stars any stars be they orbited by settled worlds or not they stayed way out in the big dark where they could not be found the whole thing had to be a brag show pure propaganda it just had to be he could not accept that ship as real his normal understandable operationopening jitters cranked themselves up a couple of notches till that ship had declared itself he had thought he could handle anything new and strange change was the order of the universe novelty was no cause for distress but this mission held too much promise of the new and unknown he had been plunged tabula rasa into a completely alien universe nothing created by man had any right being so damned big light returned it drowned the dying hologram benrabi looked around his jaw was not the only one hanging like an overripe pear about to drop despite prior warning everyone had believed themselves aboard a harvestship cultural bias left them incapable of believing the fishers could have anything better moyshe began to realize just how poorly he had been prepared for this mission he had done his homework he had devoured everything the bureau had known about starfishers he had considered speculation as well as confirmed fact he knew all there was to know too little had been known thats all youll need to know about danions outside the ships commander told them of her guts youll see plenty and youll have to learn them well we expect to get our moneys worth they had the right to ask it moyshe figured they were paying double the usual spacers rates and those were anything but poor the man talked on awhile repeating the security officers injunctions then he turned the landsmen over to ratings who showed them to their quarters benrabis nervousness subsided he had been through this part before each time he had boarded a navy warship he got a cabin to himself the seiner assigned to him helped settle him in from the mans wary replies moyshe presumed he could expect to be aboard for several days paynes fleet was harvesting far from carsons once the man had left and benrabi had converted his barren cubicle into a spartan cell he lay down to nap after looking for bugs and spyeyes of course but sleep would not come not with all the great lumpy surprises his mind still had to digest someone knocked mouse he guessed the man never used a buzzer he made a crochet a means of identification yes it was mouse hi he said im masato iwasaki oh youre in liquids too good he stuck out a hand they shook benrabi moyshe nice to meet you silly game he thought but it had to be played if they wanted people to believe that they had just met you wouldnt happen to play chess mouse asked im looking for somebody who does he was addicted to the game it would get him into trouble someday benrabi thought an agent could not afford consistent crochets but who was he to criticize ive been up and down the passage but i havent found anybody no doubt he had mouse was thorough i play but badly and its been awhile it had been about four hours they had almost been late to the spaceport because of a game mouse had been nervous about liftoff benrabi had been holding his own mouse prowled searching for bugs benrabi closed the door i dont think there are any not yet i didnt find anything mouse shrugged what do you think broomstick all the way strictly from hunger were riding the mythical nova bomb the woman yeah pure trouble spotted a couple mcgraws too you think shes teamed he dropped onto the extra bunk i dont think so not by choice shes a loner it doesnt look good mouse mused we dont have enough info i feel like a blind man in a funhouse wed better fly gentle till we learn the traffic code he stared at the overhead and how to con the natives benrabi settled onto his own bunk they remained silent for minutes trying to find handles on the future they would need every advantage they could seize three weeks mouse said i can handle it then a whole year off i wont know what to do dont make your reservations yet marya the sangaree woman shes one bad omen mouse i dont think its going to work out i can handle it you dont think i want to spend a whole damned year here do you remember what that character said down at blake city it could be the rest of our lives short lives bah he was blowing smoke ready to bet your life on it benrabis head gave him a kick he was not sure he could take much more pain and this compelling need whats the matter headache must be the change in air pressure how the hell was he supposed to work with his body in pain and his mind half around the bend there was something to be said for those oldtime sword swingers who did not have to worry about anything but how sharp their blades were wed better hedge our bets moyshe better start planning for the long haul just in case thought you could handle it mouse shrugged got to be ready for everything ive been poking around these seiners are as bad as us for special interests theyve got coin clubs and stamp clubs and archaicist period groups the whole thing theyre crazy to get into the past what i was thinking was why dont we start a chess club for landsmen wed have a cover for getting together and youd have an excuse to play that too a lot of seiners play too see maybe we could fish a few in so we could pump them socially he winked smiled the seiners he was interested in hooking were probably female benrabi could not fathom mouse mouse seemed happy most of the time that was disconcerting the man carried a load of obsessions heavier than his own and somebody whose profession was hatchet work should in benrabis preconceptions have had a happiness quotient approaching zero benrabi never had been able to understand people everybody else seemed to live by a different set of rules mouse shrugged fingers crossed hope beckhart will pull it off wouldnt bet against him benrabi never knew where he stood in the admirals grand tortuous schemes hey ive been here long enough mouse said no point attracting attention straight off i saw you get pills from that girl what was wrong head yeah might even be my migraine my head feels like somebodys been using it for a soccer ball mouse went to the door a game tonight then sure as long as you dont mind playing an amateur benrabi saw him off feeling foolish there had been no one around to hear his parting speech the public address system announced dinner for passengers mouse turned back feel up to it benrabi nodded though it had ached miserably seconds ago the tracer was not bothering him at all now somebody was trying to impress them the meal was superb it was the kind navy put on when important civilians came aboard everything was hydroponics and recycle yet supremely palatable each mouthful reminded benrabi of the horrors of a navy mess six months out after the fresh and frozen stores were gone from some angles the mission had begun to show promise he looked for the seiner girl amy but did not see her lazy days followed there was little to do in transit he stayed in his cabin most of the time loafing toying with jerusalem and trying not to remember too much mouse and a few others he had met occasionally came to visit play chess or just bullshit about common interests the landsmen began to settle in to get acquainted the unattached singles started pairing off mouse never inclined to celibacy found himself a girl the second day already she wanted to move in with him individual quarters had been assigned everyone but the married couples there was room the ship had been prepared to haul a thousand people mouse immediately established himself as a character and leader among the landsmen his notion of a chess club while no fad caught on one of the joiners was the seiner who had striven to rattle them at blake city his name was jarl kindervoort he did not hide the fact that he ranked high in danions police department benrabi marveled again at the size of the harvestship a vessel so huge that it had a regular police agency complete with detectives and plainclothes operatives just incredible they called themselves internal security benrabi saw nothing in what he learned of their structure to remind him of a security unit in the intelligence sense the function was doubtless there cobbled on in response to the arrival of outsiders but the agency look was that of a metropolitan police force mouses club inspired a general movement half a dozen others coalesced each was archaicistoriented in an age when nothing seemed as permanent as the morning dew people who needed permanence had to turn to the past benrabi looked on the whole archaicist movement with studied contempt he saw it as the refuge of the weak of moral cowards unwilling to face the now without the strategic hamlets of yesterday to run to when the pressure heightened archaicism could be damned funny benrabi remembered a holocast of potbellied old men stamping through modern new york outfitted as assyrian soldiery off for a sham battle with the legions of the pharaoh of new jersey or it could be grim sometimes they started believing he still shuddered whenever he recalled the raid on the temple of the aztec revivalists in mexico city one morning he asked mouse to read the working draft of his story he had managed to push it all the way to an unsatisfactory ending mouse frowned a lot he finally said i guess its all right i dont know anything about nonobjective art i guess that means it isnt working id better get on it and do it right even if you cant figure out what the hell its about it should affect you oh it does moyshe his tone conveyed more message than did his words it said that he thought benrabi was wasting his time moyshe wanted to cry the story meant so damned much to him six ad the olden days luna command he waited patiently in the line outside decontamination when his turn came he went to cubicle r no one else had done so a sign saying out of service clung to the door beneath the r that sign had been there more than twenty years it was old and dirty and lopsided everyone in luna command knew that door r did not open on a standard decon chamber the men and women and occasional nonhumans who ignored the sign were agents returning from the field he closed the door and placed his things on a counter surface then removed his clothing nude he stepped through the next door inward energy from the scanner in the door frame made his skin tingle and his body hair stand out he held his breath closed his eyes needles of liquid hit him stung him killing bacteria and rinsing grime away sonics cracked the long molecular helixes of viruses a mist replaced the spray he breathed deeply something clicked he stepped through the next door he entered a room identical to the first its only furniture was a counter surface on that counter lay neatly folded clothing and a careful array of personal effects he dressed filled his pockets chuckling he had been demoted his chevrons proclaimed him a second class missileman his ships patch said he was off the battle cruiser ashurbanipal he had never heard of the vessel he pulled the blank id card from the wallet he had been given placed his right thumb over the portrait square ten seconds later his photograph and identification statistics began to appear cornelius wadlow perchevski he muttered in disbelief it gets worse and worse he scanned the dates and numbers memorizing then attached the card to his chest he donned the donald duck cap spacers wore groundside said cornelius perchevski to see the king the floor sank beneath him as he descended he heard the showers go on in the decon chamber a minute later he stepped from a stall in a public restroom several levels lower he entered a main traffic tunnel and walked to a bus stop six hours later he told a plain woman behind a plain desk behind a plain room behind a plain door cornelius w perchevski missileman two im supposed to see the doctor she checked an appointment log youre fifteen minutes late perchevski but go ahead through the white door he passed through wondering if the woman knew she was fronting probably not the security games got heaviest where they seemed least functional the doctors office made him feel like alice diving down a rabbit hole into another world its just as crazy as wonderland he thought black is white here up is down in is out huck is jim and never the twain shall meet he chuckled mr perchevski he sobered sir i believe you came in for debriefing yes sir where do you want me to start sir the oral form then youll rest tomorrow well do the written ill schedule the crosscomparative for later in the week were still trying to get the bugs out of a new crossexamination program perchevski studied the faceless man while he told his tale the interrogators most noteworthy feature was his wrinkled blueveined weathered hands his inquisitor was old the faceless man usually was not normally he was a young expert psychologistlawyer the old men in the bureau were exoperatives senior staff decisionmakers not technicians he knew most of the old men he listened to the questions carefully but there was no clue in the voice asking them it was being technically modified he reexamined the hands they offered no clues either he began to worry something had gone broomstick they did not bring on the dreadnoughts otherwise his nerves were not up to an intensive interrogation it had been a heavy mission and the trip home had given him too much time to talk to himself debriefing continued all month they questioned him and counterchecked his answers so often and so thoroughly that when they finally let him go he no longer really felt that the mission had been part of his life it was almost as if some organ had been removed from him one molecule at a time leaving him with nothing but a funny empty feeling five weeks after he had arrived at luna command they handed him a pink plastic card identical in all other respects to the white one he had received at decontamination they also gave him an envelope containing leave papers money bankbooks and such written persona as a man needed to exist in an electronic universe included was an address an unsmiling amazon opened a door and set him free he stepped into the public tunnels of luna command back from beyond the looking glass he caught a bus just like any spacer on leave the room was exactly as he had left it except that they had moved it a thousand kilometers from its former location he tumbled into his bed he did not get out again for nearly two days cornelius perchevski was a lonely man he had few friends the nature of his profession did not permit making many for another five days he remained isolated in his room adapting to the books collections and little memorabilia that could be accounted the timespoor of the real him like some protean beast his personality slowly reshaped itself to its natural mold he began taking interest in the few things that made a unified field of his present and past he took down his typewriter and notebooks and pecked away for a few hours a tiny brat of agony wrested itself from the torn womb of his soul he punched his agents number added his client code and fed the sheets to the fax transmitter in a year or two if he was lucky a few credits might materialize in one of his accounts he lay back and stared at the ceiling after a time he concluded that he had been alone enough he had begun to heal he could face his own kind again he rose and went to a mirror examined his face the deplastification process was complete it always took less time than did his internal mendings the wounds within never seemed to heal all the way he selected civilian clothing from his closet dressed he returned to public life by taking a trip to the little shop the bus was crowded he began to feel the pressure of all those personalities pushing and pulling his own had he come out too early each recovery seemed to take a little longer to be a little less effective walter clark the lady shopkeeper declared where the hell have you been you havent been in here for six months and you look like youve been through hell hows it going max a selfconscious grin ripped his face open christ it felt good to have somebody be glad to see him just got out of the hospital hospital again why didnt you call me what happened some stone age first expansioner stick a spear in you again no it was a bug this time acted almost like leukemia and they dont even know where i picked it up you have anything new for me sit your ass down walter you bet i have i tried to call you when it came in but your box kept saying you werent available you ought to get a relay put on that thing here let me get you some coffee max i ought to marry you no way im having too much fun being single anyway why ruin a perfectly good friendship she set coffee before him oh thiss the real thing i love you its kenyan having old earth next door is good for something then coffee and comic opera heres the collection the best stuff is gone already you know how it is i didnt know when youd show up i couldnt hold it forever perchevski sipped coffee he closed his eyes and allowed the molecules of his homeworld to slide back across his taste buds i understand i dont expect you to hang on to anything if youve got another customer he opened the ancient stamp album you werent out to the march of ulant were you walter ulant no the other direction why because of the rumors i was curious you know how luna command is they say ulant has been rearming the senators are kicking up a fuss high command keeps telling them its nonsense but ive had a couple of highpowered corporate executive types in and they say the services are smoke screening that theres something going on out there a lot of heavy ships moving through here lately too all of them moving from out the arm in toward the march its all news to me max i havent had the holo on since i got back im so far behind ill probably never catch up these hamburg the notes all over the page what are they jimmy eagle did that right after i picked up the collection lot of them are forgeries the cancellations most of the stamps are good he marked the reprints you havent heard any news at all max by the time i got back from illwind i was so sick i couldnt see i didnt care i dont know why weve got an embassy on that hole anyway or why they sent me there the only natives i ever saw were two burglars we caught trying to blow up the ambassadors safe they need a military assistance mission like old earth needs another joshua ja their methods of killing each other are adequate already then you havent even heard that ja is done for hey what happened this i got to hear about joshua ja was one of old earths more noxious public figures the holonet newscasters had dubbed him the clown prince of senegal the nets followed his threats and posturing faithfully using him as humorous leavening for their otherwise grim newscasts the selfproclaimed emperor of equatorial africa was no joke to his subjects and neighbors his scatterbrained projects and edicts invariably cost lives he invaded the mauritanian hegemony while you were gone perchevski laughed sounds like one gang of inmates trying to break into anothers asylum old earth was a nonvoting member of confederation both confederation itself and the world government refrained from interfering in local affairs world government held off because it had no power confederation did so because the costs of straightening out the homeworld were considered prohibitive earth was one of the few confederation worlds supporting multiple national states and the only one boasting an incredible one hundred twentynine world governments writ ran only in those countries deigning to go along with its decrees centuries earlier there had been but two states on earth world commonweal and united asia united asia had remained impotent throughout its brief turbulent history world commonweal might have created a planetary state but had collapsed at fail point so called because at that point in time agroindustrial protein production capacity had fallen below the populations absolute minimum survival demand you missed the best part of it walter during the first week the mauritanians shot down half of their own air force and the empire lost a whole armored brigade in a swamp because ja ordered them to march in a straight line all the way to timbuktu the holonets had a field day thats the lilac brown shade there weve got a foundation certificate for it perchevski lifted the stamp and examined its reverse i already have a copy im just looking anyway the mauritanians have been less klutzy than the imperials theyre closing in on dakar whats the council doing laughing a lot theyre going to let him go down the words out that other countries shouldnt accept refugees from the empire ja and his gang have done too much damage to old earths image old josh youre kidding how do you lower something thats already at the bottom you see anything you want you my love smart ass wednesday night whatve you got in mind a cribbage game ill call you if it does any good if youre not off to some weird place with a name like toilet bowl actually i was thinking about going to the archaeological digs at ley funny you should mention them more coffee sure why they broke into a new chamber last month it was in pretty good shape is it open they put a transparent tube in you can walk through and look but you cant get close to anything or get in the way call me then if you want to go see excuse me walter another customer had come in yes sir may i help you how are you in twentyfirst century france perchevski lost himself in the bits of paper that told tales of a remote turbulent era he finally selected seven pieces for his collection paid for them from the walter clark account max thanks for the coffee and hold that berlin piece will you ill let you know as soon as i make up my mind like maybe wednesday all right walter ill call you tomorrow leave a message if im not there i will he clambered aboard a bus and returned the two hundred kilometers to his apartment youre a fool he told himself to go all that way for an hour of gossip but damn did he feel better he had traveled a lot farther in the past he doubted that max had a ghost of a notion just what she meant to him she was one of the few stable realities in his life she was a landmark by which he guided himself back from the wildernesses of bureauland he mounted his new stamps in his albums using a surgeons care he took down a notebook and marked their catalog numbers off his list of wants noting the date and price he had paid for each he entered the total in his cumulative ledger then marked down the fact that two more album pages had been filled the detailed record keeping was necessitated by something within him some compulsion to put down tiny proofs that he was interacting with the universe if only through the hieroglyphics of numbers he had other notebooks in which he kept other records he did a lot of bookkeeping on the events of his life none of it ever left his apartment he wondered what the bureau snoops made of the lists and notes he was sure they checked them whenever he was away he finished his record keeping he looked around the sterile room it suddenly became very tight very lonely he tried the holo turning to the luna command news channel he caught it in a low cycle there was nothing on but an endless parade of public service messages though once a commentator mentioned rumors of a forthcoming major news event involving navy something big was expected but its nature could not be determined security remained unusually tight sure perchevski growled at the cube the chief of staff will probably announce this years winners in the fleet backgammon playoffs luna command was heart and brain of confederation it was headquarters for the services which were confederations bone and sinew it was the hub of a human enterprise kept unified only by its military and the only exciting thing that had happened there in perchevskis lifetime had been the discovery of the prehistoric alien base on the moons dark side the military did not control confederation but the only obstacle to absolute military rule was a gentlemens agreement among the generals and admirals to accept the forms of democracy high command could do anything it damned well pleased any time it pleased were it to ignore custom out in the remote reaches far from senatorial eyes it often did there were few sanctions the civilian sector could exercise aggravated perchevski killed the holocast he checked the lunar calendar for the best viewing site recovered his tunic and hit public transportation again he took the highvelocity electric train the six hundred kilometers to the tourist observation dome overlooking tycho the crater was not the attraction there people did not come from confederations one hundred thirtyfour member planets and more than a hundred dominions protectorates associated states and outright colonies to look at a hole in the ground the allies and tributaries were not interested in a crater either neither was perchevski tycho observation dome offered a magnificent view of old earth his homeworld a world he had not visited in eight years tycho or its sister domes was as close as most tourists cared to get to their biological roots perchevski lay back in a lounger and halflistened to the canned commentary where the race of man began possibly also the planet of origin of the sangaree first successful extraterrestrial landing july in the old dating neil armstrong ascension of world commonweal following world war iii fail point july led to the collapse reinhardt ships carried commonweal refugees to interstellar colonies from through the end of the luna wars in the treaties of jerusalem of led to the chaotic exploration and random settlement we now call first expansion a profligate expenditure of resources and racial will initiated a reactionary isolationism which spanned the twentyfourth and twentyfifth centuries space travel even to luna was discontinued contact with the star worlds did not resume till when viceadmiral takada yoshimura brought new earths fleet back to luna a short time later yoshimura encountered ships of the palisarian directorate the old records in luna command revealed the locations of scores of settled worlds the secondary colonies of the directorate were under pressure from toke at the time the directorate and new earth concluded a xenophobic alliance and began searching for other human allies the concept if not the fact of confederation had been created we have our former enemies the toke to thank for midwifing confederation through its birth pains the unrelenting determination of the star lords and caste of warriors united humanity the conflict endured sufficiently long for confederation to become a reality with its military headquartered here in the tunnels of luna confederation and luna command have been growing steadily since perchevski stopped listening he had heard it all before he knew he would hear it again the viewing domes were the meccas of regular hadjs he looked at the earth and wondered how his parents were doing he had not heard from either for a long time he slept while returning to his apartment it had been a long day two messages awaited him the first was from max she wanted to see the xenoarchaeological digs darkside the other was from his employers the printout said senior staff party wednesday pm attendance mandatory contact for further info he sighed pecked out the number max would not like this he tried her number after he had gotten the story max walter yeah thanks for calling hey ive got a problem just got word from my boss i have to go to a staff party tomorrow night cant get out of it i know im sorry hey want to come along all the big wheels will be there the chief of staff navy is supposed to come out with some big announcement no i dont think it has anything to do with the march of ulant thats all smoke screen if you ask me its at the command club can you meet me there okay bye he lay back on his bed and wondered what the news would be and why he had been ordered to make an appearance he was a senior operative but certainly not senior staff he also wondered how long it would be before they called him down and stuck him behind a desk it didnt look as if his vacation was going to go through and they did not like people just loafing around while they waited for an assignment again he thought about his parents seven ad operation dragon engagement he could not write he had too much free time he always worked better when the minutes were quick and crowded something was wrong with his head skeletons were coming out of their closets in there especially the alyce affair the unbreakable walls of tyre were crumbling it had been years since he had thought about alyce why now that hasty psych programing before the mission or were the edges of his sanity just fraying he had two bad days there were moments when he did not know where he was or why or sometimes just who he was he sometimes felt his life was managed by guardian devils the fates pursued him like indefatigable hounds with malice their only joy the ship dropped hyper without warning are we finally there he asked the air he stepped into the corridor most of the landsmen were there jarl kindervoorts voice filled the ship passengers remain in your quarters strap in for acceleration were about to engage a confederation squadron that has been following us engage moyshe said what the hell mouse whats going on jupps not supposed to move for two weeks yet mouse shook his head warningly people were listening the sangaree woman appeared to be in a black rage wheels within wheels benrabi whispered beckharts doing it to us lets hope we didnt suddenly get expendable mousesaid whats going on oh damn i figured you knew beckhart maybe jupp thought he saw a chance maybe that frontier thing broke what thats bullshit the ulantonids know better its the old man got to be better strap in say any prayers you know benrabi had seen several battles while in the line they had ruined his taste for space warfare defeats were too total and final the vessel shuddered while he was strapping in he recognized a heavy missile salvo departing the ship clearly mounted weaponry not customary for her class would the nasty surprises never end for a few seconds his mind fell apart completely into absolute chaos a tiny part of him seemed to be outside watching the disorder allclear bells and his door buzzer sounding bracketed the reassembly process a crewman stepped into his cabin mr benrabi will you come with us please he was as polite as the spider inviting the fly there was going to be trouble a halfdozen people wearing guns backed him benrabi joined them in the passageway another group had collected a stoic mouse how had they blown it kindervoort was directing the pickup himself he looked like a man with a compulsion to explain and to ask moyshe hoped he would not get primitive mouse seemed to fear that but hatchetmen lived by the old testament eye for an eye live by the sword got you boys kindervoort grinned toothily he had an overbite benrabi had an irrational aversion to the man it had nothing to do with the situation more like loathing at first sight kindervoort had a colorless fleshless face his skin lay stretched drumhead tight over prominent cheekbones and a lantern jaw shadowed hollows lay between he achieved a deathshead look when the light was wrong benrabi automatically disliked anyone with that gaunt graveyard look ah here you are said the ships commander as they shuffled into his darkly decorated office the furniture was of mahoganytoned imitation woods crafted in antique styles the walls and ceiling had been artificially timbered to suggest the captains cabin of a sailing ship there were reproductions of antique ships lanterns a compass a sextant a chart of henry the navigator framed prints featuring caravels clippers and the frigate constellation any trouble jarl no sir the bureau doesnt employ fanatics may i present commanders masato igarashi storm and thomas aquinas mcclennon of confederation navy theyre senior field agents of the bureau of naval intelligence commanders ships commander eduard chouteau benrabi pursed his lips he had been afraid mouses real name might be storm mouse had been conspicuously absent from academy during their final year of school that had been the year of the stormhawksblood war in the shadowline moyshe had visited blackworld after that wars end there had been a masato igarashi storm there at the time but their paths had not crossed that masato had taken command of his fathers mercenaries after sangaree treachery had killed his father brothers and most of the family officers kindervoort certainly had him pat though the name mcclennon seemed like a strangers like that of someone he had known a long time ago in an age of innocence he felt less like thomas aquinas mcclennon than he did moyshe benrabi gundaker niven eric earl hollenkamp walter clark or how many men had he been take seats gentlemen chouteau said and relax benrabi dropped into a chair glanced at his partner mouse who also seemed stunned the simple knowing of a secret name bore so many implications the spookiest was that someone might have penetrated the bureau deep enough to have gained access to its primary data system that meant a mole of a generations standing worrying about your navy friends kindervoort asked dont theyre all right they cut and ran and i mean fast guess they figured there wasnt any point to a slugfest when they couldnt gain anything even if they won he chuckled so did chouteau had to be a deep mole nothing else would explain their perpetual success at evading confederation kindervoort planted himself in front of benrabi he leaned close frowning moyshe avoided his deathshead face by staring at chouteau the ships commander leaned back in his fat comfortable chair and half closed his eyes kindervoort said but were not worried about von drachau or admiral beckhart are we he chuckled again moved to mouse why we wanted to see you was these tracers youve got built in walking instels they inflict on us ingenious they did have a mole moyshe had thought he was the only human instel beckhart had pissed and moaned like the expense of it was coming out of his own pocket redundancy had not seemed plausible after that he hadnt really wondered why mouse was along beckhart had issued an assignment nobody questioned the old man not in any way that might look like contradicting his will mouse looked like death warmed over swell it would do him good to get shortsheeted sometimes too how come mouse had not been hurting knowing beckhart the pyschs had programed the headaches maybe to divert attention from mouse had mouse known they had some talking to do beckhart clockwork jerking along often was oiled by the confusion of its parts only the master knew all the secrets of his machinery would there be more silly question beckharts nature semed to demand twists on twists and gaudy smoke screens that concealed truths as slippery as greased snakes his plots however while labyrinthine had their own tightness and logic they were mapped by the finest computers in luna command he ran simulation models against even the most ridiculous contingencies had beckhart calculated a mole into this scheme benrabi suddenly intuited that he and mouse were not partners after all this time they were voyagers sailing parallel but distinct courses they had been programed to hide from one another as much as from their targets and they had been intended for exposure from the beginning beckhart knew about the mole he wanted them taken captive he wanted them to spend a year in seiner service moyshe got mad that was a year stolen from his life the things all biological eh kindervoort asked what this instel remarkable gimmick our detectors didnt quiver when you came aboard course that didnt matter in the long run he was smug damn him so was chouteau chubbyhappy there in his plasticantique made for the archaicist trade captains chair how the hell did you get my name benrabi demanded they were in the mood for talking they might give him something the computers could use to pinpoint the mole kindervoort ignored his question we began monitoring the hyper bands when we broke orbit at carsons we wanted to see if we could catch anything from von drachaus squadron imagine our surprise when we found out somebody was sending from the ship you were plain lucky jarl chouteau said it wasnt luck that we knew they were coming just that they started broadcasting in a ship small enough for us to pinpoint them how had they gotten the word moyshe remembered a raggedyassed freehauler boat that had not lifted on schedule had the freehaulers been the moles couriers black mirage remember that ship somebody would have to have a talk with her people someday was there a relationship between seiners and freehaulers both certainly refused to stop giving grief to confederations policy makers chouteau called out doctor dumaurier come in here lets get on with this kindervoort darted behind moyshe and seized his shoulders benrabi did not resist there was nothing he could do a doctor pushed into the room he poked pinched and sprayed moyshes neck with an aerosol anesthetic he removed an unsettlingly ancient lasescalpel from his medical bag then quoting every doctor who had ever lived since the days when incas trepanned one another with sharp stones he said this will only take a minute you wont feel a thing thats what they told me when they put it in benrabi grumbled he could not go down without registering some kind of protest well just pull the ambergris nodes kindervoort said ed what do you think is it proper to sell them back to navy come next auction chouteau nodded amiably i think so i like it moyshe wished they would stop it made him want to scream youre being unprofessional they were not professionals the harvestships apparently had no real intelligenceoriented security people there was justice in kindervoorts suggestion benrabi and mouse and all the other agents aboard irrespective of their allegiances were after the same thing access to one of the herds of great nightbeasts that produced the critical element in the node being removed from benrabis neck the seiners called it ambergris the name had evolved from that of a morbid secretion of old earth whales once used by perfumers the word could mean anything anyone wanted now the leviathans of the deep no longer had a claim they had been extinct for centuries stars amber space gold and sky diamond were other popular names by any name ambergris was the standard of wealth of the age in the vernacular its name was short and pithy it was the solid waste of a starfish crap this crap fertilized a civilization confederation could not have existed without it without it there would have been no fast startostar communication speed and reliability of communications ultimately define the growth limit of any empire benrabi did not comprehend the physics of instel he knew what the man in the street knew a tachyon spark could be generated in the arc between an ambergris cathode and a bilao crystal anode the spark could be made to carry an ftl message neither ambergris nor bilao crystal could be synthesized the crystal occurred naturally deep in the mantles of several roughly earthsized worlds orbiting supercool stars sierra was the only such world within confederation mining the crystal at depths exceeding thirty kilometers was overwhelmingly expensive bilao crystal was cheaper than ambergris the seiners had a monopoly they were free market capitalists of the first water every node went to the highest bidder the demand for ambergris perpetually exceeded supply despite gargantuan capital demands optimists often assembled the hard and software of an installation merely in hopes that an ambergris node would become available the combined seiner harvestfleets in their best year ever had gleaned fewer than forty thousand nodes most of those had gone to replace nodes already burning out the seiners sold their product at auction on worlds declared temporarily neutral and threatened by all the firepower the fleets could muster the bidders always went along with seiner rules the starfishers might refuse to do business with someone who pushed ambergris alone explained the floodtide of operatives heading toward carsons after danion had begun advertising for groundside technicians the agents had swept in like vultures hoping to feed on the corpse of a betrayed paynes fleet thats what we are benrabi thought me and mouse were vultures no not really were more like raptors falcons flung from beckharts wrist our prey is information were to bring down any morsel that might betray a starfish herd moyshe tried to believe that confederation should control the harvesting and distribution of ambergris he tried hard sometimes he had to tell himself some tall ones to get by otherwise he asked himself too many questions he started worrying irrelevancies like right and wrong his soul slithering past morality shyly merely mumbled i want there was a pain in it that he could not understand it nagged him worse than did his ulcer benrabi dreaded madness he was afraid of a lot of things lately he could not figure it out there one down the doctor dropped movshcs node into a gleaming stainless steel tray plunk exclamation point to the end of a phase of the mission he began suturing moyshes wound how bad will that hurt when the anesthetic wears off not much your neck should be a bit stiff and tender to the touch see me if it gives you any trouble the doctor turned to mouse mouse squirmed a little before he submitted his conscience benrabi supposed he had to make a showing doctors were another of mouses crochets he had no use for them as he often told anyone who would listen benrabi suspected that was why beckhart never had mouse altered during his mission preps we dont like spies the ships commander blurted the way he said it made it sound both spontaneous and irrelevant a non sequitur despite what was happening we moyshe thought these people always say we the worm within him bit he shifted uncomfortably somehow chouteau had taunted his need weird he tried to recapture it to discover what it was that he wanted but like a wet fish it wriggled through his fingers nearly a minute later chouteau pursued his remark but danion needs your expertise to survive and we love her enough to give you another chance he became less distant listen up were going to keep you alive but youre going to work till you drop till you forget why it was that you were sent here and when were done with you were going to ship you home just as ignorant as you were when you signed on men dont give us any more trouble be satisfied being ignorant we need you bad but wont let you push danions big a couple men more or less wouldnt make much difference doctor arent you finished yet just have to sew him up sir one minute commander mcclennon commander storm go back to your cabins try not to aggravate me for a while benrabi rose touched the small bandage behind his ear the numbness had begun to fade he could feel a mild burning it made him think of bigger cuts on his body and soul the doctor finished with mouse there you go commander try not to strain it too much i suggest you let your lady friends do the work for a few days he spoke with a gentle sarcasm that may have masked envy words getting around about you mouse benrabi said mouse did not respond he was in no mood for banter they beat an unescorted retreat seeking their cabins like wounded animals seeking the security of their dens in the passage outside benrabis cabin mouse asked what do we do now moyshe benrabi shrugged i dont know i was hoping youd think of something go for the ride i guess theyve stalemated us just for now mouse stood a little taller weve got a year they cant keep their guard up forever can they they probably can but a little false encouragement felt good still you never know something might turn up look at that the sangaree lady was watching them from her doorway she smiled waved gloating benrabi said think she knows what happened think she helped do us in benrabi shrugged looked at the woman their gazes seemed to ring like meeting swords her smile broadened yes im sure she did eight ad the olden days the broken wings hoping marya would make no sense of the data before him niven told her im checking to see where people go when they leave the broken wings if a statistically significant number emigrate to certain worlds we can begin to infer both their fantasies under dome conditions and what it is that attracts them to a particular type world if its environmental then weve discovered a way to ease the negatives of dome life he hoped he sounded tutorial he cranked it up a notch to be sure ubichi specializes in negative environment highyield exploitation operations employee turnover has become a major problem because of the expense of training and transportation for some of our field operations its in the corporate interest to reduce those costs by keeping our employees happy and comfortable pretty glib he thought he congratulated himself whatre you doing here looking for you we had a date not till holy christ look at the time hey beautiful lady im sorry i got on the track of something i worked right through lunch give me a minute will you ill finish up call my secretary and we can get moving he grinned i have to check in education didnt wear the old earth off of him you wouldnt believe the hell he gave me last night he no longer felt the smile she was turning him to gelatin again mouse did not answer his buzz niven would have been surprised had he done so the call was simply a ploy to get the data out of maryas sight and to seize time to create a plausible structure of lies atop those he had just told he needed no story marya asked no questions except what do you want to do he almost replied with the hard truth ive had it with work but we about covered everything last night angel city isnt swingtown gallantly he added im content just being with you you pick she laughed and they say theres no romance left on old earth how about we just go for a walk i feel like a good long one uh his hands started shaking he had gotten out young but the lessons of an old earths childhood died hard people who did not learn them young also died hard not to walk the streets without a gang of friends was one of the strictest lessons of the motherworld this was not old earth death did not make the streets its home here but the sticktights did lurk there and they might up the ante in the game at any minute how come youre grinning thats no grin lady thats what they call a rictus of fear im old earther you know how hard it would be for me to walk down a street without at least fifty guys to back me up i forgot but theres nothing to worry about here gun you know it i know it here in my head but down here in my guts theres a caveman who says were both liars if its really that hard no dont get upset i didnt say i wouldnt try ive got to get used to it hell i force myself to get out as much as i can i just wanted to warn you so you wont think its your fault if i get a little jumpy and quiet youll settle down youll see this is just about the dullest least dangerous city in the arm a few hours later shortly after the broken wings early night had fallen niven snarled what did you say back at the hospital something about the safest streets in the galaxy the darkness of the alley pressed in his frightened eyes probed the shadows for movement the lasebolt had missed his cheek by a centimeter he still felt the heat of it even my toenails are shaking lady marya fingered her hair a bolt had crisped it while they were running nivens nostrils twitched as they caught the sharp burnt hair odor maryas face was pallid in the glow of a distant streetlight she was shaking too and apparently too angry to respond you got a jealous boyfriend she shook her head gasped this isnt old earth people dont do things like this out here niven dropped to all fours and crawled to the alley mouth heavy work was not his province but he had had the basic programs given all field agents he could make a show if he had to he had to do something now the alley was a culdesac and the rifleman might be teamed a deathtrap could be closing a bolt scarred brick above his head he rolled away growling starscope damn but he had spotted the triggerman the bolt had come from atop a warehouse across the street cant be much of a shot niven mumbled that isnt fifty meters if he could survive the sprint across the street there was a startled exclamation from the gunmans position then a choked wail of fear and pain a body plunged off the warehouse roof and thumped into the street niven was across in an instant shoving himself into the warehouse wall while he studied the corpse the weak light revealed the limper from the marcos lobby his windpipe had been crushed every mans signature is unique and an assassin leaves a grim sort of signature on his victims niven knew this one he peered upward why would mouse be shadowing him not that he objected not right now marya arrived she averted her eyes you must have a guardian angel one of us does he stared at her something clicked it was nothing he could define just a tweak of uneasiness because she had not asked him why anyone would want to kill him a civilian would have asked that right away he looked for the assassins weapon did not see it im going to try to get onto that roof why shouldnt we get out of here another click civilians started screaming for the police outworlds civilians anyway yeah i guess if he had anybody with him we would have heard from them by now but where to go he wondered not the hotel not with the number officially on not with the war rules proclaimed and not to a safehouse he did not yet know what mouse had arranged and he could not make the fallbacks to find out with marya tagging along the death threat had alerted the professional in him had raised barriers that would wall off the whole universe till he had sorted the friends from enemies and noncombatants we could go to my place marya suggested memories of countless spy and detective dramas battled for nivens attention was it all a setup three misses at fifty meters seemed unlikely for even a clumsy assassin but he did not want to believe that marya was involved she was such a magnetic animal woman believe it or not only a cretin would have ignored the possibility completely survival had become the stake on the board he dared not let her know he was suspicious all right he looked around fearfully having no trouble projecting shakiness and confusion but ive got to do a couple of things first their eyes met and he knew he did not want it to be but it was true she was the enemy right now she was trying to find an excuse to stay close to him that would not arouse his suspicions she was not a good actress under stress she could not control the body language signals that betrayed her thoughts he felt betrayed and hurt though he had known her just one day he had always needed to be wanted not for whom or what he was but just as a human being human was she even human there was no sure way of telling without complicated tests geneticists were certain that humanity and the sangaree shared a prehistoric ancestry she might even be the new sangaree resident the last one had been a woman where do you stay he asked she chose not to push she explained how he could get to her apartment you dont have to do this he told her then cursed silently by saying that he had tacitly admitted being the snipers target but sometimes it was necessary to take chances he could at least feed her belief in his lack of suspicion it might be dangerous thats all right ive never been involved in anything like this feigned excitement illuminated her face what have i gotten myself into gun it was smoke screen time sweetheart i dont know i really dont this is the second time ive been jumped but nobody bothered to tell me why last time either they tried it right in the marcos before the day we got here and we dont even know anybody here but people have been following me all the time and if youre an old earther you sense things like that maybe its not you maybe its your friend john i never thought of that i guess its possible i dont really know anything about him the corporation sent him anyway whatevers going on i mean to find out he had yielded just enough distorted truth he hoped to leave her with doubts a lot depended on whether or not the opposition had been able to evade mouses bugscans will you be all right marya should i walk you home ill manage probably be safer without me anyway see you in a while he glanced at the dead man then the streets not a soul was stirring it was odd how people sensed a gathering storm then stayed inside where they would witness nothing and run no risks though this was a warehouse district there should have been some traffic hell where were the security patrols where were the police cruisers he had seen the same thing happen on old earth where the gangs went to their guns at the slightest provocation citizens and enforcers always kept a low profile till the stink of gunsmoke left the air mouse was not at the first fallback nor had he left a message niven did find a hastily scribbled message at the second it told him that marya was the new sangaree resident and as if in afterthought mouse went on to say that he was on the run from a dozen men who had gotten onto him after the incident at the warehouse niven scratched a reply explaining where he would be the drop was large so he left the notes he had taken at the med center those had to be salvaged no matter what maybe by chief navy recruiter for the broken wings he was the bureau angel city station chief niven began drifting killing time in order to give marya a chance to make a move that would illuminate the outfits current thinking after an hour he picked up a sticktight his shadow was a sleepyfaced thug pretending to be a derelict a nottoobright offworlder niven decided angel city was too young and thoroughly ordered to sustain even a oneman bowery the man did not move in they were hoping he would lead them to mouse he observed his shadows tradecraft more out of curiosity than concern the man was a professional but unaccustomed to this kind of work he was probably a shooter or runner grabbed simply because he was available he could be shaken at leisure niven shifted him to the back burner of awareness he drifted toward maryas apartment his nerves settled he decided what he was going to do he did not relax completely they might catch mouse then his life would be worthless but while mouse remained at large he was sure they would not harm him he shook the sticktight found a public comm woke the angel city station chief explained where the med center information was hidden he used a word code the other side would need hours to unravel assuming they were tapping at all he reached maryas apartment as dawn began coloring the dome the molecularly stacked plastic glimmered redly as the sunlight changed its angle of incidence the plastic would alternate between transparency and a progression up an iridescent spectrum he was tired but still alert and exhilarated because he had handled himself well marya responded to his knock instantly where have you been she demanded ive been worried sick she peered over his shoulder along the second floor hallway checking for mouse for her backup somebody started following me around i didnt know what to do so i just walked around till he gave up or i lost him gun i dont understand all this why honey i dont know and ive been thinking hard all i can figure is maybe one of ubichis competitors thinks im after something besides that research data he paused pretending to have been startled by a thought hey they never did tell me why they want the data i just assumed maybe its for a project thats stepping on somebodys toes had he been what he claimed the possibility would have been real ubichi maintained its own armed forces the frontier corporations played rough uncertainty filled maryas eyes for a moment bureau miscalculated he thought he could have convinced her had he looked like a social psychologist his cover could be checked all the way back to his birth the bureau was thorough that way especially beckharts section but niven looked like an old earth heavy and that was the death of any other credential a man could present mom whats going on a darkhaired girl of seven or eight stumbled into the room she ground sleepy eyes with the backs of her fists she was small for her age a breastless miniature of her mother brandy this is my friend dr niven i told you about him oh less than enthusiastic niven thought in fact her expression said he was a threat to her world she was a beautiful child straight out of a toy ad niven could not frame a compliment that did not sound inane hi brandy you can call me gun its short for gundaker gundaker what kind of name is that old earth oh she wrinkled her lip mom called you doctor michaels sick he turned to marya the woman still stood at the door my son brandys younger brother hes got some kind of bug looks like flu im not that kind of doctor brandy but if theres anything i can do do you know any good stories michael dont like the ones i make up and moms never here she glanced at her mother accusingly she was good niven thought better than marya what kind of stories pirates olden days war stories richard hawksblood and gneaus julius storm did you know they fought a war right here on the broken wings he mentioned it casually conversationally fishing for a reaction the war in the shadowline the last great mercenary war had taken place on blackworld not long after the encounter on the broken wings sangaree interests had taken a beating because of the shadowline but one or two families had begun recouping here before the shockwaves from blackworld had died getting caught with their hands in there had cost them control of numerous legitimate corporations and the lives of several family chieftains the disaster had been so huge and widespread that it had become sangaree legend the girl just shrugged implying that blackworld meant nothing to her pirates probably she seemed to lose interest she left the room cooking sounds followed her departure must not have heard about the shadowline niven thought what family did marya represent a minor one crowding the first families because of their loss of face on blackworld surely not one that had been involved there shes a doll he told marya you thought about getting her into modeling no she wouldnt sit down relax ill fix you something to eat then ill move michael in here you can sleep in the kids bed brandy brought coffee it was real he discovered what marya had meant about brandy he had not caught it earlier because she had not looked his way the girls one eye trained wildly walleyed and appeared blind he showed no reaction to her pained defiant stare her sensitivity screamed at him he supposed the damage was recent niven indulged in tradecraft during the few seconds when brandy had returned to the kitchen and marya had not yet returned he examined his surroundings critically the time would come when he would have to report accurately where every speck of dust had lain the apartment was cramped that was typical of dome city living quarters it was sparsely populated by ragged secondhand furniture that was to be expected of poor folks and marya clearly was not an obsessive housekeeper cobwebs hung in the ceiling corners junk cluttered the chairs and floors her sloppiness had nothing to do with poverty or lack of time only with habit sangaree at home had animal servants who picked up after them marya shared her roof with whole tribes of roaches dirt streaked the plastic walls the curtains were frayed and soiled it was exactly the sort of place where a busy impoverished woman would come to rest she was crafty this one she had converted her ethnic liabilities into assets but would a poor woman serve real coffee when coffee had to come all the way from old or new earth he did not call her on it he might give something away by revealing that he recognized the real thing when he tasted it most old earthers would not because every ounce went into export they were fencing now subtly with rapiers consisting of little tests one of the rules of his profession was never to yield anything concrete she was not giving him anything either certainly not enough to understand her who could comprehend the sangaree mind the admiral had been trying for decades he barely got by like mouse though beckhart did not want to understand not really he wanted to destroy comprehension was just a weapon in his arsenal they sat in silence for several minutes he watched marya over his cup she considered him he wondered what strange thoughts might be running through her alien brain id better check on michael gun he followed her as far as the bedroom door the room was tiny it contained two dilapidated beds one for marya one for her children marya settled on the edge of the one containing a pale fiveyearold the boy watched niven warily michael this is my friend dr niven hes going to stay with us for a while hi mike not mike the childs voice was weak but angry michael after my greatgrandfather marya winced michael radiated pride niven controlled his surprise right michael it is he had been wrong almost fatally wrong these sangaree would know the shadowline well there had been but one sangaree with the human name michael michael dee the man who had engineered the war the man who had been both the pride and despair of his race the man who had paid the ultimate price for failing brandy says you like pirate stories i knew a pirate once only he wasnt a pirate when i met him thats what he is now i grew up and went to school and he grew up and became a pirate i dont think hes ready for that right now gun marya seemed honestly worried im going to have to call a doctor i think niven was surprised at himself he was concerned too you want me to call a cabcar what was he doing the kid was sangaree his purpose in life was to help guide that species to a final solution little ones became big ones oh no theres one from the hospital who lives right upstairs i dont know her very well but go get her woman ill manage here she stared something within her softened momentarilythe hidden woman the one behind the one behind the one she was trying to portray showed through she kissed his cheek thanks gun when he pulled her closer later ill be back as soon as i can he had not been after a kiss he had attached a tiny chameleon transmitter to the back of her collar she closed the apartment door behind her niven inserted a receiver into his ear while pretending to scratch smiling wryly he patted himself where she had touched him had she done the same to him there was no reason why she should have to go out for a doctor she would have sufficient medical background herself if there was any truth to her cover he smiled again marya was no tactician either are you my moms new lover he was surprised little girls did not ask questions like that no not yet she needs one do you think shes pretty i think shes gorgeous he was uncomfortable he did not know how to socialize with children the only child he knew was jupps boy horstjohann maybe she should get married again are you married marya had reached a public comm she was briefing someone following her part of a conversation and trying to guess the other half while carrying on another with brandy proved impossible he did hear marya ask for a deep trace on his cover that meant he had won a round she had doubts or wanted to have them which came to the same thing no i never met the right lady this was one bold child did she know she was not human probably from the little he had heard sangaree had no childhood in the human sense their children were shielded from nothing they were treated as and expected to behave as miniature adults dont know if id like you though honest too he thought he went to check on michael the boy still watched him with wide wary eyes he was bad sick marya would not risk a human doctor otherwise there were few greater risks the underground sangaree could take physicians could sometimes spot the subtle differences between species marya returned with the doctor before nivens conversation with brandy became impossible the doctor he decided was tame she worked with a confidence and quickness that betrayed her niven whispered to marya brandys been matchmaking she laughed husbandshopping for me again she never gives up i dont think i passed the exam doesnt matter i wont get caught in that trap again whyd you bring them out here on old earth parents usually put their children into public care as soon as they were born niven had had an unusual childhood in that he had spent much of it with his mother he still kept in touch with her but had lost track of his father years ago the shedding of children was a common practice on the tamed outworlds too fewer than a quarter of confederations children were raised by their biological parents marya was shocked her sangaree sense of family had been outraged but she could not tell him that i forgot you do things differently where you come from yeah it would be convenient sometimes but theyre my kids dont try to explain just call it one of the differences between the inner worlds and the frontier im getting used to them the doctor returned from the bedroom i gave him a broadspectrum antibiotic marya and an antiviral its nothing serious see that he gets plenty of bed rest and lots of fluids and keep an eye on his temperature itll go up give him some aspirin if it gets too high do you need a thermometer marya nodded she portrayed embarrassment beautifully you did that well lady niven thought too poor to afford a thermometer but you serve genuine coffee he smiled she was doing a chemopsychiatric internship but had to summon an outside doctor was she driven by some secret death wish nice to have met you doctor niven the doctor told him you too he watched her go to the door there was no pride in the way she walked you want to get some sleep now gun marya asked going to have to but would his nerves permit it here in the heart of enemy territory they would after he had skinned down to his underwear had flopped into maryas bed and had told michael good night captain the lights went out he wakened once hazily when marya slipped into bed beside him he mumbled foggily then knew nothing for hours he wakened slowly gradually he realized that the broken wings truncated day had sped by it was night again he did not remember where he was till he rolled against the woman that simple movement initiated three tempestuous days marya was insatiable the only word he found to fit her was hungry he had never encountered a woman who had such a need for a man niven astounded himself their lovemaking became so savage so narrowly scoped that it was more like combat as if let he who first cries hold enough be damned forever they seemed to do nothing but sleep and copulate making attack after attack in some sort of sexual war the outside world seemed to have lost all meaning yet there was method there was rationality in struggling to please marya who was struggling to distract him niven kept himself motivated by remembering who she was he kept trying to convince himself that he was doing this to sabotage the enemy chain of command he knew marya was not motivated entirely by lust either oh but they did have one hell of a good time on the rumpled sheets of that battlefield in the interims niven sometimes wondered what had become of mouse mouse he reflected sure had the free hand he always wanted brandy recognizing the way of things had taken her brother out the first night they were staying upstairs with the doctor michael looking a little better sometimes wandered in moped around without saying much then wandered out again brandy stayed away all the time what are we doing niven once muttered to himself they were enemies to the death that was the prime rule the blood rule by which he and she were supposed to live and die yet they were denying it or sublimating it in the form of love he began to dread missions end debriefing he would have to answer questions he would have to explain niven was snoring he had one arm beneath maryas neck the building shuddered like a dog shaking off water a window cracked tableware clattered onto the kitchen floor the whole neighborhood reverberated to the explosion niven jerked upright d he grunted what what was that an explosion they dressed almost racing reflections of dancing firelight colored the cracked window marya looked out oh holy sant what the warehouse eh ill be right back whats that a yell had come from somewhere downstairs cries and screams followed it niven knew that first yell that was mouse in assassins mind earlier he had seen the shape of the needlegun lumping her underwear in a dresser drawer he beat her to it the door crashed inward a ragged battered bloody mouse hurtled through he was so keyed for action that he looked three meters tall easy niven said gesturing with the needlegun everythings under control mouse mouse was not hurt the blood was not his own got everything he croaked through a dry throat message away got to bend the bitch and get out that was their business but niven could not permit the womans murder that she was sangaree seemed irrelevant no theres no need not this time mouse was coming down thought was replacing action he glanced at nivens weapon at the woman all right youre the boss doc but ive got to get something out of this wherere the damned kids upstairs but i wont let you kill children either wouldnt think of it doc wouldnt even drown a puppy you know old john so tie her up will you cant have her coming after us he backed out the door siren howls tortured the streets the grumble of a gathering crowd slipped tentacles into the room sorry it had to end this way marya but business is business i almost believed she stared at him for an instant she looked small and defenseless he reminded himself that she was sangaree that she would become instant death if he were careless i suppose youre soothing your conscience i wouldnt if the tables were turned youve hurt us too much already not a smart thing to say to somebody pointing a gun at you niven thought he shrugged maybe its not conscience though a different weakness youd probably have to be human to understand he left it to her to figure out what he meant mouse returned with the children and doctor in the process he had acquired a weapon tie these three too doc the doctor was more frightened than brandy or michael humans on the fringes of the business generally imagined operations by and against the organization to be more deadly than they were brandy asked whatre you doing gun straight out emotionlessly as if she were used to being under the gun business dear oh she sped her mother a disgusted look hes the starduster marya told her and you fell for his story niven tore sheets into strips tied the doctor then the girl then michael told you i knew a pirate captain good mouse said let me have the gun doc eh why because i need it puzzled niven handed the weapon over mouse tossed it into the hallway niven shook his head said wed better get moving they wont stay disorganized forever one thing first mouse shoved his weapon under his arm he took a hypo from the doctors bag and filled it from an ampule he carried in his pocket this ones for your greatgrandfather kids and all his brothers and sisters nieces and nephews what the hell are you doing niven demanded just business doc turnabouts fair play right we should expand our own markets he raised michaels sleeve marya understood instantly no piao not my children kill me if you want but dont mouse answered her with a tight smile just business lady gag her doc hurry we got to get the stuff out before navy pops to weve cut out the instel here niven suddenly understood what mouse was doing hey you cant he wanted to stop it to protest to refuse got confused by the reference to navy stardust mouse nodded smiling wickedly his hand strayed toward his weapon oh how could the man be so cruel that was murder in the worst possible way marya needed gagging desperately her screams could attract attention dazed niven silenced her her flesh seemed icy beneath his fingertips he felt the rage and hatred boiling inside her she started shaking for an instant he thought she was having a seizure mouse injected the children that wicked little smile kept playing with his lips he was blissfully happy in his cruelty why did he hate so much come on doc theyre on their way down cant you hear them the crowd noise and sirens were yielding to the rumble of assault landing craft descending on penetration runs the broken wings atmosphere howled its protest of the violation jupp was on his way someone stuck his head through the doorway mouse shot missed jumped into the hallway and shot again doc will you come on im sorry marya really its the way things had to be he snagged the needlegun in passing skipped a fresh corpse and pursued mouse into the emergency stairwell later as they waited in the crowd watching the invaders pour through the main city locks niven asked what was that crap about getting off before navy finds out were supposed to be the starduster and piao remember but theyll know when not yet look the marines entering the city wore uniform gear but it was not service issue it was like nothing niven had ever seen mouse had chosen the waiting place with care a man loaded with brass headed directly toward them mr piao he avoided looking at niven his attitude seemed one of mixed awe fear and loathing you have the material for my officers that i do colonel mouse proffered a thick package congratulations your men are as efficient as ours the colonel reddened his mouth snapped open but he caught himself carefully he said more so mr piao as youll someday learn all things are possible to those who believe the colonel riffled through a stack of copies other officers gathered behind him he started passing them papers lets drift doc they can handle it niven did not miss the wariness in all those marine eyes what was that all about oh they think were piao and the starduster too they think we worked a deal with luna command so we could knock over the sangaree and take control of their nets whats all the smoke screen for weve got to keep the starduster story alive at least till jupp makes his hit otherwise they might evacuate their production facilities by the way i wanted to say you did a job digging all that info out the old man is going to love you niven did not follow it its too byzantine for me are the sangaree supposed to find out that theyre marines and then figure we didnt say anything about the production facilities because that would cut off our own supply wait till youre in on one of the old mans complicated ones mr piao a marine noncomm asked yes if youll follow me sir your transportation marines surrounded them a precaution against assassination niven supposed those bounties still existed sounds of sporadic fighting came from the city believing the raiders to be starduster men the sangaree minions would battle hard the stardusters viciousness toward collaborators was legend the marines guided them into an armored personnel carrier they had it to themselves it rumbled away toward angel port mouse i get the feeling the admiral threw in a few twists just to make it interesting what happens when the starduster finds out that weve been using his name in vain mouse was in a bright expansive mood he had had a beautiful day he had carved his initials on the sangaree soul he had vandalized their house of crime ill tell you a secret doc if you promise you wont ever let the old man know you know he looked at niven expectantly all right i give what you really are the starduster what the starduster piao the old man invented the whole thing the starduster is whoever he points at and says you well shit mouse i really needed that here youve had me scared to death that the son of a bitch was going to crawl out of the woodwork and cut my throat i got a years vacation coming after debriefing and dammit as soon as it goes through im going to dont count on it doc not when youre working for the old man october captain jupp von drachau commanding special action task force iv with a heavy siege squadron attached surprises and commences reduction action against sangaree manufacturing facilities hidden in the inner asteroid belt surrounding delta sheol a white dwarf in the minicluster called the hell stars destruction is swift savage and complete at the same time confederation and local police agencies begin closing down the drug networks formerly rooted on the broken wings admiral beckhart has taken every point in a victorious round against his oldest and most favored enemy nine ad operation dragon danion benrabi started to push into his cabin still glaring at the sangaree woman i shouldve bent her on the broken wings mouse snarled you shouldve he had not forgiven moyshe the weakness that had left her alive i cant stomach contingency assassinations mouse yeah look over there and think about it some more how much mischief could she do all right so it makes a perverted kind of sense if you figure a ghost like the broken wings will come back to haunt you it will it always does maybe ill settle this up benrabi shook his head not here not now not after what we just went through i didnt mean right now im not a fool moyshe it would look like an accident let it be mouse there was no compassion in mouse i should be flint too benrabi thought but i dont have his knack for hating benrabi found the things and people in his life too transient for more than mild aversion shed better move fast when we hit dirt again then mouse growled one getaway is all she gets i hope we find homeworld before i check out benrabi felt a twinge of jealousy mouse knew the nature of his grail his feet were set inalterably on the path that led to it though it was a cup of blood for your sake i hope so moyshe laughed softly bitterly sometimes he had to or scream see you later he pushed into his cabin he hoped their year cooped up here would soften mouse but feared there was no hope marya would not let time work memories of her children would lead her on mouses hate was old and strong and deeper than confederation culture usually ingrained if he were indeed a storm that would explain it the storms of the iron legion had had an oldfashioned biblical way of looking at things sangaree manipulations during the war in the shadowline had destroyed the family but mouse did not have to be a storm his hatred could be stardustrelated the joy that burns the dream that kills czyzewski had called the drug only seconds before his own addiction had carried him into the big endless dream of death the drug was the leading plague of the age and had touched virtually every human being it had taken more lives than had the bitter ulantonid war stardust was the pushers dream it was immediately addictive one flight and the user was hooked forever an addict could not taper off neither could he withdraw cold nor could he substitute another less fearsome drug in its place for the poor inner worlder addiction ended hard by suicide by being slain while trying to steal enough to finance another fix or by finding death in the constant dogfighting among have and havenot addicts and many times the end came slowly screamingly in an institution where the warders could do nothing but watch protect the world by keeping the addict restrained and try to develop hearts of stone the sordid facts of stardust addiction tickled the sangaree conscience not at all they had a product to market a stellar to turn they were not innately cruel they simply did not see humans as anything but animals to be exploited do the cattleman butcher and customer consider themselves cruel to the beef animal sangaree thought their customers better than cattle more like what renaissance europeans thought of black africans semiintelligent apes benrabi lay on his bunk and wondered about his partner mouse claimed his assignments were all countersangaree to date they had been and mouse had prosecuted them with a savage zeal with cruel little touches like the injection of maryas children but what was he doing here now working against the starfishers that did not compute following the announcement of von drachaus raid mouse had been in the clouds as if he were a skying addict himself the sangaree were the demons of the confederation era they passed as human easily their homeworld lay somewhere outside the arm compared to humanity they were few in number it was rumored that they could breed only under their native sun the sangaree produced little for themselves they preferred instead to raid to deal in drugs and slaves and guns confederation resented them bitterly man was their prime victim the nonhuman races considered them merely a nuisance someone softly knocked on moyshes door come in he said mouse thought it was you it was the first he had seen mouse since kindervoorts inquisition the words around mouse told him theyve all decided that were evil mean bad wicked nasty crude rude and unattractive spies he laughed the sangaree woman passed the word i suppose maybe why dont you slide out there and see whats going on its good for a laugh hell youd think we were as rare as dodos and smelled like skunks dont we morally ahh moyshe what the hell is it with you these days hey you should see the competition laughing up their sleeves but we get the last laugh theyre on their way kindervoorts troops snatched a couple beekies this morning same way he got us knew they were coming looks like he knew about everybody except strehltsweiter mouse theyve got to have a mole in luna command somebody deep thats what i figure its the only answer that adds up moyshe you should see the kids with their holy attitudes like they think theyre a plane above us poor innocents mouse smiled at a memory you know that williams girl i shocked the hell out of her asked her her price she missed the point thats real innocence ah youth mouse what happened to our innocence and idealism remember how it was in academy we were going to save the universe somebody found our price he frowned dropped onto the spare bunk thats not really true were doing it you know its just that the mechanics of it arent what we thought theyd be we didnt understand that everything has to be a tradeoff that whenever we changed things to what we thought they should be we had to do it at somebody elses expense hell youve got me doing it what thinking moyshe whats happening with you you always were a moody guy but ive never seen you like youve been lately ever since we left carsons benrabis defenses stood to arms he did not dare open up two reasons you just did not do that these days and he was not sure what was happening himself so he masked the shadowed walls of festung selbst behind a halftruth im just depressed maybe because i didnt get my vacation maybe because of mother i had a bag full of things i wanted to take home some stamps and coins i picked up in corporation zone some stuff i managed to get back from the broken wings this beautiful handcarved bone trivet from tregorgarth and some new earth butterflies that would be worth a mint anywhere else bullroar my friend bullroar mouse peered at him from beneath lowered brows im getting to know you moyshe benrabi i can tell when somethings got you by the guts you better do something itll eat you alive if you keep it locked up inside mouse was right about one thing they were getting to know one another too well mouse was reading him now and wanting to help maybe whens your next chess thing ill come lose a few games tip a few brews with the troops mouse frowned he knew a light show when he saw one getting too damned close mouse glanced at jerusalem at which benrabi had been scribbling well i didnt mean to porlock moyshe he rose i dont know if well have any more tournaments kindervoort says well make danion sometime tonight thats why i came over thought youd want to know benrabi brightened hey good he pushed the jerusalem papers back rose started pacing the waiting is getting to me a little work the rendezvous with the harvestship was anticlimactic there were no brass bands and no curious crowds at the receiving bay the only seiners around were those who had been sent to show the landsmen to their quarters and brief them about their job assignments no one of any stature came to greet them moyshe was disappointed his guide did his work quickly and efficiently and told him youd better turn in this is the middle of our night ill be back early to help walk you through your first day okay thanks paul moyshe examined the man paul was much like the seiners he had met before the man examined him too and struggled with prejudices as he did so good night mr benrabi see you in the morning but he did not amy showed up instead and took both benrabi and mouse under her wing keeping an eye on us eh mouse asked she colored slightly yeah sort of jarl said he wanted to keep you together so youd be easier to watch you dont have to be embarrassed we understand this isnt my kind of thing commander storm im a plumber not a counterspy call me mouse please or mr iwasaki whatever you want mouse are you ready for breakfast she turned to moyshe im still moyshe benrabi all right yes i could eat three breakfasts work commenced immediately after tool issue and a brief class in how to find ones way around the harvestship it never let up moyshe forgot his screaming need in the pressure of the following weeks labors the memories that had been gnawing the underbelly of his soul vanished from consciousness he flew easy not thinking not observing not questioning he stayed too busy or too tired the seiners were true to their promise to work the landsmen hard the mindquirk he thought of as the image of the gun bothered him some but only mildly as he wandered through daydreams while replacing wrecked piping or damaged flow meters he seized the vision played with it wrapped a few extended daydreams around it it helped pass the time kept busy he began to enjoy life again something strange is going on here mouse he whispered once when amy was out of hearing whats that this ship isnt hurt as bad as they want us to think look around i couldnt tell i never did any time in the line all i know about ships is you get on and after a while you get back off someplace else what it amounts to is theres a lot of damage but nothing that would put something this size out of action they couldve handled it themselves just might have taken them a couple of years so so maybe were here for some other reason my intuition has been sniffing around that ever since carsons why would they bring outsiders in if they didnt absolutely have to i dont know the only reason you overstaff a ship is so you have personnel redundancy in case you take battle casualties but on a ship this big two hundred people or even a thousand dont mean a thing and who would the seiners fight confederation not with a bunch of fifth columnists aboard give it time itll come to the top no matter what they hope they cant keep everything hidden forever can it amys coming curious he thought mouse did not seem interested in starfisher motives at all benrabis first week did have its rough edges every encounter with the sangaree woman became a crisis and she could not be avoided her team repairing air ducting was working the same service passages as his she would not leave mouse alone and the certainty of purpose which made mouses responses predictable taunted benrabi with worries about his own incompleteness she did not bait him she knew that he would do nothing but look at her soulfully reflecting the paingiving back at her she appeared from a crosspassage only seconds behind amy damn moyshe swore her again restrain me moyshe you got it partner be my ass in the fire too well the rat again the sangaree woman stood with her hands on her hips defying him to act backing her were several idealistic youngsters she had sold them a simpleminded antispy package what an unpleasant surprise butchered anyone lately spy therere lots of nonconfies aboard you ought to be as happy as a hog kneedeep in slop a curious metaphor benrabi thought she must have chosen it especially for the tregorgarthian kids the youths looked at one another embarrassed they shared her views and were a rather rude bunch themselves but their society had taught them that too much bluntness could get a person killed tregorgarth was a rough world you could start with me you know what i think about your fascist military dictatorship or dont you have the guts she knew damned well that he had but assumed that he would not respond in front of witnesses or that she could take him if he did she was fooling herself there benrabi thought she believed mouse strictly a strikefrombehind man he was a lot more two decades of training and several thousand years of combat experience had gone into making him the perfect organic killing machine moyshe did not know of a weapon or a system of close combat that mouse did not know as well as any man who had ever lived short of pulling guns there was little she and her whole crowd could have done were he to lose his temper benrabi could sense the aching in mouse could feel mouses need to show her but his partner controlled himself that too had been part of his training benrabi had to exercise some selfcontrol himself the womans behavior had eroded his compassion she was playing a more dangerous game than she suspected it would backfire on her if she did not ease up benrabi was sure the woman was working to some carefully prepared plan her acting had not improved her easy confidence betrayed but she was vulnerable her achilles heel was her hatred benrabi was sure mouse would exploit it miss gonzalez amy said if youre quite finished we have work to do and i suggest you return to yours before theres cause for an inquiry into the absence of your supervisor the sangaree woman backed down she was not ready to jeopardize her mission i feel like a fool benrabi muttered eyes downcast mouse said so do i i cant take it forever moyshe then amy told them im glad you restrained yourselves things are ugly enough without our getting physical she intrigued benrabi he watched her a lot when she was not looking he was glad she did not go for chestpounders he was not the type and in the back of his mind he had begun formulating designs upon her over a flow chart thick with black xs indicating trouble spots while amy was off requisitioning a special wrench mouse muttered its getting hard moyshe i know what shes doing but shes trying to make us take ourselves out of the play hang on one of these nights indefatigable mouse when benrabi finished work he had barely enough energy to eat then tumble into bed but mouse got out and mingled made new acquaintances and found new interests he sponged up every bit of information that crossed his path his latest thing was the middle american football popular with seiners they had arrived just in time for the preseason excitement his interest gave him an excuse to move around moyshe was afraid having established his pattern of mobility mouse might arrange a fatal encounter with marya somewhere far from the usual groundling stomping ground moyshe wondered if he should catch her alone and try to make her understand he remembered the broken wings he was her primary target she was trying to get at him through mouse the hurt he had done her was more personal more egoslashing than what mouse had done by her reasoning what had happened to the children could be laid at his doorstep he could have prevented it he would have to watch his back mouse was not the only one who could arrange an accident is she alone mouse asked they like lots of backup i havent spotted anybody yet they could be playing it close what i want to know is why is she here everybody else has tried something but she just keeps on being obnoxious shes waiting for what mouse shrugged well find out the hard way i guess heres a notion moyshe said it just came to me a way to warn her how tomorrows recreation day right they had been promised one day off a week this would be the first and those kids you know how tregorgarthians are theyre challenging everybody to meet them in a martial arts elimination tournament think you could manage them without hurting anybody mouse thought i dont know if i can pull the punches anymore it would be good for the boys too tregorgarthians away from home tended to become bullies their homeworld schooled them to believe that those who did not fight at the drop of a hat were cowards smacked around a little they civilized fast might give them second thoughts about letting her suck them in benrabi mused theyve got to know shes up to something theyd back off if they knew i was dangerous eh im hoping sex seems to be her main hold on them i see one sneaking out of her room almost every morning whos sneaking out of whose cabin amy had returned just gossiping moyshe replied one of the girls has an assembly line going she bit landsmen theyre right about you being immoral moyshe forbore observing that the seiners seemed to be just as loose as his own people amys priggishness was personal not cultural she was the only starfisher he knew who talked that morality nonsense mouse did not forbear when did you lose yours miss morality huh my what your cherry youre no more pure than old earth air she sputtered reddened mumbled something about all landsmen being alike youre right satyrs and nymphs the lot of us mouse licked his lips winked asked whatre you doing tonight benrabi grinned mouse was teasing her as he had been all week long but she did not realize it he used a subtler approach when he really wanted a woman something within her clicked as it did each time mouse put her on the defensive a different colder personality surfaced long enough to carry her past the rough spot sleeping alone did you decide where you want to cut that water main then another quick change of subject oh jarl said to tell you to sharpen your teeth hes bringing some people to play you tomorrow you too moyshe mouse had become chess champion of service ship three the seiners had been excited about it they were fond of the game and eager for new challenges why me im no good better than you think anyway we like everybody to find their place in the pecking order her hardness faded as quickly as it had come i wanted to go over to twentythree west if i could get permission he pulled the excuse off the wall for the salving of his ego he did not like losing all the time even at games i heard theres a guy over there with some early english coins victorians she looked puzzled mouse laughed didnt you know were both mad collectors coins and stamps mostly because theyre easy to lug around frowning over them amy reminded benrabi of alyce so many of their facial expressions were similar it looks like youre mad everything chess archaicism collections football and women thats him not me benrabi said what about people amy asked arent women people mouse countered she shook her head she was a starfisher and starfishers could not understand even archaicism was just a hobby for them landsmen plunged themselves into things because they did not want to get involved with people people hurt the growing closeness between mouse and benrabi and the apparent friendships that had taken shape among the other foreigners had confused amy she did not recognize their lack of temporal depth a critical difference between confederation and starfisher relationships was that of durational expectancy the idea of a close relationship that could be severed quickly painlessly as easily as it had been formed would not occur to a starfisher but they lived in a closed static culture where a severely limited number of people passed through their lives friendships were expected to last a lifetime benrabi was leery of the morrow the isolation of the landsmen far out in a remote residential cube had minimized cultural friction during the week but kindervoort for whom the outsiders had become a pet project planned to make recreation day a gigantic college smoker with floods of seiners being exposed to landside ways still trying to gentle everyone in moyshe supposed kindervoort was a rather thoughtful admirable cop he might get to like the man yet ten ad the olden days a victory celebration max youre beautiful dont sound so damned astonished walter oh i didnt mean i just never saw you dressed up before quit while youre ahead friend by the way i notice youve changed a little too commander she stared pointedly at the double sunbursts on his high collar i thought you said you were a dip naval attach√© you know that no i didnt naval attach√© isnt that the same thing as head spy bureau of naval intelligence perchevski reddened not always some of us dont mind me walter she smiled im just thinking out loud that would explain some of the mysteries about you mysteries about me come on max im as mysterious as a pumpkin here we are a marine accepted his id badge poked it into a slot he eyed a readout screen somewhere out of sight thank you sir is this miss travers sir yes he consulted the screen again thank you sir have a nice evening sir maam a door slid open maam max asked do i look that old come on max isnt he going to check me he did youre all right you dont have a bomb in your purse thanks a lot what do they do to you in academy why cant officers be polite like that nice young marine you were just complaining max youre sure contrary tonight whats the matter he handed his overtunic to the marine corporal in the cloak room helped max with her cape im scared walter ive never even been near the command club i dont know how to talk to senators and admirals know something max what ive never been here before either well lose our virginity together ill tell you this though admirals and senators put their pants on one leg at a time same as us and theyll paw your leg under the table the same way i do male or female she seized his arm as they entered the huge grand ballroom her grip tightened both the way you look tonight he slowed the place had no walls an allround animated hologram concealed the rooms boundaries portrayals of navys mightiest ships of war lay every direction but downward perchevski automatically scanned the starfields he saw no constellations he recognized maxs grip became painful i feel like im falling walter local gravity had been allowed to decline to lunar normal to reinforce the deepspace effect somebodys really putting on the dog perchevski grumbled commander madam said another polite marine may i show you to your seats the place was thronged of course how many people going to be here tonight first lance he was getting jittery he still did not know why he was one of the elect nearly two thousand sir here sir the marine pulled a chair for max but he had scanned the faces of his tablemates his jaw refused to continue working a few of them he knew personally the chief of staff navy and the director of naval intelligence he recognized from the holonetnews max recognized them too she leaned and whispered who the hell are you really walter she was so awed she could not look at the high brass perchevski stared at his place setting just as awed im starting to wonder myself thomas only one man alive insisted on calling him by that name perchevski forced his gaze to rise and meet that of his boss sir he flicked a sideways glance at mouse who was eyeing max appreciatively while whispering to his own ladyfriend how are you doing max mouse asked you too yamamoto thomas the csn and dni want to be introduced yes sir he evaded admiral beckharts eyes by fixing his gaze on the one seat still vacant he moved around to shake hands with the brass while beckhart murmured the introductions this is the man beckhart said he made it all go congratulations commander the csn told perchevski and thank you i understand youll receive the swords and diamonds not to mention the prize perchevski could not conceal his bewilderment theyve got to be talking about the operation he thought swords and diamonds to the lunar cross right more chest hardware with another medal and fifty pfenning he could buy a cheap cup of soycoffee or pay half a conmark without thank you sir id rather have my vacation sir his boldness startled him even more than did his bitterness the dni peered at beckhart up to your tricks with the troops admiral maam perchevski grinned the mission was worth it after all just to get here and see that look on beckharts face this man obviously doesnt have the faintest damn notion of what hes doing here perchevski threw oil on the flames by nodding behind his bosss back he entered his commanders presence only rarely which was just as well the admiral brought out the contrariness in him itll be clear soon enough beckhart said i just thought it would be a nice surprise go back to your friend thomas i see she knows mouse as perchevski departed he heard the dni snap and see that they get some time off the whole human race cant keep your pace yes maam perchevski winced he would get time all right and he would pay for it beckhart would get it back with interest what was that about max asked you looked like they were talking about the firing squad theyre going to give me a medal theres something about medals they just dont seem adequate for surviving a virus she wore a sarcastic grin the high brass fell silent people began to rise mouse abandoned the finger game he had been playing with his companion perchevski turned jupp von drachau looked old and haggard his face had grown pasty since last they had met hi tom he greeted no one else at the moment the holograms faded perchevski spied the news crews and cameras they had concealed i begin to understand he muttered what max asked lady youre about to see the full might of the luna command propaganda apparat in action von drachau dropped into the empty chair mouse he said by way of greeting tom you seen horstjohann sorry jupp i havent had a chance perchevski replied was it bad from hunger and they drag me down here without a chance to he considered the seniority of the rest of his tablemates closed his eyes leaned back whos he max whispered jupp von drachau we were classmates in academy was he in on the same thing you were yeah sort of navy stewards began serving dinner it was a smorgasbord sort of meal with the diners offered a chance to select from trays bearing bits and pieces from different confederation worlds whatever you do dont miss the january wine perchevski told max they always let you have a little at these things thought youd never been here before mouse has mouse yamamoto oh you know him too we were classmates too the holo cameras started whining they faded behind a new holo scene this one was no animation it was a speeded recording of events that had taken place inside a warships situationdisplay tank green friendly blips were approaching a huge chunk of asteroidal material circling a white dwarf sun more white dwarves blazed in every direction perchevski could almost feel the heat the smash of the solar winds the hell stars he murmured thats where it was the asteroid began sparkling large red blips scuttled away behind the cover of a storm of red pinpoints fast green blips raced after them the asteroid coruscated christ perchevski said what the place was an arsenal max did not understand she was a navy brat but had not done service herself whats going on walter or whatever your name is thats where jupp was its a display record of a battle the confederation warships began their assault jupp had had his share of firepower the guests munched complacently while watching the memory of the death of a sangaree station the fast boats trying to carry children to safety did not outrun navys bloodhungry hounds nor could the stations defenses stand up to the pounding delivered by a heavy siege squadron but the sangaree fought like a cat cornered by dogs and left scars on von drachaus command here there navys professionals commented on the action like detached spectators at a ball game perchevski glared at his plate von drachau he noted was less excited than he the steward kept bringing the courses he had to remind max to drink her wine the vintages of january were confederations finest and rarest the sangaree persisted despite an overwhelming attack it seemed impossible that they could have survived so long let alone have continued fighting back take no prisoners that was the general order to all command grade officers who engaged sangaree christ were bloodthirsty perchevski thought he looked around his neighbors were enjoying the spectacle even though they had no idea what it was all about mouse looked like he was poised on the brink of orgasm how that man could hate the marine assault boats went in in time for dessert handheld camera recordings replaced the sterile display replay marines stalked sangaree and their hirelings through smoky ruined corridors the fighting was handtohand and bitter the camera technicians seemed inordinately fond of torn corpses and shattered defensive installations an assault team blew its way through an airlock beyond running for kilometers brightly lighted lay the hugest artificial environment farm perchevski had ever seen a voice boomed sithlac fields the holos expired lights came up a spot trained on the dni she rose ladies and gentlemen comrades in arms that is what tonight is all about an operation in the hell stars that destroyed the biggest stardust production facility weve ever located the raid was carried out twelve days ago police forces throughout the arm are rounding up the people who processed and sold the drug produced on that asteroid she continued with a navyaggrandizing speech that perchevski strove to ignore her theme was one of thank god for the bureaus vigilance and determination the csn said the same things in other ways and praised von drachau and the fleet people who had acted on the information the bureau had supplied the hows and whys of the intelligence coup got no play the details could not be divulged for security reasons the agents responsible would receive decorations youre a dip eh max whispered perchevski shrugged the nearworship in her face astounded him i had a kid brother walter he got hooked on stardust oh he checked the time and was surprised to find that it had not been dragging after all the csn insisted on presenting captain von drachau to confederations billions jupp accepted his decorations reluctantly instant celebrity perchevski mused instant millionaire and they wont remember his name in six months whyre you so sour max demanded you ought to be kicking your heels look what you did i know what i did i was there lets talk about something else what about that polar flight airmail set youve been promising me for the last two years i bet you get a ton of prize money how much do you know yet no i didnt know about the raid till tonight youll be able to buy my whole shop probably he had won prize money before he was by most standards a wealthy man he did not realize it money did not mean much to him he could buy whatever he wanted when he wanted it so economic problems never intruded on his life arent you excited no i am when are we going to the darkside digs i dont know i think theyre going to put me to work he had come to a decision he was going home to his birthworld one last time maybe there where not one person in a billion gave a damn about sangaree or the march of ulant or mcgraw pirates or anything else going on offworld he could get away from himself and maybe he could refresh his memory of just what it was that had sent him into a life he so loathed now maybe he could relearn what the choices were the show for the benefit of the holonets wound down then came the private postmortem when he and mouse shook hands with the mighty and received their medals and prizemoney estimates max patiently waited it out you should have gone home he told her when he finally broke away you cant spend your life waiting for me i wanted to im coming with you she squeezed his hand sonofabitch he said softly his mood skyrocketed he had been firing on her for years she had teased and led him on with smiles and gentle touches and had never given in the occasional friendly date was as close as he had ever come max made it a rewarding evening after all eleven ad operation dragon danion benrabi groaned when he cracked an eye and saw the time noon already he had wasted half his recreation day he flung himself out of bed and into the shower minutes later he was shuffling his jerusalem papers trying to find where he had left off the door buzzer whined damn i just got started its open the door slid aside jarl kindervoort amy and a half dozen unfamiliar seiners grinned at him they wore gaily colored period costumes moyshe laughed you look like refugees from a bloodandblades epic except for one little fellow way in the back grimygruesome in billy the kid regalia what the hell is king arthur aboard its recreation day moyshe amy said using that smile that melted him we decided to drag the old grizzly out of his den how could he stay angry in the face of that smile it was so damned disarming and warm i was going to work on the story she had been impressed by his being a published author anyway i havent got anything to wear he realized they were offering him something he grew wary eh kindervoort asked cupping his ear whats that no matter moyshe no time for it come on were late for the party now amy chanted were late were late for a very important date kindervoort caught moyshes arm pulled him through the doorway he ignored benrabis protests as he led him along a passageway crowded with young seiners in wild costumes zigging and zagging through to the common room serving as the landsmens cafeteria gymnasium rec room and lounge it was a big place but today moyshe felt the walls pressing in he had never seen it so crowded most of the landsmen were there lost among five times as many curious seiners the mixer had been going awhile it had gotten organized not far from the door at a long table where a dozen chess games were in progress benrabi spied mouse and the harem he had recruited where does he find the time he murmured kindervoort and amy herded him toward the table hey mouse said you dug him out you have to use explosives he gave up without a fight kindervoort replied laughter edging his voice who should he play first now wait a minute get serious moyshe mouse snapped youre going to go roman candle freaker if you stay locked up come on out and say in to the world go on down there and beat the guy at the end of the table there was a tightness around the corners of mouses eyes and an edge to his voice moyshe recognized a command he moved down the table he did not like being pushed but mouse had a point the mission was not dead he would not get his job done sitting in his cabin he took the empty seat opposite the youth at the foot of the table smiling wanly his opponent had black moyshe opened with kings pawn four moves checkmate he could not believe it nobody fell for a fools mate good moyshe amy said over his shoulder tommy wake up moyshe isnt a subtle player hes more your kamikaze type benrabi turned really she was leaning on the back of his chair skullface kindervoort and his troops had vanished from the games ive seen you play tommys mouth finally closed the swiftness of his defeat had shattered him lets say thats just for practice moyshe said tommy smiled weakly too generous of you he murmured i deserved what i got benrabi beat him again easily but took longer then he moved up the table playing seiner after seiner quickly and one landsman whom he had beaten before the starfishers while enthusiastic were even less subtle than he they played the game like checkers going for a massacre he won every match he played break time amy he said im getting calluses on my butt that was kind what you did for tommy she said as she guided him toward the refreshments line whats that giving him a second chance playing badly on purpose i did that he was glad they had dragged him in the noise the excitement of new people it was infectious you did i know something about the game tommys eager but a little short you know she tapped her temple hes my second cousin i feel sorry for him someday hell realize that he wont ever beat anybody itll really hit him the only thing he can really do better than anybody is handle the animals animals benrabi demanded incredulously sure the zoo animals in twelve south over by sail control weve got the space for it thats one thing we dont lack weve got botanical gardens and feral forests and football stadiums and all kinds of space wasters our ships are built to be lived in you remind me of somebody he mumbled remembering alyce alyce had had that same elfin nose those same high cheekbones that same slim smallbreasted body what nothing he tried to cover up by downing half a cup of steaming coffee it scalded him he sprayed the man in front of him he mumbled apologies felt small and rubbed his lips and tongue amy guided him away before he humiliated himself swinging a hand to indicate the crowd he said reminds me of an archaicist convention for which read madhouse does this go on every week except last week when they were getting ready for you to come aboard you should see it during sports season how do they find people to play those games from what mouse told me people isnt the problem every residential cube has teams they can pick and choose their players its a big thing being a sports hero specially if you make one of the allstar teams that play against the other harvestships weve got every game you can imagine you ever try nulgrav handball ive played maybe not by the same rules mouse and i play sometimes who wins he does most of the time i dont have the killer instinct i just play for fun hes always dead serious isnt he completely determined and yet he seems to enjoy life more than you he scowled what is this sorry where was i oh theres even an olympics and intership games whenever were in the yards and fleet games while were harvesting the yards enough said thats secret stuff he did not press but the agent in him redtagged her words amy led him to a cluster of tables under a banner proclaiming collectors corner it was quieter there the people were older and less flashily dressed moyshe spied coins and stamps and other odds and ends of milemarks from old earths past coin and stamp collections had been popular lightweight links with the motherworld during early space days when mass and volume had been critically important not a nibble he overheard one man complain to another the listener nodded tautly as though he were hearing it for the nth time told you it would be a waste of time charley theyre all hedonists the speaker glared at a raucous group of archaicists we wont see one thing new before next auction his table caught benrabis eye and interest the man had laid out a display of british coins and stamps excuse me sir yeah the complainer growled then he recognized moyshe as an outsider who might have something to offer benrabi could see excitement rising in him more companionably sit down sit down names george whats your field victorians tell me how does a starfisher come by a quick conspiratorial smile flashed across the mans face i wouldve bet youd ask that friend i got lucky one time i bought this unclaimed trunk when i was on the big rock candy mountain opened it up and holy christ george launched a narrative which included the minutest detail of his lucky day collectors were that way and every one had his story moyshe studied him how had he gotten down onto a confederation world why was this another tidbit that should be redtagged did starfishers make many surreptitious visits to the worlds of their hunters i didnt know if id run into any collectors out here moyshe said but i brought my trading stock just in case im more into stamps than coins british and american and german if you know anybody ive got some good stuff know anybody look around you see all those birddogs on point im a champion fool moyshe thought suddenly i could retire on my collection if i could sell it at market hell im rich prize money had a way of piling up he only used his to support his hobbies come on friend sit how many times do i have to tell you paul get the man some coffee all warmth now george practically forced him into a chair moyshe surrendered amy attached herself to its back she must be assigned to me the way shes sticking benrabi thought its not my overwhelming charm keeping her here like i said im george grumpy george they call me but i kind of grow on you after a while benrabi moyshe benrabi i was noticing this stamp here he and george swapped stories for an hour im glad you dragged me over here moyshe told amy afterward good im glad youre enjoying yourself her tone said she was not having fun whatre you doing tonight he blurted he felt as nervous as a youngster trying to make his first date about the ball i mean one of the archaicist groups is having that american deep south civil war thing she smiled a sad smile i dont have any plans if thats what you mean but you dont have a costume is it mandatory no you know archaicists theyll put up with anything to interest people in their pet periods that ones already popular the american ones are here our ethnic roots mostly go back to north america are you asking me yeah i guess good she laughed ill pick you up at eight what shouldnt the man not when hes a landsman the rules youd get arrested if you went running around looking for me oh all right what now there isnt much happening unless you want to join the archaicists or go to a ball game lets just circulate he might pick up something interesting they milled in the press watching several archaicist performances mouse handling the tregorgarthian youths a fencing tournament and the endless chess matches life aboard danion was little different from that aboard a warship on extended patrol the limits just were not as narrow amy introduced moyshe to scores of people whose names he forgot immediately this is getting to be like an overgrown cocktail party he observed i hated them when i was line you had to attend theyre the reason i decided to be a spy spies dont have to be nice to people they dont like amy looked at him oddly just joking your friend is good at everything he does isnt he she had become impressed with the way mouse had handled the tregorgarthians when he gets interested in something he gives it everything hes got a knack for switching on and off to complete commitment and the girls how does he find the time i dont know if i did id be cutting a swath myself his answer did not satisfy her she kept trying to pry something out of him she wasted her time he had been in the spy business so long that the information shutdown was reflexive you want to find out about mouse go to the horses mouth he finally told her i dont think so moyshe he smiled mouse would talk about himself all night not tell a word of truth and seduce her three times in the process probably not were different him and me im the type that would rather observe amy linked her arm with his observe for me observer about what you came to watch seiners tell me about us what do we look like to you uhm happy at peace with yourselves and the universe heres a thing about laughter its different here not anything like at home like your souls are part of it like my people only laugh to push back the darkness the guy who was doing the comedy routine jake whatever his name is the one who told the story about murph the guy who knew everybody he even made me laugh and you know why because he was poking fun at things i wouldnt even have thought about or wouldnt have the nerve to criticize im a moral coward whoa whatre you talking about what brought that on i just started thinking about my boss very dignified gentleman when he wants to be all the bigtimers are in luna command only their dignity is almost always pomposity in disguise ever since i was a midshipman ive had this fantasy about being the kings secret agent id go around disguised as joe citizen id keep a list whenever a civil servant or sales person was obnoxious id put their names down and the kings men would come and get them id also be a sort of wandering clown who made pompous bigwigs expose themselves for what they were the bureau would be my first target you have hard feelings against the people you work for moyshe did not answer the intensity of amys question scared him off she was too keen too tense too eager all of a sudden lets change the subject she did not press a while later she suggested why dont you go back to your writing now trying to get rid of me no thats not what i meant did it sound like that im sorry i just thought you might feel better now he reflected for a moment i do maybe itll go better i hate to admit it but ive had a good time amy thanks he allowed her to escort him to his cabin where he immediately attacked his story it went well he hardly seemed to have begun though when amy pushed his buzzer moyshe wake up she called from the passageway its open time already in she bounced charmingly dressed as a southern belle in lots of pink and petticoats been going good youve got papers everywhere she had a confederate uniform over one arm and swords and things under the other smoking i borrowed some things whats the matter for an instant he had seen her as alyce his past hit him like a tsunami her smile persisted but did not ride her voice as she asked moyshe whats behind you nothing that costume for me give it here and ill change ive been watching you moyshe somethings eating you dont let it puke it up get it out where you can stomp on it chop it up and kill it that was the difference between amy and alyce alyce would never have asked she would have waited till he wanted to talk what about you he demanded want to tell me whats behind you best defense is a good offense he thought mocking himself she ignored it tell me something she spoke softly with concern just as she had done that day on the shuttle i have walked with joy down the passionshaded avenues abounding in the city of love my heart was young and she was beside me together were we and in that was my totality czyzewski she observed yes i read too its from sister love they say he wrote it before he went into space and lost his mind if a guy who brags about a love affair with his sister isnt crazy already what do you mean by it moyshe is an old love affair bothering you thats silly youre not fifteen im perfectly aware of that intellectually i was then stark in the gardens of the moon he quoted out of context now im a tired old man far from home futureless with no friend but a chessmad archaicist triggerman i never see except during working hours hold it he thought the mouth is playing traitor here give me that costume let me get ready please all right she put a lot into those two words it reminded him of the professional mother who had taken care of him occasionally while his natural mother had chased ghosts of vanished earths she had been able to say the same words the same way implying that nothing good could possibly come of whatever he planned she had been able to say almost anything in a way that made it sound like he was condemning himself to the clutches of the devil or some equally nasty fate well you make a striking officer amy said when he returned from the bathroom if you had a beard youd look a little like robert e lee yeah can you do something about this damned sword how the hell did they get around without falling on their faces all the time she giggled as she made adjustments what just wondering how many jewish generals there were in the confederate army therere a lot oh you mean that confederation i dont get it why should that be funny you have to know the period well youve lost me i only know it from military history at academy i can tell you why longstreet did what he didnt do at gettysburg but not what religion he was anyway im not jewish and you know it what are you then do you believe in anything moyshe poking again prying for her own sake he guessed fisher security probably would not care about his religion he wanted to make a snappy comeback but she had struck too close to the core of his dissatisfaction at the moment he did not believe in anything and himself least of all and that he thought was curious because he had not had these kinds of feelings since coming out of the line not till this mission had begun the prophet murphy he said murphy i dont get it who the hell is murphy i expected death and taxes the prophet murphy the guy who said if anything can possibly go wrong it will my life has been a testimonial she stepped back shook her head slowly i dont know what to make of you moyshe yes i do maybe maybe ill just make you happy in spite of yourself blood from a turnip lady he had had enough talk taking her arm he headed for the ball for the moment forgetting that he did not know where he was going then he saw that she had brought an electric scooter the seiners used them whenever they had to travel any distance there were places in danion that were literally days away by foot redfaced he settled onto the passenger seat facing backward they did not exchange a word during the trip moyshe suffered irrational surges of anger alternating with images of the gun that thing scared the hell out of him he was no triggerman it seemed to have less contact with reality than did his wanting he had become on a lowkey reflexively suppressed level convinced that he was going insane time seemed to telescope the unwanted thoughts would not go away his hands grew cold and clammy his mood sank amy swung to the passage wall parked plugged the scooter into a charger circuit it became one of a small herd of orange beasts nursing electrical teats good crowd he said inanely taking a clumsy poke at the silence uhm she paused to straighten his collar and sword come on her face remained studiedly blank landside style it was a bit of home for which he was ungrateful the ball seemed a repeat of the mornings gettogether the same people were there only a hundred or so were in appropriate costume twice as many wore every getup from babylon to tomorrow and as many again wore everyday jumpsuits moyshe froze just inside the doorway what is it amy asked im not sure i dont have the right but i feel like somethings been taken away from me had all those vikings and puritans and marie antoinettes stolen his moment of glory had he been bitten by the archaicist bug its our history too remember amy countered misunderstanding you said everybodys roots go back to old earth a hand took moyshes left elbow mint julep sir benrabi turned to face jarl kindervoort who wore buckskins and coonskin cap danl deathshead he thought scair em injuns right outn kaintuck the damn thing fits you better than it does me kindervoort observed its your costume yeah lets see what theyve got at the bar moyshe amy had disappeared and kindervoorts tone implied business feeling putupon benrabi allowed himself to be led to the bar that was another unpleasantness the setup was wild west with a dozen rowdy black hat types attached busy making asses of themselves with brags and mock gunfights acrid gunsmoke floated around in greyblue streamers of all the period crap that archaicists bought moyshe felt wild west was the worst it was all madeup history a consensus fantasy with virtually no foundation in actual history his mothers first archaicist flier had been wild west it had come during his difficulties at academy when he had desperately needed an anchor somewhere she had not given him what he had needed she had not had the time to top it off the sangaree woman was there she had assumed the guise of the lady who goes upstairs appropriate benrabi muttered her awesome sexual appetites had grown since the broken wings she was watching him with jarl was she getting a little worried wondering when he would turn her in he smiled at her let her sweat there was a stir at the door jesus benrabi said will you look at this mouse the attentiongrabber and most popular boy in class with no less than six beauties attached had just swept in outfitted as a diminutive henry viii were lucky this isnt a democracy kindervoort observed your friend would be captain by the end of the year riding the female vote moyshe ignored the pun sourly he said arent you he was getting irritated with mouses antics the man was flaunting his successes envy was one of benrabis nastier vices he tried to control it but mouse made that hard he faced the bar found himself staring at some horridlooking swill in a tall glass mint julep kindervoort explained we try to drink according to period at these things he sipped from a tin cup the gunfighters were tossing off straight shots at bars end a hairy viking type waved an axe and thundered something about honey mead bet it all comes out of the same bottle probably kindervoort admitted its your ballpark what do you want jarl kindervoorts eyebrows rose moyshe youre damned hard to get along with you know that now you frown im getting too personal how do you people survive never touching we dont touch because therere too many of us unless youre mouse he grew up with lots of elbow room and not wanting for anything i dont expect you to understand you couldnt unless youve lived on one of the inner worlds kindervoort nodded how would you like to get away from all that to live where theres room to be human where you dont have to be an emotional brick to survive he took a long sip from his cup watching moyshe over its rim he had to wait a long time for an answer moyshe knew what was being offered and what it would cost the demons of his mind rallied to fiery standards warring with one another in an apocalyptic clash ideals beliefs desires and temptations stormed one anothers strongholds he struggled to keep that armageddon from painting itself on his face he was good at that he had had decades of practice it occurred to him that kindervoort was security and security men did not deal in the obvious get thee behind me satan kindervoort laughed all right moyshe but well talk about it later go on find amy have a good time its a party he vanished before moyshe could respond amy appeared on cue rotten trick amy manynames letting that vampire get ahold of me kindervoorts retreat raised his spirits he felt benevolent toward the universe he would let it roll on awhile what did he do nothing much just tried to get me to defect she just stared at him apparently wondering why he was not shrieking with joy seldom did a landsman receive the opportunity to become a seiner it was human nature to think your own acre was godchosen he realized and amys was one he would not mind entering though not on kindervoorts terms he was not in love with confederation or the bureau but he would never sell them out lets dance amy suggested thats what we came for time drifted away moyshe began to enjoy himself he discovered that he was spending the evening with a woman who mattered more than the bag of duffel with sex organs she had been when they had arrived somewhere along the way one of amys cousins invited them to a room party no longer tense and wary he said why not sounds good a moment later he and amy were part of a gay crowd on scooters shooing pedestrians with rebel yells the partiers were mostly youngsters recently graduated from the creche schools almost as new to the harvestship as moyse in a small group confined to a cabin he found them less reserved than the older seiners he met while working they seemed to have archaicist tendencies oriented toward the late twentieth century youth cults at least the cabin belonged to someone fond of the approximate period moyshe could not identify it for certain liquor flowed smoke filled the air time passed quiet in a corner with amy most of the time but sometimes without observing he gradually settled into a strange mood wherein he became detached from his environment the bittersweet smoke was more to blame than the alcohol it was dense enough to provide a high without his having to toke any of the odd little cigarettes offered him marijuana someone called them he vaguely remembered it from childhood as something the older kids in his gang had used he had never done dope himself his companions coughed and gasped and made faces but persisted the drug was part of the period cult he drifted farther from reality himself floating free till he swam in a mist of uninhibited irrational impressions the touch of a woman on his hand sail on silver girl and the flavor of whiskey on his tongue dancing light harsh in a distant corner all shadows and angles beside him his fingers slipped into the warm place at the back of amys neck she purred moving from the arm of the chair into his lap he thought sex no he was not drunk enough to forget alyce fear arose shadows grew beckoning in their hearts lurked dark things wicked spiritreevers from the deeps of the past come to stalk him along the shores of the future there was a magic at work in that room he and amy were suddenly alone amid the horde alone among the golden people all of them ten years their junior each with a newly minted shiny innocence on some becoming tarnished he did not care they talked she a little deeply and he with scant attention he was not ready to explore her yet but it seemed from hints she dropped that their pasts might read like sides of the same coin an unhappy affair lay behind her and something physical sexual that she was not yet ready to yield was troubling her now he did not press his own midnighteyed haunts were lurking in the wings on on near midnight in a moment of clarity he noticed her lefthandedness for the first time because of the way she offered him a can of archaicisttrade beer lefthanded pop the top shift hands offer with a bend of the wrist because he was righthanded he marveled because he had not noticed it earlier he was supposed to be an observant man it was his profession october thoughts died as his interest increased and he became aware of the intenseness of amys every move she laughed a lot usually at things that were not funny her own fanged shadows were closing in memories that she had to exorcise with forced mirth she was trying to keep her devil out of sight but he found its shaggy edges familiar it was a cousin of his own while a dozen people silently considered the songs of someones named simon and garfunkel or buddy holly he discovered how nicely they fit she spent an hour in his lap without making him uncomfortable his left hand touched the back of her neck his right lay on the curve of her left hip and her head rested nicely on his left shoulder beneath his chin her hair had a pale pleasant unfamiliar scent werent they a little old for this shadows in the doorways shadows on the walls dont ask questions he listened to her heartbeat three beats for his two he shivered as his monster shuffled closer amy moved wriggling nearer she chuckled softly when he grunted from the paintweak of her bony bottom shifting in his lap the partiers began drifting out off to their private places to be lonely or frightened or together till the reality of morning swept them back to work and today soon there were just three couples left moyshe shivered as he lifted amys chin she resisted a moment then surrendered the kiss became intense the shadows retreated a bit come on she said bouncing up yanking his arm they darted into the passageway boarded the scooter and flew to his cabin she went in with him locking the door behind her but the time was not yet right they spent the night sleeping just cuddling and sleeping hiding from the darkness neither was ready to risk anything more she was gone when he awakened and his wants and haunts were strangely quiet where would they go from here he wondered twelve ad the olden days the mother world perchevski shuffled from foot to foot he was too nervous to sit he had not realized that going home would unleash so much emotion he glanced around the lounge the lighter would be carrying a full load tourists and business people the former were mostly ulantonid and toke they huddled in racial clumps intimidated by old earths xenophobic reputation yet determined to explore the birth world of man the toke nerved themselves with bold talk their every little quirk or gesture seemed to proclaim we are the meltan star warriors of the marine toke legion we are the chosen of the star lords the delinquents of a decadent world cannot frighten us but they were scared no enemy could intimidate the toke the toke war had proven that only the stroke of diplomatic genius that had made a place for them in service and a place for toke in confederation as equals had saved the warrior caste from extinction its a pity we cant work something like that for the sangaree perchevski thought but there had been no hatred in the toke war it had been an almost clinically unemotional contest for supremacy in the star ranges of the palisarian directorate the ulantonid were less bellicose than the toke their war with confederation had been unemotional too another bloodflavored wrestling match for supremacy these looked like a catholic group headed for rome jerusalem and bethlehem shuttle bravo tango romeo three one is now ready for boarding for passengers making a lake constance descent passengers for corporation zone will please assemble at shuttle bay nine id like to meet her said a stranger near perchevski whos that the woman who does the announcing she can put her shoes under my bed anytime oh the voice it had been a soothing mellow yet suggestive voice similar voices did the announcing in every terminal perchevski had ever visited the tourists and business people boarded first luna command made a habit of doing little things that avoided irritating civilians the individual serviceman was supposed to remain unobtrusive only one check on luna commands power existed the operating appropriation voted by a popularly elected senate the toke marines stood aside for perchevski who had come in his commanders uniform it was a long lazy twelvehour orbit to lake constance and geneva perchevski read slept and pondered the story he had recently begun he tried not to think about the world below the holonets could not begin to portray the squalid reality that was old earth beyond the embattled walls of corporation zone the shuttle dropped into the lake a tug guided it into a berth perchevski followed the civilians into the air of his native world he had come home after eight years geneva had not changed switzerland remained unspoiled its wealth and beauty seemed to give the lie to all the horror stories about old earth it was a mask offworld billions cosmeticized the zone and corporation police forces maintained its sanctity at gunpoint the perimeters were in a continuous state of siege there were times when luna command had to send down marines to back the corporation defense forces the excuse was protection of confederations senate and offices which were scattered between geneva zurich and the south shore of the bodensee once there had been a social theory claiming that the wealth coming into the zone from the corporations headquartered there would eventually spread across the planet a positive balance of trade would be created and the positive example of life in the zone would act as a counterinfection to the social diseases of the rest of the planet change would radiate from switzerland like ripples in a pond the theory had been stillborn as so many social engineering schemes are no one here gives a damn perchevski reflected as he entered his hotel room all that kept earth going was trillions in interplanetary welfare maybe the whole thing should be allowed to collapse then something could be done for the survivors the motherworlds people still played their games of nationalism and warfare they loved their joshua jas and they flatly refused to do anything for themselves while confederation could be shamed into paying support the too often told tale of welfarism was repeating itself as always provision of means for improvement had become an overpowering disincentive to action perchevski spent his first day at home doing one of the guided tours of the wonders of corporation zone with his group were a few native youngsters who had been awarded the tour as contest prizes they surprised him they were reasonably wellbehaved moderately clean and not too badly dressed a cut above the average run and not unlike kids elsewhere the security guard was not called upon to practice his trade the tour group lunched in the restaurant at the nureyev technical industries chalet atop the matterhorn excuse me commander perchevski looked up from his sausage and kraut startled a girl of sixteen a tall attractive blonde stood opposite him he was eating alone his uniform had put off everyone but two toke marines who were still trying to explain their need to a cook who was appalled at the idea of permitting raw meat out of his kitchen he suspected the marines wanted to stay near him for a feeling of added security the toke were a strongly hierarchical people and among them warriors were the most respected of castes yes may i sit here of course he was stunned she was one of the prize winners most old earthers so hated the services that even the best intentioned could not remain polite is she a prostitute he wondered whatever her pitch she needed time she was so nervous she could not eat she suddenly blurted youre old earth arent you i mean originally yes how did you know the way you look at things outworlders look at things different like theyre afraid theyll catch something or something perchevski glanced at the other prize winners disgust marked their faces your friends dont theyre not my friends i never saw any of them before yesterday how did you get out words tumbled out of her all strung together so fast he could hardly follow them out of this this place this world i took the academy exams they accepted me they didnt stop you who your friends the people you knew i tried three times somebody always found out and kept me from going last time three men stopped me outside the center and said theyd kill me if i went in so theres still hope perchevski murmured he knew what she wanted now sir i mean as long as theres somebody like you left old earth isnt dead youve made my trip worthwhile get me out can you get me out anything is better than this ill do anything anything you want she meant it her desperate promise was so obvious it hurt he remembered his own desperation at an even younger age when you chose the unpopular path you had to cleave to it with fanatical determination he was moved deeply i entered every contest there ever was just so i could get this far i knew they wouldnt keep me from coming here and i thought maybe i could find somebody but you were too scared to do anything when you got here they were all outworlders you leave earth you wont meet anyone else ive only run into two or three earthmen in twenty years he eyed the group with which the girl had been traveling the youths seemed to have caught the drift of her appeal they did not like it i know id get used to it are you sure three young men drifted to the table this slut dont belong here spike perchevski smiled gently you just made fuckup number one stud dont get smoked that startled them one snarled youll shit in your hand and carry it to china spike may i be of assistance commander the toke marine dwarfed the three youths adams apples bobbed i dont think so fire cord id say the banner is secure the young men have said their piece they were just leaving the toke major glared down at two and a quarter meters and one hundred thirty kilos he was a runt for a star warrior his aide though was the kind they put on recruiting pamphlets meant for circulation through the caste lodges he stood quietly behind his officer filled with that still dread equanimity that made the star warriors unnerving to even the most hardened human servicemen go you silently children of the night perchevski quoted from an old song used as a battle anthem by half the youth gangs on the planet you especially talking head the slang had not changed much unlike the outworlds old earth had become locked into static patterns the youths understood there had been a time when he had been one of them they left strutting with false bravura perchevski thought he caught a glint of envy in the spokesmans eye thank you fire cord the security man busy talking shit to a restaurant girl had missed the encounter we share the banner commander we will be near fire cord sir dont call them on their own ground this is my third visit commander then you know he turned to the girl again who seemed petrified the two huge leatheryskinned marines moved to the nearest empty table the girl finally blurted why did you come back i dont know to remind myself looking for something i left behind roots im not sure i wanted to see my mother its been eight years oh she sounded envious i couldnt find out who my parents were i never met anybody who did know not my age anyway he smiled do you have a name after that scene youd better stay close to me or the marines well have to call you something besides hey girl greta helsung from hamburg are they real star warriors he laughed softly dont let them hear you ask a question like that greta from hamburg theyre as real as the stink in the sink im commander perchevski if you dont change your mind ill take you to see somebody when we get back to geneva i wont change it not after all the trouble i had he peered at her intently this was too breathtaking too real too dreamcometrue for her she did not quite believe him he could almost hear her thinking he would use her then dump her the use temptation existed she was fresh and beautiful i mean it greta and dont be scared youre young enough to be my daughter im not a child im old enough im aware of that im not young enough eat your knockwurst the meat came all the way from palisarius oh god really i didnt know what i was ordering i just asked for something that i didnt know what it was just for something different they didnt show any prices it must be awful expensive she looked around guiltily so dont waste it then price doesnt matter to most people who eat here if they couldnt afford it they wouldnt come go on enjoy yourself her tour expenses would be covered luna command would pick up the tab the services sponsored the contests that gave zone vacations as prizes some inspired social theorist had decided to fish for old earths gretas for the oneinamillion children who had adventure in their genes and dreams in their hearts the program was as successful as the normal recruiting procedures it gave interested youths a chance to escape peer pressure computers watched and crosschecked the contest entries undoubtedly someone would have contacted greta if she had not come to him he eyed her and thanked heaven that someone out there still cared he felt pretty good greta remained nearby throughout the tour milking him for every detail about outside her former companions were not pleased but the fire cord was always too close for their nerve terrorism was a popular terran sport toke though refused to be terrorized they bashed heads their reputation did not make them immune but it did force the natives to respect them perchevski took the girl to the bureaus front business office that evening a potential recruit he told the night desk man who recognized him from a holo portrait that had preceded him down greta helsung from hamburg treat her right of course commander miss will you take a seat we can get the paperwork started its that easy she asked perchevski the desk man replied youll be sleeping on the moon tomorrow night miss oh commander youre leaving i have an eleventhirty to montreal greta looked at him in silent appeal will you sponsor commander he knew he shouldnt it meant accepting legal and quasiparental responsibility the admiral would be furious of course where do i print he offered his thumb here thank you something buzzed the desk man glanced to one side read something from a screen perchevski could not see ohoh he thumbed a printlock a drawer popped open he handed perchevski a ring why it was a call ring it would let him know if the bureau wanted him on the hurry up it would give them a means of following his movements too word from the head office ready miss helsung greta ill see you in academy he wrote a number on a scrap of paper keep this call it when you get your barracks assignment he started to leave again commander he turned soft young arms flung around his neck tears seeped through his uniform thank you greta he whispered dont be scared theyll be good to you they would she would be treated like a princess till her studies began goodbye be good four of the tour youths caught him outside he had to break ones arm before they got the message he was nearly late for his flight he had to wait to shift to civilian clothing till after he had boarded the airbus north american central directorate showed his mother living at the same st louis zone address he went without calling first afraid she might find some excuse for not seeing him though their intentions were friendly enough their few visits had been tempestuous she could never forgive him for turning on his own kind the passage down the last light canyon was like a journey home along an old route of despair the playgrounds of his childhood had not changed trash still heaped them kid gangs still roamed them crudely written frequently misspelled obscenities obscured the unyielding plastic walls future archaeologists might someday go carefully through layer after layer of spray paint reconstructing the aberrations of generations of uneducated minds he labored to convince himself that this was not the totality of old earth some of its worse he murmured then he castigated himself for his bigotry sure most terran humanity lived like animals but not all there were enclaves where some pride some care some ambition remained there were native industries earth produced most of its own food and necessities and there were artists writers and men of vision they just got lost in the barbarian horde they formed an unnaturally small percentage of the population not only had risktaking been drained from the gene pool so had a lot of talent and intelligence the average iq on old earth ran twenty points below confederation mean perchevski overtipped his driver it was enough to convince the man that he had conveyed some criminal kingpin crime was one profession where a man could still win some respect his codes still opened the buildings doors after all these years he was amazed it was another symptom of what had become of his motherworld terror had become so ubiquitous that no one tried very hard to resist anymore his mother was drunk she snapped youre not harold who the hell are you wheres harold nobody comes here but harold he looked past her into the space where he had spent most of his childhood three meters by four it was divided into three tiny rooms it had seemed bigger back then even with his father living at home he said nothing look brother holy christ its you what the hell are you doing here she sounded angry dont stand there looking get in here before somebody burns us he slipped past her plopped himself down on the same little couch that had been his boyhood bed the apartment had not changed only his mother had for the worse it was more than age and unrelenting poverty it was a sliding downhill from the inside she had begun to go to fat her personal habits had slipped her hair had not been combed in days let me clean up i just got outta bed she vanished behind the movable screen that made a bedroom wall what have you been doing she asked better i should ask you i sent letters and hard outworlds currency neither had drawn any response i never seem to get around to answering at least she did not make outrageous excuses like not being able to pay a writer he knew she took his missives to a reader she cared that much but not enough to reply i did write twice once right after you were here last time and two or three years ago after your father was killed in the tanner revolt i didnt care anymore but i thought you might hes dead as a stone he got hung up in the revanchist crusade they were getting pretty big then most of them got themselves killed attacking security fortress i didnt get the letter i didnt know he had never heard of the tanner revolt or revanchist crusade he asked about them they were going to turn things around bring back the golden age or something unite earth and make it the center of the galaxy a lot of people think you loonies were behind it they say the whole archaicist tiling was started by your meddling archaicism had had its infancy on old earth concurrent with his own if it had been more social engineering the plan had backfired the motherworld had not been awakened by the glory that was it had merely found a new way to escape the reality of now the romantic pasts were popular men liked playing empires women liked glamour men died when groups like stahlhelm ss totenkopf or black september ganged up on irgun or stern the smallest and most obscurely referenced groups were the most dangerous the ladies seemed to prefer regency balls french courts and seraglio situations a search for uniqueness combined with the need for belonging had driven people to probe the remotest corners of earths history during his flight he had watched a live newscast of a raid on mexicos aztec revivatist cult the police attackers had battled their way into the temple too late to save the sacrifices perchevskis mother returned she wore an outfit that looked ridiculous on a woman her age the blouse was seethrough the skirt fell only to midthigh he concealed his consternation no doubt this was her best i dont get into that kind of thing not my line i do know a few guys who make a hobby of trying to save this dump from itself she did not like his attitude what are you calling yourself this time perchevski cornelius perchevski he stared at her and saw greta forty years from now unless if the kid enlisted he would feel his own lifechoice was justified he would have rescued someone from becoming this what are you into he asked i dont recognize the period beatles and twiggy eh twentieth century seventh decade angloamerican with the beginning in england one of the light periods youth and no philosophy i gathered that much though im not familiar with it its all the rage now its so very outr√© so clishclash with itself so schizophrenic you speak

everybody wants to learn here we go he thought shes picking up where she left off eight years ago itll only get worse why did i come here to punish myself for getting out of this hellhole she recognized the look on his face its news time lets see whats happening she whistled a few bars of a tune he did not recognize the editing was unbelievable this archaicist group had done this that one had done that the bay bombers had beaten the rat pack there wasnt a word about von drachau or anything else offworld except mention of a russian basketball team trouncing the touring team from novgorod big deal he muttered novgorods gravity is seventythree percent of earth normal theyd have to play midgets for it to be fair his mother flared up she hated foreigners almost as much as she hated outworlders but the russians were at least good old earthers who had had the sense to stay on the motherworld he tuned her out again wondering if he had a masochistic streak would she try to understand if he explained how much in the middle he was that outworlders disliked old earthers just as much as she loathed them that he had to reconcile those attitudes both within himself and with everyone he met he did not think she would help he knew her cure give it up come back home to squalor and hopelessness mother i am what i am i wont change youre wasting your time when you try why dont we go out somewhere this place is depressing whats wrong with it yes all right its a little old and i have the extra credit over si basic to move but its so big i like having all this room to knock around in i wouldnt have that in a new place perchevski groaned to himself now came the mama marx selfcriticism session during which she would confess all her failings as a social insuree then she would segue into her shortcoming as a mother ultimately taking upon herself all responsibility for his having gone wrong he shook his head sadly in eight years she should have found a new song come on mother we did this last time lets go somewhere lets see something lets do something she dithered she fussed it was getting dark out only rich old earthers who could afford the armor went out after the sun went down here he said opening his bag ive got my own house now i brought some holos to show you the pictures finally penetrated her fa√ßade tommy its beautiful magnificent you really are doing all right arent you good enough but youre not happy a mother can tell holy shit he thought im grown up twice over i dont need that you could live there if you wanted she became suspicious immediately its not in some foreign place is it those mountains dont look like the rockies or sierras its on a world called refuge omigod dont do that dont talk that way my heart did i tell you that the medics say i have a weak heart every time youve ever needed an excuse for he stopped himself he refused to start the fight lets dont fight tommy we should be friends oh speaking of friends patrick was killed just last week he went out after dark it was so sad nobody can figure out what made him do it patrick that redhaired boy you were friends with the year before you you enlisted i think his last name was medich he was living with his mother he didnt remember a patrick redhaired medich or otherwise he did not belong here even the memories were gone he had changed the kid who had lived with this woman was dead he was an impostor pretending to be her son she was bravely playing the game trying to be his mother he was sure there were other things she would rather be doing hadnt she been expecting a harold maybe that was why they tried to keep people from going they became somebody else while they were gone mother his throat clamped down on the word yes i i think id better go i dont know what i came looking for its not here its not you its probably something that doesnt exist the words came rumbling out one trampling the heels of the next im not making you happy being here so id better just go back he tried to read her face disappointment fought relief there he thought im an old earther when im out there mother but im not when i come back here i can see that when im here i guess i should just stop remembering this place as home it is your home no not anymore its just the world where i was born and this is just a place where i lived and im just somebody you knew back when no youre mother youll always be that silence existed between them for more than a minute perchevski finally said wont you even consider coming to my place i couldnt i just couldnt i belong where i am being what i am useless as that is mother you dont have to get old out there we have a rejuvenation process she showed genuine interest when she asked youve recovered the secrets of the immortality labs no theyre gone forever all this process does is renew the body it cant stop nerve degeneration its been around for centuries how come nobodys heard about it here with earth overpopulated and everybody doing their damnedest to make more babies some people probably know though some maybe even benefit its not a big secret but nobody here ever listens about outside everybody here is part of this big conspiracy of blindness thats not fair its my world i have the birthright if i want to point a finger and call names are you going to come with me he had begun to think about greta that was making him mad no ill leave in the morning then theres no sense us carving each other up with knives of love how poetic she sighed darling tommy keep writing i know i almost never answer but the letters they help i like to hear about those places perchevski smiled it must be in the genes thanks of course ill write youre my numberone lady thirteen ad operation dragon danion benrabi muttered aljo aljo hens ilyas ilyas im gialo bar over a joint with stripped threads what the hell mouse asked a nonsense poem by potty welkin from shadows in a dominion blue goes nun√© nun√© scutarrac never heard of it think we ought to cut new threads lets put in a new fitting it was a political protest thing not one of his biggies it was a satire on confederation the poem was his idea of what a political speech sounded like whats that got to do with anything its just the way i feel this morning like a poem without sense or rhyme that everybodys trying to figure out including me there thats got it what do we do next beyond mouse amy consulted her clipboard she had been staring at him with questioning eyes a cracked nipple in a lox line about a kilometer from here uhn benrabi tossed his tool kit into the electric truck sat down with his legs dangling off the bed mouse joined him amy took off with a lurch that bounced spare fittings all over the truckbed she had been angry and uncommunicative all week moyshe had been as wary himself as unsure he thought she was upset because he had not tried to seduce her mouse had let it be for three days now whispering he asked what happened between you two nothing come on moyshe i know you better than that nothing really thats the trouble he shrugged tried to change the subject i still cant believe were inside a ship i keep feeling were back in the tunnels at luna command what did you mean by that poem what i said people keep trying to figure me out so they can use me the ship was a lot like luna command with long passageways connecting the several areas that had to be big to function i dont understand mouse said who does no wait look heres skullface trying to get me to cross over so he tried me too hes trying everybody looks like part of their plan i just told him i couldnt meet his price i dont know anything that would be any good to him anyway so whats the big deal its all part of the floor show weve been through it before but theres something different this time benrabi thought ive never been tempted before why was she hustling me he jerked his head toward amy mouse laughed wearily lowered his head shook it sadly moyshe moyshe moyshe does it have to be a plot did the sangaree woman burn you that bad maybe she likes you theyre not all vampires but theyll all get you hurt benrabi mumbled what oh you ever stop to think maybe she feels the same way benrabi paused mouse could be right mouse knew how to read women and it paralleled his own impression he wished he could assume a more casual nocommitment attitude in his personal relationships mouse managed and left the girls happy speaking of women and her the sangaree woman gave them a bright gunmetal smile and mocking wave as they glided past her work party what to do she had been less obnoxious since mouses recreationday demonstration but had not abandoned her plot just wait were making her nervous you think old skullface knows about her we might make a few points by stopping her when she moves its a notion mouse said becoming thoughtful as they rolled to a stop he suggested why dont you come by for a game tonight his partner was still very much devoted to the mission moyshe realized amy plugged the truck into a charger circuit that woman who is she which woman mouse countered tone idle benrabi scanned the area it looked like the site of a recent elephant riot the passage had been open to space liquids had frozen and burst their pipes well be here a week amy how come we didnt bring any replacement pipe theyre sending a damage control team up after lunch theyll bring what we need we just worry about the lox line now its got to be open by noon you didnt answer my question mouse whats that whos that woman benrabi shrugged said maria gonzalez i think i know her name i want to know whats between you three benrabi shrugged again i guess she hates spies a lot of people have scratched us off their christmas lists avoiding her eyes he handed mouse a wrench who does she work for the question took him by surprise but he was in good form paul kraus in atmosphere systems he could tell you whatever you want to know mouse chuckled a muscle in amys cheek started twitching you know what i mean answer me take it easy amy mouse said your badge is showing what a little professional advice thats all dont press it puts people off they clam up or play games with you leading you around with lies a good agent never pushes unless he has to you dont have to nobodys going anywhere for a year so why not just lie back and let the pieces fall then put them together he had selected the tone of an old pro advising a novice take our situation give me a twentycentimeter copper nipple moyshe you know were navy men we know you work for kindervoort okay i what dont be coy torch moyshe and find the solder you give yourself away a dozen times a day amy the greenest apprentice wouldnt have fallen for that lefthanded wrench thing benrabi chuckled amy had torn through all three tool kits trying to find the mythical wrench then she had gone down to damage control and tried to requisition one somebody down there had gone along with the gag they had passed her on to tooling amy had been given a crash course in plumbing but she had not learned enough to fool the initiate fury reddened her face it faded into a soft smile i told him i couldnt pull it off he probably didnt expect you to he knows were the best doesnt matter anyway were out of it now just a couple spikes here working okay we know where we stand wheres the flux moyshe so why dont you do like we do dont push pay attention wait itll come in bits and pieces no hard feelings that way and that closes old doc igarashis spy school and lonely hearts club for today be ready for a surprise quiz tomorrow ow thats hot watch the torch dummy moyshe said this t pipe is an odd size well have to choke it down to two centimeters somehow here amy said she made a checkmark on one of the sheets on her clipboard handed moyshe a reduction joint with a number tag attached special made see im learning she laughed no more questions mouse moyshe i feel better now not so sneaky good for you mouse said danion suddenly groaned and shivered benrabi whirled looking for a spacesuit locker mouse crouched defensively making a sound suspiciously like a whimper what the hell he demanded we breaking up amy laughed its nothing theyre shifting mindsails and catchnets mindsails benrabi asked whats that her smile vanished she had evidently said too much i cant explain youd have to ask somebody from operations sector and thats off limits yes got you the shuddering continued for a half hour they lunched while waiting for the damage control people amy began to lose her reserve toward benrabi soon they were chattering like teenagers who had just made up mouse did a little poking and prodding from the sidelines as skillfully as any psychologist maneuvering amy into inviting moyshe out next recreation day benrabi went to mouses cabin after supper they played chess and lip reading discussed what moyshe was putting down using the venerable invisible ink trick between the lines of his drafts of jerusalem they also attacked the problem of the sangaree woman and found it as stubborn as ever recreation day came with all its mad morning chess tournaments and its afternoon sports furor its archaicist exhibitionism and its collectors excitement benrabi concluded some business with grumpy george got deadlocked over some stamps and managed a handsome cash settlement on some new earth mutant butterflies he had brought along for trading that evening he and amy attended another ball this one was louis xiv he went in his everyday clothing amy though scrounged a costume and was striking from the ball they went to her cabin so she could change they had been invited to another party by the same cousin how did you people get involved in the archaicist thing moyshe asked while she was changing were the originals she replied from her bathroom her voice light with nearlaughter she had been mirthfully happy all day moyshe too had been feeling intensely alive and aware it starts in creche in school when we act out history we havent really been around long enough to have any past of our own so we borrow yours thats not true we all have the same history i guess youre right old earth is everybodys history if you get right down to it anyway its a creche game a teaching method and it carries over for some people its fun to dress up and pretend but we dont live it not the way some people do know what i mean you remember chouteau that ships commander who brought us here he had as bad a case as ive ever seen an exception look at it this way how many people go to these things not very many and theyre most of the archaicists aboard see its a game but your people are so serious about it its spooky ill buy that curious he thought in these two weeks he had seen nothing culturally unique to the seiners they lived borrowed lives in a hash that did not add to a whole his expectations based on landside legends rumors and his luna command studies had been severely disappointed but amy had a point he had encountered only a narrow selection of her people an unusual minority the majority remaining aloof might represent something different she came from the bathroom zip me up okay then responding to a question were not complete borrowers its partly because youre just seeing a few people like you say and partly because this is the fleet you wouldnt judge confederation by what you saw on one of your navy ships would you the yards and creches are different except when were working we try to make life a game to beat the boredom and fear cant be that much different for navy men anyway youre not seeing the real us ever youre just seeing us reacting to you what were these yards they kept slipping into seiner conversation did the starfishers have a world of their own hidden somewhere out of the way it was not impossible the records revealing the whereabouts of scores of early settlements had been destroyed in the lunar wars he was about to ask when he recalled mouses advice about pressing there was much much more to the seiner civilization than anyone in confederation suspected the bits he and mouse had collected already would be worth fortunes to the right people if he kept learning at this rate they were going to give him another medal when he got back he could see it coming he would rather have that damned year off the party was a carbon of the previous one same people same music same conversation and arguments only he and amy were different they watched their drinking and tried to understand what was happening to them the partiers were younger than he or amy and uncomfortable with the gap though amys cousin did her best to make them part of things moyshe never felt unwelcome only out of place he supposed he had been as much an anomaly before but had been too preoccupied to notice had amy manipulated the invitation if so why another kindervoort ploy both jarl and mouse seemed eager to push them together why did he question everything even the questioning why did he feel that he was losing his grasp on his place in the universe they cuddled they drank the shadows closed in they probed one anothers pasts he learned that she had once had an abortion after having been tricked into pregnancy by a man who had wanted to marry her but whom she had loathed he resisted the temptation to ask why she had been in bed with him in the first place he also learned that she was afraid of sexual intercourse because of some failing in herself what she shied away from explaining he did not press time marched the sun of the party zenithed and hurried on he and amy stayed till everyone else had gone they feared leaving more than overstaying their welcome that room locked them into a cell with wellknown walls their interaction was defined by rules of courtesy toward their hostess the limits would expand a pale of hurt yet courtesy demanded that they leave before amys cousin found their presence painful the subtle differences between weeks coalesced and came to a head when they reached benrabis cabin amy was frightened unsure so was he this time they knew something would happen the big it as they had called it when he was first becoming sexually aware like kids they were eager and afraid the pleasant sharing they wanted carried with it a big risk of pain thus did the sins of the past leave their marks both were so frightened of repeating old mistakes that they had almost abandoned trying anything new moyshe watched the processes of his mind with mild amazement the detached part of himself could not comprehend what was happening he had survived affairs even with the sangaree woman why this retrogression to the adolescent pain and confusion of the alyce era there was a long pale tense moment when the night balanced on the edge of a doubleedged blade amy stared at him as he slowly dismounted from the scooter then with a grimace she jammed the charging plug into a socket moyshe yielded to a surge of relief she had saved him the need to make a decision she would bear the blame if anything went wrong they remained nervous and frightened the tension had its effect in temporary impotence and difficult penetration they whispered a lot reassuring one another benrabi could not help remembering the first time with alyce both of them had been virgins now as then they managed the main point only after trying too hard experience made it easier from there the truly cruel blow did not fall till the ultimate moment at the peak instant moyshe felt a flood of hot wetness against his groin something he had thought the exclusive domain of pornography amy started crying she had lost bladder control egomad with that stunning proof of his manhood benrabi laughed and collapsed upon her holding her tightly she thought he was laughing at her her nails ripped his skin angry words filled the air she tried to knee him he rolled away baffled and babbling hair streaming wet with their sweat trailing a damp wrinkled sheet amy fled into the corridor by the time benrabi got into his jumpsuit and started after her she was a hundred meters down the corridor scooter forgotten trying to wrap herself in the sheet as she fled amy come back im sorry too late she would not listen he started after her but gave it up when people began coming out to see what was going on he went back and pondered what he had done he had given her a gutkick in a festering wound this must have happened before and have caused her a lot of grief this was why she had been so frightened but she had come to him anyway hoping for understanding and he had laughed fool he said flinging a pillow against a wall then she should have warned me he realized that she had in her timorous way he had to do something before her anger ossified into hatred he tried he really tried he returned her clothing with a long apologetic note he called but she would not answer he visited kindervoort and asked his help but that seemed to do no good their paths no longer crossed she did not return to work he could not corner her and make her listen the sword had fallen his new supervisor another of kindervoorts people was a small hard character named lyle bruce bruce was uncommunicative and prejudiced he was intolerant and grossly unfair repairs had to be done his way even though he was less skilled than amy mouse and benrabi took it all and smiled back so bruce tried harder his turn in the barrel will come mouse promised this is just some test kindervoort is putting on benrabi agreed he wont last ill sweet him to death benrabi was right next week bruce was replaced by a man from damage control martin king was not exactly friendly but neither was he antagonistic he was a prejudiced man controlling his prejudices for the good of danion he did nothing to hamper their work at shifts end one day he told moyshe im supposed to take you to kindervoorts office oh why he didnt say what about supper something will be arranged all right lets go kindervoorts office was a place comfycozy in nineteenthcentury english decor lots of dark wood scores of books a fireplace would have set it off perfectly have a seat moyshe kindervoort suggested hows it going out there benrabi shrugged dumb question huh he left his chair came around his desk and sat on its corner this isnt really business relax he paused no thats not all the way true everything gets to be business sooner or later i want to talk about amy you willing why not after all this was the man he had come running to when things had fallen apart its personal i thought you might be touchy i am and honest ill be honest too i want to help because youre my friends not close but friends and ive got a professional interest of course theres going to be more of this kind of trouble thats bad for danion i want to find ways to smooth things over nicely rehearsed speech moyshe thought you want to use me and amy as guinea pigs in a way but its not just an experiment youre what counts in the end moyshe fought his reaction to kindervoorts appearance he pushed back the anger and resentment this interference stimulated swirling visions of stars and darkness the image of the gun flaming on a black velvet background he had never had it so strongly nor in such detail fear replaced anger what was happening what did this deadly vision mean to his unconscious mind moyshe are you all right kindervoort bent over him studying his eyes his voice was remote benrabi rumbled for an answer his tongue betrayed him ghosts had begun dancing inside his head he could not focus his attention a burning crowbar drove through his right eyesocket migraine he gasped it was so sudden none of the little spots or the geometric figures that were the usual warnings just the ghosts the guns and that curiously familiar stellar backdrop benrabi groaned the devil himself had him by the skull trying to crush it down to pea size kindervoort bounced back around his desk took something from a drawer dashed through a door into an adjoining bathroom returned with pills and water benrabi watched with little interest the pain had become the dominant force in his universe there was just him and it and now voices he heard them faint and far away unintelligible but real like snatches of conversation caught drifting down a hallway from a distant room he tried to listen but the agony made a flaming barrier against concentration moyshe herere some pills moyshe cant you hear me a hand grabbed benrabis chin pulled back fingers forced his mouth open dry bitter tablets burned his tongue water splashed him a hand covered his mouth and nose till he had no choice but to swallow the hand departed he gasped for air he had not screamed not yet because he could not the pain was killing him and he could do nothing but cling to its shooting star down it went down into darkness seconds later he recovered the pain vanishing as quickly as it had come with it went the ghosts and voices but he remained disoriented kindervoort was seated behind his desk again talking urgently into an intercom exact time you went on minddrive he glanced at his watch were the comnets open thanks he switched off his expression was grave moyshe had to have more water he felt as dry as a blake city summer he tried to rise water stay there kindervoort snapped dont move ill get it glass in hand he rushed into the bathroom benrabi fell back into his chair shivering both from shock and coolness he had sweated out a good liter the painkiller which hit the system as fast as a nerve poison worked perfectly but did nothing to ease nervous exhaustion he would not be able to move for a while several glasses of water and a blanket helped when he felt human enough to talk again kindervoort went on as if nothing had happened moyshe i think its important that we work out something between you and amy both on the personal and social level uhm will you talk to her ive been trying for a week and a half all right easy easy he thumbed his intercom bill send miss coleridge in now amy burst through the door what happened i heard softly so moyshe could not hear kindervoort explained amys concern became mixed with dismay she moved to benrabi are you all right ill live unfortunately moyshe moyshe whatre we going to do im going to say im sorry he murmured the apologies and explanations came easy with the edge off their emotions though amy remained sensitive her problem as moyshe had suspected had caused her a lot of grief kindervoort thoughtfully absented himself in an hour or so they concluded a cautious truce fourteen ad the olden days academy perchevski stared out the window as the airbus banked into its geneva approach something was happening down by the lake a cluster of flashing red lights hugged the shore ladies and gentlemen this is your pilot air traffic control has asked me to relay a security service warning theres trouble on the northbound traffic tube terrorists have occupied number three station they could try to retreat through the tubeway or take passenger hostages the tube is open but youll have to use it at your own risk perchevski watched the flashing lights and darting gnat figures of zone police till the bus dropped too low later as he crossed the tarmac to a waiting hovercar he heard the shooting an occasional explosion drowned the titter of light weaponry theyre putting up a fight said the rating leaning against the groundcar sir sounds like what do they want the rating shrugged opened the passenger side door i dont think anybody asked sir the zonies dont bother anymore they just shoot them and get ready for the next bunch he closed the door moved to the pilots side company office sir yes who are they how did they get in a new mob sir call themselves the ninth of june i dont know what it means neither do i they broke through at checkpoint ahrsen yesterday usual surprise attack another mob hit there the day before and the zonies didnt get everything put back together fast enough they always find a way we had a bunch come in by hot air balloon last year perchevski left the car for the office where he had helped greta helsung catch her rainbow he checked in said he was returning to luna command and glanced over what they had on the girl an hour later he was headed for the lakeside launch pits he drew the same driver this time the rating regaled him with a saga concerning his conquest of a pink patch lady she had loved him so much she had almost enlisted pink patch people were old earthers who worked in the zone but lived outside the uniform patch was their entry permit each was kirlian keyed to prevent terrorist use perchevski was back in his lunar apartment before bedtime next evening he took a pill and put himself out for twelve hours old earth and his mother had been a miserable mistake he did not check his calls right away he did not want to risk finding a summons from the bureau there was none the only messages were from max and greta max was missing him greta was scared and lonely and amazed by everything perchevski reacted to gretas call first he remembered how frightened and lonely he had been when he had come to academy even hating home he had been dreadfully homesick he made a call to academy information learned that greta had been assigned to a training battalion but the battalion had not begun training the rigorous discipline of academy would not isolate her for weeks she could have visitors she would be allowed a weekly visit from her sponsor after she began training things have changed since my day lieutenant he told the woman handling his call since mine too commander were getting soft maybe seems like a step in the right direction to me ill be there this evening id appreciate it if youd let me surprise her whatever you say commander thanks for your time lieutenant he settled back in his bed stared at the ceiling and wondered why he was sponsoring a kid he hardly knew sponsorship was serious business his reponsibility under lunar law equaled that of a parent will you sponsor the man had asked and he had responded without thinking how could he do right by greta in his line of work maybe beckhart would move him to a staff post old buddy you backed yourself into a corner this time how do you get into these things ah what was the worry greta would be locked up in academy for four years she would have no chance for anything but training and study his sponsorship would not amount to anything but quotations in her files she would reach the age of responsibility before she graduated maybe he knew that unconsciously when he agreed he called max no answer he donned his commanders uniform and took the highvelocity tube to academy station the tube passed through the core of the moon academy was farside though he still used the perchevski name he had abandoned the missilemans uniform after high command had announced von drachaus raid there seemed little point to the pretense the bureau apparently agreed no one had called him on it the tubeways were the gossip shops of luna command there strangers whiled away the long transits by dissecting the latest in scandal and rumor it was there that perchevski first heard the march of ulant discussed seriously max had talked about it of course but max was a civ max had been retailing fourthhand merchandise the people he overheard were planetary defense corps general staff officers from worlds far centerward of sol they were in luna command for a series of highpowered defense strategy seminars cold fear breathed down perchevskis neck the what might be debatable but he could no longer deny that something spooky was going on he had been seeing the colorful and sometimes odd uniforms of the local forces everywhere he had gone lately there were even a few from worlds not part of confederation no wonder there were rumors of war he checked in with the local office when he arrived he was wearing the ring of course but redundancy of action and mistrust of technology were bureau axioms a staff type told a computer terminal where he was then in boredom resumed watching a holodrama he caught a bus to academys visitors hotel academy was an almost autonomous fortressstate within the fortressworld of luna command nearly ten percent of the moons surface and volume had been set aside for the school which trained every service officer and almost half of all enlisted personnel academy contained all the staff colleges war colleges and headquarters of special warfare schools which kept the service honed to a fighting edge at times as many as two million people taught and studied there perchevski had spent eight years in academy glimpsing the outside universe only rarely passes had been few in his day going out usually meant having to take part in some very active training exercise there had been no time left over for sightseeing he was supposed to have graduated as a dedicated unquestioning confederation warrior he supposed even the best systems made mistakes he enjoyed his venture into the old familiar halls remembering incidents recalling classmates he had not thought of in years he was amused by all the bright freshly scrubbed young faces behind those snappy salutes gretas battalion was quartered not far from the barracks his own had occupied he spent an hour ambling through school days memories it was late when he located the officer of gretas training battalion the dateletter designation on the door could be interpreted to tell that gretas was the fortythird officer candidate unit activated in he whistled softly they were taking candidates at a wartime rate there must be something to the rumors nothing else would explain why greta had been assigned to an officer training unit almost instantaneously a rating was closing the office you the officer looking for the helsung girl yes chief sorry im late the petty officer muttered something sarcastic that attitude going to relay itself to the middies chief sorry sir its been a bad day where can i find her alpha company room twentyfive were just starting the battalion sir its one of your remedials for candidates without a service background thanks chief go ahead and close up ill only stay a few minutes perchevski entered the barracks block generations of midshipmen had passed through it the air was heavy with age and human scent he found a corridor and followed it glancing at the name tags on the cubicle doors he located helsung greta hamburg earth paired with james leslie from someplace on sierra called token offering no one answered his knock he followed the noise of a holoset on to the company commons some twenty youngsters were watching holo or playing games without enthusiasm homesickness thickened the air greta sat in a vinylcovered armchair she had heels pulled up against her behind her arm embraced her knees she had an air of infinite sadness of unspeakable loneliness a tenyearold with a boarding school voice snapped tenshut as you were people greta hurled herself at him she flung her arms around his neck i didnt think id ever see you again easy girl dont break anything he felt better about himself suddenly it was great to have someone glad to see him how come youre here i thought you were going to see your mother i did we were both disappointed oh im sorry its all right i didnt expect much come on sit down hows it going what do you think of the moon i havent seen anything yet everythings bigger than i thought it would be whats happening back home nothing new homesick she shook her head fibber i was here too remember and i still get homesick thats why i go back sometimes of course i came up with neil armstrong dont tease me all right tell you what i talked to your company commander old greasy hair i hate him already perchevski laughed youll hate him a lot more before youre done hes going to be your father mother priest god and devil look do you want to see the rest of the moon you wont have a chance after classes start dont you have something better to do youve got your job and your own friends im on vacation sort of and i dont have many friends here i dont want to put you out a skinny little black girl with pigtailed hair wearing a ragged woolen smock was staring at them oh leslie come here this is leslie james commander my roommate hi les where is token offering i visited sierra once but i dont remember it the girl said something into a mouth full of fingers and retreated shes shy greta said her parents must be dead she came from an orphanage were all orphans one way or another navy is our family greta looked at him oddly then can we take her with us if we go uhm youre starting to understand already i dont know it might be complicated ill ask if you want i think so okay id better go its past visiting hours i just wanted to see how you were ill be back tomorrow she squeezed his hand thank you for everything her hands were soft and smooth and warm he spent the evening entertaining fantasies he would never pursue the inside man never ages he spends the rest of his life in love with the soft smooth warm girls he knew when he was young and just becoming aware of what marvelous creatures females are where do you want to go girls they were at academy station perchevski was watching greta try to peoplewatch without being offensive oddly uniformed folks surrounded them i dont know greta replied luna command was no sightseers paradise it had no spectacular ruins or monuments the real sights were outside the mountains and craters of the surface he took the girls to tycho dome and for a ride on one of the surface trains he treated them to the best restaurants and hotels gretas response was gratifying leslies remote he ran out of ideas after two days all but the alien digs and he had promised those to max max could take the pressure off she would have ideas he took the girls to her shop hello walter max said her voice was chilly she stared at greta greta did not notice she was engrossed in the showcases hi lady anything for me same old stuff is that what youve been doing since you got back come on max shes sixteen greta come here i want you to meet max max greta helsung and her friend leslie greta was not imperceptive hi max the commander is my sponsor your sponsor you never told me you had a kid walter im a man of mystery love how come she calls you walter your name is cornelius because hes a man of mystery dear max replied everybody has a different name for him hes some kind of spy i dont think he knows his real name himself max wow really yes really max you talk too much i came here to see if you still wanted to go to the farside dig someone entered the shop behind him max said hello hi tall blonde and desirable thomas is that you what the hell are you doing here perchevski turned mouse had come in he gave greta an admiring onceover thats right you know max dont you max i really want that manchurian collection but youre going to have to come down on it its just not worth twelve thousand i can see what you want hands off shes your buddys kid and i can get fifteen if i send it out to amonhotep to greta she explained this is one of your old mans buddies hes a spy too perchevski shook his head shes in a roman candle mood today mouse i come in to ask her out and she plays mad dog with me i didnt know you were a collector lot of things we dont know about each other that seemed to close the subject mouse and i were in the same battalion in academy perchevski told greta mouse gave the girl another admiring look she moved closer to perchevski as if feeling for a protective shadow mouse smiled gently and resumed arguing with max perchevski wondered how he could demonstrate to her satisfaction that she was not in competition with inconquerable youth max you want to go to the farside digs or not when its convenient are you really a spy commander i guess you could put it that way greta how about after work max you sure you wont be busy perchevski closed his eyes took a long deep breath released it be patient he told himself whats your real name greta asked mouse watched his expression unreadable honey sometimes im not sure myself dont worry about it it doesnt matter if you need to get in touch just call the number i gave you if i cant get back to you one of my friends will but forget it subject closed max are you going to the digs or not you dont have to get snappy walter yes im coming what about you mouse me yes you want to see that new chamber they think it might shed some light on the sangaree therere some primitive murals that might be of human origin on a noahs ark theme with spaceships or arent you the culture type sure why not he looked at perchevski as if in appeal i dont know mouse maybe its the change why was mouse attaching himself because of the sangaree remark or because the old man wanted somebody to keep an eye on him after what had happened on the broken wings beckhart would be wondering about him the girls slept during the tube trip perchevski and mouse played chess on mouses pocket set prodded by max mouse related several anecdotes about perchevski while saying nothing about himself perchevski let him set the limits max did not seem the least interested in his former partner both men loosened up on sips from a flask max dug out of her jumpsuit emergency rations she claimed good thinking perchevski told her what is this a class reunion she demanded toward trips end mouse and perchevski had begun playing remember when they were reliving the great sunjammer race of in which they had crewed a ship and had beaten the best starwind yachtsmen in confederation that fluke victory was one of the brightest of perchevskis memories he and mouse had been a team then almost friends and for a few days afterward they had been closer than ever before or since those were the days mouse said ignoring max wish we could be kids forever think we could do it again getting too old nah i think ill check it out just for the hell of it want to try it if i can find a ship perchevski laughed better find the time off first were almost there the capsule had begun decelerating ill wake the girls they reached the digs an hour later the onetime alien base was being unearthed studied and explored at a snails pace the xenoarchaeologists had been working for decades and might be at it for centuries they sifted every grain of lunar dust and preserved it they did not want to miss a thing even through ignorance thus far the base had revealed more about humanitys past than it had about its builders the scientists had concluded that the station had served both scientific and military purposes and had been occupied continuously for at least ten millennia it seemed to have been abandoned approximately eleven centuries before its discovery just as mankind teetered on the brink of its first tentative step into space perchevski and his companions began with the museum of recovered artifacts most of which were everyday items comparable to human combs tableware wornout socks pill bottles broken furniture and the like the aliens had taken their fancy hardware with them ooh greta said as they approached a group of wax figurines they were ugly notice anything about them greta perchevski asked besides ugly yes look at how theyre dressed think all the legends about little people gnomes dwarves elves leprechauns the kobolds where you come from the largest alien figurine stood just a meter tall yeah youre right you know therere still people that believe in them one time i guess i was ten we went on a field trip to the black forest there was this old caretaker a kind of forest ranger who told us all these stories about the kobolds in the woods max interjected i think its more interesting that they resemble the spacemen of the ufo era everyone looked at her oh its not my idea i just liked it it was on the educational channel one time in the old days people used to see what they called flying saucers sometimes they claimed that space people talked to them they described them like this but nobody ever believed them where are they now leslie asked nobody knows perchevski replied they just disappeared nobodys found any other traces of them either ulant got into space before we did and they never ran into them what if theyre still watching mouse asked perchevski gave him a funny look spooky idea isnt it lets look at that new chamber max says they found some stuff there that isnt just cafeteria or rec room equipment maybe not perchevski could not guess what it might have been the chamber was large and wellpreserved with most of its furnishings intact and in place parallel function ought to result in parallel structure he said meaning you ought to be able to figure what this stuff is all he recognized were the faded mural walls which looked somewhat minoan he would have bet his fortune they had been done by human artists those he could see seemed to tell some sort of quest story its a solarium greta said without sun a hydroponics farm no thats not right hydroponics is different what what i mean is its almost like the desert house at the state botanical gardens in berlin see how the beds are laid out and those racks up there would hold the lights that make plants think theyre getting sunshine mouse laughed by jove i think the lady has something he indicated a small sign which proposed a similar hypothesis it also suggested that the painters of the murals might have been humans who had become protosangaree mouse suddenly gasped and seized his left hand in his right perchevski nearly screamed at the sharp agony surrounding his call ring whats the matter max and greta demanded oh hell perchevski intoned here we go again let up you bastards mouse snarled we got the message were coming for christs sake business max weve been called in and i mean in a hurry thomas ill kill him just when max im sorry whats going on she asked again we have to report in right now could you take the girls back to barracks business she sounded excited yeah the bastards mouse they said no more team jobs mouse shrugged ill get them home max promised perchevski kissed her turned to greta ive got to run out on you honey im sorry i really am thomas come on the old man means it wait a minute damn it i dont know how long ill be gone greta if you need something call my number or get ahold of max okay max sure max did not sound enthusiastic thomas he waved a hand kissed max again then greta and trotted off after mouse greta called a sad goodbye commander he was angry he was ready to skin beckhart with a butter knife the chance never came he and mouse were seized by mission prep the instant they hit bureau territory the training was intense and merciless and the explanations impossibly far between it went on around the clock waking and sleeping and after a few weeks perchevski was so tired and disoriented that he was no longer sure who he was tiny unextinguishable sparks of anger were all that kept him going education passed him to psych psych eventually passed him to medical for a week every opening of his eyes meant he was fresh off another operating table then education took another go at him while he recovered he had to read and when he slept computers pressureinjected information directly into his brain dragons in the night golden chinese dragons starfishers what the hell was it all about who was moyshe benrabi what was becoming of cornelius perchevski sometimes he screamed and fought them but they were as stubborn as entropy they kept right on rebuilding their new man this was the most intensive extensive prep he had ever undergone he saw mouse just twice during the whole prep period they shared the intense hypoteaching sessions briefing them about starfishers but did not intersect again till they met in their masters office perchevski thought they were prepping for different missions till the admiral got hold of them personally boys beckhart said youve just gone through hell and i did it to you im not proud of it it hurt me as much as it hurt you i dont like operating this way youll just have to take my word that its necessary and i know what you think about that tommy i dont blame you but give me the benefit of the doubt and try to trust me when i tell you that its imperative that we bring the starfishers into confederation as soon as possible such was the opening barrage in a oneway discussion lasting more than three hours beckhart talked endlessly and never answered even one of the questions perchevski thought pertinent he once protested you promised no more team jobs and i meant it when i said it tommy but this is the most hurried hurryup job weve ever had the cni told me to put my best men in she picked you my god tommy its only for a couple of weeks you cant put up with mouse that long its the principle beckhart ignored him veering instead into another track almost before he knew what was happening perchevski found himself aboard a warship bound for the nether end of the arm for a world that was galactically only a stones throw from the broken wings he did not like that it seemed to be tempting fate too much there wasnt a thing he did like about this mission they hadnt even let him say his goodbyes bureau thugs had surrounded him from the moment he had departed beckharts office hey moyshe mouse said cheerfully within an hour of their going aboard lets go up to the wardroom and play some chess fifteen ad operation dragon danion danion became as comfortable as an old wellworn shoe fact is its getting downright dull mouse complained toward the end of the third month what benrabi demanded all those ball games and you up to your ears in women and youre bored you got it partner like the man in the joke said women are fine but what do you do the other twentythree hours of the day amy made a remark that moyshe did not catch if thats how you feel mouse replied laughing you can carry your own damned books they were moving her into moyshes cabin benrabi was not overwhelmed by the idea nor was he sure how it had come about it had just sort of fenced him in pushed by amy and mouse till the move actually began and he still had not said no he preferred living alone sharing struck him as synonymous with imposition amys mere presence foreordained increased demands at least he would have someone around when the headaches came mouse and amy kept bickering mouse was teasing but amy sounded serious she did not like mouse much benrabis migraines came several times a week now he was scared the voices and visions he thought it might be a tumor but the seiner doctors would not take him seriously they gave him pain pills and told him not to worry he had been on continuous medication the last ten days he was pale dehydrated weak and shaky amy seemed to be the only one who cared and she would not say why his old downdeep fear that he was going mad seemed ever more creditable this is a hell of a time to take a livein lover he thought dumping an armload of clothing the relationship was paraplegic the inexplicable recurring memory of alyce did not help it frightened and disoriented him there was no reason for that old dead affair to obsess him it was just another symptom of whatever was happening to him but it was damned scary on the broken wings he had almost been the tough hard character he had been portraying now less than a year later he was a spineless whimpering disgusted he tried to kick a chair across the cabin it did not move all shipboard furniture was bolted down he resumed work in grim silence moyshe i need your help mouse said a month after the move voice sounding a plaintive note what how ill do whatever i can he glanced over his shoulder to make sure amy remained in the womens head he was surprised this tone did not fit his partner at all figure out a way to keep me from killing her benrabi followed mouses gaze it was fixed on the sangaree woman like the cross hairs of an assassins rifle scope shes working on me moyshe shes got me working on myself ive been having trouble sleeping i just lay there thinking up ways thinking about her being right down the passage its because of the mess on blackworld i cant get it out of my head and i thought i had it under control you too what the hell did beckhart do to us amazing mouses finally owning up to a connection with the shadowline war he must be under real stress selfdiscipline mouse thats the only answer ive got and maybe the notion that you ought to save yourself for a bigger target shes not worth getting burned over shes the queen in the game and the stakes are as big as they can get moyshe watch her ive never seen anybody so sure they had a winning hand shes got a royal flush in spades look youre mixing metaphors metaphors be damned moyshe i need help jesus benrabi thought here i am halfway to the psycho ward and my partner is crying for me to keep him out are we going to have one nut stand guard over the cracks in the others noggin lets take it to kindervoort then oh no this stays in the family jarl doesnt get anything free hows your head doing the docs keep saying theres nothing wrong it dont sound right i mean how come i hurt so goddamned much but maybe its true for a while i thought it was a tumor and they were just jollying me so i wouldnt panic but the scans didnt show anything when i finally got them to let me see them now i think something external is causing it allergy no i cant explain yet its just barely a suspicion so far that suspicion did not leaf out blossom and bear fruit for months time lumbered forward mouse worked himself into the shipwide chess finals benrabi had a falling out with the collector crowd among whom he had been a brief bright star they were older more prejudiced people and unable to tolerate his alienness indefinitely he trudged onward in his laborious relationship with amy he tried to make it work he sincerely believed he was giving it an honest go and for a while the curious alyce memories and attendant mental oddities withdrew but he never saw any longterm hope he even abandoned his writing in order to give her more time i just dont feel like writing he lied it isnt me anymore she protested but with such restraint that he began to resent her presence during moments when he could have written turn around twice and there went another month into the file cabinets of time and here was mouse with another moyshe i think i need help stay out of her way not the sangaree woman this time moyshe another one what else carrie just gave me the word that sally i was going with shes peegee come on youre shitting me people dont get pregnant unless oh my oh my yes unless they want to moyshe fought a grin you laugh and ill kick your head in me laugh im sorry its just that what do you want me to do sheeit moyshe i dont know talk to me ive never been up this tree before what is it she figure youd do the honorable thing why are you doing this to me mouse i had a handle on the alyce thing thats the name of the game thats the way they do things here and the way they lay their little traps straight from century one no law says youve got to give her what she wants though kiss her goodbye that was how he had failed alyce so long ago he had not found the strength to say no until it was too late i dont like to hurt anybodys feelings thats the chance she took isnt it how come it was so easy to say but so hard to do i dont see how anybody could believe in a marriage that started out that way anyway go on tell her to kiss off easier said than done moyshe i know advice is that way heres some more while were at it take your own precautions so it doesnt happen again that much i figured out for myself mouse went away he returned within the hour shaking his head she couldnt believe that landsmen dont give a damn if a kids parents are married or not but i think i finally got through to her for a while mouses social calendar was less crowded but only for a while the ladies seemed incapable of remaining away tell me something amy benrabi said one afternoon why are we here she started giving him the standard story thats not true danion didnt really need us certainly not a thousand of us even with only two hundred well finish up six months early your own damage control people wouldnt have taken much longer so whats really going on she would not tell him she even refused to speculate he suspected from her expression that she might not know that she was beginning to ask herself the questions that were bothering him his came of a long line of thinking sparked by snippets of information and flashes of intuition that had begun accumulating on carsons correct me if you can fault this hypothesis he told mouse when amy was out of hearing were guinea pigs in a coexistence experiment theyve got something big and dangerous going and they thought they could hire outside help to get through it id guess they expect heavy fighting our job descriptions all deal with damage control but the experiment was a failure no takers i wouldnt know moyshe youve got your head working who were they going to fight not us sharks maybe but it doesnt add up still im not much good at puzzles hows your head doing real good why i thought so youre more like the old moyshe lately they completed the last scheduled repair three weeks later from then on there was little to do one day a longfaced amy announced they just told me starting monday youll be assigned to damage control to the emergency ready room at dc south ill take you over and introduce you breaking up the team eh mouse asked where are you going back to security she did not sound pleased benrabi felt a guilty elation though he loved amy he did not like having her around all the time he felt smothered the damage control assignment was a crushing bore a fireman in a steel city would have more to do mouse complained a few days later he cornered benrabi in order to update him on his own snooping our fleet commander looks like a maverick he wont bow down to gruber of grubers fleet as the head honcho starfisher he wants to do things his own way the other fleets treat this one like an idiot cousin that why the old man targeted paynes fleet no he just jumped on a chance to get somebody onto a harvestship you were right about the experiment by the way it was something gruber put payne up to i get the impression that now hes using the failure as an excuse to go haring off on some adventure of his own as soon as were done harvesting speaking of which amy says its the best theyve ever had theyre going to hold their auction after we leave kindervoort still on you about crossing over he mentions it sometimes came to the cabin last week did mouse suspect that he found the offer tempting sports season became crazier than ever as playoff time approached for moyshe it was all bewildering color and madness mouse of course was right in the thick of it football was his latest passion he could quote records and statistics by the hour benrabi studied the game just so he could carry on a conversation their lives increasingly became frosting sugarbits having nothing to do with their assignments they had come here to find starfish despite a thousand doubts and distractions benrabi kept his wavering cross hair sighted near his programed target he even resumed wrestling with jerusalem so he could keep his invisible notes sharing quarters with an agent for the other side constantly hampered him he was not so na√Øve as to believe that amy had been struck deaf and blind by love he had come aboard thinking starfish were a wonderful concept a miraculous hook on which to hang modern myths and legends they had been one with the lost planet osiris and the fabulous weapons of stars end now he knew that the hydrogen streams teemed with life the fairy magic was gone but still the fantastic fish were something to play with during his long hours of waiting for an emergency that never arose the starfish the leviathans of the airless deep were more fields of force and the balances between them than they were creatures of matter the longbeards of the breed could be three hundred kilometers long and a million years old they might occupy thousands of cubic kilometers yet have fewer atoms in them than a human adult in them atoms and molecules functioned primarily as points upon which forces anchored here there a pinpoint hawking hole left over from the big bang formed the core of an invisible organ the fabric of space and time were the creatures bone and sinew he could manipulate them within himself in essence he built himself a secondary universe within the primary and within that homemade pocket reality existed as tangibly as did men in their own reality the part of a starfish that could be detected was but a fraction of the whole beast he also existed in hyperspace null space and on levels mankind had not yet reached those beasts of the big night were living fusion furnaces they fed on hydrogen and enjoyed an occasional spice of other elements in the fusion chain at first moyshe had wondered why they did not gather where matter was more dense as in the neighborhood of a protostar amy told him that the field stresses around stellar masses could rip the creatures apart a starfishs stomach contained a fire as violent as that at the heart of a sun not only did fusion take place there but matter annihilation as well when the beast browsed on antihydrogen with that part of him coexisting in a counteruniverse benrabi did not speculate on the physics he was a field man a supernova seemed kindergarten stuff by comparison he simply noted his thoughts in invisible ink and hoped the bureaus tame physicists could make something of them mouse ive run into a philosophical problem he said one morning about the fish youve lost me already moyshe ive gotten onto something thats turning my thinking inside out which is that this isnt your usual man cattle relationship its a partnership if the fishers arent the cows the fish are intelligent probably more intelligent than we are he looked around no one was listening they have what they call a mindtech section in ops sector somehow they communicate with the starfish mind to mind whered you get that around keeping my ears open adding things up so the ugly old psi theory raises its head again out here you know what the old mans scientists will say about that theyll have to loosen up those stiff necks but what i think is interesting is the research possibilities research historical research the fish have been in contact with other races and some of them are over a million years old thats a lot of remembering im thinking like oceans the hydrogen streams supported a complete ecology including the predatory shark the starfishs natural enemy there were a dozen species even the biggest and most dangerous was much smaller than an adult starfish however like man and wolves several of the species hunted in cooperative packs they could even pursue their prey through hyperspace packs shadowed all the great herds they struck when a fish straggled sometimes when driven by hunger they tried to cut individual fish from the herd and occasionally when their numbers reached a certain critical mass a whole pack went berserk and threw itself at the herd the starfish were not helpless they could burp up balls of gut fire and sling them around like granddaddy nuclear bombs but sharks were fast and the burping was slow a starfish under attack seldom had a chance for more than one defensive attempt he had to count on the help of his herdmates who might be under attack themselves thus inadequate the starfish sometimes needed allies to survive when the earliest seiners had located their first starfish herd the shark packs had been expanding rapidly that first herd had been threatened with extinction its fish had touched the minds of those early seiners had found in them a hope and so had contacted them and had made a bargain they would produce ambergris in quantity in exchange for human protection therere times when i think theyre trying to touch me benrabi told mouse after rehearsing what history he had learned what makes you think that mouse seemed excited by the idea probably just my imagination he was reluctant to tell mouse that he sometimes dreamed of vast swimming spatial panoramas oddly alive with things never seen by human eyes dragons flew there and played with a ponderousness unmatched even in old earths vanished whales each time he dreamed the dream he wakened with a screaming migraine so those first fishers armed themselves he said resuming his history lesson the fish taught them to detect the sharks the herd slowly recovered but the sharks in their slow fashion reasoned they learned to associate casualties with the hard things shepherding their prey in the middle thirties they had begun getting harvestships as well as herds forcing the seiners to defend themselves before they protected their allies this past year they had begun attacking the ships first and cooperating between packs of different species their numbers were still expanding soon the seiners feared they would be numerous enough to attack and destroy whole harvestfleets no ships had yet been lost but the attack on danion had demonstrated the reality of the peril the starfishers believed themselves at war and feared it was a war they could not win they were too few and too weakly armed packs are migrating here from deeper in the galaxy moyshe concluded i suppose because of a depleted food supply there thats it mouse asked whatd you expect its hard to get anything out of amy she may be sleeping with me but she doesnt forget that im the other old enemy the landsman about the only other thing is that theyre desperate for more and better weapons they might have something cooking there any time i mention weapons amy changes the subject fast in fact she usually left the cabin that scared him something big was going on and she did not want to risk giving him a hint her behavior confirmed the feeling he had had from the beginning this was no ordinary harvest danion had been under drive for weeks moyshes suspicions had become stronger harvestships seldom went hyper the fish did not like it were the beasts following the fleet nobody was talking even the friendliest seiners had little to say anymore the year was winding down he had learned a lot but still nothing concrete nothing of genuine advantage to the bureau and confederation was the mission going to end up a wild goose chase playing spyvsspy in the bedroom with amy had become agonizing yet he had to pursue his tradecraft he had to try to learn and he did not dare relax he could not forget the sangaree woman she was still there and still very much involved in her own mission whatever her game was it was in its final moves she had resumed pushing mouse hard confident of her strength the drives had been dead a week danion had reached her destination whole new sections of the ship had been closed to landsmen the seiners who came and went there were more closed mouthed than ever some whom moyshe considered friends would barely acknowledge his greetings whatever they were doing they wanted no hint to get back landside work schedules went to shiftandahalf there were no exceptions benrabi and mouse just spent that much more time being bored whatever it is its dangerous mouse said theyre all scared green the shark packs are collecting like ten times thicker than theyve ever seen i watched one of the service ship crews come in this morning they rotated with an alternate crew fighting just exhausted i think i didnt see any stretchers but kindervoorts thugs ran me off before i could find out anything despite kindervoort they gleaned their bits of information theyre in a race against time benrabi told mouse i heard one guy say they wouldnt get a chance to gamble if the sharks hit aggressive mass before they finish their experiments what did he mean are they working on some new weapon benrabi shrugged i didnt ask but i sure wouldnt mind knowing what theyre risking my life for one evening after a workday spent within taunting distance of the sangaree woman benrabi and mouse tried to relax over a chessboard youre shook up again mouse observed while staring at his pieces whats up trouble with amy thats part of it ive only seen her twice all week she just comes in long enough to shower and change so shes not sitting on the only one in the universe the little redhead penny something from new earth shes young enough to be my kid mouse only a couple of years older than greta mouse flung his hands up in mock exasperation whats that got to do with it shes willing isnt she maybe but i think im more a father image so indulge in a little incest it doesnt matter anyway sex isnt the problem what its always a problem one way or another mouse chuckled he chuckled again as he ambushed moyshes queen moyshe could not keep his mind on his game the want had returned mildly along with that damned thing with the gun what is the problem then the way people are treating us i guess theyre so scared they wont have anything to do with us check check there too part of its the sangaree woman moyshe shes telling stories on us again trying to isolate us i wonder why one move to mate they batted possibilities around moyshe so loathed the one that occurred to him that he refused to mention it right away his game grew increasingly poor he became irritable the i want grew stronger louder mocking him telling him that he was on the threshold of its fulfillment and was too blind to see it i cant hold off much longer mouse said taking a pawn with a savage grab next time she gouges me or the next ill bend her and damned be the consequences please dont were almost home weve only got five weeks to go mouse slaughtered a knight you think we should let her set us up benrabi glanced at mouses emotionless face back to the disaster already developing on the chessboard i yield the more he reflected the more he was sure he knew what marya was planning he stood abruptly scattering chessmen we may have to have to what bend her for our own good i know what shes doing we ignored the obvious suppose she has the same kind of tracer we did theyve got the technology and suppose she has control and didnt turn it on till after the seiners stopped worrying about things like that got you lets not bend her lets just chop the tracer out mouse returned his chessmen to their box with loving care then recovered a wicked homemade plastic knife from beneath his mattress lets go benrabi thought of a dozen reasons for putting it off but could not articulate a one it was time marya was put out of the game she was too dangerous they were halfway to her cabin when he stopped struck by a sudden thought mouse what if shes expecting us doesnt seem likely you cant overlook anything in this business thats true let me think a minute for months they had known that the seiners sometimes listened in on them when they did not want to be overheard they carefully lipread one another never verbalizing anything that might excite an eavesdropper i think i made a mistake bringing this up in your cabin yeah maybe but its too late to cry if she bugged us she bugged us whatre you going to do im thinking i dont got a whole lot of use for pyrrhic victories you know they continued talking quietly ten meters from maryas door three seiners on a flying scooter squealed round a corner and skidded to a stop at maryas door they wore security patches one moved toward mouse and benrabi hand on his weapon then stood easy they tried to look like curious bystanders the other security men eyed the door looks like we get it done for us mouse theyre not thinking mouse growled benrabis heart pounded out a flamenco these guys were too sure of themselves they overrode the door closure a pair of explosions greeted them one man fell in the doorway the other flung himself inside the one facing mouse and benrabi whirled charged into the cabin too his face had gone grey they heard grunts and a cry of pain homemade gunpowder weapons benrabi gasped nice welcome she had for us mouse looked up and down the passageway come on before we draw a crowd benrabi did not know what mouse planned but he followed mouse went in the door low scooping the weapon from the hand of the dying seiner benrabi scrambled after him seizing another fallen handgun the sangaree woman had her back to the door she was struggling with the last security man her left hand darted past his guard smashing his windpipe he gagged she followed up with a bonebreaking blow over his heart benrabis grunt of sympathy warned her of enemies to her rear slowly mouse said as she started for the seiners weapon id hate to shoot for once she had no instantaneous retort mouses tone made it clear there was nothing he would hate less than killing her emotional pain twisted her face when she turned once again from her viewpoint they had outmaneuvered her and this time might be fatal her agony turned into a strained smile after a moment youre too late the smile broadened it became anticipatory theyre on their way by now moyshe get that man in here and close the door how bad is he hes gone better be nice marya said as benrabi forced the door shut she had the sense to keep her voice neutral to survive to enjoy her victory she had to overcome the obstacle she had made of mouse theyll be here soon you wont want them mad at you this ones gone too benrabi said the other one might make it marya dont think the seiners will hand over a harvestfleet because a few raidships turn up she smiled that gunmetal smile he remembered ruined merchantmen left in the wake of sangaree raiders they would come with enough gunpower there would be no survivors an alarm began hooting it was a forlorn call to arms general quarters mouse shes for real the borrowed weapon seemed to swell painfully in his hand a part of him was telling him it was time he finished what he had started on the broken wings sixteen ad operation dragon combat time telescoped then coiled around itself like some mad snake trying to crush itself it detached maryas battlefield cabin from the macrouniverse establishing an independent timeline ten seconds became an eternal instant benrabi was afraid something clicked inside mouse he slipped into assassins mind benrabi vacillated between answering the alarm and staying to restrain the organic killing machine danion shivered moyshe recognized the feel of service ships launching im going on station mouse keep her here till jarls people come and keep her alive mouse nodded mechanically he was easily guided while in assassins mind if psych had keyed him to accept your direction he would be upset later he wanted to show the woman the death of a thousand cuts or something equally grisly he was on his way back to the real universe already take the guns moyshe hide them what about this he tapped the plastic knife thrust through a tool loop on his jumpsuit all right benrabi collected the weapons he hid them in mouses cabin then headed for damage control south whats up he asked one of his teammates when he arrived sangaree raidships they say theres at least fifty of them thats scary in more ways than one what do you mean that their show is being put on by a consortium no one family has that kind of muscle the last time they put that many ships together was for the helgas world thing during the shadowline war the seiner regarded benrabi with a puzzled fearful frown moyshe was talking foreign history moyshe found his fellow landsmen in a lowgrade panic they had no faith in seiner arms and they were sure the starfishers would fight he did not understand till he heard the seiners themselves secondguessing payne fleet commander payne had refused to negotiate or back down he had told the sangaree that he would fight to the last harvestship whatre we fighting about moyshe asked plaintively his seiner companions refused to enlighten him he felt that touch of panic himself he never had wanted to die with his boots on not since he had given up boyhood daydreams he had no interest in dying at all not for several thousand years time moved with the haste of pouring treacle he knew the sangaree ships were maneuvering in the darkness outside outgunned service ships were moving to meet them the death dance had begun moyshe stood facing the dark gate with all the unanswerable questions still banging around in his mind the nature of his want remained the biggest closely followed by the meaning of the gun thing he started worrying about amy where was she would she be safe stupid question he muttered of course she was not safe nobody was safe today then he saw her standing at the tool crib what was she doing here she spotted him started his way wheres mouse she asked he explained quickly good she said when he finished she tried to remain cool but a tear formed in the corner of one eye she brushed at it irritably she had caught some of the groundside uninvolvement disease from him he thought why else would a seiner hide her emotions three men had died it was a sad affair she said ill call jarl he may not have sent anyone else down moyshe resumed his seat stared at the deck tensely counting rivets and welds when would the sangaree missiles arrive the attack when it came was not sangaree the dullwitted sharks confused and distressed by the sudden appearance of so many more ships reached emotional critical mass they attacked in all directions scraps of news filtered in from operations sector some were good some bad the sangaree were having a hard time but the sharks attacking the harvestfleet were concentrating on danion in the sea of nothing the service ships were killing and sometimes being killed by sharks the sangaree vainly fought an enemy invisible to their equipment while foolishly continuing to try for a position of vantage against the harvestfleet there was a wan hope in that moyshe thought the sharks might take care of them but then who would take care of the sharks danion shivered continuously all her weaponry was in action firing on sangaree and sharks alike benrabi grimaced as he wondered just what the monster ship mounted he waited with his team in the heart of the great mobile he smelling their fear and they his amy quivered like a frightened rabbit in the crook of his arm alarms screamed each time the sharks penetrated the defenses but dc south received no emergency calls courage brewed beneath the fear there was no tension between landsman and seiner now they were united in defiance of an unprejudiced death danion rocked sirens raked their wicked nails over a million blackboards officers shouted into the confusion a damagecontrol team piled aboard an electric truck and hurtled off to aid technicians in the stricken sector behind them the mood gradually turned grim as the fear unable to sustain itself indefinitely faded into a lower key an abiding dread each technician sat quietly alone with his or her thoughts the damage reports began arriving nearly ten percent of danions population were either dead or cut off from the main lifesupport systems more trucks left survivors had to be brought out before the emergency systems failed and there moyshe sat doing nothing awaiting his dying turn somewhere in the big nothing the sangaree raidmaster decided he had had enough his fleet took hyper bequeathing the starfishers his share of ghostly foes suits said the blankfaced fisher directing dc ops when the news arrived he foresaw the end they drew spacesuits from the emergency lockers benrabi donned his while thinking that this was the first time he had worn one seriously always before it had been for training or fun he wondered why mouse had not yet shown was he in the sector cut off he asked amy no theres no damage there yet jarl probably hasnt had a chance to do anything our people should all be manning weapons danion screamed whirled beneath them moyshe fell his suit servoes hummed and forced him to his feet the gravity misbehaved he floated into the air then came down hard the lights weakened died returned as emergency power entered the lines a shark had hit danions main power and drives somebody was yelling at him amy what he was too upset to listen closely heard only that his team was going out he jumped at the truck as it started rolling seiner hands dragged him aboard twenty minutes later in an odd part of the ship devoted to fusion plant his team captain set him to securing broken piping systems whole passageways had been ripped apart gaps opened on the night sometimes he saw it starless as he worked but thought nothing of it he was too busy hours later when the pipes no longer bled and he had time for sloth he noticed a vacuumruined corpse tangled in a mass of wiring dark against an outer glow that gave him pause space it was what he was not supposed to see so of course he had to look he walked to the hole saw nothing he pushed the corpse aside leaned out still nothing no stars no constellations no milky way nothing but a tangle of harvestship limned by a sourceless glow he stood there frozen in disbelief for he knew not how long no stars where were they that there were no stars the harvestship rotated slowly something gradually appeared beyond tubing spars and folded silver sails the source of the glow he recognized it but did not want to believe it it was the galaxy edge on seen from beyond its rim his premonitions returned to haunt him what outside the galaxy was near enough to be reached by ship far away another harvestship coruscated under shark attack danion had shuddered to several while he worked but none had been bad there was an explosion aboard the other vessel gases spewed from her broken hull but his eyes fled her hurrying on to the coinsized brightness rising in the direction of rotation it was a planet selfilluminating no sun there was only one such place stars end certain destruction for all who went near what were the seiners doing were they mad suicidal something broke something blossomed across the face of the galaxy a hundred times brighter a fire like that of an exploding star a harvestship was burning in a flame only a multidimensional shark could have ignited they were growing more cunning were spraying antimatter gases that totally devoured in a corner of his mind a little voice asked as a fisher would if that vessels death had served the fleet were sharks dying there too his gaze returned to stars end all his myths were hemming him in he did not doubt that the sangaree would return it was not their style to back down when the stakes were high and there was more on the line now than a source of ambergris he knew why the seiners had come here as did all who sought stars end they wanted the fortress worlds fabulous weapons for centuries opportunists had tried to master the planet whoever possessed its timeless might became dictator to the arm no modern defense could withstand the power of stars end weaponry nor could sharks the weapons were the salvation for which payne had dared hope what a faint hope benrabi knew there was no way to penetrate the planets defenses battle fleets had failed a hand touched his shoulder a helmet met his a voice came by conduction were pulling out danions been hit inboard of us we dont want to get trapped here in those words moyshe imagined great sadness but little of the fear he felt himself they managed to reach dc south again only by trekking several kilometers afoot through regions of ship that looked like they had been mauled by naval weaponry moyshe found it hard to believe that the wrecking had been done by a creature he could not see a room had been prepared for them to relax in with snacks and drinks and secure enough so they dared shed their suits mouse was there wounded and bleeding mouse what the hell i shouldve bent her straight off moyshe she got to me tricked me now shes into it somewhere it was a big and confused ship she could disappear easily how moyshe examined mouses left arm it was angled mouse had gotten a tourniquet on somehow thing like a hatchet mouses face was drawn and bloodless but he did not protest benrabis rough hands she mustve caught you napping that dont sound like you yeah we were playing chess chess for christs sake shes pretty good for a woman nailed me when i was moving in for a mate benrabi shook his head are you for real he could picture it an overconfident mouse suggesting a game to kill time getting too deep into alternate moves to react quickly stupid but in character how many times have i told you it was going to get you into trouble someday god damn moyshe dont mother me not now do something about the arm eh nobody around here is interested i could lose it and these clowns dont do regeneration surgery amy wheres amy coleridge benrabi asked he found her you seen mouse he needs a doctor bad i saw him come in theres one on the way the woman yeah what was marya doing now this was the price of not having let mouse have his way on the broken wings on his hands was the blood of a friend in his mind a nagging gunmetal smile whatever feeling he might have had for her or she for him they were of enemy tribes that was the overriding rule in the end neither could give quarter ill take care of it mouse he whispered to his friend you keep amy busy he rose keep an eye on him will you love ill be back in a couple minutes she asked no questions probably assuming he was off to the toilet from the tool crib he drew an old takadi model vi laser cutting torch it was a lightduty onehanded tool meant for sheet metal trimming the crib attendant asked no questions he slipped out of dc and into an empty office nearby it took just minutes to make the modifications he had been taught in a bureau school he created an unwieldy lasegun then he stole a scooter and took off he had tried to think like the woman while modifying the torch he presumed that she would not know the attacks were shark and not her own peoples she would do something to neutralize the ship without damaging it her specialty dealt with atmosphere she would head for central blowers she could take out operations if she could cut its oxygen supply he hurtled through passageways impatiently trying to remember the way to the blower rooms fate seemed determined to stall him damage compelled long detours he had to wait on emergency traffic people kept stopping him to tell him to get a suit on the scooter low on power slowed to a crawl he had to walk a kilometer before he found another unattended but he eventually reached his destination and instantly knew that he had guessed right dead men guarded the closed blower room door from within their weapons if they had been armed were gone moyshe glanced at the thing in his hand would it work the blower room was vast it served only danions core but still was a wild jungle of massed machinery and ducting a lot of air needed moving and scrubbing she was in there somewhere trying to kill them half an hour departed with antelope fleetness he wandered among the brobdingnagian machines and found nothing danion kept shivering but the battle had become so old that it no longer caught his attention an overpowering fatalism had set in now a feeling that he was completely powerless in the greater situation but damn it was a long skirmish weariness preoccupied him he had been through twenty hard emotionally draining hours he finally located the huge ring of consoles from which danions core oxygen levels and humidities were controlled he crawled he climbed he attained himself a perch on a high catwalk from which most of the controls were visible he saw only empty seats where a dozen technicians should have been stationed corpses lolled lifelessly in two more a body lay like a broken doll on the aluminum grate decking she had been here what was she doing now the question answered itself she appeared as if spontaneously generated moving among the boards selecting cutoffs benrabi aimed his makeshift weapons marya maria her names ripped themselves from him against his will she had been closer to him in some hidden part of him than he had realized her head jerked up turning startled her eyes were narrow and searching that mocking smile exploded across her face moyshe what are you doing here she hunted him with jerkily moving eyes her hand hovering near a holstered captured weapon she was afraid and she wanted to shoot youre trying to kill us he croaked what a stupid thing to say of course she was why was he waiting pull the trigger pull the trigger he screamed at himself he had done it a million times in imagination all those images of the gun go go he couldnt it was real this time it was not some insane inexplicable daydream oozing from the nether pits of his mind had the gun thing ever had anything to do with real weapons she stepped over a dead seiner moyshe how can you say that not you youd be repatriated repatriated to hell maybe her lie was a kilometer tall after the broken wings and von drachaus raid she was going to have his guts on her breakfast toast if he did not do something she crossed his aim repeatedly but he just could not end it it had seemed so easy when he had been angry it was easy for mouse wasnt it sweat beaded on his forehead as he tried to force his trigger his aim fell the movement gave him away her smile gave way to clashingsabers laughter her weapon leapt into her hand her hand rose he reacted her shot reddened metal where he had crouched but he was moving across an open space his finger was frozen no more though he fired wild scoring a section of console he dove into the shelter of a huge machine disinterested it went on grumbling to itself like a lot of people it would do nothing till it was hurt and then it would just sit there and scream her shouts mocked him he did not catch her words but they did not matter she was taunting him trying to get him to give himself away again beams licked here and there probing his cover making metal run like tongues of candlewax he was scared he had swum too deep this time he had taken the dive he had feared since his assignment to beckhart in an instant of insane gallows humor he told himself that death would certainly end his psychological woes but both he and the woman were too confident of his inability his uncertainty his lack of commitment something within him cracked something hatched from an egg of darkness lying in his deeps he suddenly knew that there was something he could believe in something worth fighting for it had been trying to break through from the beginning he grinned then laughed at the ludicrous irony of life his grail he had found it here on the marches of hell as he was about to die this ship these seiner people in marveling stupidity he stepped into the open the woman was so startled she hesitated he did not he shot first his hand was steady his aim flawless just as they had taught him the madness of the moment faded he felt as empty as he had on the day he had entered the blake city spaceport had he found anything after all or had his gunneed just thrown up a lightshow of justification he was standing over her when kindervoorts people arrived he did not know how long he had been there the battle had died away while he waited and he had reversed all the switches she had thrown though he did not remember doing so operations was getting its desperately needed oxygen he was crying when they found him he had wondered about that for a long time mouse sometimes shed tears afterward as if the new corpse were that of a favorite brother he supposed mouse spent his stored emotion then while it was safe while no one could grab a handle on his soul someone pried the torch from his bent rod fingers moyshe amy asked are you all right he seized her held her she was a warm fire in a cold dark and lonely cavern she let him cling for a second then pulled away retaining a grip on his arm she seemed a little distant a little frightened and who wouldnt be after what he had done come on youve got to talk to jarl he nodded yes kindervoort would want to know all about it old doctor deathshead would poke and prod and try to pry open the lid of his soul even on a battle day kindervoort would want to keep an eye on the blood of his ship that was all people were to danion the harvestship was the real living thing here the folks inside were just specialized cells he let amy lead him away but looked back at marya as he went they were taking pictures and nattering into recorders medics were piling bodies onto stretchers techs were weeping over the damaged console and impatiently trying to cajole readouts on atmospheric quality but he had eyes only for marya marya she was dead now he could ease up and let her be more than just the sangaree woman he did not know why or how but he must have loved her in some odd psychotic way or maybe he was in love with the death she had symbolized but now that she was lying there sprawled inelegantly brokenly he felt a little freer and a little sadder kindervoorts office was hectic people came and went hastily crowding its outer reaches the chaos was probably typical of every office aboard moyshe thought there would be plenty of work for everyone kindervoort pushed through the crowd moyshe amy come on in the office he broke trail settling behind his desk he said thank god for this lull i was insuit for eleven hours the damned things drive me crazy give me claustrophobia you all right now moyshe you look a little pale benrabi sat with his elbows on his knees staring into infinity he shrugged for a long time you had me worried moyshe kindervoort said you seemed so solitary so introspective so ineffectual not exactly up to advance billing i dont know what i expected beckharts top man to be but you werent it not till today then you acted when you had to intuitively quickly correctly efficiently the way i was told to expect and in character all on your own except maybe you told mouse kindervoort had steepled his fingers in front of his mouth he seemed to be thinking out loud now tell me what happened an unedited version moyshe started talking it helped he began at the beginning and told the whole story presuming jarl had enough details to catch any major deletions he tried to be objective kindervoort nodded occasionally doodled once made a call for corroboration he asked moyshe to go over several things twice it was a brief and gentle holiday compared to a bureau debriefing he had amy call to make sure mouse was getting medical attention benrabi left out nothing but the hiding of the weapons when he concluded kindervoort asked did today change anything for you you ready to cross over now moyshe considered it hard he wanted to be part of what he had found here but he could not not on kindervoorts terms no jarl i cant amy was disappointed he expected her to be the signs were unmistakable she had plans bells and white satin a regular archaicist extravaganza whyd you go after gonzalez then we wouldve gotten her eventually maybe too late to have saved ops though he conceded benrabi could not bring himself to answer truthfully landsmen did not avenge friends they had no friends to avenge and he did not want them to know that a prime rule of the bureau was that you let no blow against one of its people slide thats why it meant my neck too briefly he sketched what had happened on the broken wings i wish youd done it for us if you change your mind i really want you on my team moyshe not on your terms kindervoort looked perplexed he started to say something but was interrupted by a comm buzzer he pressed a button said kindervoort security he stared at moyshe frowning leclare contact a tiny voice said you got a landsman named lets see benrabi moyshe benrabi down there right hes here with me now good been trying to track him down all over he the one with the headaches the same has he been warner tested do you know no hes landside but hes a marginal id guess a strong full looks to me like repeated and intense spontaneous contact reaction moyshe began to feel like a sample on a microscope slide good im sending a man to pick him up priority alpha the old mans okay the paperwork will come down later off off kindervoort said puzzled he leaned back studied moyshe speculatively finally said well things change desperate times i guess i just hope they know what theyre doing moyshe when youre finished in contact i want you to get plenty of rest amy see that he does then report back here moyshe looked from one to the other both seemed shaken disturbed what the hell was going on that comm exchange made no sense at all but it had gotten these two as antsy as a cat in heat what was a warner test why were his migraines so important he studied amy his thoughts drifted back to the attack he had suffered after being switched on she had become as nervous then he had tried a dozen times to discover why she thought his migraines important she would not tell him they were important to him heaven knew they had become one of the central features of his life he had had scores since coming aboard so many that he had become conditioned to recognize the slightest warning symptom he gulped his medication instantly for a while though he had not been bothered much till danion had come here he had been eating the pills like candy the past few days at regular intervals not waiting for symptoms to begin what did it mean well jarl said ive got a ton of work have to sort things out count the bodies inform the next of kin amy turn him over to contact then get some sleep this break probably wont last she took benrabis hand guided him to the door why was she so quiet because of marya as he was about to close the door behind him kindervoort called moyshe thanks seventeen ad operation dragon mindteching the man who came for moyshe when he arrived meteorically on a fast orange scooter wore a jumper of a style moyshe had never before seen it was black trimmed with silver instead of being the offwhite of the technical groups it was an operations group uniform the man looked and smelled as if he had not changed for a week trying to find a man name of he checked a card benrabi moyshe benrabi what land of name is that a literary allusion amy replied thiss him here right teddy larkin contact support whore you he was brusque and tired he appeared to be on the verge of collapse moyshe felt sympathetic he was on his last legs himself amaranthina amaryllis isolte galadriel de coleridge y gutierez security she snapped oh all right lets go benrabi he headed for his scooter moyshe did not move he was fighting his temper larkins rudeness might be excused intellectually because he was tired but emotionally moyshe could not let it slide he had the feeling that larkin was this way all the time larkin reached his vehicle noticed that moyshe was not tagging along dutifully come on grub get your ass benrabi was there and teddy was yon seated on hard steel deck plating wondering what had hit him there was no forgiving his remark grub was the seiners ultimate epithet for landsmen benrabi moved in he was ready to bounce larkin all over the passageway amys touch stopped him go gentle you ape she snarled at larkin or yours will be the second big mouth hes shut today larkin took it as a wisecrack started toward moyshe benrabi bounced him off the bulkhead and floor a couple of times i meant what i said amy told larkin her badge was showing now literally how was your air supply this afternoon eh larkins eyes widened his face grew pale yeah you see what i mean amy told him moyshe slowly relaxed have the covers turned down when i get home love he said blowing a kiss he did it to irritate larkin would you want your sister to marry one im going to sleep for a week he settled himself on the scooters passenger seat ready when you are teddy he had to hang on for his life the scooter seemed designed for racing its driver was a madman who did not know how to let up on the gopedal whats the hurry i get to get me some sleep when i deliver you a big airtight door closed behind them the instant they entered operations sector sealed in moyshe thought an instant of panic flashed by nervous he studied his surroundings ops seemed quieter more remote less frenzied than his home sector it looked less touched by battle there was no confusion people seemed more aloof more calm less harried he supposed they had to be they had to think danion past defeat the fighting may have stopped but it was not finished larkin braked to a frightening squealing stop that almost threw moyshe off the scooter larkin led him into a large room filled with complex electronics contact larkin muttered by way of explanation the battle had reached this place acrid smoke hung thick here it still curled up from one instrument bank ozone underlay the stench casualties awaiting ambulances rested along one wall there were at least a dozen stretchers there but the hull had remained sound there were no suits in evidence larkin led moyshe to the oldest man he had yet seen aboard danion benrabi he said and instantly disappeared moyshe examined his surroundings while waiting for the old man to acknowledge his presence the vast room looked like a crossbreed of ships bridge and lighter passenger compartment the walls were banked with data processing equipment consoles and screens whose displays he could not fathom seiners in black seated shoulder to shoulder manipulated observed and muttered into tiny mikes the wide floor of the room was occupied by cornrows of couches on which more seiners lay their heads enveloped in huge plastic helmets which twinkled with little telltale lights beside each couch stood a motionless pair of seiners one studied the helmet lights the other a small blockish machine which looked uncomfortably like a diagnostic computer a constant pavanne of repairmen moved among the couches apparently examining the empties for defects benrabi finally spied something familiar it was a spatial display globe that lurked blackly in a far corner centered in it were ten golden footballs apparently representing harvestships he supposed the quick darting golden needles represented service ships they were maneuvering against scarlet things which vaguely resembled terran sharks the tiny golden dragons at the far periphery then should represent distant starfish stars end would be the deeper darkness biting a chunk from the displays side he saw nothing that could be interpreted as sangaree he hoped they would stay gone though it was not their style and he did not expect it mr benrabi the old man said why dragons image from our minds youll see i dont understand instead of responding the old man plunged into a prepared speech nobody explained this to you did they well our drives are dead except for minddrive the sharks cant kill that till they get to us here or till we stop getting power from the fish but were in trouble mr benrabi we do have minddrive but the sharks mindburned most of my techs he indicated the nearest stretcher a girl barely out of creche smiled in vacant madness ive lost so many im out of standbys im drafting marginal sensitives from the crew youre subject to migraine arent you moyshe nodded confused here they came with the headaches again he had suspected for several months now but the implications were too staggering he did not want to believe the psi business had been discredited maybe if he remembered that hard enough this man and place would go away we want you to go into rapport with a fish no panic smote him he did not entirely understand his response a niggling little demon named loyalty to whom he seldom listened urged him to surrender for the sake of information beckhart would reward him with a shovel full of medals he thought of sudden terrible headaches and of frightening haunting dreams he recalled his fear that he had made involuntary contact with the starfish i couldnt why not i dont know how you dont need to the techs will put you in the fish will do all the work all you do is serve as a channel but im tired ive been up for tell me a story so has everybody else he gestured impatiently a couple of technicians hovering nearby approached clara put mr benrabi in number fortythree both techs nodded theres nothing to be afraid of mr benrabi moyshe wanted to protest being pushed around but lacked the will the technicians pressed him into a couch he surrendered undoubtedly he had been through worse the technician whom the old man had called clara reminded him of the professional mother of his childhood she was greyhaired cherryfaced and chattered soothingly while strapping his arms to those of the couch she placed his fingers on gripswitches before she started on his legs her partner was a darkhaired quiet youth who efficiently prepared moyshes head for the helmet he began by rubbing moyshes scalp with an unscented paste then he covered benrabis short hair with a thing like a fine wire hairnet moyshes skin protested a thousand little tingles that quickly faded im taking this too passively he thought why are you strapping me down he demanded so you cant hurt yourself what take it easy theres nothing to be afraid of its just a precaution the woman replied she smiled gently damn he thought better be two shovels full of medals lift your head please the younger seiner said moyshe did the helmet devoured his head he was blind his fear redoubled a green ogre with dirty claws shoved nasty hands into his guts grabbed yanked his heart began playing a theme for battle drums words came echoing through his mind czyzewskis from his poem the old god who sang the darkful deep and dragons in the sky had czyzewski had starfish in mind moyshe felt his body growing wet with fearsweat maybe the contact wouldnt work maybe his mind wouldnt be invaded that had to be the root of his terror he did not want anything looking inside his head where the madness lay behind the most fragile of barriers it had taken him all year to get it under control guns dragons headaches improbable obsessive memories of alyce continuous instability he did not dare go under his balance was too delicate guns did the image of the gun have anything to do with the stars end weaponry was it some twisted symbol his mind had created for a part of the mission that psych had not wanted him to remember somewhere a voice were ready mr benrabi the old woman it was an ancient trick for calming a man it worked a little please depress your right side switch one click he did he lost all sensation he floated he saw smelled felt nothing he was alone with his tortured mind thats not bad is it she used the voice of the professional mother this time his cunning frightened mind made it that of the woman of his youth he remembered how she had comforted him when he had been afraid when youre ready depress your right switch another click then release it to withdraw you have to pull up on your left switch his hand seemed to act on its own down went the switch the dreams he had been having returned space swimming the galaxy wrong in color stars end strangely misty yet bright things moved around him he remembered the situation tank this was like being bodiless at the heart of the display the service ships were glimmering needles the harvestships glowing tangles of wire the sharks were reddish torpedoes in the direction of the galaxy far away the starfish looked like golden chinese dragons they were drifting toward him moyshes fear faded as though a hand had erased it from the blackboard of his mind only an allencompassing wonder remained gently warm friendly as a loving mother a voice trickled into his mind i do it starfish chub there was a windchimes tinkle of something like laughter watch i show me a small dragon rose from the approaching herd did a ponderous forward roll shortly oh my old ones dont like dangerous this no time for fun but we winning new manfriend sharks afraid confused too many manship running now some many destroyed big feast for scavenger things the creatures joy was infectious and moyshe supposed he had cause if the sharks were indeed abandoning herd and harvestfleet funny his conscious mind was not questioning just accepting his fear remained down deep but the night creature held it at bay infecting him with its own excitement when did the power thing start he wondered it had already the starfish told him he did not feel anything other than this creature chub exploring the ways of his mind like a kid on holiday exploring a resort hotel shark battle won mind battle won the starfish said after a while when moyshe finally had himself under control but another fight coming moyshe manfriend bad one maybe what and he realized for the first time that he really was talking with his mind shipsthatkill evil ones return sangaree how do you know no way to show tell is they come hyper now your people prepare benrabi did not want to be out here during combat he felt exposed easy prey panic began to well up the starfishs control did not slacken he soon forgot the danger became engrossed in the wonders around him the rippling movements of retreating sharks the ponderous approach of dragons the maneuvers of the shimmering service ships as their weary crews prepared for another battle the galaxy hung over everything like a ragged tear in the night vast in its extension how much more magnificent would it be if it could be seen without the interference of the dust that obscured the packed suns at its core nearby stars end waited a quiet but furious god of war as yet unconcerned with the goingson around it moyshe hoped no one aroused its wrath coming now his dragon told him spots appeared against the galaxy as sangaree raidships dropped hyper down in his backbrain behind his ears moyshe felt a gentle tickle more power chub told him the raidships radiated from their drop zone in lines like the tentacles of a squid they soon formed a bowl with its open side facing the harvestfleet it was an obvious preliminary to englobement the distant decimated shark packs milled uncertainly they withdrew a little farther they were not yet wholly defeated a ball of light flared among the sangaree a lucky mine had scored but it made little difference the power and numbers remained theirs only a handful of service ships remained combatworthy even the halest of the harvestships had lost some main power and drive capacity to shark attack minddrive and auxiliary power were insufficient for highstress combat maneuvering benrabi sensed something changing he cast about finally saw the great silver sails that had been taken in before the earlier fighting spreading between danions arms and spars the ship looked so ragged so injured so vulnerable a blizzard of debris drifted about her held by her minuscule natural gravity the sangaree maneuvered closer but held off attacking trying to talk first manfriend into surrender chub to benrabi creatures of shipsthatkill want herd without fight payne wont give up he thought back is true moyshe manfriend the starfish drifted closer they were almost upon the sangaree they meant to join the battle this time though cautiously their enemies still watched from afar looking for another chance to savage fleet and herd fight soon moyshe manfriend the slow stately dance of enmity ended the negotiations had broken down the sangaree struck fast and hard firing on the service ships to show their determination the service ships dodged suddenly there were missiles everywhere streaking around like hurrying wasps beam fire from the harvestships wove gorgeous patterns of death and moyshe became depressed he had done his navy fleet time he could see the untippable balance written in the patterns there was no hope of victory chub chuckled into his consciousness you see only part of pattern moyshe manfriend in the far distance a starfish crept close to a raidship the vessels weapons could destroy the dragon in an instant but the ship stopped attacking it simply drifted a lifeless machine we do mind thing moyshe heard like stars end with much power we stop shipsthatkill like human eyeblink so fast if no guns no drive field to fear a second raidship fell silent then a third and a fourth moyshe felt less pessimistic the raidships would be locked into an overcommand directed by a master computer aboard the raidmasters vessel that master computer would be burning up its superconductors trying to adjust fire fields to accommodate the losses if it became the least hesitant the least unsure of its options a toocautious starfish burped a ball of gutfire the microsun rolled through space sedately devoured another raidship bad moyshe manfriend old ones angry will give away unsuspected attack the sangaree hemisphere closed steadily its diameter rapidly dwindled the harvestships threw everything they had fire heavier than anything benrabi had ever witnessed yet were barely able to neutralize the incoming offensive capacity seemed to have been lost the starfish mindburned another raidship and proved chub and the old ones right the fireball had given them away moyshe felt the deep sadness of his dragon as one of the herd perished beneath sangaree guns the starfish threw a barrage of fireballs before beating a hasty retreat sangaree missiles broke up most of them the globe closed around the harvestfleet it tightened like a squeezing fist a desperate ships commander piloting a threequarters dead service ship knocked a small hole in the globe by ramming a raidship and blowing his drives theyll know they were in a fight moyshe thought there was no response from chub the sangaree stepped up the attack their ships began piling up toward stars end moyshe suddenly intuited their strategy theyre going to push us into the sharks again there was no response from his dragon unless it were that windchime tinkle he caught on the extreme edge of his sensitivity the sangaree seemed to have managed some equipment adjustments during their absence they appeared to have no trouble detecting the sharks now and since detecting the starfish attack they were having no trouble keeping the dragons at bay chub returned to his mind suddenly it works well moyshe manfriend be patient will have little time to chat is hard to think thoughts in commanders of shipsthatkill and in machinesthatthink sangaree minds twisted different than manminds the dragon faded away what was this he asked himself were the fish trying to control the sangaree the raidships massed thickly then pushed hard the sharks grew agitated as if dimly aware that they were about to be drawn into the inferno the starfish began drifting their way as if to cover the fleets retreat be ready moyshe manfriend it was a sudden bellow and all the warning he received the trickle in the root of his brain suddenly became a flaming torrent it hurt god did it hurt searing the power boiled through him into whatever danion used to control and convert it and out to the silvery sails moyshe followed the flow for an instant then became lost in an ocean of pain the harvestship began moving toward the massed raidships all weapons firing not aiming simply trying to erect an irresistible wall of destruction the compacted sangaree were unable to bring all their firepower to bear they wavered wavered a raidship blew up it left a momentary hole in the fire pattern another vessel began to come apart service ships were doing the same one harvestship ceased firing her auxiliary power was exhausted sangaree missiles began picking her apart benrabi felt that infinite sadness again the enemy drifted backward not really retreating just being pushed inexorably it could not last but the harvestfleets ferocity for the moment was greater than the raidfleets afar the starfish suddenly struck at the sharks who scattered in dismay the strike was pure bluff on the dragons part a determined shark attack would have destroyed the herd in minutes something screamed across benrabis mind a mad voice babbling shrieking fear and incoherencies its power was such that it inundated his pain he made no sense of the mindtouch other than warning and terror phantoms grotesqueries from the most insane medieval imagination gathered in space around him things that might have been gargoyles and gorgons boschian nightmares writhing all fangs and talons and fire became more real than the battleships every one of them shrieked the message go away or die ive gone completely insane he thought my mind has snapped under contact pressure they cant be real he screamed then the warm feeling came soothing gently calming his terror pushing the madness away his dragon told him we succeed moyshe manfriend maybe win then darkly monsters are stars end sending fear and visions are stars end mindthing planet machine is mad mad machine uses madness weapons soon other weapons look moyshe manfriend shielded by chubs touch moyshe turned his attention to a stars end grown huge with their approach the sangaree were silhouetted against the glowing planetary disk the face of the world had become diseased behind them it was spotted blackly in a hundred thousand places the disk was receding the harvestfleet was on the run scattering as fast as it could moyshe suspected that had any been able the harvestships would have gone hyper that could not be accomplished on minddrive the sangaree could not jump out while locked into their master battlecomputer breaking lock and getting up influence took time two thousand kilometers closer to the fortress worlds weapons they were trying with the desperation of the condemned they were breaking lock scattering throwing out defensive missiles trying to get up influence they did not have time the mad worlds weapons reached them first close mind chub shrieked get out not need power now save mind how he couldnt remember it became another nightmare of the sort where all efforts to elude pursuit were vain feeling returned to his left hand another hand rested upon it pulling upward the reality of the contact room returned he could feel his helmet the couch beneath him and a tremendous sense of loss he missed his dragon already and in missing chub he understood starfishers a little better maybe the contact was one reason they stayed so far from the worlds of men the fishfisher thing was a unique experiential frontier perhaps only one in a thousand fishers would ever experience contact but that one could share the vision with his blind brethren he had suffered a range of emotions out there only one thing had been missing while chub was in his mind the ordinary everyday insecurity which so shaped human life he was drowning in his own sweat and he was shivering cold as if his body temperature had dropped while he was linked the room surrounding him was silent where were his technicians was he alone no someone had helped him get out the thoughts reflections fears flashed by in scant seconds then his head exploded in a thundering migraine the most sudden and terrible of his experience it obliterated all conscious control and thought he screamed he fought the straps that held him the helmet that stole his vision he became pure trapped animal danion shuddered staggered staggered vaguely through the agony he heard screams loose objects rattled around gravity surged and faded mind monsters momentarily broke through the pain taunting him with visions of hell the stars end weapons had found the sangaree the fringes of their fury had brushed the harvestfleet like the cold breeze of the passing wings of death and he was pinned here helpless in agony slowly slowly the breeze faded the screams died with it all but his own excited chatter surrounded him he could distinguish no words his head was tearing itself apart once when he was a kid it had been almost this bad he had nearly killed himself smashing his head against a wall someone finally noticed him his helmet came off a needle stung his arm the pain began fading the room was nearly dark so weak were the lights gravity had been reduced to half normal danion was rationing power the faces crossing his field of vision seemed unconcerned with danions condition they were exuberant there was laughter little jokes flew weve won motherly clara told him stars end killed them not all moyshe thought though he said nothing one or two had made hyper in time the seiners had just moved up the sangaree vendetta list perhaps surpassing jupp von drachau but we lost four harvestships the younger half of his tech team told him four harvestships he was having a hard time believing that it was a victory day all right but one which left the seiners little to celebrate blessed darkness enfolded moyshe he fell into the blissful sleep of the needle a sleep untroubled by fearful dreams eighteen ad operation dragon the change he ignored the shouldershaking as long as he could finally sleepslurred he muttered whadya wan get up moyshe time to go to work theres a million things to do so amy he thought altogether too businesslike for a girl who thought she should be a wife he opened an eye checked the time five hours what the hell kind of rest is that he grumbled how the hell did i get here i was in contact its been eleven hours the clocks unplugged to save power they brought you down on a stretcher i thought youd been mindburned she threw herself on top of him clinging with desperation moyshe i was so scared all right all right i survived he grumbled he still was not accustomed to the seiner habit of showing emotion she reached under the sheet tickled him come on grump therere things to do he threw his arms around her and rolled her over his mouth seeking hers moyshe he smothered her protest with a kiss its been a week lady i know but but me no buts woman the humpbacked crocodiles of entropy are gnawing at the underbellies of our allotted spans im not going to waste an opportunity on tinkering with a piece of pipe moyshe what kind of talk is that shut up yes boss they dressed hurriedly afterward amy decided on a fresh coverall now whats the hurry moyshe demanded youve got to get back to work moyshe we really are desperate this time were in a decaying orbit around stars end the mindsails went in the spillover from whatever killed the sangaree well hit the boundary in two days unless we get the drives working boundary limit of approach stars end starts shooting if a ship passes it i wondered why were alive only the sangaree violated it the machine is very literal anyway were due on shift in three hours and jarl needs you to take some tests first cant they wait he said today might as well im awake now wheres mouse hospital block hes doing okay hospital block was fifteen kilometers away maybe more if there were detours moyshe knew he had to move fast well go there first why to see mouse but the tests damn the tests i want to see mouse you coming not anymore hey wait they ran to a scooter laughingly fought for the controls moyshe made a point of winning he did not trust her to take him where he wanted to go he whipped down the passageway scattering cursing pedestrians the wind in his face exhilarated him till he remembered what had happened memories of what he had done kept him quiet till he reached the hospital block bluff and bluster got him past nurses who believed they were running a monastery they wandered the ward where mouse was supposed to be confined unable to find him feminine laughter suddenly rippled through the passageway what do you think moyshe asked wouldnt bet against it amy replied her good cheer had not faded moyshe followed the laughter to a small private room where he found mouse making friends with his nurse benrabi began to wonder why he had come it did not look as if mouse needed him then he understood he had not come for any good businesslike reason he just wanted to see how mouse was and that was silly landsmen did not behave that way mouse was fine needless to say whatre you doing in here moyshe asked embarrassed because he was interrupting theres work to do mouse grinned winked moyshe everybody gets a vacation besides i had to meet vickie here darling say hello to my friend moyshe hello to my friend moyshe isnt she something been trying to find out if those long lean legs are as fine as they promise to be those work outfits just dont do a thing for a woman how are you mouse benrabi asked like the man said before they closed the coffin as well as can be expected under the circumstances he whipped his top sheet back his arm and shoulder were heavily bandaged and in a partial cast theyll have me back on light duty in a couple of days unless i can blow in that dainty ear there and get somebody to keep me here vickie giggled well good i just wanted to check sorry i interrupted behave dont i always mouse chuckled hey moyshe go by my cabin and make sure nobodys run off with the silverware all right see you in a couple days yeah benrabi withdrew amy on his heels damn he told her i feel silly what why he shook his head he could not explain not to her a seiner would never understand what he meant when he said he and mouse had passed a point of no return and become genuine friends amy did not have the background to comprehend what that could mean to a landsman she was worried thinking about what jarl is going to say when we show up late he asked uhm she remained thoughtful as they stalked the sterile white corridors whatre the tests for i dont know just some tests he caught a whiff of untruth he was not supposed to learn their purpose he always hated that kind of test though people were always taking them back home iq emotional stability prejudicial index social responsiveness survival index environmental response flexibility adaptability the governments euphemistically labeled random sample report bureau agents suffered bombardment with them during briefing and debriefing they even had a test to test ones resistance to testing his was strong he did not like having people look inside him he did too damned much of that himself wouldnt be the famous warner test would it she did not respond he tried a couple of different tacks could not get a rise out of her so gave up they had to make a detour returning to the scooter their planned path was blocked with casualties just in from one of the dead harvestships its bad moyshe amy said looking down that long hallway of stretchers theyve been bringing people in since the shooting stopped they may never get them all out of the wrecks theyre falling in toward stars end too where are they going to put them well end up having to sleep standing up well find something reminds me of my senior year midshipman cruise he said there were war scares that summer too the shadowline war and the sangaree and somebody had found a mcgraw world the fleet was tied up academy contracted our shipboard astrogation training to private carriers memories that had been the summer he had ended it with alyce tell me about it eh why because i dont know anything about you you never talk about yourself i want to know who you are well i got the worst billet on the list some people didnt like me it was a raggedyass freehauler on the rim run from tregorgarth to the big rock candy mountain to blackworld then carsons sierra and the broken wings broomstick all the way with crazy passengers the freehaulers carry some real weirdos between the broken wings and carsons coming back we got jumped by mcgraws my first taste of action after he had been silent a few seconds she asked what happened it was a complete surprise mcgraws dont usually bother freehaulers but navy was pushing them hard and we were carrying weapons for gneaus storm why was he telling her this it was none of her business still talking kept his mind off the upcoming tests go on moyshe he did not doubt that details of the incident were in kindervoorts files tinkers dam that was the ship had a cranky drive just a hair out of synch the freehaulers couldnt afford to tune it till after the run so the mcgraws couldnt phase in and pull us into normspace they tried putting a warning shot across our nose the drive did one of its tricks phased in with theirs and dragged us both into the explosion the mcgraw was destroyed tinkers dam was hurt pretty bad but we kept one section airtight i was trapped there with this crazy family from some first expansion world they hated everybody and old earthers and aliens especially and it was up to me and a ulantonid radioman to find out where we were and call for help took three weeks to rig a transmitter and three more months before anybody caught our signal it was miserable there i was nineteen years old scared to death and all that on me hey where are we chagrined amy replied i was listening i guess we took a wrong turn well have to go back back they went till she found a passage that would take them in the right direction it led through a womens intensivecare ward the casualties were out where the harried nurses could examine them at a glance there were at least three hundred women crammed into a ward meant for fifty its really bad isnt it theyre moving the walking wounded into the residential blocks moyshe stopped suddenly stricken the face of the final patient confined to a burn tank was one he had not expected to see again marya she was alive and inside her tank amid the jungle of tubes she was aware she met his gaze tried to communicate her hatred her iv monitor fed her a little nembutol moyshe whats the matter he pointed you didnt know no i thought she was dead she would have died if we hadnt gotten her here so quick but you used the torch from too far away i see she dropped the subject realizing he wanted done with it he should have realized that marya would not go easily did she have a partner the answer was critical his life might depend on it and if he survived here marya would come after him landside he was winning the battles but the war remained in doubt he did not look forward to their next encounter whats the rush suddenly amy asked he was almost running kindervoort was not pleased with his being late but he shuffled moyshe into a testing room without remonstrance thiss benrabi psych types took over moyshe suffered through the old parade of idiot questions since childhood he had been trying to beat them with random answers which was why his test sessions always lasted so long the computers needed a big sample to pin him down when the psychs were done they turned him over to regular medical types who gave him a thorough physical they were in love with his head he told the life story of his migraine three times and endured dozens of shallow and area skull scans they also wanted to know all about his instel implant he developed a sudden muteness bureau activities were beyond discussion just when he was about to scream they turned him loose the chief examiner apologized profusely for taking so long there was not a hint of sincerity in his tone both he and moyshe knew the time factor was moyshes fault moyshe was told to get a good nights rest before going back to work he hoped they had not learned anything but suspected that they had profile tests were hard to beat time slipped away quickly almost as swiftly as it did in the mad hectic culture groundside moyshe returned to damage control his working hours were gruesome somehow they got the drives functioning and pushed danion into a stable orbit then the real work began everyone not engaged in rescue work or in keeping the ship alive began preparing her for a hyper fly to the yards moyshes work was less demanding than he expected danion had suffered more damage to personnel than to plant had been hurt more by shark attack than by sangaree fire he heard rumors claiming half the harvestships people had perished or had been made as good as dead by mindburn his acquaintances had been lucky he knew no one who had been a victim but every day in the course of work he encountered new faces and missed a lot of old ones every time he wakened moyshe was amazed to find himself still alive the battle of stars end was over and won but winning had left the harvestfleet on the brink of disaster new problems arose as fast as old ones were conquered and the sharks had not given up they stalked the fleet and herd still their numbers growing daily in a week or a month they would strike again the fleet was in a race against time it had to make the yards before the sharks reached critical time fled swiftly when sudden death lurked behind the veil of time and every day passing brought moyshe closer to an hour he dreaded the moment when he would have to return to carsons and his old life he did not want to leave the i want had not sipped at the blood of his soul since the battle nor had he had visions of imaginary guns he seemed to have undergone a spontaneous remission of his mental diseases in that way the weeks were close to tranquil his problems became more direct and personal he had found what he needed a combination of things to do with belonging a woman a useful occupation and a place in a society that considered him something more than a bundle of statistics to be manipulated he could not yet quite understand what had happened or why but he knew he belonged here even if he was not yet wholly accepted this was what he had been seeking when he had abandoned old earth navy had given him some of it but not enough this was the real thing he had come home but how could he stay there were prior demands on his loyalties he simply could not accept kindervoorts terms he could not betray the bureau should he see jarl and try to arrange something he vacillated he swung this way and that he decided and changed his mind a hundred times a day what about mouse what would he think what would he do and say and all the while like a recording mechanism he kept making his notes for the bureau sometimes he worried about getting them off the ship but that did not much matter writing them down fixed them in his backbrain from which the psychs could dredge them with narcohypnosis assuming he went home assuming he wanted them recovered he had not wanted this mission back when and wanted it even less now by carrying it out he might destroy something that had become dear he was in a proper mood for concluding jerusalem and he had found just the quote for summation the world was all revenge and thou hadst said it is a seething sea earth had no room for walking air was ambushed by the spears the stars began to fray and time and earth washed hands in mischief firdausi all jerusalems characters had perished while trying to seize their hearts desires farewell old companions he thought so much for that it had been a pretentious trial of modern literature anyway he did not like the thing anymore only his suicidal mood had let him finish quickly rather than with the intimate detail he had planned originally sometimes he felt so like his own creations denied anything but a deadly end ten days remained on his contract when he received the second summons from contact jarl kindervoort relayed it personally id really rather not do any more mindteching jarl he said im not trained for it and im perfectly happy where im at id rather you didnt myself kindervoort seemed caught in a baffled daze you know too goddamned much already but orders are orders and these came from the top a chill breeze swept moyshes cabin he knew too much would they let him go if they did kindervoort was capable of arranging a deepspace accident that would silence the returning landsmen would jarls superiors authorize an incident starfishers were feisty but did not go out of their way to provoke confederation whats going on jarl i dont know and i dont like it theyve shut me out they want you reassigned to contact thats all i know im just a messenger boy grab yourself a scooter and go heres your pass but i dont want to youre still under contract you agreed to perform whatever duties were assigned damn all right right now right now moyshe reached contact a half hour later he found the same old man in charge youll be working with hans and clara again mr benrabi strictly basic contact exercises i dont know which fish your rapport will be they decide that for themselves why am i here theres no point in this im leaving the end of next week the man acted deaf youll probably link with several fish during the coming week they like to get different perspectives on a mind before they decide on a permanent partner hans clara mr benrabi is here go ahead with the basic program now wait a goddamned minute the old man walked away pursuing a blackuniformed electrician whose repair work did not please him good morning moyshe clara said good to have you back how have you been and the youth hans said well be your regular support team theyve given us number fiftyone who the hell does that guy think he is when i speak to somebody i expect them to answer take it easy hans suggested he does that to everybody youll get used to him hes a dreadful boss clara said just dreadful but we wont have him much longer theyre booting him upstairs why dont you show moyshe our station hans ill get us all some coffee what do you think is going on benrabi asked hans he sat on the end of the contact couch ive got no business being here hans shrugged i havent the faintest they just told us youd be our new mindtech that we should start breaking you in clara thought youd decided to stay didnt you whats that clara asked say that mr benrabi decided to stay with danion yes hasnt he she handed moyshe a cup of coffee black thats fine no im not staying i dont understand she seemed confused neither do i i tried to tell them somebody screwed up nobody would listen you know how things go when their minds are made up id better check clara said theres no point going ahead if its all a mixup do that she returned fifteen minutes later looking more puzzled than ever they said go ahead dammit why i dont know moyshe thats what they told me it just doesnt make sense thought you were a soldier hans said thought you were used to taking orders you didnt understand i knew they made sense to the man who gave them hans smiled made sense to the man who gave them he barely heard clara when she said wed better get started were behind schedule so beckhartism existed here too he must have that look of the born pawn try as he might he could see no way the seiners could profit from training him as a mindtech not if he was going back ready moyshe same drill as the other day it shouldnt bother you this time we wont be drawing power just go out and float try to open to the fish and get the feel hans slipped the helmet over benrabis head claras voice came through warm and gentle remember one click down on the right for tsd moyshe two for contact up on the left to come back go when youre ready he pushed the righthand switch without knowing why the womblike comfort of total sensory deprivation enveloped him he let it take him carrying off the aches and fears of reality he ran through a mantra several times trying to take his mind into the same nirvana his flesh occupied this was nice a man could lower his guard here could relax his vigil against the universe nothing could reach him wrong his hindbrain the ancient brain that had crawled out of the sea of old earth a billion years ago could not tolerate an extended absence of stimuli it became claustrophobic youre staying in tsd too long moyshe clara said from a thousand kilometers away thats not good for your mind he depressed the switch again weirdly distorted and colored space formed around him he was falling toward a milky scar some cruel god had scratched on the face of darkness logic told him it was the galaxy that it looked both solid and fuzzy because his brain was trying to translate something seen in hyper into conventionalized images what was he seeing tachyon scatter gravitation the frenzied dance of the gluons that cement all matter the scar was most intense toward the galactic core which would have been concealed by dust clouds in norm space long pink streaks like the fire of ruby lasers winked past him arrowing to a point of convergence centered on the heart of the galaxy a barrage of golden tracers skipped along inside the circle of pink lines sharks and starfish skipping along with the harvestfleet he extended his attention till he detected several eggshapes of st elmos fire with cometary tails that had to be harvestships in hyper transit he searched but could find no trace of stars end the fortress world had been left behind the seiner gamble had failed that episode had ended paynes fleet was running for the yards hello moyshe manfriend benrabi felt a rush of elation as he recognized chub it became a feeling of im home this is where i belong you came back moyshe manfriend yes i didnt think i would you survived the battle im glad the starfishs mental fingers slithered into his mind bringing comfort he did not resist a feel of laughter accompanied me too moyshe manfriend you came to learn to be linker i guess good i teach me starfish chub best teacher ever make you best linker of all time show old ones we begin you study universe around try to see tell me what you see moyshe did as he was told no no see everything at once forget eyes forget senses of flesh entire let universe soak in be one forget self forget everything just be like center of universe it was the prime lesson he had to learn and the most difficult one for the beginning mindtech he tried valiantly hour after hour but it was like forcing sleep the more effort he invested the more remote his goal became he heard a faint voice calling moyshe moyshe time to come out now he did not want to go this being outside this being free this made everything he had endured worthwhile at stars end death had been leaning over his shoulder here unthreatened he found himself closer to heaven than anything else he could imagine it was almost a religious experience like a first spacewalk eva or a first orgasm reluctantly he commanded his left hand to lift all the aches and pains of mortal flesh crept back into his consciousness and for an instant he understood those people who sought the false nirvana promised by drugs and religion something stung his arm as the helmet slid off his head just a precaution clara told him you shouldnt have much of a contact reaction but we never know for sure the agonies of the flesh receded his incipient migraine died unborn that was something he said i didnt want to come back youve got the true linker touch then hans told him they never want to go and they never want to come back eat big and get a lot of sleep clara said contact takes more out of you than you think he shared three more extended sessions with chub and they became solid friends within the limits of two such alien backgrounds his fifth training link brought him in touch with a creature calling itself a judge of the old ones the judge was nothing like chub it was completely and truly alien it entered his mind as coldly as a serpent digging exploring till he felt like a bug under a microscope it made no effort to teach him nor did it chat nor conceal its task of determining if he was fit to link with starfish moyshe was glad to break that contact realworld pains notwithstanding he went into contact with the old ones twice more and each was as chill and phlegmatic as the judge these were the passionless creatures czyzewski must have had in mind when he had penned the old god their minds were exactly what benrabi imagined a gods to be then there were two glorious rollicking fun days with chub who had been appointed his permanent link irreverent chub made the most libelous observations about the old ones moyshe had encountered benrabi countered by trying to teach the starfish the concept of humor and then it was over the dream came to an end goodbye moyshe manfriend chub said setting benrabis mind to echoing sadness i will think of you often stranger than any manfriend ill remember you too chub moyshe promised try to catch me when i reach out in my dreams he ripped upward on his exit switch clara and hans thought he was in pain and tried to give him a second pain shot but he pushed them away he let the tears flow then he hugged clara goodbye he took hanss hand im going to miss you both they stood and watched as slumpshouldered he shuffled out of contact for the last time nineteen ad the homecoming the days were gone and with them most of the hours he was down to his last few and still he had not contacted kindervoort still he had not found the courage to seize what he wanted while he had slept danion had dropped hyper preparatory to launching a service ship the starfish and sharks would be orbiting the remnants of the harvestfleet chub would be out there watching for the little steel needle that would take him away forever he lay in his bunk and remembered story time at the creche where he had lived as a small child all those tales had had heroes who had never been indecisive never been terribly afraid but they had all come from a remote and probably unreal past there was little room for the selfassured mouse types in this kaleidoscopic modern universe nowadays timidity was prosurvival he often wondered if mouse was genuinely as cool as he appeared he had to be bothered by something beside takeoffs and landings in two hours the service ship would leave for carsons what could he do what should he do he knew what he wanted knew what amy wanted but still he teetered between the new commitment and the old to betray bureau secrets for personal gain he felt would constitute a selfbetrayal it looked like he had picked up a bunch of new haunts to replace the ones he had conquered the new ones at least made more sense his remaining time dwindled to an hour his things were packed he prowled his cabin like a beast caged unable to remain still and amy sat on her bed motionless alternately sulking and subjecting him to verbal assaults he had to get out had to get away he went looking for his partner maybe mouse could help paranoia had its merits they had seen little of one another after benrabi had begun mindtech training mouse answered his door with pleased surprise first thing he said was i was just going to look for you his one hand was shaking want to play a game while were waiting all right they could help each other a game or two might relax them both hows amy taking it like a trouper a storm trooper mouse was awfully excited his shakes were not always confined to his bad hand moyshe paid no attention the usual prefly jitters he thought did you hear what i found mouse bubbled been after it for years i finally got it off one of our own people a guy who carried it for luck he displayed an ancient bronze coin with a hole in the middle benrabi judged it to be at least two thousand years old oriental in good condition but comparatively common certainly nothing special mouses excitement began to puzzle him nice i guess amys really taking it worse than i expected he glanced at the coin again because mouse kept shoving it in front of him you sure it isnt fake shell get over it they always do if youve loved them right no its not fake mouse seemed disappointed about something you take white benrabi tried to broach his problems over his almost ritualistic opening mouse i want to stay here mouse looked at him strangely as if with mixed emotions as if he had been expecting this but hoping for something else he fingered his coin nervously replied lets talk about it after the game how about a drink you look like you could stand to unwind a man about to undergo high acceleration and temporary weightlessness should not imbibe but benrabi agreed he needed something mouse went to a cabinet got a bottle of something premixed while he hunted glasses benrabi examined the cabin almost everything that was mouse was gone all the memorabilia that for a time had made the place his home everything but the ubiquitous chess set a glass broke mouse cursed gathered the pieces cursed again as he cut himself why the hell arent these things made out of plastic i wish you wouldnt use your bad hand then benrabi saw why he was with his good hand mouse was smearing something gooey over securitys bug he then brought the drinks resumed the game it was a slow one mouse was off his usual confident form he had to study every move carefully he kept fingering his coin as if he wanted to wear it out before boarding the service ship benrabi downed his drink and several more began to relax to turn off the troubled part of his mind he got involved in the game for once he was holding his own mouse despite his studiousness remained remote disturbed and inattentive mouse suddenly unleashed a series of rapid moves benrabis queen went and then checkmate the alcohol no longer helped the defeat so small a thing but so inevitable suddenly became an analog of benrabis whole life his depression deepened a moment later while fumbling the pieces into their box with his bad hand mouse said i kept this out so we could play on the way home but now you say you want to stay yes this is what ive been looking for i was afraid of that mouse turned his fumbling had not been without purpose his good hand clutched a fisher weapon salvaged from maryas cabin you shouldve figured moyshe you shouldve run to kindervoort mouse was playing the game to its end wheels within wheels you know were still working for beckhart i cant just leave you maybe he had known down deep he thought maybe he had come here so mouse could make his decision for him psych programed you to cross over so you could get where i couldnt they might even have known about stars end thats what that gun thing makes me think of moyshe glanced at the coin turning in mouses bad hand strange that he had never mentioned wanting one of that type maybe it was a hypnotic key maybe it had opened the full mission to mouses memory it was meant long term from the beginning moyshe we need ambergris for the fleet all of it for the war war what war nobody takes the ulantonid rearmament business serious you told me it was manure yourself mouse shrugged you were a remote datacollector one of my missions was to be your keeper most of the rest was windowdressing and obfuscation though it was a clubfooted effort mouse was trying to do more than just explain he did not like what he was doing he was trying to convince himself yes they had grown too close far too close they cared were friends moyshe so lets fly gentle eh yes gentle as in chess he was outskilled here he was the half of the team trained and programed for the soft work mouse always handled the hard friendship or no mouse would bend him if he did not cooperate mouse was the perfect agent he let nothing stand in the way of getting his job done benrabi searched his partners face he saw the pain there maybe he thought mouse doesnt want to go back either but mouses nature would leave him less choice it would be stupid to push him he tended to overreact under stress benrabis shoulders slumped he surrendered back to being a chip in the stream a dread voice rang through danion godlike calling all departing landsmen to departure station for payoff and checkout mouse pocketed his weapon said sorry moyshe i understand but he did not not really mouse nodded to the door lets go they went moyshe gave him no trouble even when the opportunity arose he had given up completely no home at all he thought guess ill never have one ill just go on being a chip in a universe like those sierran flood rivers im back where i started he stared at the lock that would open on the service ship one long step through and he would come out in the terminal on carsons how much would things have changed during their absence greta would have grown greta mouse i forgot to get something for greta ive been gone a whole damned year i got to bring her something mr benrabi a man pushed through the crowd some of benrabis belongings in hand you left some of your things moyshe recognized him he was one of kindervoorts people had they found his notes mike do i have time to get a souvenir for my daughter still talking about moyshes forgetfulness mike stepped between benrabi and mouse landsmen milled around them talking excitedly of home rushing to the paymaster when their names were called benrabi paid no attention he was fascinated by the sudden despair on mouses face the weapon please mike said several men surrounded them now kindervoort himself was approaching having just left a nearby office mouse surrendered the gun meekly consternation becoming a weak smile told beckhart it wouldnt work he said loudly but he never listens to the man in the field there was a stir shouts screams mouse hit benrabi with a flying tackle mike grunted twisted came down atop them an expression of incredible surprise fixed on the unburned half of his face the shouting redoubled people tried to run a handgun flashed again security men tried to reach the source of fire wheels within wheels mouse said into benrabis ear his voice coldly calm kindervoort kneeling beside them looked at him questioningly this was mine mouse told him i figured hed have a failsafer in failsafer that was a trade name for a man hyped and programed to do everybody in if a mission went bust failsafers seldom knew what they were usually they were innocents dragged in off a street somewhere and run through the psych mill even after assassinating agents about to defect or to be captured they seldom knew what they had done why or for whom benrabi had never considered himself mouse and this mission that critical sorry moyshe i didnt think i should tell you made it look better you believing is he telling the truth moyshe wondered or is he playing the ends against the middle is he just bending with the breeze hoping to keep his skin we had to spot him before we could cross over and this was the only place to do it its too late for him now he cant hunt us down mouse shrugged then smiled so did benrabi he chose to believe he did not want to stay here alone that was why he had had so much trouble deciding amy was not enough chub was not enough the seiner culture itself was insufficient he had needed that one extra mouse his heartline to the past kindervoorts men returned you get him mouse asked somebody did he was dead when we got there looks like a nerve poison kindervoort regarded them oddly appraisingly failsafer for a failsafer your admiral is bizarre but ive never heard of that before unusual moyshe thought its unprecedented it doesnt make sense but what the hell it was over now he was home free home after all and with a good woman amy was running toward him through the crowd pale with worry and a friend life it seemed had finally taken a happy turn are you ready now amy asked anxiously after having made sure he was unharmed ready for what to cross over stupid are you darling she seemed afraid his stiffneckedness would persist it did seems like i dont have much choice but i wont talk talk kindervoort asked what do you mean about what about the bureau about its policies its goals its mission things i might know that youd want to know i wont tell you the man who was commander thomas aquinas mcclennon is dead everything he knew died with him dont try to call him back from
