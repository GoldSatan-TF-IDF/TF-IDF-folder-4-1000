faust eric the bees of death are big and black they buzz low and sombre they keep their honey in combs of wax as white as alter candles the honey is black as night thick as sin and sweet as treacle it is well known the eight colours make up white but there are also eight colours of blackness for those that have the seeing of them and the hives of death are among the black grass in the black orchard under the blackblossomed ancient boughs of trees that will eventually produce apples that put it like this probably wont be red the grass was short now the scythe that had done the work leaned against the gnarled bole of a pear tree now death was inspecting his bees gently lifting the combs in his skeletal fingers a few bees buzzed around him like all beekeepers death wore a veil it wasnt that he had anything to sting but sometimes a bee would get inside his skull and buzz around and give him a headache as he held a comb up to the grey light of his little world between the realities there was the faintest of tremors a hum went up from the hive a leaf floated down a wisp of wind blew for a moment through the orchard and that was the most uncanny thing because the air in the land of death is always warm and still death fancied that he heard very briefly the sound of running feet and a voice saying no a voice thinking oshitoshitoshit im gonna die im gonna die im gonna die death is almost the oldest creature in the universe with habits and modes of thought that mortal man cannot begin to understand but because he was also a good beekeeper he carefully replaced the comb in its rack and put the lid on the hive before reacting he strode back through the dark garden to his cottage removed his veil carefully dislodged a few bees who had got lost in the depths of his cranium and retired to his study as he sat down at his desk there was another gust of wind which rattled the hourglasses on the shelves and made the big pendulum clock in the hall pause briefly in its interminable task of slicing time into manageable bits death sighed and focused his gaze there is nowhere death will not go no matter how distant and dangerous in fact the more dangerous it is the more likely he is to be there already now he stared through the mists of time and space oh he said its him it was a hot afternoon in the late summer in ankhmorpork normally the most thriving bustling and above all the most crowded city on the disc now the spears of the sun had achieved what innumerable invaders several civil wars and the curfew law had never achieved it had pacified the place dogs lay panting in the scalding shade the river ankh which never what you might call sparkled oozed between its banks as if the heat had sucked all the spirit out of it the streets were empty ovenbrick hot no enemies had ever taken ankhmorpork well technically they had quite often the city welcomed freespending barbarian invaders but somehow the puzzled raiders always found after a few days that they didnt own their own horses any more and within a couple of months they were just another minority group with its own graffiti and food shops but the heat had besieged the city and triumphed over the walls it lay over the trembling streets like a shroud under the blowlamp of the sun assassins were too tired to kill it turned thieves honest in the ivycovered fastness of the unseen university premier college of wizardry the inmates dozed with their pointy hats over their faces even bluebottles were too exhausted to bang against windowpanes the city siestad awaiting the sunset and the brief hot velvet surcease of the night only the librarian was cool he was also swinging and hanging out this was because hed rigged up a few ropes and rings in one of the subbasements of the unseen university library the one where they kept the um erotic books in vats of crushed ice and he was dreamily dangling in the chilly vapour above them all books of magic have a life of their own some of the really energetic ones cant simply be chained the bookshelves they have to be nailed shut or kept between steel plates or in the case of the volumes on tantric sex magic for the serious connoisseur kept under very cold water to stop them bursting into flames and scorching their severely plain covers the librarian swung gently back and forth above the seething vats dozing peacefully then the footsteps came out of nowhere raced across the floor with a noise that scraped the raw surface of the soul and disappeared through the wall there was a faint distant scream that sounded like ogodsogodsogods this is it im gonna die the librarian woke up lost his grip and flopped into the few inches of tepid water that was all that stood between the joy of tantric sex with illustrations for the advanced student by a lady and spontaneous combustion and it would have gone badly for him if the librarian had been a human being fortunately he was currently an orangutan with so much raw magic sloshing around in the library it would be surprising if accidents did not happen sometimes and one particularly impressive one had turned him into an ape not many people get the chance to leave the human race while still alive and hed strenuously resisted all efforts to turn him back since he was the only librarian in the universe who could pick up books with his feet the university hadnt pressed the point it also meant that his idea of desirable female companionship now looked something like a sack of butter thrown through a roll of old inner tubes and so he was lucky to get away with only minor burns a headache and some rather ambivalent feelings about cucumbers which wore off by teatime in the library above the grimoires creaked and rustled their pages in astonishment as the invisible runner passed straight through the bookshelves and disappeared or rather disappeared even more ankhmorpork gradually awoke from its slumber something invisible and yelling at the top of its voice was passing through every part of the city dragging in its wake a trail of destruction wherever it went things changed a fortuneteller in the street of cunning artificers heard the footsteps run across her bedroom floor and found her crystal ball had turned into a little glass sphere with a cottage in it plus snowflakes in a quite corner of the mended drum tavern where the adventuresses herrena the hennahaired harridan red scharron and diome witch of the night were meeting for some girl talk and a game of canasta all the drinks turned into small yellow elephants its them wizards up at the university said the barman hastily replacing the glasses it oughtnt to be allowed midnight dropped off the clock the council of wizardry rubbed their eyes and stared blearily at one another they felt it oughtnt to be allowed too especially since they werent the ones that were allowing it finally the new archchancellor ezrolith churn suppressed a yawn sat up straight in his chair and tried to look suitably magisterial he knew he wasnt really archchancellor material he hadnt really wanted the job he was ninetyeight and had achieved this worthwhile age by carefully not being any trouble to anyone he had hoped to spend his twilight years completing his sevenvolume treatise on some little known aspects of kuian rainmaking rituals which were an ideal subject for academic study in his opinion since the rituals only ever worked in ku and that particular continent had slipped into the ocean several thousand years ago the trouble was that in recent years the lifespan of archchancellors seemed to be a bit on the short side and the natural ambition of all wizards for the job had given way to a curious selfeffacing politeness hed come down one morning to find everyone calling him sir it had taken him days to find out why his head ached he felt it was several weeks past his bedtime but he had to say something gentlemen he began oook sorry and mo oook i mean apes of course oook the archchancellor opened and shut his mouth in silence for a while trying to reroute his train of thought the librarian was ex officio a member of the college council noone had been able to find any rule about orangutans being barred although they had surreptitiously looked very hard for one its a haunting he ventured some sort of a ghost maybe a bell book and a candle job the bursar sighed we tried that archchancellor the archchancellor leaned towards him eh he said i said we tried that archchancellor said the bursar loudly directing his voice at the old mans ear after dinner you remember we used humptempers names of the ants and rang old tom did we indeed worked did it no archchancellor eh anyway weve never had trouble with ghosts before said the senior tutor wizards just dont haunt places the archchancellor groped for a crumb of comfort perhaps its just something natural he said possibly the rumblings of an underground spring earth movements perhaps something in the drains they can make very funny noises you know when the wind is in the right direction he sat back and beamed the rest of the council exchanged glances the drains dont sound like hurrying feet archchancellor said the bursar wearily unless someone left a tap running said the senior tutor the bursar scowled at him hed been in the tub when the invisible screaming thing had hurtled through his room it was not an experience he wanted to repeat the archchancellor nodded at him thats settled then he said and fell asleep the bursar watched him in silence then he pulled the old mans hat off and tucked it gently under his head well he said wearily has anyone got any suggestions the librarian put his hand up oook he said yes well done good boy said the bursar breezily anyone else the orangutan glared at him as the other wizards shook their heads its a tremor in the texture of reality said the senior tutor thats what it is what should we do about it then search me unless we tried the old oh no said the bursar dont say it please its far too dangerous his words were chopped off by a scream that began at the far end of the room and dopplered along the table accompanied by the sound of many running feet the wizards ducked in a scatter of overturned chairs the candle flames were drawn into long thin tongues of octarine light before being snuffed out then there was silence the special kind that you get after a really unpleasant noise and the bursar said all right i give in we will try the rite of ashkente it is the most serious ritual eight wizards can undertake it summons death who naturally knows everything that is going on everywhere and of course it is done with reluctance because senior wizards are generally very old and would prefer not to do anything to draw deaths attention in their direction it took place in the midnight in the universitys great hall in a welter of incense candlesticks runic inscriptions and magic circles none of which was strictly necessary but made the wizards feel better magic flared the chants were chanted the invocations were truly invoked the wizards stared into the magic octogram which remained empty after a while the circle of robed figures began to mutter amongst themselves we must have done something wrong oook maybe he is out or busy do you think we could give up and go back to bed who are we waiting for exactly the bursar turned slowly to the figure beside him you could always tell a wizards robe it was bedecked with sequins sigils fur and lace and there was usually a considerable amount of wizard inside it this robe however was very black the material looked as though it had been chosen for its hardwearing qualities so did its owner he looked as though if he wrote a diet book it would be a bestseller death was watching the octogram with an expression of polite interest er said the bursar the fact is in fact that er you should be on the inside im so sorry death stalked in a dignified way into the centre of the room and watched the bursar expectantly i hope we are not going to have any of this foul fiend business again he said i trust we are not interrupting any important enterprise said the bursar to somebody er er the reason o fou sir that we have called you here is for the reason it is rincewind what the reason you have summoned me the answer is it is rincewind but we havent asked you the question yet nevertheless the answer is it is rincewind look what we want to know is what is causing this outbreak of oh death pointedly picked invisible particles off the edge of his scythe the archchancellor cupped a gnarled hand over his ear whatd he say whos the fella with the stick its death sir you know tell him we dont want any said the old wizard waving his stick the bursar sighed we summoned him archchancellor is it whatd we go and do that for bloody silly thing to do the bursar gave death an embarrassed grin he was on the point of asking him to excuse the archchancellor on account of his age but realised that this would in the circumstances be a complete waste of breath are we talking about the wizard rincewind the one with the the bursar gave a shudder horrible luggage on legs but he got blown up when there was all that business with the sourcerer didnt he into the dungeon dimensions and now he is trying to get back home can he do that there would need to be an unusual conjunction of circumstances reality would need to be weakened in certain unexpected ways that isnt likely to happen is it said the bursar anxiously people who have it on record that they were visiting their aunt for two months are always nervous about people turning up who may have mistakenly thought that they werent and owing to some trick of the light might have believed they had seen them doing things that they couldnt have been doing owing to being at their aunts it would be a million to one chance said death exactly a million to one chance oh said the bursar intensely relieved oh dear what a shame he brightened up considerably of course theres all the noise but unfortunately i expect he wont survive for long this could be the case said death blandly i am sure though that you would not wish me to make a practice of issuing definitive statements in this field no no of course not said the bursar hurriedly right well many thanks poor chap what a great pity still cant be helped perhaps we should be philosophical about these things perhaps you should and we had better not keep you the bursar added politely thank you goodbye be seeing you in fact the noise stopped just before breakfast the librarian was the only one unhappy about it rincewind had been his assistant and his friend and was a good man when it came to peeling a banana he had also been uniquely good at running away from things he was not the librarian considered the type to be easily caught there had probably been an unusual conjunction of circumstances that was a far more likely explanation there had been an unusual conjunction of circumstances by exactly a million to one chance there had been someone watching studying looking for the right tools for a special job and here was rincewind it was almost too easy so rincewind opened his eyes there was a ceiling above him if it was the floor then he was in trouble so far so good he cautiously felt the surface he was laying on it was grainy woody in fact with the odd nailhole a human sort of surface his ears picked up the crackle of a fife and a bubbling noise source unknown his nose feeling that it was being left out of things hastened to report a whiff of brimstone right so where did that leave him lying on a rough wooden floor in a firelit room with something that bubbled and gave off sulphurous smells in his unreal dreamy state he felt quite pleased at this process of deduction what else oh yes he opened his mouth and screamed and screamed and screamed this made him feel slightly better he lay there a bit longer though the tumbled heap of his memories came the recollections of mornings in bed when he was a little boy desperately subdividing the passing time into smaller and smaller units to put off the terrible moment of getting up and having to face all the problems of life such as in this case who he was where he was and why he was what are you said a voice on the edge of his consciousness i was coming to that muttered rincewind the room oscillated into focus as he pushed himself up on his elbows i warn you said the voice which seemed to be coming from a table i am protected by many powerful amulets jolly good said rincewind i wish i was details began to distil out of the blur it was a long low room one end of which was occupied by an enormous fireplace a bench all down one wall contained a selection of glassware apparently created by a drunken glassblower with hiccups and inside its byzantine coils coloured liquids seethed and bubbled a skeleton hung from a hook in a relaxed fashion on a perch beside it someone had nailed a stuffed bird whatever sins it had committed in life it hadnt deserved what the taxidermist had done to it rincewinds gaze swept across the floor it was obvious that it was the only sweeping the floor had had for some time only around him had space been cleared among the debris of broken glass and overturned retorts for a magic circle it looked an extremely thorough job whoever had chalked it was clearly aware that its purpose was to divide the universe into two bits the inside and the outside rincewind was of course inside ah he said feeling a familiar and almost comforting sense of dread sweep over him i adjure and conjure thee against all aggressive acts o demon of the pit said the voice from rincewind now realised behind the table fine fine said rincewind quickly thats all right by me er it isnt possible that there has been the teeniest little mistake here could there avaunt right said rincewind he looked around him desperately how dont you think you can lure me to my doom with thy lying tongue o fiend of shamharoth said the table i am learned in the ways of demons obey my every command or i will return thee unto the boiling hell from which you came thou came sorry thou camest in fact and i really mean it the figure stepped out it was quite short and most of it was hidden by a variety of charms amulets and talismans which even if not effective against magic would have protected it against a tolerably determined sword thrust it wore glasses and had a hat with long sidepieces that gave it the air of a shortsighted spaniel it held a sword in one shaking hand it was so heavily etched with sigils that it was beginning to bend boiling hell did you say said rincewind weakly absolutely where the screams of anguish and the tortured torments yes yes youve made your point said rincewind only you see the thing is in fact that i am not a demon so if you would just let me out i am not fooled by thy outer garb demon said the figure in a more normal voice it added anyway demons always lie wellknown fact it is said rincewind clutching at this straw in that case then i am a demon aha condemned out of your own mouth look i dont have to put up with this said rincewind i dont know who you are or whats happening but im going to have a drink all right he went to walk out of the circle and went rigid with shock as sparks crackled up from the runic inscriptions and earthed themselves all over his body thou maysnt thou maysnt thou maysnt the conjurer of demons gave up look you cant step over the circle until i release you right i mean i dont want to be unpleasant its just that if i let you out of the circle you will be able to resume your true shape and a pretty awful shape it is too i expect avaunt he added feeling that he wasnt keeping up the tone all right im avaunting im avaunting said rincewind rubbing his elbow but im still not a demon how come you answered the conjuration then i suppose you just happened to be passing through the paranatural dimensions eh something like that i think its all a bit blurred pull the other one it has got bells on the conjurer leaned his sword against a lectern on which a heavy book dripping bookmarks lay open then he did a mad little jig on the floor its worked he said heheh he caught sight of rincewinds horrified gaze and pulled himself together he gave an embarrassed cough and stepped up to the lectern i really am not rincewind began i had this list here somewhere said the figure lets see now oh yes i command you thee i mean to ah grant me three wishes yes i want mastery of the kingdoms of the world i want to meet the most beautiful woman who has ever lived and i wan to live forever he gave rincewind an encouraging look all that said rincewind yes oh no problem said rincewind sarcastically and then i get to have the rest of the day off right and i want a chest full of gold too just to be going on with i can see youve got it all thought out yes avaunt right right only rincewind thought hurriedly hes quite mad but mad with a sword in his hands the only chance ive got is to argue him out of it on his own terms only dyou see im not a very superior kind of demon and im afraid those sort of errands are a bit out of my league sorry you can avaunt as much as you like but theyre just beyond me the little figure peered over the top of its glasses i see he said testily what could you manage then do you think well er said rincewind i suppose i could go down to the shops and get a packet of mints or something there was a pause you really cant do all those things sorry look ill tell you what you just release me and ill be sure to pass the word around when i get back to rincewind hesitated where the hell did demons live anyway demon city he said hopefully you mean pandemonium said his captor suspiciously yes thats right thats what i meant ill tell everyone next time youre in the real world be sure and look up whats your name thursley eric thursley right demonologist midden lane pseudopolis next door to the tannery said thursley hopefully right you are dont you worry about it now if youll just let me out thursleys face fell youre sure you really cant do it he said and rincewind couldnt help noticing the edge of pleading in his voice even a small chest of gold would do and i mean it neednt be the most beautiful woman in the whole of history second most beautiful would do or third you pick any one out of you know the top one hundr thousand whatever youve got in stock sort of thing by the end of the sentence his voice twanged with longing rincewind wanted to say look what you should do is stop all this messing around with chemicals in dark rooms and have a shave a haircut a bath make that two baths buy yourself a new wardrobe and get out of an evening and then but hed have to be honest because even washed shaved and soaked in body splash thursley wasnt going to win any prizes and then you could have your face slapped by any woman of your choice i mean it wouldnt be much but it would be body contact sorry he said again thursley sighed the kettles on he said would you like a cup of tea rincewind stepped forward into a crackle of psychic energy ah said thursley uncertainly as the wizard sucked his fingers ill tell you what ill put you under a conjuration of duress theres no need i assure you no its best this way it means you can move around i had it all ready anyway in case you could go and fetch you know her fine said rincewind as the demonologist mumbled words from the book he thought feet door stairs what a great combination it occurred to him that there was something about the demonologist that wasnt quite usual but he couldnt put his finger on it he looked pretty much like the demonologists rincewind had known back in ankhmorpork who were all bent and chemicalstained and had eyes with pupils like pinheads from all the chemical fumes this one would have fitted in easily it was just that there was something odd to be honest said thursley industriously mopping away part of the circle youre my first demon its never worked before what is your name rincewind thursley thought about this it doesnt ring a bell he said theres a riinjswin in the demonologie and a winswin but theyve got more wings than you you can step out now i must say thats a firstclass materialisation noone would think you were a fiend to look at you most demons when they want to look human materialise in the shape of nobles kings and princes this motheatenwizard look is very clever you couldve almost fooled me its a shame you cant do any of those things i cant see why youd want to live for ever said rincewind privately determining that the words motheaten would be paid for if ever he got the opportunity being young again i can understand that huh being youngs not much fun said thursley and then clapped his hand over his mouth rincewind leaned forward about fifty years that was what was missing thats a false beard he said how old are you eightyseven squeaked thursley i can see the hooks over your ears seventyeight honest avaunt youre a little boy eric pulled himself up haughtily im not he snapped im nearly fourteen ahha the boy waved the sword at rincewind it doesnt matter anyway he shouted demonologists can be any age youre still my demon and you have to do as i say eric came a voice from somewhere below them erics face went white yes mother he shouted his eyes fixed on rincewind his mouth shaped the words dont say anything please whats all that noise up there nothing mother come down and wash your hands dear your breakfasts ready yes mother he looked sheepishly at rincewind thats my mother he said shes got a good pair of lungs hasnt she said rincewind id id better go then said eric youll have to stay up here of course it dawned on him that he was losing a certain amount of credibility at this point he waved the sword again avaunt he said i command you not to leave this room right sure said rincewind eyeing the windows promise otherwise youll be sent back to the pit oh i dont want that said rincewind off you trot dont worry about me im going to leave the sword and stuff here said eric removing most of his accoutrements to reveal a slim darkhaired young man whose face would be a lot better when his acne cleared up if you touch them terrible things will befall wouldnt dream of it said rincewind when he was left alone he wandered he wandered over to the lectern and looked at the book the title in impressively flickering red letters was mallificarum sumpta diabolicite occularis singularum the book of ultimate control he knew about it there was a copy in the library somewhere although wizards never bothered with it this might seem odd because if there is one thing a wizard would trade his grandfather for it is power but it wasnt all that strange because any wizard bright enough to survive for five minutes was also bright enough to realise that if there was any power in demonology then it lay with the demons using it for your own purposes would be like trying to beat mice to death with a rattlesnake even wizards thought demonologists were odd they tended to be surreptitious pale men who got up to complicated things in darkened rooms and had damp weak handshakes it wasnt like good clean magic no selfrespecting wizard would have any truck with the demonic regions whose inhabitants were as big a collection of dingdong as youd find outside a large belfry he inspected the skeleton closely just in case it didnt seem inclined to make a contribution to the situation it belonged to his wossname grandfather said a cracked voice behind him bit of an unusual bequest said rincewind oh not personally he got it in a shop somewhere its one of them wossname articulate wossnames its not saying much right now said rincewind and then went very quiet and thoughtful er he said without moving his head what precisely am i talking to im a wossname tip of my tongue begins with a p rincewind turned around slowly youre a parrot he said thats it rincewind stared at the thing on the perch it had one eye that glittered like a ruby most of the rest of it was pink and purple skin studded with the fagends of feathers so that the net effect was of an ovenready hairbrush it jiggled arthritically on its perch and then slowly lost its balance until it was hanging upside down i thought you were stuffed said rincewind up yours wizard rincewind ignored it and crept over to the window it was small but gave out on to a gently sloping roof and out there was a real life real sky real buildings he reached out to open the shutters a crackling current coursed up his arm and earthed itself in his cerebellum he sat on the floor sucking his fingers he tole you said the parrot swinging backwards and forwards upside down but you wouldnt wossname hes got you by the wossnames but it should only work on demons ah said the parrot achieving enough momentum to swing upright again whereupon it steadied itself with the stubby remains of what had once been wings its all according isnt it if you come in the door marked wossnames that means you get treated as a wossname right demon i mean subject to all the rules and wossnames tough one for you but you know im a wizard dont you the parrot gave a squawk ive seen em mate the real mcwossname some of the ones weve had in here theyd make you choke on your millet great scaly fiery wossnames took weeks to get the soot off the walls it added in an approving tone of voice that was in his granddads day of course the kid hasnt been any good at it up to now bright lad i blame the wossnames parents new money you know wine business spoil him rotten let him play with his wossnames old stuff oh hes such an intelligent lad nose always in a book the parrot mimicked they never give him any of the things a sensitive growing wossname really needs if you was to ask me what you mean love and guidance said rincewind i was thinking of a bloody good wossname thrashing said the parrot rincewind clutched at his aching head if this was what demons usually had to go through no wonder they were always so annoyed polly want a biscuit said the parrot vaguely in much the same way as a human would say er or as i was saying and went on his granddad was keen on it that and his pigeons pigeons said rincewind not that he was particularly successful it was all a bit trial and wossname i thought you said great big scaly oh yes but that wasnt what he was after he was trying to conjure up a succubus it should be impossible to leer when all youve got is a beak but the parrot managed it thats a female demon what comes in the night and makes mad passionate wossn ive heard of them said rincewind bloody dangerous things the parrot put its head on one side it never worked all he ever got was a neuralger whats that its a demon that comes and has a headache at you demons have existed on the discworld for at least as long as the gods who in many ways they closely resemble the difference is basically the same as that between terrorists and freedom fighters most of the demons occupy a spacious dimension close to reality traditionally decorated in shades of flame and maintained at roasting point this isnt actually necessary but if there is one thing that your average demon is it is a traditionalist in the centre of the inferno rising majestically from a lake of lava substitute and with unparalleled views of the eight circles lies the city of pandemonium at the moment it was living up to its name astfgl the new king of the demons was furious not simply because the airconditioning had broken down again not because he felt surrounded by idiots and plotters on every side and not even because noone could pronounce his name properly yet but also because he had just been given bad news the demon who had been chosen by lottery to deliver it cowered in front of his throne with its tail between its legs it was immortally afraid that something wonderful was soon to happen to it it did what said astfgl it er it opened o lord the circle in pseudopolis ah the clever boy we have great hopes of him er then it closed again lord the demon shut its eyes and who went through er the demon looked around at its colleagues clustered at the far end of the milelong throne room i said and who went through in point of fact o lord yes we dont know someone i gave orders did i not that when the boy succeeded the duke vassenego was to materialise unto him and offer him forbidden pleasures and dark delights to bend him to our will the king growled the problem with being evil hed been forced to admit was that demons were not great innovatory thinkers and really needed the spice of human ingenuity and hed really been looking forward to eric thursley whose brand of superintelligent gormlessness was a rare delight hell heeded horriblybright selfcentred people like eric they were much better at being nasty than demons could ever manage indeed lord said the demon and the duke has been awaiting the summons there for years shunning all other temptations steadfastly and patiently studying the world of men so where was he er call of supernatural lord the demon gabbled hadnt turned his back for two minutes when and someone went through were trying to find out lord astfgls patience which in any case had the tensile strength of putty snapped at this point that just about summed it up he had the kind of subjects who used the words find out when they meant ascertain damnation was too good for them get out he whispered and i shall see to it that you get a commendation for this o master i plead get out the king stamped along the glowing corridors to his private apartments his predecessors had favoured shaggy hind legs and hoofs lord astfgl had rejected all that sort of thing out of hand he held that noone would ever get taken seriously by those stuckup bastards in dunmanifestin when their rear end kept ruminating all the time and so he favoured a red silk cloak crimson tights a cowl with two rather sophisticated little horns on it and a trident the end kept dropping off the trident but he felt it was the sort of getup in which a demon king could be taken seriously in the coolness of his chambers oh by all the gods or rather not by all the gods it had taken him ages to get them up to some sort of civilised standard his predecessors had been quite content just to lounge around and tempt people they had never heard of executive stress he gently lifted the cover off the mirror of souls and watched it flicker into life its cool black surface was surrounded by an ornate frame from which curls of greasy smoke constantly unfolded and drifted your wish master it said show me the events around the pseudopolis gate over the last hour said the king and settled down to watch after a while he went and looked up the name rincewind in the filing cabinet he had recently had installed in place of the distressinglybound old ledgers that had been there the system still needed ironing out though because the bewildered demons filed everything under p for people then he sat watching the flickering pictures and absentmindedly playing with the stuff on his desk to soothe his nerves he had any amount of desk things notepads with magnets for paperclips handy devices for holding pens and those tiny jotters that always came in handy incredibly funny statuettes with slogans like youre the boss and little chromium balls and spirals operated by a sort of ersatz and shortlived perpetual motion noone looking at that desk could have any doubt that they were in cold fact truly damned i see said lord astfgl setting a selection of shiny balls swinging with one tap of a talon he couldnt remember any demon called rincewind on the other hand there were millions of the wretched things swarming all over the place with no sense of order and he hadnt yet had time to carry out a proper census and retire the unnecessary ones this one seemed to have a fewer appendages and more vowels in his name than most but it had to be a demon vassenego was a proud old fool one of the elder demons who smiled and despised him and notquiteobeyed him just because the kingd worded hard over the millennia to get humble beginnings to where he was today he wouldnt put it past the old devil to do this on purpose just to spite him well hed have to see about that later send him a memo or something too late to do anything about it now hed have to take a personal interest eric thursley was too good a prospect to pass up getting eric thursley would really annoy the gods god how he hated the gods he hated the gods even more than he hated the old guard like vassenego even more than he hated humans hed thrown a little soirйee last week hed put a lot of thought into it he wanted to show that he was prepared to let bygones be bygones work with them for a new better and more efficient universe hed called it a getting to know you party thered been sausages on sticks and every thing hed done his best to make it nice they hadnt even bothered to answer the invitations and hed made a special point of putting rsvp on them demon eric peered around the door what shape are you he said pretty poor shape said rincewind ive brought you some food you do eat do you rincewind tried some it was a bowl of cereal nuts and dried fruit he didnt have any quarrel with any of that it was just that somewhere in the preparation something had apparently done to these innocent ingredients what it takes a million gravities to do a neutron star if you died of eating this sort of thing they wouldnt have to bury you they would just need to drop you somewhere where the ground was soft he managed to swallow it it wasnt difficult the trick would have been preventing it from heading downwards lovely he choked the parrot did a splendid impersonation of someone being sick ive decided to let you go said eric its pretty pointless keeping you isnt it absolutely you havent any powers at all sorry dead failure you dont look too demonic come to think about it said eric they never do you cant trust them wossnames chortled the parrot it lost its balance again polly want a biscuit it said upside down rincewind spun around you stay out of this beaky there was a sound behind them like the universe clearing its throat the chalk marks of the magic circle grew terribly bright for a moment became fiery lines against the scuffed planks and something dropped out of the empty air and landed heavily on the floor it was a large metalbound chest it had fallen on its curved lid after a while it started to rock violently and then it extended hundreds of little pink legs and with considerable effort flipped itself over finally it shuffled around until it was watching the pair of them it was all the more disconcerting because it was staring without having any eyes to do it with eric moved first he grasped the homemade magic sword which flapped wildly you are a demon he said i nearly believed you when you said you werent wheee said the parrot its just my luggage said rincewind desperately its a sort of well it goes everywhere with me theres nothing demonic about it er he hesitated not much anyway he finished lamely avaunt oh not again the boy looked at the open book my commands earlier resume he said firmly the most beautiful woman who has ever lived mastery of all the kingdoms of the world and to live forever get on with it rincewind stood frozen well go on said eric youre supposed to disappear in a puff of smoke listen do you think i can just snap my fingers rincewind snapped his fingers there was a puff of smoke rincewind gave his fingers a long shocked stare as one might regard a gun that has been hanging on the wall for decades and has suddenly gone off and perforated the cat theyve hardly ever done that before he said he looked down aargh he said and closed his eyes it was a better world in the darkness behind his eyelids if he tapped his foot he could persuade himself that he could feel the floor he could know that he was really standing in the room and that the urgent signals from all his other senses which were telling him that he was suspended in the air some thousand miles or so above the disc were just a bad dream hed wake up from he hastily cancelled that thought if he was asleep hed prefer to stay that way you could fly in dreams if he woke up it was a long way to fall perhaps i have died and i really am a demon he thought it was an interesting point he opened his eyes again wow said eric his eyes gleaming can i have all of it the boy was standing in the same position he had been in the room so was the luggage so to rincewinds annoyance was the parrot it was perching in midair looking speculatively at the cosmic panorama below the disc might almost have been designed to be seen from space it hadnt rincewind was damn sure been designed to be lived on but he had to admit that it was impressive the sun was about to rise on the far rim and made a line of fire that glittered around half the circumference a long slow dawn was just beginning its sweep across the dark massive landscape below harshly lit in the arid vacuum of space great atuin the world turtle toiled under the weight of creation on his or her the matter had never really been resolved carapace the four giant elephants strained to support the disc itself there might have been more efficient ways to build a world you might start with a ball of molten iron and then coat it with successive layers of rock like an oldfashioned gobstopper and youd have a very efficient planet but it wouldnt look so nice besides things would drop off the bottom pretty good said the parrot polly want a continent its so big breathed eric yes said rincewind flatly he felt that something more was expected of him dont break it he added he had a nagging doubt about all this if he was for the sake of argument a demon and so many things had happened to him recently he was prepared to concede that he might have died and not noticed it in the confusion then he still didnt quite see how the world was his to give away he was pretty sure that it had owners who felt the same way also he was sure that a demon had to get something in writing i think that you have to sign for it he said in blood whose said eric yours i think said rincewind or bird blood will do at a pinch he glared meaningfully at the parrot which growled at him arent i allowed to try it out first what well suppose it doesnt work im not signing for it until ive seen it work rincewind stared at the boy then he looked down at the broad panorama of the kingdoms of the world i wonder if i was like him at his age he thought i wonder how i survived its the world he said patiently of course it will bloody well work i mean look at it hurricanes continental drift rainfall cycle its all there all ticking over like a bloody watch itll last you a lifetime a world like that used carefully eric gave the world a critical examination he wore the expression of someone who knows that all the best gifts in life seem to require the psychic equivalent of two u batteries and the shops wont be open until after the holidays theres got to be tribute he said flatly you what the kings of the world said eric theyve got to pay me tribute youve really been studying this havent you said rincewind sarcastically just tribute you dont fancy the moon while were up here this weeks special offer one free satellite with every world dominated are there any useful minerals what eric gave a sigh of longsuffering patience minerals he said ores you know rincewind coloured i dont think a lad your age should be thinking of i mean metal and things its no use to me if its just a load of rock rincewind looked down the discworlds tiny moonlet was just rising over the far edge and shed a pale radiance across the jigsaw pattern of land and sea oh i dont know it looks quite nice he volunteered look its dark now perhaps everyone can pay you tribute in the morning i want some tribute now i thought you might rincewind gave his fingers a careful examination it wasnt as if hed ever been particularly good at snapping them he gave it another try when he opened his eyes again he was standing up to his ankles in mud preeminent amongst rincewinds talents was his skill in running away which over the years he had elevated to the status of a genuinely pure science it didnt matter if you were fleeing from or to so long as you were fleeing it was flight alone that counted i run therefore i am more correctly i run therefore with any luck ill still be but he was also skilled in languages and in practical geography he could shout help in fourteen languages and scream for mercy in a further twelve he had passed through many of the countries on the disc some of them at high speed and during the long lovely boring hours when hed worked in the library hed whiled away the time by reading up on all the exotic and faraway places hed never visited he remembered that at the time hed sighed with relief that hed never have to visit them and now here he was jungle surrounded him it wasnt nice interesting open jungle such as leopardskinclad heroes might swing through but serious real jungle jungle that towered up like solid slabs of greenness thorned and barbed jungle in which every representative of the vegetable kingdom had really rolled up its bark and got down to the strenuous business of outgrowing all competitors the soil was hardly soil at all but dead plants on the way to composthood water dripped from leaf to leaf insects whined in the humid sporeladen air and there was the terrible breathless silence made by the motors of photosynthesis running flat out any yodelling hero who tried to swing through that lot might just as well take his chances with a beanslicer how do you do that said eric its probably a knack said rincewind eric subjected the wonders of nature to a cursory and disdainful glance this doesnt look like a kingdom he complained you said we could go to a kingdom do you call this a kingdom this is probably the rain forests of klatch said rincewind theyre stuffed full of lost kingdoms you mean mysterious ancient races of amazonian princesses who subject all male prisoners to strange and exhausting progenitative rites said eric his glasses beginning to fog haha said rincewind stonily what an imagination the child has wossname wossname wossname shrieked the parrot ive read about them said eric peering into the greenery of course i own those kingdoms as well he stared at some private inner vision gosh he said hungrily i should concentrate on the tribute if i was you said rincewind setting off down what was possibly a path the brightlycoloured blooms on a tree nearby turned to watch him go in the jungles of central klatch there are indeed lost kingdoms of mysterious amazonian princesses who capture male explorers for specifically masculine duties these are indeed rigorous and exhausting and the luckless victims do not last long there are also hidden plateaux where the reptilian monsters of a bygone epoch romp and play as well as elephants graveyards lost diamond mines and strange ruins decorated with hieroglyphs the very sight of which can freeze the most valiant heart on any reasonable amp theres barely room for the trees the few explorers who have passed on a number of handy hints to those who follow after such as avoid if possible any hangingdown creepers with beady eyes and a forked tongue at one end dont pick up any orangeandblackstripped creepers that are apparently lying across the path twitching because there is often a tiger on the other end and dont go if im a demon rincewind thought hazily why is everything stinging me and trying to trip me up i mean surely i can only be harmed by a wooden dagger through my heart or do i mean garlic eventually the jungle opened out into a very wide cleared area that stretched all the way to a distant blue range of volcanoes the land fell away below them to a patchwork of lakes and swampy fields here and there punctured by great stepped pyramids each one crowned with a thin plume of smoke curling into the dawn air the jungle track opened out into a narrow but paved road wheres this demon said eric it looks like one of the tezuman kingdoms said rincewind theyre ruled over by the great muzuma i think shes an amazonian princess is she strangely enough no youd be astonished how many kingdoms arent ruled by amazonian princesses eric it looks pretty primitive anyway a bit stone age the tezuman priests have a sophisticated calendar and an advanced horology quoted rincewind ah said eric good no said rincewind patiently it means time measurement oh youd approve of them theyre superb mathematicians apparently huh said eric blinking solemnly shouldnt think theyve got a lot to count in a backward civilisation like this rincewind eyed the chariots that were heading rapidly towards them i think they usually count victims he said the tezuman empire in the jungle valleys of central klatch is known for its organic market gardens its exquisite craftsmanship in obsidian feathers and jade and its mass human sacrifices in honour of quezovercoatl the feathered boa god of mass human sacrifices as they said you always knew where you stood with quezovercoatl it was generally with a lot of people on top of a great stepped pyramid with someone in an elegant feathered headdress chipping an exquisite obsidian knife for your very own personal use the tezuman are renowned on the continent for being the most suicidally gloomy irritable and pessimistic people you could ever hope to meet for reasons that may soon be made clear it was true about the time measurement as well the tezuman had realised long ago that everything was getting worse and having a terrible literalmindedness had developed a complex system to keep track of how much worse each succeeding day was contrary to general belief the tezumen did invent the wheel they just had radically different ideas about what you used it for it was the first chariot that rincewind had ever seen that was pulled by llamas that wasnt what was odd about it what was odd about it was that it was being carried by people two holding each side of the axle and running after the animals their sandalled feet flapping on the flagstones do you think its got the tribute in it said eric all the leading chariot seemed to contain apart from the driver was a squat basically cubeshaped man wearing a pumaskin outfit and a feather headdress the runners panted to a halt and rincewind saw that each man wore what would probably be described as a primitive sword made by affixing shards of obsidian into a wooden club they looked to him no less deadly than sophisticated extremely civilised swords in fact they looked worse well said eric well what said rincewind tell him to give me my tribute the fat man got down ponderously marched over to eric and to rincewinds extreme surprise grovelled rincewind felt something claw its way up his back and onto his shoulder where a voice like a sheet of metal being torn in half said thats better very wossname comfy if you try and knock me off demon you can wossname your ear goodbye what a turn up for the scrolls eh they seemed to be expecting him why do you keep saying wossname said rincewind limited wossname doodah thingy you know its got words in it said the parrot dictionary said rincewind they passengers in the other chariots had got out and were also grovelling to eric who was beaming like an idiot the parrot considered this yeah probably it said ive got to wing it to you it went on i thought you were a bit of a wossname at the start but you seem to be delivering the wossname demon said eric airily yes what are they saying cant you speak their language er no said rincewind i can read it though he called out as eric turned away if you could just sort of make signs for them to write it down it was around noon in the jungle behind rincewind creatures whooped and gibbered mosquitoes the size of hummingbirds whined around his head of course he said for the tenth time theyve never really got around to inventing paper the stonemason stood bake handed the latest blunted obsidian chisel to his assistant and gave rincewind and expectant look rincewind stood back and examined the rock critically its very good he said i mean its a very good likeness youve got his hairstyle and everything of course hes not as er square as that normally but yes very good and heres the chariot and theres the steppyramids yes well it looks as though they want you to go to the city with them he said to eric tell them yes said eric firmly rincewind turned to the headman yes he said ї rincewind sighed without saying a word the stonemason put a fresh stone chisel into his unresisting fingers and manhandled a new slab of granite into position one of the problems of being a tezuman apart from having a god like quezovercoatl is that if you unexpectedly need to order an extra pint of milk tomorrow you should have started writing the note last month tezumen are the only people who beat themselves to death with their own suicide notes it was late afternoon by the time the chariot trotted into the slab city around the largest pyramid between lines of cheering tezumen this is more like it said eric graciously acknowledging the cheers theyre very pleased to see us yes said rincewind gloomily i wonder why well because im the new ruler of course hmm rincewind glanced sidelong at the parrot who had been unnaturally silent for some time and was now cowering up against his ear like an elderly spinster in a strip club it was having serious thoughts about the exquisite feather headdresses wossname bastards it croaked any wossname lays a hand on me and that wossname is minus one finger im telling you theres something not right about this said rincewind whats that everything im telling you one feather out of place rincewind wasnt used to people being pleased to see him it was unnatural and boded no good these people were not only cheering they were throwing flowers and hats the hats were made out of stone but the thought was there rincewind thought they were rather odd hats they didnt have crowns they were in fact mere discs with holes in the middle the procession trotted up the wide avenues of the city to a cluster of buildings at the foot of the pyramid where another group of dignitaries was waiting for them they were wearing lots of jewellery it was all basically the same there are quite a lot of uses to which you can put a stone disc with a hole in the middle and the tezumen had explored all but one of them more important though were the boxes and boxes of treasure stacked in front of them they were stuffed with jewels erics eyes widened the tribute he said rincewind gave up it was really working he didnt know why but at last it was all going right the setting sun glinted off a dozen fortunes of course it belonged to eric presumably but maybe there was enough for him too naturally he said weakly what else did you expect and there was feasting and long speeches that rincewind couldnt understand but which were punctuated with cheers and nods and bows in erics direction and there were long recitals of tezuman music which sounds like someone clearing a particularly difficult nostril rincewind left eric sitting proudly enthroned in the firelight and wandered disconsolately across to the pyramid i was enjoying the wossname said the parrot reproachfully i cant settle down said rincewind im sorry but this sort of thing has never happened to me before all the jewels and things everything going as expected its not right he looked up the monstrous face of the steep pyramid red and flickering in the firelight every huge block was carved with a basrelief of tezumen doing terribly inventive things to their enemies it suggested that the tezumen whatever sterling qualities they possessed were not traditionally inclined to welcome perfect strangers and heap them with jewels the overall effect of the great heap of carvings was very artistic it was just the details that were horrible while working his way along the wall he came to a huge door which artistically portrayed a group of prisoners apparently being given a complete medical checkup it opened into a short torchlit tunnel rincewind took a few steps along it telling himself he could always hurry out again and came out into a lofty space which occupied most of the inside of the pyramid there were more torches all around the walls which illuminated everything quite well that wasnt really welcome because what they mainly illuminated was a giantsized statue of quezovercoatl the feathered boa if you had to be in a room with that statue youd prefer it to be pitch black or then again perhaps not a better option would be to put the thing in a darkened room while you had insomnia a thousand miles away trying to forget what it looked like its just a statue rincewind told himself its not real theyve just used their imagination thats all what the wossname is it said the parrot its their god get a way no really its quezovercoatl half man half chicken half jaguar half serpent half scorpion and half mad the parrots beak moved as it worked this out that makes a wossname total of three homicidal maniacs it said about right yes said the statue on the other hand said rincewind instantly i do think its frightfully important for people to have the right to worship in their own special way and now i think well just be going so just please dont leave me here said the statue please take me with you could be tricky could be tricky rincewind said hurriedly backing away its not me you understand its just that where i come from everyone has this racial prejudice against thirtyfoothigh people with fangs and talons and necklaces of skulls all over them i just think youll have trouble fitting in the parrot tweaked his ear its coming from behind the statue you stupid wossname it croaked it turned out to be coming from a hole in the floor a pale face peered shortsightedly up at rincewind from the depths of a pit it was an elderly goodnatured face with a faintly worried expression hallo said rincewind you dont know what it means to hear a friendly voice again said the face breaking into a grin if you could just sort of help me up sorry said rincewind youre a prisoner are you alas this is so i dont know that i ought to go around rescuing prisoners just like that said rincewind i mean you might have done anything i am entirely innocent of all crimes i assure you ah well so you say said rincewind gravely but if the tezumen have judged wossname wossname wossname shrieked the parrot in his ear as it bounced up and down on his shoulder havent you got the faintest whereve you been hes a prisoner a prisoner in a temple youve got to rescue prisoners in temples thats what theyre bloody there for no it isnt snapped rincewind thats all you know hes probably here to be sacrificed isnt that right he looked at the prisoner for confirmation the face nodded indeed you are correct flayed alive in fact there said rincewind to the parrot see you think you know everything hes to be flayed alive every inch of skin removed to the accompaniment of exquisite pain added the prisoner helpfully rincewind paused he thought he knew the meaning of the word exquisite and it didnt seem to belong anywhere near pain what every bit he said this is apparently the case gosh what was it you did the prisoner sighed youd never believe me he said the demon king let the mirror darken and drummed his fingers on his desk for a moment then he picked up a speaking tube and blew into it eventually a distant voice said yes guv yes sir snapped the king the distant voice muttered something yes sir it added do we have a quezovercoatl working here ill see guv the voice faded came back yes guv is he a duke earl count or baron said the king no guv well what is he there was a long silence at the other end well said the king hes noone much guv the king glared at the tube for some time you try he thought you make proper plans you try to get organised you try to help people and this is what you get send him to see me he said outside the music rose to a crescendo and stopped the fires crackled from the distant jungles a thousand glowing eyes watched the proceedings the high priest stood up and made a speech eric beamed like a pumpkin a long line of tezumen brought baskets of jewels which they scattered before him then the high priest made a second speech this one seemed to end in a question fine said eric jolly good keep it up he scratched his ear and ventured you can all have a half holiday the high priest repeated the question again in a slightly impatient tone of voice im the one yes said eric just in case they were unclear youve got it exactly right the high priest spoke again this time there was no slightly about it lets just run through this again shall we said the demon king he leaned back in his throne you just happened to find the tezumen one day and decided i think i recall your words correctly that they were a bunch of stoneage nohopers sitting around in a swamp being no trouble to anyone am i right whereupon you entered the mind of one of their high priests i believe at the time they worshiped a small stick drove him insane and inspired the tribes to unite terrorise their neighbours and bring forth upon the continent a new nation dedicated to the proposition that all men should be taken to the top of ceremonial pyramids and be chopped up with stone knives the king pulled his notes towards him oh yes some of them were also to be flayed alive he added quezovercoatl shuffled his feet whereupon said the king they immediately engaged in a prolonged war with just about everyone else bringing death and destruction to thousands of moderately blameless people ekcetra ekcetra now look this sort of thing has got to stop quezovercoatl swayed back a bit it was only you know a hobby said the imp i thought you know it was the right thing sort of thing death and destruction and that you did did you said the king thousands of moreorless innocent people dying straight out of our hands he snapped his fingers just like that straight off to their happy hunting ground or whatever thats the trouble with you people you dont think of the big picture i mean look at the tezumen gloomy unimaginative obsessive by now they could have invented a whole bureaucracy and taxation system that could have turned the minds of the continent to slag instead of which theyre just a bunch of secondrate axemurderers what a waste quezovercoatl squirmed the king swivelled the throne back and forth a bit now i want you to go back down there and tell them youre sorry he said pardon tell them youve changed your mind tell them that what you really wanted them to do was strive day and night to improve the lot of their fellow men itll be a winner what said quezovercoatl looking extremely shifty you want me to manifest myself theyve seen you already havent they i saw the statue its ver lifelike well yes ive appeared in dreams and that said the demon uncertainly right then get on with it quezovercoatl was clearly unhappy about something er he said you want me to actually materialise sort of thing i mean actually sort of turn up on the spot yes oh the prisoner dusted himself down and extended a wrinkled hand to rincewind many thanks ponce da quirm he said pardon its my name oh its a proud old name said da quirm searching rincewinds eyes for any traces of mockery fine said rincewind blankly we were searching for the fountain of youth da quirm went on rincewind looked him up and down any luck he said politely not significantly no rincewind peered back down into the pit you said we ha said wheres everyone else they got religion rincewind looked up at the statue of quezovercoatl i took no imagination whatsoever to imagine what kind i think he said carefully that we had better go too true said the old man and quickly too before the ruler of the world turns up rincewind went cold it starts he thought i knew it was all going to turn out badly and this is where it starts i must have an instinct for these things how do you know about that he said oh theyve got this prophecy really its more the entire history of the world start to finish its written all over this pyramid said da quirm cheerfully my word i wouldnt like to be the ruler when he arrives theyve got plans eric stood up now just you listen to me he said im not going to stand for this sort of thing im your ruler you know rincewind stared at the blocks nearest the statue it had taken the tezumen two storeys twenty years and ten thousand tons of granite to explain what they intended to do to the ruler of the world but the result was well graphic he would be left in no doubt that they were annoyed he might even go so far as to deduce that they were quite vexed but why do they give him all these jewels to start with he said pointing well he is the ruler said da quirm hes entitled to some respect i suppose rincewind nodded there was a sort of justice in it if you were a tribe who lived in a swamp in the middle of a damp forest didnt have any metal had been saddled with a god like quezovercoatl and then found someone who said he was in charge of the whole affair you probably would want to spend some time explaining to him how incredibly disappointed in him you were the tezumen had never seen any reason to be subtle in dealing with deities it was a very good likeness of eric his eye followed the story on to the next wall this block showed a very good likeness of rincewind he had a parrot on his shoulder hang on he said thats me you should see what theyre doing to you on the next block said the parrot smugly itll turn your wossname rincewind looked at the block his wossname revolved well just leave very quietly he said firmly i mean we wont stop to thank them for the meal we can always send them a letter later you know sos not to be impolite just a moment said da quirm as rincewind dragged at his arm i havent had a chance to read all the blocks yet i want to see how the worlds going to end how its going to end for everybody else i dont know said rincewind grimly dragging him down the tunnel i know how its going to end for me he stepped out in to the dawn light which was fine where he went wrong was stepping into a semicircle of tezumen they had spears they had exquisitely chipped obsidian spearheads which like their swords were nowhere near as sophisticated as ordinary coarse inferior steel weapons was it better to know that you were going to be skewered by delicate examples of genuine ethnic origin rather than nasty forgemade items hammered out by people not in contact with the cycles of nature probably not rincewind decided i always say said da quirm that there is a good side to everything rincewind trussed to the next slab turned his head with difficulty where is it at the moment precisely he said da quirm squinted down across the swamps and the forest roof well its a firstclass view from up here to begin with oh good said rincewind you know i never would have looked at it like that youre absolutely right its the kind of view youll remember for the rest of your life i expect i mean its not as if it will be any great feat of recollection theres no need to be sarcastic i was only passing a remark i want my mum said eric from the middle slab chin up lad said da quirm at least youre being sacrificed for something worthwhile i just suggested they tried using the wheels upright so theyd roll im afraid theyre not very responsive to new ideas around here still nil desperandum where theres life theres hope rincewind growled if there was one thing he couldnt stand it was people who were fearless in the face of death it seemed to strike at something absolutely fundamental in him in fact said da quirm i think he rolled from side to side experimentally tugging at the vines which were holding him down yes i think when they did these ropes up yes definitely they what what said rincewind yes definitely said da quirm im absolutely sure about it they did them up very tightly and professionally not an inch of give in them anywhere thank you said rincewind the flat top of the truncated pyramid was in fact quite large with plenty of room for statues priests slabs gutters knifechipping production lines and all the other things the tezumen needed for the bulk disposal of religion in front of rincewind several priests were busily chanting a long list of complaints about swamps mosquitoes lack of metal ore volcanoes the weather the way obsidian never kept its edge the trouble with having a god like quezovercoatl the way wheels never worked properly however often you laid them flat and pushed them and so on the prayers of most religions generally praise and thank the gods involved either out of general piety or in the hope that he or she will take the hint and start acting responsibly the tezumen having taken a long hard look around their world and decided bluntly that things were just about as bad as they were ever going to get had perfected the art of the plainchant winge wont be long now said the parrot from its perch atop a statue of one of the tezumens lesser gods it had got there by a complicated sequence of events that had involved a lot of squawking a cloud of feathers and three tezumen priests with badly swollen thumbs the high priest is just performing a wossname in honour of quezovercoatl it went on conversationally youve drawn quite a crowd i suppose you wouldnt kind of hop down here and bite through these ropes would you said rincewind not a chance thought so suns coming up soon the parrot continued rincewind felt that it sounded unnecessarily cheerful im going to complain about this demon moaned eric you wait my mother finds out my parents have got influence you know oh good said rincewind weakly why dont you tell the high priest that if he cuts your heart out shell be right down to the school tomorrow to complain the tezumen priests bowed towards the sun and all eyes in the crowd below turned to the jungle where something was happening there was the sound of crackling undergrowth tropical birds erupted through the trees shrieking rincewind of course could not see this you never should have wanted to be ruler of the world he said i mean what did you expect you cant expect people to be happy about seeing you noone ever is when the landlord turns up but theyre going to kill me its just their way of saying that metaphorically theyre fed up with waiting for you to repaint the place and see to the drains the whole jungle was in uproar now animals exploded out of the bushes as if running from a fire a few heavy thumps indicated that trees were falling over at last a frantic jaguar crashed through the undergrowth and loped down the causeway the luggage was a few feet behind it it was covered with creepers leaves and the feathers of various rare jungle fowls some of which were now even rarer the jaguar could have avoided it by zigging or zagging to either side but sheer idiot terror prevented it it made the mistake of turning its head to see what was behind this was the last mistake it ever made you know that box of yours said the parrot what about it said rincewind its heading this way the priests peered down at the running figure far below the luggage had a straightforward way of dealing with things between it and its intended destination it ignored them it was at this moment against all his instincts in great trepidation and most unfortunately of all in deep ignorance of what was happening that quezovercoatl himself chose to materialise on top of the pyramid several of the priests noticed him the knives fell from their fingers er squeaked the demon other priests turned around right now i want you all to pay attention squeaked quezovercoatl cupping his tiny hands around his main mouth in an effort to be heard this was very embarrassing hed enjoyed being the tezumen god hed been really impressed by their singleminded devotion to duty hed been very gratified by the incredible lifelike statue in the pyramid and it really hurt to have to reveal that in one important particular it was incorrect he was six inches high now then he began this is very important unfortunately noone ever found out why at that moment the luggage breasted the top of the pyramid its legs whirring like propellers and landed squarely on the slabs there was a brief flat squeak it was a funny old world said da quirm you had to laugh really if you didnt youd go mad wouldnt you one minute strapped to a slab and about to undergo exquisite torture the next being given breakfast a change of clothes a hot tub and a free lift out of the kingdom it made you believe there was a god of course the tezumen knew there was a god and that he was currently a small and distressing greasy patch on top of the pyramid which left them with a bit of a problem the luggage squatted in the citys main plaza the entire priesthood was sitting around it and watching it carefully in case it did anything amusing or religious are you going to leave it behind said eric its not as simple as that said rincewind it generally catches up lets just go away quickly but well take the tribute wont we i think that could be an amazingly bad idea said rincewind lets just quietly go while theyre in a good temper the novelty will wear off soon i expect and ive got to get on with my search for the fountain of youth said da quirm oh yes said rincewind ive devoted my whole life to it you know said the old man proudly rincewind looked him up and down really he said oh yes exclusively ever since i was a boy rincewinds expression was one of acute puzzlement in that case he began in the manner of one talking to a child wouldnt it have been better you know more sensible if youd just got on with what said da quirm oh never mind said rincewind ill tell you what though he added i think in order to prevent you getting you know bored we should present you with this wonderful talking parrot he made a swift grab while keeping his thumbs firmly out of harms way its a jungle fowl he said cruel to subject it to city life isnt it i was born in a cage you raving wossname screamed the parrot rincewind faced it nose to beak its that or fricassee time he said the parrot opened its beak to bite his nose saw his expression and thought better of it polly want a biscuit it managed adding sotto voce wossnamewossnamewossname a dear little bird of my very own said da quirm i shall look after it wossnamewossname they reached the jungle a few minutes later the luggage trotted after them it was noon in the kingdom of tezuma from inside the main pyramid came the sounds of a very large statue being dismantled the priests sat around thoughtfully occasionally one of them stood up and made a short speech it was clear that points were being made for example how the economics of the kingdom depended on a buoyant obsidian knife industry how the enslaved neighbouring kingdoms had come to rely on the smack of firm government and incidentally on the hack slash and disembowelling of firm government as well and on the terrible fate that awaited any people who didnt have gods godless people might get up to anything they might turn against the fine old traditions of thrift and nonselfsacrifice that had made the kingdom what it was today they might start wondering why if they didnt have a god they needed all these priests anything the point was well put by mazuma the high priest when he said after a while a vote was taken by nightfall the kingdoms leading stonemasons were at work on a new statue it was basically oblong with lots of legs the demon king drummed his fingers on his desk it wasnt that he was unhappy about the fate of quezovercoatl who would now have to spend several centuries in one of the nether hells while he grew a new corporeal body serve him right the ghastly little imp nor was it the broad trend of events on the pyramid after all the whole point of the wish business was to see to it that what the client got was exactly what he asked for and exactly what he didnt really want it was just that he didnt feel in control of things which was of course ridiculous if the best came to the best he could always materialise and sort things out personally but he liked people to believe that all the bad things happening to them were just fate and destiny it was one of the few things that cheered him up he turned back to the mirror after a while he had to adjust the temporal control one minute the breathless humid jungles of klatch the next i thought we were going back to my room eric complained i thought that too said rincewind shouting to be heard over the rumbling snap your fingers again demon not on your life theres plenty of places worse than this but its all hot and dark rincewind had to concede that it was also shaking and noisy when his eyes grew used to the blackness he could make out a few spots of light here and there whose dim radiance suggested that they were inside something like a boat there was a definite feel of carpentry about everything and a powerful smell of wood shavings and glue if it was a boat then it was having an awfully painful launching down a slipway greased with rocks a jolt slung him heavily against a bulkhead i must say complained eric if this is where the most beautiful woman lives i dont think much of her choice of boodwah youd think shed put a few cushions or something around the place boodwah said rincewind shes bound to have one said eric smugly ive read about em she reclines on it tell me said rincewind have you ever felt the need to have a cold bath and a brisk run around the playing fields never it could be worth a try the rumbling stopped abruptly there was a distant clanging noise such as might be made by a pair of great big gates being shut rincewind thought he heard some voices fading into the distance and a chuckle it wasnt a particularly pleasant chuckle it was more of a snigger and it boded no good for someone rincewind had a pretty good idea who hed stopped wondering how hed come to be here wherever it was malign forces that was probably it at least nothing particularly dreadful was happening to him right now probably it was only a matter of time he groped around a bit until his fingers encountered what turned out to be following an inspection by the light of the nearest knothole a rope ladder further probing at one end of the hull or whatever it was brought him in contact with a small round hatchway it was bolted on the inside he crawled back to eric theres a door he whispered where does it go it stays where it is i think said rincewind find out where it leads to demon could be a bad idea said rincewind cautiously get on with it rincewind crawled gloomily to the hatch and grasped the bolt the hatch creaked open down below quite a long way below there were damp cobblestones across which a breeze was driving a few shards of morning mist with a little sigh rincewind unrolled the ladder two minutes later they were standing in the gloom of what appeared to be a large plaza a few buildings showed through the mist where are we said eric search me you dont know not a clue said rincewind eric glared at the mistshrouded architecture fat chance of finding the most beautiful woman in the world in a dump like this he said it occurred to rincewind to see what they had just climbed out of he looked up above them a long way above them and supported on four massive legs which ran down to a huge wheeled platform there was undoubtedly a huge wooden horse more correctly the rear of a huge wooden horse the builder could have put the exit hatch in a more dignified place but for humorous reasons of his own had apparently decided not to er said rincewind someone coughed he looked down the evaporating mists now revealed a broad circle of armed men many of them grinning and all of them carrying massproduced soulless but above all sharp long spears ah said rincewind he looked back at the hatchway it said it all really the only thing i dont understand said the captain of the guard is why two of you we were expecting maybe a hundred he leaned back on his stool his great plumed helmet in his lap a pleased smile on his face honestly you ephebian he said talk about laugh you must think we was born yesterday all night nothing but sawing and hammering the next thing theres a damn great wooden horse outside the gates so i think thats funny a bloody great wooden horse with airholes thats the kind of little detail i notice see airholes so i muster all the lads and we nips out extra early and drag it in the gates as per expectations and then we bides quiet like around it waiting to see what it coughs up in a manner of speaking now he pushed his unshaven face close to rincewind youve got a choice see top seat or bottom seat its up to you i just have to put the word in you play discus with me and ill play discus with you what seat said rincewind reeling from the gusts of garlic its the war triremes said the sergeant cheerfully three seats see one above the other triremes you get chained to the oars for years see and its all according whether youre in the top seat up in the fresh air and that or the bottom seat where he grinned youre not so its down to you lads be cooperative and all youll need to worry about will be the seagulls now why only the two of you he leaned back again excuse me said eric is that tsort by any chance you wouldnt be trying to make fun of me would you now boy only theres such a thing as quinquiremes see you wouldnt like that at all no sir said eric if you please sir im just a little lad lead astray by bad companionship oh thank you said rincewind bitterly you just accidentally drew a lot of occult circles did you and sarge sarge a soldier burst into the guardroom the sergeant looked up theres another of em sarge right out side the gates this time the sergeant grinned triumphantly at rincewind oh thats it is it he said you were just the advance party come to open the gates or whatever right well just go and sort your friends out and well be right back he indicated the captives you stay here if they move do something horrible to them rincewind and eric were left alone with the guard you know what youve done dont you said eric youve only taken us all the way back to the tsortean wars thousands of years we did it at school the wooden horse everything how the beautiful elenor was kidnapped from the ephebians or maybe it was by the ephebians and there was this siege to get her back and everything he paused hey that means im going to meet her he paused again wow he said rincewind looked around the room it didnt look ancient but then it wouldnt because it wasnt yet everywhere in time was now once you were there or then he tried to remember what little he knew of classical history but it was just a confusion of battles oneeyed giants and women launching thousands of ships with their faces dont you see hissed eric his glasses aglow they must have brought the horse in before the soldiers had hidden in it we know whats going to happen we could make a fortune how exactly well the boy hesitated we could bet on horses sort of thing good idea said rincewind yes and all weve got to do is escape then find out if they have horse races here and then really try hard to remember the names of the horses that won races in tsort thousands of years ago they went back to looking glumly at the floor that was the thing about time travel you were never ready for it about the only thing he could hope for rincewind decided was finding da quirms fountain of youth and managing to stay alive for a few thousand years so hed be ready to kill his own grandfather which was the only aspect of time travel that had ever remotely appealed to him he had always felt that his ancestors had it coming to them funny thing though he could remember the famous wooden horse which had been used to trick a way into the fortified city he didnt remember anything about there being two of them there was something inevitable about the next thought that turned up excuse me he said to the guard this er this second wooden thing outside the gate its probably not a horse i expect well of course youd know that wouldnt you said the guard youre spies i bet its more oblong and sort of smaller said rincewind his face a picture of innocent enquiry you bet pretty unimaginative bastards arent you i see rincewind folded his hands on his lap try to escape said the guard go on just try it you try it and see what happens i expect your colleagues will be bringing it into the city rincewind went on they might do the guard conceded eric began to giggle it had just begun to dawn on the guard that there was a lot of shouting going on in the distance someone tried to blow a bugle but the notes gurgled into silence after a few bars bit of a fight going on out there by the sound of it said rincewind people winning their spurs doing heroic deeds of valour being noticed by superior officers that sort of thing and heres you hanging around in here with us ive got to stick to my post said the guard exactly the right attitude said rincewind never mind about everyone else out there fighting valiantly to defend their city and womenfolk against the foe you stop in here and guard us thats the spirit theyll probably put up a statue to you in the city square if theres one left he did his duty theyll write on it the soldier appeared to think about this and while he was doing so there was a terrible splintering creak from the direction of the main gates look he said desperately if i just pop out for a moment dont you worry about us said rincewind encouragingly its not even as if were armed right said the soldier thanks he gave rincewind a worried smile and hurried off in the direction of the noise eric looked at rincewind with something like admiration that was actually quite amazing he said going to go a long way that lad said rincewind a sound military thinker if ever i saw one come on lets run away where to rincewind sighed hed tried to make his basic philosophy clear time and again and people never got the message dont you worry about to he said in my experience that always takes care of itself the important word is away the captain raised his head cautiously over the barricade and snarled its just a box sergeant he snapped its not even as if it could hold one or two men beg pardon sir said the sergeant and his face was the face of a man whose world has changed a lot in a few short minutes it holds at least four sir corporal disuse and his squad sir i sent them out to open it sir are you drunk sergeant not yet sir said the sergeant with feeling little boxes dont eat people sergeant after that it got angry sir you can see what it did to the gates the captain peered over the broken timbers again i suppose it grew legs and walked over there did it he said sarcastically the sergeant broke into a relieved grin at last they seemed to be on the same wavelength got it in one sir he said legs hundreds of the little bleeders sir the captain glared at him the sergeant put on the poker face which has been handed down from nco to nco ever since one protoamphibian told another lowerranking protoamphibian to muster a squad of newts and take that beach the captain was eighteen and fresh from the academy where he had passed with flying colours in such subjects as classical tactics valedictory odes and military grammar the sergeant was fiftyfive and instead of an education he had spent about forty years attacking or being attacked by harpies humans cyclopses furies and horrible things on legs he felt put upon well im going to have a look at it sergeant not a good plan sir if i may and after ive had a look at it sergeant there is going to be trouble the sergeant threw him a salute right you are sir he predicted the captain snorted and climbed over the barricade towards the box which sat silent and unmoving in its circle of devastation the sergeant meanwhile slid into a sitting position behind the stoutest timber he could find and with determination pulled his helmet down hard over his ears rincewind crept through the streets of the city with eric tagging along behind are we going to find elenor the boy said no said rincewind firmly what were going to do is were going to find another way out and were going to go out through it thats not fair shes thousands of years older that you i mean attraction of the mature woman all right but itd never work out i demand that you take me to her wailed eric avaunt rincewind stopped so sharply that eric walked into him listen he said were in the middle of the most fatuous war there has ever been any minute now thousands of warriors will be locked in mortal combat and you want me to go and find this overrated female and say my friend wants to know if youll go out with him well i wont rincewind stalked up to another gateway in the city wall it was smaller that the main one didnt have any guards and had a wicket gate in it rincewind slid back the bolts this isnt anything to do with us he said we havent even been born yet were not old enough to fight it isnt our business and were not going to do anything more to upset the course of history all right he opened the door which saved the entire ephebian army a bit of effort they were just about to knock all day long the noise of battle raged this was chronicled by later historians who went on at length about beautiful women being kidnapped fleets being assembled wooden animals being constructed heroes fighting one another and completely failed to mention the part played by rincewind eric and the luggage the ephebians did notice however how enthusiastically the tsortean soldiery ran towards them not so much keen to get into battle as very anxious to get away from something else the historians also failed to note another interesting fact about ancient klatchian warfare which was that it was still at that stage quite primitive and just between soldiers and hadnt yet been thrown open to the general public basically everyone knew that one side or the other would win a few unlucky generals would get their heads chopped off large sums of money would be paid in tribute to the winners everyone would go home for the harvest and that bloody woman would have to make up her mind whose side she was on the hussy so tsortean street life went on more or less as normal with the citizens stepping around the occasional knots of fighting men or trying to sell them kebabs several of the more enterprising ones began to dismantle the wooden horse for souvenirs rincewind didnt attempt to understand it he sat down at a street cafй and watched a spirited battle take place between market stalls so that amid the cries of ripe olives there were the screams of the wounded and shouts of mind your backs please mкlйe coming through the hard part was watching the soldiers apologise when they bumped into customers the even harder part was getting the cafй owner to accept a coin bearing the head of someone whose greatgreatgreatgrand father wasnt born yet fortunately rincewind was able to persuade the man that the future was another country and a lemonade for the boy he added my parents let me drink wine said eric im allowed one glass i bet you are said rincewind the owner industriously swabbed the tabletop spreading its coating of dregs and spilt retsina into a thin varnish up for the fight are you he said in a manner of speaking said rincewind guardedly i shouldnt wander about too much said the owner they say a civilian let the ephebians in not that ive got anything against the ephebians a fine body of men he added hurriedly as a knot of soldiery jogged past a stranger they say thats cheating using civilians theres people out looking for him sos they can explain he made a chopping motion with his hand rincewind stared at the hand as though hypnotised eric opened his mouth eric screeched and clutched at his shins have they got a description rincewind said dont think so well best of luck to them said rincewind rather more cheerfully whats up with the lad cramp when the man had gone back behind his counter eric hissed you didnt have to kick me youre quite right it was an entirely voluntary act on my part a heavy hand dropped on to rincewinds shoulder he looked around and up into the face of an ephebian centurion a soldier beside him said thats the one sarge id bet a years salt whod of thought it said the sergeant he gave rincewind an evil grin up we come chummy the chief would like a word with you some talk of alexander and some of hercules of hector and lysander and such great names as these in fact throughout the history of the multiverse people have said nice things about every cauliflowereared swordswinger at least in their vicinity on the basis that it was a lot safer that way its funny how the people have always respected the kind of commander who comes up with strategies like i want fifty thousand of you chappies to rush at the enemy whereas the more thoughtful commanders who say things like why dont we build a damn great wooden horse and then nip in at the back date while theyre all round the thing waiting for us to come out are considered only one step above common oiks and not the kind of person youd lend money to this is because most of the first type of commanders are brave men whereas cowards make far better strategists rincewind was dragged before the ephebian leaders who had set up a command post in the citys main square so that they could oversee the storming of the central citadel which loomed over the city on its vertiginous hill they were not too close however because the defenders were dropping rocks they were discussing strategy when rincewind arrived the consensus seemed to be that if really large numbers of men were sent to storm the mountain then enough might survive the rocks to take the citadel this is essentially the basis of all military thinking several of the more impressively dressed chieftains glanced up when rincewind and eric approached gave them a look which suggested that maggots were more interesting and turned away again the only person who seemed to be pleased to see them didnt look like a soldier at all he had the armour which was tarnished and he had the helmet which looked as though its plume had been used as a paintbrush but he was skinny and had all the military bearing of a weasel there was something vaguely familiar about his face though rincewind thought it looked quite handsome pleased to see them was only a comparative description he was the only one who acknowledged their existence he was lounging in a chair and feeding the luggage with sandwiches oh hallo he said gloomily its you it was amazing how much information can be crammed in to a couple of words to achieve the same effect the man could have said its been a long night im having to organise everything from wooden horse building to the laundry rota these idiots are about as much help as a rubber hammer i never wanted to be here anyway and on top of all this theres you hallo you he indicated the luggage which opened its lid expectantly this yours he said sort of said rincewind guardedly i cant afford to pay for anything its done mind you funny little thing isnt it said the soldier we found it herding fifty tsorteans into a corner why was it doing that do you think rincewind thought quickly it has this amazing ability to know when people are thinking about harming me he said he glared at the luggage as one might glare at a sly eviltempered and generally reprehensible family pet who after years of biting visitors has rolled over on its scabby back and played as lovable puppy to impress the bailiffs yes said the man without much surprise magic is it yes something in the wood is it yes good job we didnt build the sodding horse out of it then yes got into it by magic did you yes thought so he threw another sandwich at the luggage where you from rincewind decided to come clean the future he said this didnt have the expected effect the man just nodded oh he said and then he said did we win yes oh i suppose you cant remember the results of any horse races said the man without much hope no i thought you probably wouldnt why did you open the gate for us it occurred to rincewind that saying it was because he had always been a firm admirer of the ephebian political position would not strangely enough be the right thing to do he decided to try the truth again it was a novel approach and worth experimenting with i was looking for a way out he said to run away yes good man only sensible thing in the circumstances he noticed eric who was staring at the other captains clustered around their table and deep in argument you lad he said want to be a soldier when you grow up no sir the man brightened a bit thats the stuff he said i want to be a eunuch sir eric added rincewinds head turned as though it was being dragged why he said and then came up with the obvious answer at the same as eric because you get to work in the harem all day long they chorused slowly the captain coughed youre not this boys teacher are you he said no do you think anyone has explained to him no perhaps it would be a good idea if i got one of the centurions to have a word youd be amazed at the grasp of language those chaps have got do him the power of good i expect said rincewind the soldier picked up his helmet sighed nodded at the sergeant and smoothed out the creases in his cloak it was a grubby cloak i think im expected to tell you off or something he said what for spoiling the war apparently spoiling the war the soldier sighed come on lets go for a stroll sergeant you and a couple of lads please a stone whistled down from the fort high above them and shattered they can hold out for bloody weeks up there said the soldier gloomily as they walked away with the luggage padding patiently behind them im lavaeolus whore you hes my demon said eric lavaeolus raised an eyebrow the closest he ever came to expressing surprise at anything is he i suppose it takes all sorts any good at getting into places is he hes more the gettingout kind said eric right said lavaeolus he stopped beside a building and walked up and down a bit with his hands in his pockets tapping on the flagstones with the toe of his sandal just here i think sergeant he said after a while right you are sir look at that lot will you said lavaeolus while the sergeant and his men started to lever up the stones that bunch around the table brave lads ill grant you but look at them too busy posing for triumphant statues and making sure the historians spell their names right bloody years weve been laying siege to this place more military they said you know they actually enjoy it i mean when alls said and done who cares lets just get it over with and go home thats what i say found it sir said the sergeant right lavaeolus didnt look round okay he rubbed his hands together lets sort this out and then we can get an early night would you care to accompany me your pet might be useful what are we going to do said rincewind suspiciously were just going to meet some people is it dangerous a stone smashed through the roof of a building nearby no not really said lavaeolus compared to staying here i mean and if the rest to them try to storm the place you know in a proper military way the hole led into a tunnel the tunnel after winding a bit led to stairs lavaeolus mooched along it occasionally kicking bits of fallen masonry as if he had a personal grudge against them er said rincewind where does this lead oh its just a secret passageway into the centre of this citadel you know i thought it would be something like that said rincewind ive got an instinct for it you know and i expect all the really top tsorteans will be up there will they i hope so said lavaeolus trudging up the steps with lots of guards dozens i imagine highly trained too lavaeolus nodded the best and this is where were going said rincewind determined to explore the full horror of the plan as one probes the site of a rotting tooth thats right all six of us and your box of course oh yes said rincewind making a face in the darkness the sergeant tapped him gently on the shoulder and leaned forward dont you worry about the captain sir he said hes got the finest military brain on the continent how do you know has anyone ever seen it said rincewind you see sir what it is he likes to get it over with without anyone getting hurt sir especially him thats why he dreams up things like the horse sir and bribing people and that we got into civvies last night and come in and got drunk in a pub with one of the palace cleaners see and found out about this tunnel yes but secret passages said rincewind therell be guards and everything at the other end no sir they use it to store the cleaning things sir there was a clang in the darkness ahead of them lavaeolus had tripped over a mop sergeant sir just open the door will you eric was tugging at rincewinds robe what said rincewind testily you know who lavaeolus is dont you whispered eric well hes lavaeolus get away dont you know the classics that isnt one of these horse race were supposed to remember is it eric rolled his eyes lavaeolus was responsible for the fall of tsort on account of being so cunning he said and then afterwards it took him ten years to get home and he had all sorts of adventures with temptresses and sirens and sensual witches well i can see why youve been studying him ten years eh where did he live about two hundred miles away said eric earnestly kept getting lost did he and when he got home he fought his wifes suitors and everything and his dear dog recognised him and died oh dear it was the carrying his slippers in its mouth for fifteen years that killed it off shame and you know what demon all this hasnt happened yet we could save him all that trouble rincewind thought about this we could tell him to get a better navigator for a start he said there was a creak the soldiers had got the door open everyone fall in or whatever the bloody stupid command is said lavaeolus the magic box to the front please no killing anyone unless its really necessary try not to damage things right forward the door led into a columnlined corridor there was the distant murmur of voices the troop crept towards the sound until it reached a heavy curtain lavaeolus took a deep breath pushed it aside and stepped forward and launched into a prepared speech now i want to make myself absolutely clear he said i dont want there to be any unpleasantness of any kind or any shouting for guards and so forth or indeed any shouting at all we will just take the young lady and go home which is where anyone of any sense ought to be otherwise i shall really have to put everyone to the sword and i hate having to do things like that the audience to this statement did not appear to be impressed this was because it was a small child on a potty lavaeolus changed mental gear and went on smoothly on the other hand if you dont tell me where everyone is i shall ask the sergeant here to give you a really hard smack the child took its thumb out of its mouth mummy is seeing to cassie it said are you mr beekle i dont think so said lavaeolus mr beekle is a silly the child withdrew its thumb and with the air of one concluding some exhaustive research added mr beekle is a poo sergeant sir guard this child yessir corporal sarge take care of the kid yes sarge private archeios yes corp said the soldier his voice gloomy with prescience see to the sprog private archeios looked around there was only rincewind and eric left and while it was true that a civilian was in every respect the lowest possible rank there was coming somewhere after the regimental donkey the expressions on their faces suggested that they werent about to take any orders lavaeolus wandered across the room and listened at another curtain we could tell him all kinds of stuff about his future hissed eric he had i mean he will have all kinds of things happen to him shipwrecks and magic and all his crew turned into animals and stuff like that yes we could say walk home said rincewind the curtain swished aside there was a woman there plump goodlooking in a slightly faded way wearing a black dress and the beginnings of a moustache a number of children of varying sizes were trying to hide behind her rincewind counted at least seven of them whos that said eric ahem said rincewind i rather think its elenor of tsort dont be silly whispered eric she looks like a mum elenor was much younger and was all his voice gave out and he made several wavy motions with his hand indicative of the shape of a woman who would probably be unable to keep her balance rincewind tried not to catch the sergeants eye yes he said going a bit red well you see er youre absolutely right but well its been a long siege hasnt it what with one thing and another i dont see what thats got to do with it said eric sternly the classics never said anything about children they said she spent all her time mooning around the towers of tsort and pining for her lost love well yes i expect she did pine a bit said rincewind only you know you can only pine so much and it must have been a bit chilly up on those towers you can catch your death mooning nodded the sergeant lavaeolus watched the woman thoughtfully then he bowed i expect you know why were here my lady he said if you touch any of the children i shall scream said elenor flatly once again lavaeolus showed that along with his guerilla abilities was a marked reluctance to waste a prepared speech once he had it all sorted out in his head fair maiden he began we have faced many dangers in order to rescue you and take you back to your loved his voice faltered ones er this has all gone terribly wrong hasnt it i cant help it said elenor the siege seemed to go on for such a long time and king mausoleum was very kind and i never liked it much in ephebe anyway where is everyone now the tsorteans i mean apart from you theyre all out on the battlements throwing rocks if you must know lavaeolus flung up his hands in desperation couldnt you you know have slipped us a note or something or invited us to one of the christenings you all seemed to be enjoying yourselves so much she said lavaeolus turned and shrugged gloomily all right he said fine qed no problem i wanted to leave home and spend ten years sitting in a swamp with a bunch of meatheaded morons it wasnt as if i had anything important to do back home just a little kingdom to rule that sort of thing okay well then we might as well be off im sure i dont know how i shall break it to everyone he said bitterly they were having such fun theyll probably have a bloody great banquet and laugh about it and get drunk itd be their style he looked at rincewind and eric you might as well tell me what happens next he said im sure you know um said rincewind the city burns down said eric especially the topless towers i didnt get to see them he added sulkily who did it their lot or our lot said lavaeolus your lot i think said eric lavaeolus sighed sounds like them he said he turned to elenor our lot that is my lot are going to burn down the city he said it sounds very heroic its just the kind of thing they go for it might be a good idea to come with us bring the kids make it a day out for all the family why dont you eric pulled rincewinds ear towards his mouth this is a joke isnt it he said shes not really the fair elenor youre just having me on its always the same with these hotblooded types said rincewind they definitely go downhill at thirtyfive its the pasta that does it said the sergeant but i read where she was the most beautiful ah well said the sergeant if youre going to go around reading the thing is said rincewind quickly its what they call dramatic necessity noones going to be interested in a war fought over a a quite pleasant lady moderately attractive in a good light are they eric was nearly in tears but it said her face launched a thousand ships thats what you call a metaphor said rincewind lying the sergeant explained kindly anyway you shouldnt believe everything you read in the classics rincewind added they never check their facts theyre just out to sell legends lavaeolus meanwhile was deep in argument with elenor all right all right he said stay here if you like why should i care come on you lot were going what are you doing private archeios im being a horse sir explained the soldier hes mr poo said the child who was wearing private archaios helmet well when youve finished being a horse find us an oil lamp i caught my knees a right wallop in that tunnel flames roared over tsort the entire hubward sky was red rincewind and eric watched from a rock down by the beach theyre not topless towers anyway said eric after a while i can see the tops i think they meant the toppleless towers rincewind hazarded as another one collapsed redhot into the ruins of the city and that was wrong too they watched in silence for a while longer and the eric said funny that the way you tripped over the luggage and dropped the lamp and everything yes said rincewind shortly makes you think history is always going to find a way to work itself out yes good though the way your luggage rescued everyone yes funny to see all those kids riding on its back yes everyone seems quite pleased about it the opposing armies were at any rate noone was bothered to ask the civilians whose views on warfare were never reliable among the soldiery at least among the soldiery of a certain rank there was a lot of backslapping and telling of anecdotes jovial exchanging of shields and a general consensus that what with the fires and sieges and armadas and wooden horses and everything it had been a jolly good war the sound of singing echoed across the winedark sea hark at them said lavaeolus emerging from the gloom around the beached ephebian ships itll be fifteen choruses of the ball of philodelphus next you mark my words lot of idiots with their brains in their jockstraps he sat down on the rock bastards he said with feeling do you think elenor will be able to explain it all to her boyfriend said eric i imagine so said lavaeolus they usually can she did get married and shes got lots of children said eric lavaeolus shrugged a moments wild passion he said he gave rincewind a sharp look hey you demon he said id like a quiet word if i may he led rincewind towards the boats pacing heavily across the damp sand as if there was a lot on weighing on his mind im going home tonight on the tide he said no sense in hanging about here what with the war being over and everything good idea if theres one thing i hate its sea voyages said lavaeolus he gave the nearest boat a kick its all idiots striding around and shouting you know pull this lower that avast the other and i get seasick too its heights with me said rincewind sympathetically lavaeolus kicked the boat again obviously wrestling with some big emotional problem the thing is he said wretchedly you wouldnt happen to know if i get home all right would you what its only a few hundred miles it shouldnt take too long should it said lavaeolus radiating anxiety like a lighthouse oh rincewind looked at the mans face ten years he thought and all kinds of weird stuff with winged wossnames and seamonsters on the other hand would it do him any good to know you get home okay he said youre well known for it in fact theres whole legends about you going home phew lavaeolus leaned against a hull took off his helmet and wiped his forehead thats a load off my mind ill tell you i was afraid the gods might have a grudge against me rincewind said nothing they get a bit angry if you go around thinking up ideas like wooden horses and tunnels said lavaeolus theyre traditionalists you know they prefer people just to hack at one another i thought you see that if i could show people how to get what they wanted more easily theyd stop being so bloody stupid from further along the shoreline came the sound of male voices raised in song vestal virgins came down from heliodeliphilodelphiboschromenos and when the ball was over there were it never works said rincewind its got to be worth a try though hasnt it oh yes lavaeolus slapped him on the back cheer up he said things can only get better they walked out into the dark breakers where lavaeolus ship was riding at anchor and rincewind watched him swim out and climb aboard after a while the oars were shipped or unshipped or whatever they called it when they were stuck through the holes in the sides and the boat moved slowly out into the bay a few voices floated back over the surf point the pointed end that way sergeant aye aye sir and dont shout did i tell you to shout why do you all have to shout now im going downstairs for a lie down rincewind trudged back up the beach the trouble is he said is that things never get better they just say the same only more so but hes going to have enough to worry about behind him eric blew his nose that was the saddest thing ive ever heard he said from further along the beach the ephebian and tsortean armies were still in full voice around their convivial campfires the village harpy she was there come on said rincewind lets go home you know the funny thing about his name said eric as they strolled along the sand no what do you mean lavaeolus means rinser of winds rincewind looked at him hes my ancestor he said who knows said eric oh gosh rincewind thought about this well i whish id told him to avoid getting married or visiting ankhmorpork it probably isnt even built yet rincewind tried snapping his fingers this time it worked astfgl sat back he wondered what did happen to lavaeolus gods and demons being creatures outside of time dont move in it like bubbles in the stream everything happens at the same time for them this should mean they know everything that is going to happen because in a sense it already has the reason they dont is that reality is a big place with a lot of interesting things going on and keeping track of all of them is like trying to use a very big video recorder with no freeze button or tape counter its usually easier just to wait and see one day hed have to go and look right here and now insofar as the words can be employed about an outside of space and time matters were not progressing well eric seemed marginally more likeable which wasnt acceptable he also appeared to have changed the course of history although this is impossible since the only thing you can do to the course of history is facilitate it what was needed was something climactic something really souldestroying the demon king realised he was twirling his moustaches the trouble with snapping your fingers is that you never knew what it would lead to everything around rincewind was black it wasnt simply an absence of colour it was a darkness that flatly denied any possibility that colour might ever have existed his feet werent touching anything and he appeared to be floating there was something else missing he couldnt quite put his finger on it are you there eric he ventured a clear voice nearby said yes are you there demon yeess where are we are we falling i dont think so said rincewind speaking from experience theres no rushing wind you get a rushing wind when youre falling also your past life flashes before your eyes and i havent seen anything i recognise yet rincewind yes when i open my mouth no sounds come out dont be rincewind hesitated he wasnt making any sound either he knew what he was saying it just wasnt reaching the outside world but he could hear eric perhaps the words just gave up on his ears and went straight to his brains its probably some kind of magic or something he said theres no air thats why there no sound all the little bits of air sort of knock together like marbles thats how you get sound you know is it gosh so were surrounded by absolutely nothing said rincewind total nothing he hesitated theres a word for it he said its what you get when theres nothing left and everythings been used up yes i think its called the bill said eric rincewind gave this some thought it sounded about right okay he said the bill thats where we are floating in absolute bill total complete rockhard bill astfgl was going frantic now he had spells that could find anyone anywhere anywhen and they werent anywhere one minute he was watching them on the beach the next nothing that left only two other places fortunately he chose the wrong one first even some stars would be nice said eric theres something very odd about all this said rincewind i mean do you feel cold no well do you feel warm no i dont feel anything much really no hot no cold no light no heat no air said rincewind just bill how long have we been here dont know seems like ages but aha im not sure theres any time either not what youd call proper time just the kind of time people make up as they go along well i didnt expect to see anybody else here said a voice by rincewinds ear it was a slightly putupon voice a voice made for complaining in but at least there was no hint of menace rincewind let himself float around a little ratfaced man was sitting crosslegged watching him with vague suspicion he had a pencil behind one ear ah hallo said rincewind and where is here exactly nowhere swhole point innit nowhere at all not yet all right said eric when is it going to be somewhere hard to say said the little man looking at the pair of you and taking one thing with another metabolic rates and that id say that this place is due to become somewhere in well give or take a bit in about five hundred seconds he began to unwrap the pack in his lap fancy a sandwich while were waiting what would i at this point rincewinds stomach aware that if his brain was allowed to make the running it was in danger of losing the initiative cut in and prompted him to say what sort search me what sort would you like it to be sorry dont mess about just say what sort youd like it to be oh rincewind stared at him well if youve got egg and cress let there be egg and cress sort of thing said the little man he reached into the package and proffered a white triangle to rincewind gosh said rincewind what a coincidence it should be starting any minute now said the little man over not that theyve got any proper directions sorted out yet of course not them there all i can see is darkness said eric no you cant said the little man triumphantly youre just seeing what there is before the darkness has been installed sort of thing he gave the notyetdarkness a dirty look come on he said why are we waiting whyeye are we waiting waiting for what said rincewind everything everything what said rincewind everything not everything what everything sort of thing astfgl peered through the swirling gas clouds at least he was in the right place the whole point about the end of the universe was that you couldnt go past it accidentally the last few embers winked out time and space collided silently and collapsed astfgl coughed it can get so very lonely when youre twenty million light years from home anyone there he said yes the voice was right by his ear even demon kings can shiver apart from you i mean he said have you seen anybody yes who everyone astfgl sighed i mean anyone recently its been very quiet said death damn were you expecting someone else i thought there might be someone called rincewind but astfgl began deaths eyesockets flared red the wizard he said no hes a dem astfgl stopped for what would have been several seconds had time still existed he floated in a state of horrible suspicion a human he growled it is stretching the term a little but you are broadly correct well ill be damned astfgl said i believe you already are the demon king extended a shaking hand his mounting fury was overridding his sense of style his red silk gloves ripped as the talons unfolded and then because its never a good idea to get on the wrong side of anyone with a scythe astfgl said sorry youve been troubled and vanished only when he judged himself out of deaths extremely acute hearing did he scream his rage nothingness uncoiled its interminable length through the draughty spaces at the end of time death waited after a while his skeletal fingers began to drum on the handle of his scythe darkness lapped around him there wasnt even any infinity any more he attempted to whistle a few snatches of unpopular songs between his teeth but the sound was simply sucked into nothingness forever was over all the sands had fallen the great race between entropy and energy had been run and the favourite had been the winner after all perhaps he ought to sharpen the blade again no not much point really great roils of absolutely nothing stretched into what would have been called the distance if there had been a spacetime reference frame to give words like distance any sensible meaning any more there didnt seem to be much to do perhaps its time to call it a day he thought death turned to go but just as he did so he heard the faintest of noises it was to sound what one photon is to light so weak and feeble that it would have passed entirely unheard in the din of an operating universe it was a tiny piece of matter popping into existence death stalked over to the point of arrival and watched carefully it was a paperclip well it was a start there was another pop which left a small white shirtbutton spinning gently in the vacuum death relaxed a little of course it was going to take some time there was going to be an interlude before all this got complicated enough to produce gas clouds galaxies planets and continents let alone tiny corkscrewshaped things wiggling around in slimy pools and wondering whether evolution was worth all the bother of growing fins and legs and things but it indicated the start of an unstoppable trend all he had to do was be patient and he was good at that pretty soon thered be living creatures developing like mad running and laughing in the new sunlight growing tired growing old death sat back he could wait whenever they needed him hed be there the universe came into being any createdagain cosmogonist will tell you that all the interesting stuff happened in the firs couple of minutes when nothingness bunched together to form space and time and lots of really tiny black holes appeared and so on after that they say it became just a matter of well matter it was basically all over bar the microwave radiation seen from close by though it had a certain gaudy attraction the little man sniffed too showy he said you dont need all that noise it could just as easily have been a big hiss or a bit of music could it said rincewind yeah and it looked pretty iffy around the two picosecond mark definitely a bit of ropey fillingin but thats how it goes these days no craftsmanship when i was a lad it took days to make a universe you could take pride in it now they just throw it together and its back on the lorry and away and you know what no said rincewind weakly they pinches stuff off the site they finds someone nearby who wants to expand their universe a bit next thing you know theyve had it away with a bunch of firmament and flogged it for an extension somewhere rincewind stared at him who are you the man took the pencil from behind his ear and looked reflectively at the space around rincewind i makes things he said what sort of things what sort of things would you like youre the creator the little man looked very embarrassed not the not the just a i dont contract for the big stuff the stars the gas giants the pulsars and so on i just specialise in what you might call the bespoke trade he gave them a look of defiant pride i do all my own trees you know he confided craftsmanship takes years to learn how to make a tree even the conifers oh said rincewind i dont get someone in to finish them off no subcontracting thats my motto the buggers always keep you hanging about while theyre installing stars or something for someone else the little man sighed you know people think it must all be very easy creating they think you just have to move on the face of the waters and wave your hands a bit its not like that at all it isnt the little man scratched his nose again you soon run out of ides for snowflakes for example oh you start thinking itd be a doddle to sneak in a few identical ones you do you think to yourself theres a billion trillion squillion of them noones going to notice but thats where professionalism comes in sort of thing it does some people and here the creator looked sharply at the unformed matter still streaming past think its enough to install a few basic physical formulas and then take the money and run a billion years later you got leaks all over the sky black holes the size of your head and when you pray up to complain theres just a girl on the counter who says she dont know where the boss is i think people appreciate the personal touch dont you ah said rincewind so when people get struck by lightning er its not just because of all that stuff about electrical discharges and high points and everything er you actually mean it oh not me i dont run the things its a big enough job just building em you cant expect me to operate them as well theres a load of other universes you know he added a slight note of accusation in his voice got a list of jobs as long as your arm he reached underneath him and produced a large leatherbound book which he had apparently been sitting on it opened with a creak rincewind felt a tugging at his robe look said eric this isnt really him is it he says it is said rincewind what are we doing here i dont know the creator glared at him a little quiet there please he said but listen hissed eric if he really is the creator of the world that sandwich is a religious relic gosh said rincewind weakly he hadnt eaten for ages he wondered what the penalty was for eating a venerated object it was probably severe you could put it in a temple somewhere and millions of people would come to look at it rincewind cautiously levered up the top slice of bread its got no mayonnaise in it he said will that still count the creator cleared his throat and began to read aloud astfgl surfed across the entropy slope an angry red spark against the swirls of interspace he was so angry now that the last vestiges of selfcontrol were slipping away his jaunty cap with its stylish hornlets had become a mere wisp of crimson dangling from the tip of one of the great coiled ramshorns that framed his skull with a rather sensuous ripping noise the red silk across his back tore open and his wings unfolded they are conventionally represented as leathery but leather wouldnt survive more than a few seconds in that environment besides it doesnt fold up very well these wings were made of magnetism and shaped space and spread out until they were a faint curtain against the incandescent firmament and they beat as slowly as the rise of civilisations they still looked batlike but that was just for the sake of tradition somewhere around the th millennium he was overtaken quite without noticing by something small and oblong and probably even angrier than he was eight spells go to make up the world rincewind knew that well enough he knew that the book which contained them was the octavo because it still existed in the library of the unseen university currently inside a welded iron box at the bottom of a speciallydug shaft where its magical radiations could be kept under control rincewind had wondered how it had all started hed imagined a sort of explosion in reverse with interstellar gases roaring together to form great atuin or at least a roll of thunder or something instead there was a faint musical twang and where the discworld hadnt been there the discworld was as if it had always been hiding somewhere the whole time he also realised that the feeling of falling he had so recently learned to live with was one he was probably going to die with too as the world appeared beneath him it brought this aeons special offer gravity available in a choice of strengths from your nearest massive planetary body he said as so often happens on these occasions aargh the creator still sitting serenely in midair appeared beside him as he plummeted nice clouds dont you think done a good job on the clouds he said aargh rincewind repeated something the matter aargh thats humans for you said the creator always rushing off somewhere he leaned closer its not up to me of course but ive often wondered what it is that goes through your heads its going to be my feet in a minute screamed rincewind eric falling alongside him tugged at his ankle thats not the way to talk to the creator of the universe he shouted just tell him to do something make the ground soft or something o i dunno if i could do that said the creator its causality regulations id have the inspector down on me like a ton of a ton of a ton of weight he added i could probably knock you up a really spongy bog or quicksands very popular at the moment i could do you a complete quicksand with marsh and swamp en suite no problem said rincewind youre going to have to speak up a bit im sorry wait a moment there was another harmonious twanging noise when rincewind opened his eyes he was standing on a beach so was eric the creator floated nearby there was no rushing wind he hadnt go so much as a bruise i just wedged a thingy in the velocities and positions said the creator noticing his expression now what was it you were saying i rather wanted to stop plunging to my death said rincewind oh good glad thats sorted out then the creator looked around distractedly you havent seen my book around have you i thought i had it in my hand when i started he sighed lose me own head next i done a whole world once and completely left out the fingles not one of the buggers couldnt get em at the time told myself i could nip back when they were in stock completely forgot imagine that noone spotted it of course because obviously they just evolved there and they didnt know there ought to be fingles but it was definitely causing them deep you know psychological problems deep down inside they could tell there was something missing sort of thing the creator pulled himself together anyway i cant hang about all day he said like i said ive got a lot of jobs on lots said eric i thought there was only one oh no theres masses of them said the creator beginning to fade away thats quantum mechanics for you see you dont do it once and have done no they keep on branching off multiple choice they call it its like painting the painting the painting something very big that you have to keep on painting sort of thing its all very well saying you just have to change one little detail but which one thats the real bugger well nice to have met you if you need any extra work you know an extra moon or something hey the creator reappeared his eyebrows raised in polite surprise what happens now said rincewind now well i imagine therell be some gods along soon they dont wait long to move in you know like flies around a flies around a like flies they tend to be a bit highspirited to start with but they soon settle down i suppose they take care of all the people ekcetra the creator leaned forward ive never been good at doing people never seem to get the arms and legs right he vanished they waited i think hes really gone this time said eric after a while what a nice man you certainly understand a lot more about why the world is like it is after talking to him said rincewind whatre quantum mechanics i dont know people who repair quantums i suppose rincewind looked at the egg and cress sandwich still in his hand there was still no mayonnaise in it and the bread was soggy but it would be thousands of years before there was another one there had to be the dawn of agriculture the domestication of animals the evolution of the breadknife from its primitive flint ancestry the development of dairy technology and if there was any desire to make a proper job of it the cultivation of olive trees pepper plants salt pans vinegar fermentation processes and the techniques of elementary food chemistry before the world would see another on like it it was unique a little white triangle full of anachronisms lost and all alone in an unfriendly world he bit it anyway it wasnt very nice what i dont understand said eric is why we are here i take it that isnt a philosophical question said rincewind i take it you mean why are we here at the dawn of creation on this beach which has hardly been used yes thats what i meant rincewind sat down on a rock and sighed i think its pretty obvious isnt it he said you wanted to live forever i didnt say anything about travelling in time said eric i was very clear about it so thered be no tricks there isnt a trick the wish is trying to be helpful i mean its pretty obvious when you think about it forever means the entire span of space and time forever for ever see you mean you have to sort of start at square one precisely but thats no good its going to be years before theres anyone else around centuries corrected rincewind gloomily millennia iains and then theres going to be all kinds of wars and monsters and stuff most of history is pretty appalling when you look hard at it or even not very hard but what i meant was i just wanted to go on living for ever from now said eric frantically i mean from then i mean look at this place no girls no people nothing to do on saturday nights it wont even have any saturday nights for thousands of years said rincewind just nights you must take me back at once said eric i order it avaunt you say that one more time and i will give you a thick ear said rincewind but all you have to do is snap your fingers it wont work youve had your three wishes sorry what shall i do well if you see anything crawl out of the sea and try to breathe you could try telling it not to bother you think this is funny dont you it is rather amusing since you mention it said rincewind his face expressionless the jokes going to be wearing pretty thin over the years then said eric what well youre not going to go anywhere are you youll have to stay with me nonsense ill rincewind looked around desperately ill what he thought the waves rolled peacefully up the beach not very strongly at the moment because they were still feeling their way the first high tide was coming in cautiously there was no tideline no streaky line of old seaweed and shells to give it some idea of what was expected of it the air had the clean fresh smell of air that has yet to know the effusions of a forest floor or the ins and outs of a ruminants digestive system rincewind had grown up in ankhmorpork he liked air that had been around a bit had got to know people had been lived in weve got to get back he said urgently thats what ive been saying said eric with strained patience rincewind took another bite of the sandwich hed looked death in the face many times or more precisely death had looked him in the back of his rapidlyretreating head many times and suddenly the prospect of living forever didnt appeal there were of course great questions he might learn the answer to such as how life evolved and all the rest of it but looked at as a way of spending all your spare time for the next infinity it wasnt a patch on a quiet evening strolling through the streets of ankh still hed acquired an ancestor that was something not everyone had an ancestor what would his ancestor have done in a situation like this he wouldnt have been here well yes of course but apart from that he would have he would have used his fine military mind to consider the tools available thats what he would have done he had item one halfeaten egg and cress sandwich no help there he threw it away he had item himself he drew a tick in the sand he wasnt certain what use he could be but he could come back to that later he had item eric thirteenyearold demonologist and acne attack ground zero that seemed to be about it he stared at the clean fresh sand for a while doodling in it then he said quietly eric come here a moment the waves were a lot stronger now they had really got the hang of the tide thing and were venturing a little ebb and flow astfgl materialised in a puff of blue smoke aha he said but this fell rather flat because there was noone to hear it he looked down there were footprints in the sand hundreds of them they ran backwards and forwards as if something had been frantically searching and then vanished he leaned nearer it was hard to make out what with all the footprints and the effects of the wind and the tide but just on the edge of the encroaching surf were the unmistakable signs of a magic circle astfgl said a swearword that fused the sand around him into glass and vanished the tide got on with things further down the beach the last surge poured into a hollow in the rocks and the new sun beamed down on the soaking remains of a halfeaten egg and cress sandwich tidal action turned it over thousands of bacteria suddenly found themselves in the midst of a taste explosion and started to breed like mad if only there had been some mayonnaise life might have turned out a whole lot different more piquant and perhaps with a little extra cream in it travelling by magic always had major drawbacks there was the feeling that your stomach was lagging behind and your mind filled up with terror because the destination was always a little uncertain it wasnt that you could come out anywhere anywhere represented a very restricted range of choices compared to the kind of places magic could transport you to the actual travelling was easy it was achieving a destination which for example allowed you to survive in all four dimensions at once that took the real effort in fact the scope for error was so huge it seemed something of an anticlimax to emerge in a fairly ordinary sandyfloored cavern it contained on the far wall a door there was a forbidding door it looked as though its designer had studied all the cell doors he could find and had then gone away and produced a version for as it were full visual orchestra it was more of a portal some ancient and probably fearful warning was etched over its crumbling arch but it was destined to remain unread because over it someone else had pasted a bright redandwhite notice which read you dont have to be damned to work here but it helps rincewind squinted up at the notice of course i can read it he said i just dont happen to believe it multiple exclamation marks he went on shaking his head are a sure sign of a diseased mind he looked behind him the glowing outlines of erics magic circle faded and winked out im not being picky you understand he said its just that i thought you said you could get us back to ankh this isnt ankh i can tell by the little details like the flickering red shadows and the distant screaming in ankh the screaming is usually much closer he added i think i did very well to get it to work at all said eric bridling youre not supposed to be able to run magic circles in reverse in theory it means you stay in the circle and reality moves around you i think i did very well you see he added his voice suddenly vibrating with enthusiasm if you rewrite the source codex and this is the difficult bit you route it through a highlevel yes yes very clever what will you people think of next said rincewind the only thing is were i think its quite possible that were in hell oh erics lack of reaction made rincewind curious you know he added the place with all the demons in it oh not a good place to be its generally felt said rincewind rincewind thought about this he wasnt when you got right down to it quite sure what it was that demons did to you but he did know what humans did to you and after a lifetime in ankhmorpork this place could turn out to be an improvement warmer at any rate he looked at the doorknocker it was black and horrible but that didnt matter because it was also tied up so that it couldnt be used beside it with all the signs of being installed recently by someone who didnt know what they were doing and didnt want to do it was a button set into the splintered woodwork rincewind gave it an experimental prod the sound it produced might once have been a popular tune possibly even one written by a skilled composer to whom had been vouchsafed for a brief ecstatic moment the music of the spheres now however it just went bingbongdingdong and it would be a lazy use of language to say that the thing that answered the door was a nightmare nightmares are usually rather daft things and its very hard to explain to a listener what was so dreadful about your socks coming alive or giant carrots jumping out of hedgerows this thing was the kind of terrifying thing that could only be created by someone sitting down and thinking horrible thoughts very clearly it had more tentacles than legs but fewer arms than heads it also had a badge the badge said my name is urglefloggah spawn of the pit and loathly guardian of the dread portal how may i help you it was not very happy about this yes it rasped rincewind was still reading the badge how may you help us he said aghast urglefloggah who bore a certain resemblance to the late quezovercoatl ground some of its teeth hi there it intoned in the manner of one who has had the script patiently explained to him by someone with a redhot branding iron my name is urglefloggah spawn of the pit and i am your host for today may i be the first to welcome you to our luxuriouslyappointed hang on a moment said rincewind chosen for your convenience urglefloggah rumbled theres something not right here said rincewind full regard for the wishes of you the consumer the demon continued stoically excuse me said rincewind as pleasurable as possible said urglefloggah it made a noise like a sigh of relief from somewhere deep in its mandibles now it appeared listening for the first time yes what it said where are we said rincewind various mouths beamed quail mortals what were in a bird grovel and cower mortals the demon corrected itself for you are condemned to everlast it paused and gave a little whimper there will be a brief period of corrective therapy it corrected itself again spitting out each word which we hope to make as instructive and enjoyable as possible with due regard to all the rights of you the customer it eyed rincewind with several eyes dreadful isnt it it said in a more normal voice dont blame me if it was up to me it would be the old burning thingys up the whatsit toot sweet this is hell isnt it said eric ive seen pictures youre right there said the demon mournfully it sat down or at least folded itself in some complicated way personal service thats what it used to be people used to feel that we were taking an interest that they werent just numbers but well victims we had a tradition of service fat lot he cares but what am i telling you my troubles for its not as if you havent got plenty of your own what with being dead and being here youre not musicians are you actually were not even dea rincewind began the demon ignored him but got up and began to plod ponderously down the dank corridor beckoning them to follow youd really hate it here if you was musicians hate it more i mean the walls play music all day long well he calls it music ive got nothing against a good tune mark you something to scream along with but this isnt it i mean i heard where were supposed to all the best tunes so whyve we got all this stuff that sounds like someone turned on the piano and then walked away and left it in point of fact and then theres the potted plants dont get me wrong i like to see a bit of green around the place only some of the lads says these plants arent real but what i say is they must be noone in their right mind would make a plant that looks like dark green leather and smells like a dead sloth he says it gives the place a friendly and open aspect friendly and open aspect ive seen keen gardeners break down and cry im telling you they said it made everything we did to them afterwards seem like an improvement dead is not what we said rincewind trying to hammer the words into a gap in the things endless monotone but he was too late the coffee machine now the coffee machines a good one ill grant you we only used to drown people in lakes of cats pee wee didnt make them buy it by the cup were not dead eric shouted urglefloggah came to a quivering halt of course youre dead it said else you wouldnt be here they wouldnt last five minutes it opened several of its mouths showing a choice of fangs hur hur it added if i was to catch any live people down here not for nothing had rincewind survived for years in the paranoid complexities of unseen university he felt almost at home his reflexes operated with incredible precision you mean you werent told he said it was hard to see if urglefloggahs expression changed if only because it was hard to know what part of it was expression but it definitely projected a familiar air of sudden and resentful uncertainty told what it said rincewind looked at eric youd think theyd tell people wouldnt you tell them wh argarg said eric clutching his ankle thats modern management for you said rincewind his face radiating angry concern they go ahead and make all these changes all these new arrangements and do they consult the very people who form the backbone exoskeleton corrected the demon or other calcareous or chitinous structure of the organisation rincewind finished smoothly he waited for what he knew would have to come not them said urglefloggah too busy sticking up notices they are i think thats pretty disgusting said rincewind dyou know said urglefloggah they wouldnt let me on the club holiday said i was too old said i would spoil the fun whats the netherworld coming to said rincewind sympathetically they never come down here you know said the demon sagging a bit they never tell me anything oh yes very important only keeping the bloody gate most important i dont think look said rincewind you wouldnt like me to have a word would you down here all hours seeing em in perhaps if we spoke to someone said rincewind the demon sniffed from several noses at once would you it said be happy to said rincewind urglefloggah brightened a little but not too much just in case cant do any harm can it it said rincewind steeled himself and patted the thing on what he hoped fervently was its back dont you worry about it he said thats very kind of you rincewind looked across the shuddering heap at eric wed better go he said so were not late for our appointment he made frantic signals over the demons head eric grinned yeah right appointment he said they walked up the wide passage eric started to giggle hysterically this is where we run right he said this is where we walk said rincewind just walk the important ting is to act nonchalant the important thing is to get the timing right he looked at eric eric looked at him behind them urglefloggah made a kind of ivejustworkeditout noise about now said eric about now i think would do it yes they ran hell wasnt what rincewind had been led to expect although there were signs of what it might once have been a few clinkers in a corner a bad scorch mark on the ceiling it was hot though with the kind of heat that you get by boiling air inside an oven for years hell it has been suggested is other people this has always come as a bit of a surprise to many working demons who had always thought hell was sticking sharp things into people and pushing them into lakes of blood and so on this is because demons like most people have failed to distinguish between the body and the soul the fact was that as droves of demon kings had noticed there was a limit to what you could do to a soul with eg redhot tweezers because even fairly evil and corrupt souls were bright enough to realise that since they didnt have the concomitant body and nerve endings attached to them there was no real reason other than force of habit why they should suffer excruciating agony so they didnt demons went on doing it anyway because numb and mindless stupidity is part of what being a demon is all about but since noone was suffering they didnt enjoy it much either and the whole thing was pointless centuries and centuries of pointlessness astfgl had adopted without realising what he was doing a radically new approach demons can move interdimensionally and so hed found the basic ingredients for a very worthwhile lake of blood equivalent as it were for the soul learn from humans hed told the demon lords learn from humans its amazing what you can learn from humans you take for example a certain type of hotel it is probably an english version of an american hotel but operated with that peculiarly english genius for taking something american and subtracting from it its one worthwhile aspect so that you end up with slow fast food west country and western music and well this hotel its early closing day the bar is really just a pastelpink paneled table with a silly bucket on it set in one corner and it wont be open for hours yet and then you add rain and let the one channel available on the tv be perhaps welsh channel four showing its usual mobius eisteddfod from pantygyrdl and there is only one book in this hotel left behind by a previous victim it is one of those where the name of the author is on the front in raised gold letters much bigger than the tittle and it probably has a rose and a bullet on there too half the pages are missing and the only cinema in the town is showing something with subtitles and french umbrellas in it and then you stop time but not experience so that it seems as though the very fluff in the carpet is gradually rising up to fill the brain and your mouth starts to taste like an old denture and you make it last for ever and ever thats even longer than from now to opening time and then you distil it of course the discworld lacks a number of the items listed above but boredom is universal and astfgl had achieved in hell a particularly high brand of boredom which is like the boredom you get which is a costing you money and b is taking place while you should be having a nice time the caverns that opened before rincewind were full of mist and tasteful room dividers now and again screams of ennui rose from between the pot plants but mainly there was the terrible numbing silence of the human brain being reduced to cream cheese from the inside out i dont understand said eric where are the furnaces where are the flames where he added hopefully are the succubi rincewind peered at the nearest exhibit a disconsolate demon whose badge proclaimed it to be azaremoth the stench of dog breath and moreover hoped the reader would have a nice day was sitting on the edge of a shallow pit wherein lay a rock on which a man was chained and spreadeagled a very tiredlooking bird was perched beside him rincewind thought that erics had it bad but this bird had definitely been through the mangle of life it looked as though it had been plucked first and then had its feathers stuck back on curiosity overcame rincewinds usual cowardice whats going on he said whats happening to him the demon stopped kicking his heels on the edge of the pit it didnt occur to it to question rincewinds presence it assumed that he wouldnt be here unless he had a right to be the alternative was unbelievable i dont know what he done it said but when i first come here his punishment was to be chained to that rock and every day an eagle would come down and peck his liver out bit of an old favourite that one it doesnt look as though its attacking him now said rincewind nah thats all changed now it flies down every day and tells him about its hernia operation now its effective ill grant you said the demon sadly but its not what id call torture rincewind turned away but not before catching a glimpse of the look of terminal agony on the victims face it was terrible there was worse however in the next pit several chained and groaning people were being shown a series of paintings a demon in front of them was reading from a script this is when we were in the fifth circle only you cant see where we stayed it was just off to the left there and this is that funny couple we met youd never believe it they lived on the icy plains of doom just next door to eric looked at rincewind its showing them pictures of itself on holiday he said they both shrugged and walked away shaking their heads then there was a small hill at the bottom of the hill there was a round rock beside the rock sat a manacled man his despairing head buried in his hands a squat green demon stood beside him almost buckling under the weight of an enormous book ive heard of this one said eric man who went and defied the gods or something got to keep pushing that rock up the hill even though it rolls back all the time the demon looked up but first it trilled he must listen to the unhealthy and unsafety regulations governing the lifting and moving of large objects volume of the commentaries in fact the regulations themselves comprised a further volumes part that is rincewind had always liked boredom treasuring it if only because of its rarity value it had always seemed to him that the only times in his life when he wasnt being chased imprisoned or hit were when he was being dropped from things and while falling a long way always had a certain sameness about it it did not really count as boring the only time he could look back on with a certain amount of fondness was his brief spell as assistant librarian at unseen university when there wasnt much to do except read books make sure the librarians banana supply wasnt interrupted and rarely help him with a particularly recalcitrant grimoire now he realised what made boredom so attractive it was the knowledge that worse things dangerously exciting things were going on just around the corner and that you were well out of them for boredom to be enjoyable there had to be something to compare it with whereas this was just boredom on top of more boredom winding in on itself until it became a great crushing sledgehammer which paralysed all thought and experience and pounded eternity into something like flannel this is dreadful he said the chained man raised a haggard face youre telling me he said i used to like pushing the ball up the hill you could stop for a chat you could see what was going on you could try various holds and everything i was a bit of a tourist attraction people used to point me out i wouldnt say it was fun but it gave you a purpose in the afterlife and i used to help him said the demon its voice raw with sullen indignation give you a bit of a hand sometimes didnt i pass on a bit of gossip and that sort of encourage him when it rolled back and that id say things like whoops there goes the bleeder again and hed say bugger it we had some times dint we great times it blew its nose rincewind coughed sgetting too much said the demon we used to be happy in the old days it wasnt as if it used to hurt anyone much and well we was all in it together thats it said the chained man you knew if you kept your nose clean youd stand a chance of getting out one day you know once a week now i have to stop this for craft lessons that must be nice said rincewind uncertainly the mans eyes narrowed basketwork he said i been here eighteen millennia demon and imp grumbled the demon i learned my trade i did eighteen thousand bloody years behind the pitchfork and now this reading a a sonic boom echoed the length of hell oi oi said the demon hes back he sounds angry too wed better get our heads down and indeed all over the circles of hades demons and damned were groaning in unison and getting back to their private hells the chained man broke into a sweat look vizzimuth he said couldnt we just sort of miss out one or two of paragraphs its my job said the demon wretchedly you know he checks up its more than my jobs worth he broke off gave rincewind a sad grimace and patted the sobbing figure with a gentle talon tell you what he said kindly ill skip some of the subclauses rincewind took eric by an unresisting shoulder wed better get along he said quietly this is really horrible said eric as they walked away it gives evil a bad name um said rincewind he didnt like the sound of him being back and him being angry whenever something important enough to deserve capital letters was angry in the vicinity of rincewind it was usually angry with him if you know such a lot about this place he said perhaps you can remember how to get out eric scratched his head it helps if one of you is a girl he said according to ephebian mythology theres a girl who comes down here every winter to keep warm i think the story says she actually creates the winter sort of ive known women like that said rincewind nodding wisely or it helps if youve got a lyre i think ah we could be on firmer ground here said rincewind he thought for a bit and then said er my dog my dog has six legs the kind you play said eric patiently oh and and and when you do leave if you look back i think pomegranates come into it somewhere or or or you turn into a piece of wood i never look back said rincewind firmly one of the first rules of running away is never look back there was a roar behind them especially when you hear loud noises rincewind went on when it comes to cowardice thats what sorts out the men from the sheep you run straight away he grabbed the skirts of his robe and they ran and ran until a familiar voice said ho there dear lads hop up its amazing how you meet old friends down here and another voice said wossname wossname where are they the sublords of hell trembled this was going to be dreadful it might even result in a memo they cant have escaped rasped astfgl theyre here somewhere why can you not find them am i surrounded by incompetents as well as fools my lord the demon princes turned the speaker was duke vassenego one of the oldest demons how old noone knew but if he didnt actually invent original sin at least he made one of the first copies in terms of sheer enterprise and deviousness of mind he might even have passed for human and in fact generally took the form of an old rather sad lawyer with an eagle somewhere in his ancestry and every demonic mind thought poor vassenego hes done it this time this wont be just a memo this will be a policy statement ccd to all departments and a copy for files astfgl turned slowly as though mounted on a turntable he was back in his preferred form now but had pulled himself together as it were on a higher level of emotion the mere thought of living humans in his domain made him twang with fury like a violin string you couldnt trust them they were unreliable the last human allowed down here alive had given the place a terribly bad press above all they made him feel inferior now the full wattage of his anger focused on the old demon you had a point to make he said i was merely going to say lord that we have made an extensive search of all eight circles and i am really certain silence dont think i dont know whats going on growled astfgl circling the drawn figure ive seen you and you and you his trident pointed at some of the other lords plotting in corners encouraging rebellion i rule here is that not so and i will be obeyed vassenego was pale his patrician nostrils flared like jet intakes everything about him said you pompous little creature of course we encourage rebellion were demons and i was maddening the minds of princes when you were encouraging cats to leave dead mice under the bed you smallminded paperworshipping nincompoop everything about him said this except his voice which said calmly noone is denying this sire then search again and the demon who let them in is to be taken to the lowest pit and disassembled is that clear vassenegos eyebrows rose old urglefloggah sire he was foolish certainly but he is loyal are you by any chance endeavouring to contradict me vassenego hesitated dreadful as he privately held the king to be demons are strong believers in precedence and hierarchy there were too many young demons pressing below them for the senior lords to openly demonstrate the ways of regicide and coup no matter what the provocation vassenego had plans of his own no sense in spoiling things now no sire he said but that will mean sire that the dread portal is no longer do it the luggage arrived at the dread portal there was no way to describe how angry you can get running nearly twice the length of the spacetime continuum and the luggage had been pretty annoyed to start with it looked at the hinges it looked at the locks it backed away a bit and appeared to read the new sign over the portal possibly this made it angrier although with the luggage there wasnt any reliable way of telling because it spent all its time beyond in a manner of speaking the hostility event horizon the doors of hell were ancient it wasnt just time and heat that had baked their wood to something like black granite theyd picked up fear and dull evil they were more than mere things to fill a hole in the wall they were bright enough to be dimly aware what their future was likely to hold they watched the luggage shuffle back across the sand flex its legs and crouch down the lock clicked the bolts dragged themselves back hurriedly the great bars jerked from their sockets the doors flung themselves back against the wall the luggage untensed it straightened it stepped forward it almost strutted it passed between the straining hinges and when it was nearly through turned and gave the nearest door a damn good kick there was a great treadmill it didnt power anything and had particularly creaky bearings it was one of astfgls more inspired ideas and had no use whatsoever except to show several hundred people that if they had thought their lives had been pretty pointless they hadnt seen anything yet we cant stay here for ever said rincewind we need to do things like eat thats one of the tremendous advantages of being a damned soul said ponce da quirm all the old bodily cares fade away of course you get a completely new set of cares but i have always found it advisable to look for the silver lining wossname said the parrot who was sitting on his shoulder fancy that said rincewind i never knew animals could go to hell although i can quite see why they made an exception in this case up yours wizard why dont they look for us here thats what i dont understand said eric shut up and keep walking said rincewind theyre stupid thats why they cant imagine that we would be doing something like this yes theyre right there i cant imagine that we are doing something like this either said eric rincewind treadled for a bit watching a crowd of frantically searching demons hurry past so you didnt find the fountain of youth then he said feeling that he should make some conversation oh but i did said da quirm earnestly a clear spring deep in the jungle it was very impressive i had a good long drink too or draught which i think is the more appropriate word and said rincewind it definitely worked yes for a while there i could definitely feel myself younger but rincewind waved a vague hand to take in da quirm the treadmill the towering circles of the pit ah said the old man of course thats the really annoying bit id read so much about the fountain and youd have thought someone in all those books would have mentioned the really vital thing about the water wouldnt you which was boil it first says it all doesnt it terrible shame really the luggage trotted down the great spiral road that linked the circles of the pit even if conditions had been normal it probably would not have attracted much attention if anything it was rather less astonishing than most of the denizens this is really boring said eric thats the point said rincewind we shouldnt be lurking here we should be trying to find a way out well yes but there isnt one there is in fact said a voice behind rincewind it was the voice of someone who had seen it all and hadnt liked any of it very much lavaeolus said rincewind his ancestor was right behind them youll get home all right said lavaeolus bitterly your very words huh ten years of one damn thing after another you might have told a chap er said eric we didnt want to upset the course of history you didnt want to upset the course of history said lavaeolus slowly he stared down at the woodwork of the treadmill oh good that makes it all right i feel a lot better for knowing that speaking as the course of history id like to say thank you very much excuse me said rincewind yes you said theres another way out oh yes a back way where is it lavaeolus stopped treadling for a moment and pointed across the misty hollow see that arch over there rincewind peered into the distance just about he said is that it yes a long steep climb dont know where it comes out though how did you find out about it lavaeolus shrugged i asked a demon he said theres always an easier way of doing everything you know itd take forever to get there said eric its right on the other side wed never make it rincewind nodded and glumly continued the endless walk after a few minutes he said has it struck you we seem to be going faster eric turned around the luggage had stepped aboard and was trying to catch up with them astfgl stood in front of his mirror show me what they can see he commanded yes master astfgl inspected the whirring image for a moment tell me what this means he said im just a mirror master what do i know astfgl growled and im lord of hades he said gesturing with his trident and im prepared to risk another seven years bad luck the mirror considered the available options i might be able to hear some creaking lord it ventured and i smell smoke no smoke i specifically banned all open fires a very oldfashioned concept it gave the place a bad name nevertheless master show me hades the mirror gave of its best the king was just in time to see the treadwheel its bearings glowing red hot crash down from its mountings and roll as deceptively slowly as an avalanche across the country of the damned rincewind hung from the pushbar watching the rungs whirr past at a speed that would have burned the soles off his sandals if hed bee foolish enough to let his feet down the dead however were taking it all with the cheerful aplomb of those who know that the worst has already happened to them cries of pass the candyfloss drifted down he heard lavaeolus commending the wheels splendid traction and explaining to da quirm how if you had a vehicle which put down its road in front of it just like the luggage was in fact doing and then you covered it with armour then wars would be less bloody over in half the time and everyone could spend even longer going home the luggage made no comment at all it could see its master hanging a few feet away and just kept going it may have occurred to it that the journey was taking some time but that was times problem and so flinging out the occasional screaming soul bumping and gyrating and crushing the occasional luckless demon the wheel bowled on it smashed against the opposite cliff lord vassenego smiled now he said it is time the other senior demons looked a bit shifty they were of course steeped in evil and astfgl was definitely not one of us and the most revolting little oik ever to oil his way into the post but well this perhaps there were some things that were too learn from the ways of humans mimicked vassenego he bade me learn from humans me the impudence the arrogance but i watched oh yes i learned i planned the look on his face was unspeakable even the lords of the nethermost circles who gloried in villainy had to turn their heads duke drazometh the putrid raised a hesitant talon but if he even suspects he said i mean he has a foul temper on him those memos he shuddered but what are we doing vassenego spread his hands in a gesture of innocence where is the harm in it brothers i ask you where is the harm his fingers curled the knuckles shone white under the thin blueveined skin as he surveyed the doubting faces or would you rather receive another statement of policy he said expressions twitched as the lords made up their minds like a row of dominoes falling over there were some things on which even they were united no more policy statements no more consultative documents no more moraleboosting messages to all staff this was hell but you had to draw the line somewhere earl beezlemoth rubbed one of his three noses and humans somewhere thought this up all by themselves he said we didnt give them any you know hints vassenego shook his head all their own work he said proudly like a fond schoolmaster who has just seen a star pupil graduate summa cum laude the earl stared into infinity i thought we were supposed to be the ghastly ones he said his voice filled with awe the old lord nodded hed waited a long time for this while others had talked of redhot revolution hed just stared out into the world of men and watched and marvelled this rincewind character had been extremely useful hed managed to keep the king totally occupied hed been worth all the effort the damnfool human still thought it was his fingers doing the business three wishes indeed and thus it was when rincewind pulled himself free of the wreckage of the wheel he found astfgl king of demon lord of hell master of the pit standing over him astfgl had passed through the earlier stage of fury and was now in that calm lagoon of rage where the voice is steady the manner is measured and polite and only a faint trace of spittle at the corner of the mouth betrays the inner inferno eric crawled out from under a broken spar and looked up oh dear he said the demon king twirled the trident suddenly it didnt look comical any more it looked like a heavy metal stick with three horrible spikes on the end astfgl smiled and looked around no he said apparently to himself not here it is not public enough come a hand grasped each of them by the shoulder they could no more resist it than a couple of nonidentical snowflakes could resist a flamethrower there was a moments disorientation and rincewind found himself in the largest room in the universe it was the great hall you could have built moon rockets in it the kings of hell might have heard of words like subtlety and discretion but they had also heard that if you had it you should flaunt it and reasoned that if you didnt have it you should flaunt it even more and what they didnt have was good taste astfgl had done what he could but even he had been unable to add much to the basic bad design the clashing colours and the terrible wallpaper hed put in a few coffee tables and a bullfight poster but they were more or less lost in the overall chaos and the new antimacassar on the back of the throne of dread only served to highlight some of its more annoying basreliefs the two humans sprawled on the floor and now said astfgl but his voice was lost in a sudden cheering he looked up demons of every size and shape filled almost all the hall piling up the walls and even hanging from the ceiling a demonic band struck up a choice of chords on a variety of instruments a banner slung from one side of the hall to the other read hale to ther cheve astfgls brow knitted in instant paranoia as vassenego trailed by the other lords bore down on him the old demons face was split in a totally guileless grin and the king nearly panicked and hit it with the trident before vassenego reached out and slapped him on the back well done he cried what oh very well done astfgl looked down at rincewind oh he said yes well he coughed it was nothing he said straightening up i knew you people werent getting anywhere so i just not these sneered vassenego such trivial things no sire i was referring to your elevation elevation said astfgl your promotion sire a great cheer went up from the younger demons who would cheer anything promotion but but i am the king astfgl protested weakly he could feel his grasp on events beginning to slip pfooie said vassenego expansively pfooie indeed sire king king sire i speak for us all when i say that is no title for a demon such as you sire a demon whose grasp of organisational matters and priorities whose insight into the proper functions of our being whose if i may say so sheer intellectual capabilities have taken us to new and greater depths sire despite himself astfgl preened well you know he began and yet we find despite your position that you interest yourself in the tiniest details of our work said vassenego looking down his nose at rincewind such dedication such devotion astfgl swelled of course ive always felt rincewind pulled himself up on his elbows and thought look out behind you and so said vassenego beaming like a coastful of lighthouses the council met and has decided and may i add sire has decided unanimously to create an entirely new award in honour of your outstanding achievements the importance of proper paperwork has what award said astfgl the minnows of suspicion suddenly darting across the oceans of selfesteem the position sire of supreme life president of hell the band struck up again with your own office much bigger than the pokey thing you have had to suffer all these years sire or rather mr president the band had a go at another chord the demons waited will there be potted plants said astfgl slowly hosts plantations jungles astfgl appeared to be lit by a gentle inner glow and carpets i mean wall to wall the walls have had to be moved apart especially to accommodate them all sire and think pile sire whole tribes of pygmies are wondering why the light stays on at night sire the bewildered king allowed himself to have an expansive arm thrown across his shoulder and was gently led all thoughts of vengeance forgotten through the cheering crowds ive always fancied one of those special things for making coffee he murmured as the last vestiges of selfcontrol were eroded a positive manufactory has been installed sire and a speaking tube sire for you to communicate your instructions to your underlings and the very latest in diaries two aeons to a page and a thing for coloured marker pens ive always held that complete rainbows sire vassenego boomed and let us go there without delay sire for i suspect that with your normal keen insight you cannot wait to get to grips with the mighty tasks ahead of you sire certainly certainly time they were done indeed an expression of vague perplexity passed across astfgls flushed face these mighty tasks nothing less than a complete full authoritative searching and indepth analysis of our role function priorities and goals sire vassenego stood back the demon lords held their breath astfgl frowned the universe appeared to slow down the stars halted momentarily in their courses with forward planning he said at last a top priority sire which you have instantly pinpointed with your normal incisiveness said vassenego quickly the demon lords breathed again astfgls chest expanded several inches i shall need special staff of course in order to formulate formulate the very thing said vassenego who was perhaps getting just a bit carried away astfgl gave him a faintly suspicious glance but at that moment the band struck up again the last words that rincewind heard as the king was led out of the hall were and in order to analyse information i shall need and then he was gone the rest of the demons aware that the entertainment seemed to be over for the day started to mill around and drift out of the green doors it was beginning to dawn on the brightest of them that the fires would soon be roaring again noone seemed to be taking any notice of the two humans rincewind tugged at erics robe this is where we run right said eric where we walk said rincewind firmly nonchalantly calmly and er fast you pick things up quickly dont you it is essential that the proper use of three wishes should bring happiness to the greatest available number of people and this is what in fact had happened the tezumen were happy when no amount of worshipping caused the luggage to come back and trample their enemies they poisoned all their priests and tried enlightened atheism instead which still meant they could kill as many people as they liked but didnt have to get up so early to do it the people of tsort and ephebe were happy at least the ones who write and feature in the dramas of history were happy which is all that mattered now their long war was over and they could get on with the proper concern of civilised nations which is to prepare for the next one the people of hell were happy or at least happier than hitherto the flames were flickering brightly again the same old familiar tortures were being inflicted on ethereal bodies quite incapable of feeling them and the damned had been given the insight which makes hardship easier to bear the absolute and certain knowledge that things could be worse the demon lords were happy they stood around the magic mirror enjoying a celebratory drink occasionally one of them would risk slapping vassenego on the back shall we let them go sire said a duke peering at the climbing figures in the mirrors dark image oh i think so said vassenego airily its always a good thing to let a few tales spread you know pour encouragy le poor encoura to make everyone sit up and take notice and they have been useful after their fashion he looked into the depths of his drink exulting quietly and yet and yet in the depths of his curly mind he thought he could hear the tiny voice that would grow louder over the years the voice that haunts all demon kings everywhere look out behind you it is hard to say whether the luggage was happy or not it had viciously attacked fourteen demons so far and had three of them cornered in their own pit of boiling oil soon it would have to follow its master but it didnt have to rush one of the demons made a frantic grab for the bank the luggage stamped heavily on its fingers the creator of universes was happy hed just inserted one sevensided snowflake into a blizzard as an experiment and noone had noticed tomorrow he was halfinclined to try small delicatelycrystallised letters of the alphabet alphabet snow it could be a winner rincewind and eric were happy i can see blue sky said eric where do you think well come out he added and when anywhere said rincewind anytime he looked down at the broad steps they were climbing they were something of a novelty each one was built out of large stone letters the one he was just stepping on to for example read i meant it for the best the next one was i thought youd like it eric was standing on for the sake of the children weird isnt it he said why do it like this i think theyre meant to be good intentions said rincewind this was a road to hell and demons were after all traditionalists and while they are of course irredeemably evil they are not always bad and so rincewind stepped off we are equal opportunity employers and through a wall which healed up behind him and into the world it could he had to admit have been a lot worse president astfgl sitting in a pool of light in his huge dark office blew into the speaking tube again hallo he said hallo there didnt seem to be anyone answering strange he picked up one of his coloured pens and looked around at the stack of work behind him all those records to be analysed considered assessed and evaluated and then suitable management directives to be arrived at and an indepth policy document to be drafted and then after due consideration redrafted again he tried the tube once more hallo hallo noone there still not to worry lots to do his time was far too important to waste he sank his feet into his thick warm carpet he looked proudly at his plotted plants he tapped a complicated assembly of chromed wire and balls which began to swing and click executively he unscrewed the top of his pen with a firm decisive hand he wrote what business are we in he thought for a bit and then carefully wrote underneath we are in the damnation business and this too was happiness of a sort just erotic nothing kinky its the difference between using a feather and using a chicken it took thirty years to subside the inhabitants spent a lot of the time wading it went down in history as the multiverses most embarrassing continental catastrophe old tom was the single cracked bronze bell in the university bell tower the clapper dropped out shortly after it was cast but the bell still tolled out some tremendously sonorous silences every hour the bursar was referring obliquely to the difficult occasion when the university very nearly caused the end of the world and would in fact have done so had it not been for a chain of events involving rincewind a magic carpet and a halfbrick in a sock the whole affair was very embarrassing to wizards as it always is to people who find out afterwards that they were on the wrong side all along and it was remarkable how many of the universitys senior staff were now adamant that at the time they had been off sick visiting their aunt or doing research with the door locked while humming loudly and had had no idea of what was going on outside there had been some desultory talk about putting a statue up to rincewind but by the curious alchemy that tends to apply in these sensitive issues this quickly became a plaque then a note on the roll of honour and finally a motion of censure for being improperly dressed demons and their hell are quite different from the dungeon dimensions those endless parallel wastelands outside space and time the sad mad things in the dungeon dimensions have no understanding of the world but simply crave light and shape and try to warm themselves by the fires of reality clustering around it with about the same effect if they ever broke through as an ocean trying to warm itself around a candle whereas demons belong to the same spacetime wossname more or less as humans and have a deep and abiding interest in humanitys daytoday affairs interestingly enough the gods of the disc have never bothered much about judging the souls of the dead and so people only go to hell if thats where they deserve to go which they wont do if they dont know about it this explains why it is important to shoot missionaries on sight demons have a distorted sense of values rincewind had been told that death was just like going into another room the difference is when you shout wheres my clean socks noone answers this is because wiring plugs putting up shelves sorting out the funny noise in attics and mowing lawns can eventually reduce even the strongest constitution from a distance it did anyway close to no ball games were unknown in the discworld at this time many people think it should have been a hydrogen molecule but this is against the observed facts everyone who has found a hitherto unknown eggwhisk jamming an innocent kitchen drawer knows that raw matter is continually flowing into the universe in fairly developed forms popping into existence normally in ashtrays vases and glove compartments it chooses its shape to allay suspicion and common manifestations are paperclips the pins out of shirt packaging the little keys for central heating radiators marbles bits of crayon mysterious sections of herbchopping devices and old kate bush albums why matter does this is unclear but it is evident that matter has plans it is also apparent that creators sometimes favour the big bang method of universe construction and at other times use the more gentle methods of continual creation this follows studies by cosmotherapists which have revealed that the violence of the big bang can give a universe serious psychological problems when it gets older
