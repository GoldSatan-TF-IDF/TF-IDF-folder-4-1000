betrayal adjustment massacre to love and be loved sacrifice food refugees welcome hell planet when will it end violation of trust female mystique pirate treasure the final raid salvation editorial epilog editorial preface there have been many biographies of the socalled tyrant of jupiter and countless analyses of the supposed virtues and vices of his character he was after all the most remarkable figure of his generation as even his enemies concede and will no doubt be ranked with the other prime movers or disturbers of history such as alexander caesar attila genghis khan napoleon hitler and the like but his personal model was asoka who was also called a tyrant in his day though he may have been the finest ruler the subcontinent of india earth ever had it is virtually certain however that neither the inimical nor the sanitized references adequately describe the real man now that the tyrant of jupiter is dead his voluminous private papers have been released to researchers these reveal some phenomenal secrets confirming both the best and worst aspects of his reputation it turns out to be true for example that this man was personally responsible for the deaths of between fifty and a hundred human beings before he was sixteen years old and thousands more thereafterbut still it is not fair to call him a coldblooded mass murderer it is also true that there were many women in his life including several temporary wives or mistressesthe distinction becomes obscure in some casesbut not that he was promiscuous the legal name of the tyrant was hope hubris literally reflecting the hope his family had for him he was of hispanic origin and the name hope was at that time an unusual appellation for a male of his culture it is perhaps a measure of his impact that it is so no more he was throughout his life literate in two languages and able to speak others he was in any language always possessed of that particular genius of expression any leader needs hope hubris was charged with many terrible things and his seeming unwillingness to deny or clarify many of these charges appeared to lend credence to them it was said that he watched his father being murdered without lifting a hand that he sold his sisters into sexual slavery that he permitted his mother to practice prostitution in his sight and that he killed his first girl friend in order to save himself he was also accused of practicing incest and cannibalism of trafficking in illegal drugs and of being a coward about heights there is an element of truth in all these charges but appreciation of their full context goes far to exonerate him as he himself wrote we did what we had to how can that be wrong hope was fallible in the fashion of his kind especially during his truncated youth but he did possess a single and singular skill and there was a certain greatness in him his early and savage if limited experience in leadership was to serve him excellently later in life as tyrant he seldom repeated his mistakes remember too that he suffered tribulations such as few survive how pretty do we really expect the survivors of holocaust to be the tyrant was not a bad man this assessment is well documented by the series of autobiographical manuscripts he left each written with disarmingly complete candor it seems fitting that the final word on his nature be his own the intelligence and literacy of young hope hubris who wrote at age fifteen in a secondary language is manifest coupled with a quaint naпvetй of experience this is however no juvenile narration herewith edited only for clarification of occasional obscurities and for separation and titling of episodes but otherwise uncensored is the earliest of these five major documents editorially titled refugee hmh chapter rape of the bubble jupiter orbit the shell of the bubble was opaque for it had to be thick and solid to contain the pressure of air and to insulate against the cold of empty space but there were portholes multiply glazed tunnels that offered views outside and naturally i was interested the view really wasnt much jupiter the colossus of the system dominated as it always did about the apparent size of my outstretched fist its turbulent cloudcurrents and great red eye were looking right back at me the planet was almost fullface right now because the sun was behind us our progress toward the planet was so slow that the disk seemed hardly larger than it had been when we started three days before but giant jove was always impressive however distant and whatever the phase ship ahoy our temporary navigator cried i didnt know whether this was standard space procedure but it was good enough for us who were less experienced than the rankest of amateurs a ship excitement rippled through the refugees massed in the bubble what could this mean soon we all saw it through the portholes a somewhat bloated barrel with attachments of course streamlining was not needed in space and a tub like this one was never intended to land on any significant solid body still i felt a certain disappointment perhaps i had been spoiled by all those dramatic holographs of the jupiter space navy in action with needlesleek missileships homing in on decoy drones and exploding with instant fireballs i had always known that real spacecraft were not like that and yet my mental picture remained shaped by the jupe publicity ads the ship overhauled us readily for it had chemical jets to boost its gravity shields it closed on us and its blunt nose clanged against our access port with a jolt that shook us all what was it up to i turned to discover my big sister faith immediately behind me she was absolutely beautiful in her excitement though as always i pretended not to notice i had the chore of staying near her during this voyage to discourage mischief faith attracted men the way garbage draws flies in the incredible films of old earthperhaps it would be kinder to say the way flowers draw beespartly because no man had touched her we latins place importance on that sort of thing i understand there are other cultures that dont who are they faith asked maybe traders i answered feeling a mild burgeoning of importance in the expressing of such an opinion but i felt a slow clutch of apprehension we were refugees we had nothing to trade in any event we were powerless to oppose their boarding our bubble had only one weak propulsive jet we were virtually freefloating in space our main physical motivation was the selected gravity of jupiter and the forces of inertia we could not have performed an evasive maneuver had we known how the entry ports could be operated from either side this was to prevent anyone from being trapped outside our competence was such that this was a necessary safety feature but it did leave us open to boarding by any craft that chose to do so the seal was made and the port opened making an open window to the other craft there were of course safety features to prevent the lock opening both doors simultaneously when the pressure was unequal but the normal air pressure of the ship did equalize it in space safety had to be balanced by convenience it would have been awkward to transfer any quantity of freight from one vessel to another if one panel of the air lock always had to be sealed a burly bearded man appeared garbed in soiled yellow pantaloons a black shirt and a bright red sash he needed no space suit of course the merged air lock mechanism made exit into the vacuum of space unnecessary most striking was his headdress a kind of broad split hat like that of the classical buccaneers there is a lot of conscious imitation of the past so archaic costumes are not unusual buccaneers i had been uneasy before now i was scared i was aware that not all of those who emulated buccaneers in costume were playing innocent games some took the part more seriously particularly in this region of the system weve got to hide faith i said in our natural spanish the translation of course is not perfect and neither is my memory allowance must be made her clear brow furrowed why hope she asked i want to meet the traders maybe they have soap she had been unable to wash her luxuriant tresses and so she fretted it was the way of pretty girls theyre not traders i snapped come on she frowned she was three years older than i and did not like taking orders from me i could hardly blame her for that but i really feared the trouble that could come if my suspicion was correct i took her by the arm and drew her along with me but you said she protested as she moved it was already too late for several more brutish men had crowded through the open port and they were armed with clubs and knives line up here on the main floor their leader cried i found it mildly anomalous that he did not use the proper term deck maybe he did not consider our little bubble to be a true spacecraft the refugees looked at our navigator who seemed to be the most likely authority in a situation like this he looked suddenly tired i think we must do as they say he said they are armed and we are not stay back i whispered to faith stand behind me try toyou knowmake yourself inconspicuous oh no she breathed she had a very feminine way of expressing herself even when under stress she had the business of being pretty down virtually to a science you dont think i think theyre pirates i said trying to speak without moving my lips as i faced the intruders so they wouldnt know i was talking theyre going to rob us i hoped that would be the limit of it we moved slowly to merge with the mass of people forming on the designated portion of the deck fortunately the bubbles spin was high at the moment so there was enough centrifugal gravity to hold us firm our concentration at this spot did cause the bubble to wobble slightly however now im called the horse because of the way i smell the redsashed leader said i run this party thats about all you need to know about me just do what i say and no one will be hurt too much he chuckled but none of us saw any humor in this we were frightened the pirates spread out around the bubble around the curve of the deck poking into things the leader and several others attended to the refugees all right come on up here you the horse said beckoning an older man what the man asked in spanish startled the pirate leaped and grabbed him by the arm hauling him roughly forward move he shouted the man recovered his balance nonplussed but seсor horse deliberately yet almost carelessly the pirate struck him on the head backhanded it was no token blow the man cried out and fell to the deck a trace of blood showed on his lip as he put one hand to his face check him the horse said brusquely two others stepped up hauled the old man to his feet and searched him roughly they found his wallet and a small bag of golden coins his fortune they dumped these in a central box and threw him to the side i think the violence upset him and us more than the actual robbery did we were plainly unprepared for this you the horse said pointing to a middleaged woman she screamed and shrank back into the crowd but he was too quick for her he caught her by the shoulder and dragged her into the open strip he ordered horrified unmoving she stared at him the horse did not repeat his order he gestured to the two assistant pirates they grabbed the woman and literally ripped the clothing from her body shaking it so that all objects in her pockets fell to the deck these were mostly feminine articles a comb a mirror a vial of perfume and a small change purse the pirates took the change and cast her aside naked and sobbing now the pirates eye fell on faith my effort to conceal her had been unsuccessful there were too many of the intruders scattered around the bubble also the curve of the deck meant that those of us who stood behind the group actually were more visible than those near the center because the curve had the effect of elevating us heres something better than money he exclaimed beckoning her faith shrank away of course my father shoved his way out of the crowd she has nothing he cried one of the peripheral pirates strode forward to intercept my father another went after faith my father was not a man of violence but he could not tolerate abuse of his children he raised one fist in warning as he met the pirate it was not that he wanted to fight but that he had to give some signal that the limit of our tolerance had been approached even confused refugees could only be pushed so far the pirate drew his curved sword get back another refugee cried catching my father by his other arm and drawing him back into the throng the pirate satisfied by this act of retreat scowled and did not pursue meanwhile the other pirate reached faith who now stood close beside me no longer protesting my leadership he caught her by the elbow she screamedand i launched myself at the man i caught him in a clumsy tackle about the legs making him stumble this brought a feeling of dйjа vu to me the sensation of having been here before my mind is like that i make odd connections at the least convenient times a teacher once told me that it is a sign of creativity that can be useful if properly harnessed i had tackled a man before rescuing my sister a fist like a block of icerock clubbed me on the ear there is a peculiar agony to the injured ear my very brain seemed to shake inside my skull the pirate had knocked me down with the same almost careless contempt the horse had applied to the old man it was as effective i sat up my ear seeing red stars for a moment i was disorganized not doing more than hurting and watching the pirate hauled faith into the open she screamed again and wrenched herself away her blouse tore leaving a shred in the mans grip he cursed in the manner of his kind and lunged for her again i scrambled up and launched myself at him a second time this time i didnt tackle i butted the man was leaning toward me reaching for faith i brushed past her and struck him dead center with the top of my head his arms were outstretched he had no protection from my blow his mouth was open as he was about to say something i was braced for the impact even so it was one spinedeadening collision the air whooshed out of the pirate like gas from a punctured bag while i dropped halfstunned to the deck now my whole head saw stars and they had heated from red to white we were both lightweight in the fractional gravity of the bubble but our inertial mass remained intact there had been nothing light about the butt i lay prone waiting for the shock to let go of my system i was conscious but somehow couldnt get my limbs to coordinate i heard the pirates shouting and faiths voice as she turned about and returned to me hope she cried are you all right oh theyve hurt him i presumed that him was me news for a third party i tried to tell her i would be all right in a moment when the universe stopped gyrating quite so wildly and my head shrank back to manageable dimension but only a grunt came out maybe that sound actually issued from the pirate next to me who was surely hurting as much as i was maybe with luck i had managed to separate his ribs but now other pirates charged in hack that boy apart the horse cried and rough hands hauled me into the air my dizziness abated rapidly there is nothing like a specific threat to ones life to concentrate his attention faith screamed againthat was one thing she was good atand flung her arms about me as my feet touched the deck the scream was illtimed at that moment all the pirates were doing was standing me on my feet and supporting me as i wobbled woozily their intent was unlikely to be kind but in that instant no one was actually doing me violence despite their leaders order maybe it had been intended to cow the other refugees rather than to be implemented literally i make this point with the advantage of retrospection because of the importance of that particular scream illtimed it was but that scream electrified the refugees in a manner no prior event had suddenly they were acting all at once as if choreographed by a larger power four of them grabbed the pirate beside me stripping him from me others jumped on the one i had stunned with my butt still others went after the oncoming pirates the refugee throng had been transformed from an apathetic frightened mass to a fighting force faiths third scream had done it it remains unclear to me why her first or second screams had not had that effect perhaps the first ones had primed the group i like to understand human motives and sometimes they defy reasonable explanation at any rate in moments all the pirates except their leader had been caught and disarmed surprised by the suddenness and ferocity of the refugee reaction and overwhelmed by our much greater number the horse stood however not with a drawn sword but with a drawn laser pistol this was another matter for though a laser lacked the brute force of a sword it could do its damage a great deal faster particularly when played across the face turn loose my men the horse said sternly my father spoke up i knew he did not like this sort of showdown but he was after all our leader and with faith and me involved he was also personally responsible get out of this bubble he said youre nothing but robbers the horses weapon swung to cover my father i tensed despite my continuing discomfort knowing that little weapon could puncture a mans eyeballs and cruelly blind him before he could even blink who are you said the pirate major hubris my father responded youre no military man its my name not a title fire that laser and the rest of us will swamp you before i fall the horse grinned humorlessly i can take out five or six of you first two or three of us my father corrected him evenly and i felt a surging pride at his courage my father had always had the nerve to do what he had to do even when he disliked it this was an example and there are two hundred of us weve already got your men you stand to lose regardless the pirate leader considered there is that all rightyou release my men and well leave you alone my father turned to the crowd that seems fair enough he noted the scattered nods of approval then turned back to the pirate but you have to leave the things you stole from us no robbery the horse scowled agreed by this time i had recovered most of my wits dont trust him father i cried these are pirates i am a pirate the horse said but i keep my word we will not rob you and we will leave the bubble my father like most men of honor tended to believe the best of people he nodded at the men who held the pirates and the pirates were released they quickly recovered their weapons and rejoined their leader somewhat shamefaced the horse stood for a moment considering then he indicated me thats your boy who floored my man my father nodded grimly and my daughter whom he was defending as i mentioned thoughts scurry through my head at all times not always relevant to the issue of the moment right now i wondered where my little sister spirit was as i didnt see her i dont know why i thought of her right then maybe it was because the way my father spoke it sounded as though he had only two children when in fact he had three of course he wasnt trying to deceive anyone the pirate hadnt asked how many he had just whether i was one it was just that my meandering brain insisted on exploring surplus details and when she screamed the others rallied around the horse said we misjudged that it seems yes so well just have to try it again the horse concluded he made a signal with his hand take them suddenly the nine other pirates advanced on us again each with his sword or club ready hey my father protested you agreed not to rob you the horse said and to leave the bubble well honor that but first we have some business that wasnt in the contract he looked at faith and me dont hurt the boy or the girl or the man he ordered bring them here pirates grabbed the three of us in each case two men menaced the refugees nearby while the third cornered the victim they were much more careful than before it was not possible to resist without immediate disaster for the horse backed them up with his laser more than that it was psychological the remaining refugees rendered leaderless again did nothing the dynamics had changed thats another phenomenon that has perplexed me the mechanism by which a few uninhibited individuals can cow a much larger number when both groups know the larger group has the power to prevail it seems impossible yet it happens all the time whole governments exist in opposition to the will of the people they govern because of this if i could just comprehend that dynamic bind father and son the horse said string them up to the baggage rack i struggled but lacked the strength and mass of any one of the pirates they tied my hands behind me cruelly tight and suspended me from the guyed baggage net in the center of the bubble my father suffered a similar fate we hung at a slight angle overlooking the proceedings helpless now the horse turned to faith he whistled shes a looker he exclaimed his vernacular expression may have been cruder but that was the essence faith of course blushed leave her alone i cried foolishly no we wont let this piece go to waste the horse said running his tongue around his lips prepare her the pirates held faith and methodically tore the rest of her clothing from her struggling body grinning salaciously oh yes they enjoyed doing this in my mind they resembled burning demons from the depths of hell someone among the refugees cried out but the swords of the other pirates on guard prevented any action when faith was naked they hauled a box out of the baggage and held her supine spreadeagled across it the horse ran his rough hands over her torso and squeezed her breasts then dropped his pantaloons there was a gasp of incredulity from the refugees this was not because of any special quality of the horses anatomy which was unimpressive and unclean but because of the open manner in which he exhibited himself before such a company of men women and children the man was completely without shame i am striving to record this sequence objectively for this is my personal biography the description of the things that have made me what i am i strive always to comprehend the true nature of people myself most of all there is a place for subjectivityor so i believe my feelings about a given event may change with time and mood and memory but the facts of the event will never change so i must first describe precisely what occurred as though it were recorded by videotape uncluttered by emotion then proceed to the subjective analysis and interpretation perhaps there should be several interpretations separated by years so that the change in them becomes apparent and helps lead to the truest possible comprehension of the whole but in this case i find i cannot adequately perform the first requirement my hand balks my very mind veers away from the enormity of the outrage and hurt i can only say that i loved my two sisters with a love that was perhaps more than brotherly though never would i have thought that there was any incestuous element faith was beautiful and nice and i was charged with her protection though she was a woman while i was a mere adolescent i had in fact never before witnessed the sexual act either in holo or in person and had never imagined it to be so brutal it was as if that foul pirate shoved a blunt dagger into my sisters trembling vulnerable body again and again and his face distorted in a grimace of urgency that in ironic fashion almost matched her grimace of agony and his body shuddered as if in epileptic seizure and when he stopped and stepped away there was blood on the weapon and ii with my absolute horror of that ravishment my hatred of every aspect of that crueltyi found my own body reacting as it were a thing apart from my mind yet i knew it could not truly be separate there was some part of me that identified with the fell pirate though i knew it was wrong and more than wrong my innocent lovely sister faith possessed certain attributes of heaven while now i knew that i possessed at least in part an attribute of hell i looked upon the foul lust of satan and felt an echo of that lust within myself i cannot write of this further it is no pleasant thing to confess an affinity to that which one condemns i can only say that i swore a private oath to kill the pirate horse some time some way and the pirates who followed him in the appalling act i tried to note the details of each of them so that i would not fail to recognize them if ever i encountered them again i saw that several of the pirates however did not participate they obeyed the horse in all other things but would not ravish a helpless woman even among pirates there were some who were not as bad as others apart from that effort of identification my mind retreated from what was happening my sister i think had fainted before the second pirate readied his infernal weapon and that was a portion of mercy for her she at least no longer knew what was being done to her body i knewbut chose not to see i fled into memory into that sequence that was the origin of my feeling of dйjа vu for it related directly to the present situation probably i should have commenced my bio there instead of with the shock of faiths violation for i see now that the true beginning of my odyssey was then this bio is more than a record of experience it is therapy biography biology biopsyall the ways to study a subject biolife my life not only do i seek to grasp the nature of myself i seek to strengthen my character by reviewing my successes and my mistakes with an eye to improving the ratio between them painful as this process can be at times therefore i will now illumine that prior sequence demarking it with a new dateline and will try to keep my narrative more coherent hereafter i would perhaps dispose of my false start but my paper and ink are precious as is my evocative effort after all if once i begin the process of unwriting what i have written where may it end every word is important for it too is part of my being chapter faith and spirit maraud callisto my sisters and i walked home together after school because there was a certain safety in numbers faith eighteen years old resented this she claimed her social life was inhibited by the presence of a skinny fifteenyearold little sibling the vernacular term she was wont to employ was less kind and i think not completely fair and does not become her so i shall not render it here yet she smiled as she said it deleting much of the sting and i think there was some merit to her complaint it is true that a fiftykilo sibling is not much company for a fiftykilo girl our weights were similar in full earth gravity but the distribution differed substantially faith was about as pretty a girl as one might imagine with the rich ashblond tresses and gray eyes that made her face stand out among the darker shades that predominated in our culture and a generously symmetrical figure and small extremities i was young and not versed in social relations between the sexes and i was her brother even so i understood the impact such physical qualities had on men faith was not really intelligent as i define the concept though she did well enough in scholastics it was said that a single look at her was enough to raise her grade before any given class commenced and that may not have been entirely in jest she lacked that ornery attitude that passes for courage in others these qualities of intelligence and courage were reserved in healthy measure for her sister spirit was as bold and cunning a gamin as could be found on the planet technically callisto is merely the fourth galilean satellite of jupiter a moon but its diameter is almost kilometers the same as mercury and greater than pluto so only the accident of its association with the colossus of the system prevents it from being accorded the dignity of planetary status and so i think of it as a planet though the texts disagree but i was describing my little sister spirit who even at age twelve was a person to be reckoned with i fought with her often but i liked her too and envied her survivalist nature theoretically i was the guardian of our little group for i was the male but my appreciation of the complexities of people was too great for me to perform this duty as well as spirit might had she been me once she set her course she pursued it with an almost appalling efficiency and dispatch on this day precisely one month following my fifteenth birthday we experienced what is termed an incident how i wish i could have foreseen the consequences of this seemingly minor event we have on callisto a society of classes arising somewhat haphazardly from the turbulent history of our satellite the government has changed often but the mass of the populace has sunk slowly into the stability of poverty and dependence interactions between the classes are fraught with complications my father had mortgaged his small property and gone into debt to insure a decent education for all his children thus the three of us unlike the vast majority of those of our station were literate and well informed faith and i could speak and read english as well as spanish and spirit was learning we had applied ourselves most diligently throughout aware of the sacrifice that had been made for us but for me the pursuit of knowledge of every kind had become an obsession that no longer required any other stimulus we hoped this good education would facilitate faiths marriage into a more affluent class and my own chance to enter some more profitable trade than that of coffee technician then we could begin to abate the debts of our education bettering the situation of our parents who had toiled so hard for our benefit we could also achieve higher status and greater economic leverage to benefit our own children when they came it was a worthwhile ambition but such aspirations were fraught with mischief as this episode was to demonstrate as we three walked a side street of the city of maraudnamed after the days when the marauders of space had made callisto a base of operations a quaint bit of historical lore that was not so quaint in its remaining influencea minisaucer floated up it bore the scion of some wealthy family he was handsome and wore jewelry on his quality coat steel caps on his leather shoes and the sneer of arrogance on his face that only one born to the manner could affect i disliked him the moment i saw him for he had all the ostentatious luxury of situation that i craved yet he had been given it on the proverbial platter while my family had to struggle constantly with no certainty of achieving it he was about twenty years old for he looked no older and could not have been younger that was the minimum age at which a person could obtain the license to float a saucer youre hubris he said to faith hovering obnoxiously near so that the downdraft from the saucers small propeller stirred the hem of her light dress and caused more of her legs to show here within the dome the climate varied only marginally and was always controlled so that heavy clothing was unnecessary this was fortunate for we could not afford anything more than we had still the untoward breeze embarrassed faith who was of a genuinely demure nature in the presence of grown men ive seen you in school the scion continued his eyes traveling rather too intimately along her torso he must have meant that he had watched her at her school for he would not have attended school at all he would have had hired tutors throughout and computerized educational programs and hypnoteaching for the dull material you look pretty good for a peasant how would you like a good kiss only kiss was not precisely the term he employed our language of spanish has nuances of obscenity that foreigners tend to overlook and translation would be awkward something as simple as a roll of bread can become with the improper inflection a gutter imprecation he surely had not learned such terms from his expensive tutors faith blushed from her collar to her ears she tried to walk away from the insulting man but he coasted close and took hold of her arm i saw the several rings on the fingers of his hand set with diamonds and rubies displaying his inordinate wealth the hand was quite clean and uncallused he had never performed physical labor come onyou lowclass girls do it all the time dont you ill give you two dollars if youre good the jovian dollarthat was our currency toohad been revalued many times and currently was worth about what it had been seven hundred years ago back on planet earth that was one of the things i had learned in the school it had cost my father so many of those same dollars to send us to i also understood the ancient vernacular significance of the twodollar figure it was an allusion to the fee of prostitutes my anger was building up like pressure in the boiler of a steam machine but i contained it slumming scions could have foul mouths and manners but it was best to tolerate these and stay out of trouble all men are not equal in the domes of callisto faith tried to wrest her arm free but the man hauled her roughly in to him she screamed helplessly i suppose it would have been better if she had kicked or scratched him but she had practiced being the helpless type so long it was now second nature then spirit did what i had lacked the nerve to do she put her foot against the rim of the saucer and tilted it up its gravity lens made it and the man aboard it very light so it responded readily to her pressure the shield was partial so that the saucer would not float away when not in use about percent of the weight of vehicle and user was eliminated enabling the propeller in the base to lift and move the mass readily the nullgee effect was narrow and limited so that the air above was not unduly disturbed the first saucers when gravity shielding was new had borne their users along in perpetual clouds of turbulence and minor tornadoes had been known to form above them contributing to the awkwardness but the refinement of the shield to make a curving and selflimiting nullgee zone had solved that problem and the saucers were now quite common i use shield and lens interchangeably here i should not but the technical distinctions are beyond my expertise so i go with the ignorant majority in this case as i understand it there is no shield but the lens performs the office admirably the saucers use very little power and though they arent generally fast they are fun larger saucers can do considerably more of course but i digress as is my fault the point is it does require fair balance and skill to ride such a saucer for the passengers weight reduction is proportional to the amount of the body within the region of shielding and the angle of the shielding disk it is a common misconception that a gravshield angled sidewise abates gravity sidewise of course that could never be true such an angle merely reduces the size of the nullgee region thus a person floating too high can always bring himself down by tilting the shield properly managed the saucers provide precisely controlled individual flotation with the rider drawing his body into the shielded region to increase lift and extending it beyond that region to increase weight and make a gentle descent so when spirit tilted the saucer two things happened its cross section intercepting the planetary gravity diminished slightlyand the man aboard it found himself angled to a greater extent outside that field naturally the saucer sank under his increasing weight it also threw him off balance so that yet more of his body projected from the shielded zone balancing on a gravity lens has been described as similar to balancing on a surfboard or skateboardwhich provides modern folk a hint of the fun the ancients hadand a slight miscue could quickly become calamitous it was so in this case only the mans grip on faiths arm steadied him enabling him to jump off the saucer instead of being dumped on his face shaken and furious he whirled aboutjust in time to spy the burgeoning smirk on my face i had not done the deed but i was certainly guilty of appreciating it ill teach you he cried angrily in that idiomatic expression that means the opposite he released faith and concentrated on me behind him the vacant saucer righted itself and hovered in place as it was programmed to do it had not failed him he had failed it with a little help from spirit the scion was substantially older and larger than i for five years can be a tremendous distinction in this period of life and i was afraid of him i did not want to fight him i have never regarded myself as a creature of violence in the most propitious circumstances and this one was least propitious at the same time i was aware that this development had distracted his malign attention from faith and that it would return to her the moment he settled with me therefore i could not seek to elude him not until my sister was safe that was the onus attached to my privilege of being male get on home girls i snapped peremptorily spirit started to go knowing it was best though she didnt like leaving me by herself she would have stayed but she was aware that the real threat was to faith who had to be moved out of danger but faith less perceptive of the realities of the situation had the endearing loyalty of the hubris family she did not go you cant fight him hope she protested her voice quavering with reaction and fear i wont fight the twerp the scion snarled again i take a liberty with the translation ameliorating the essential term ill only jam his head into a wall to teach him his place then ill deal with you and he made a small gesture of universal and impolite significance emboldened by my awareness of the peril of our situation i never paused to see the horrified blush i knew was crossing faiths face i punched the scion in the stomach it was a foolish gesture he was not only larger than i he was in better physical condition he looked clean and soft but he had access to expensive completenutrition foods tailored to his specific chemistry while my stature had been somewhat retarded by sometimes inadequate diet he could go regularly to a private gymnasium for expertly supervised exercise crafted to be entertaining and efficient while i got mine playing handball in the back alleys even if i had been his age and size i could not have matched his training and endurance this was a gross mismatch the scion smiled grimly well aware of these aspects he might not have completely enjoyed the various facets of his training since he might have preferred at any given time to be out slumming in the city as he was now but he had nevertheless profited from them he assumed a competent fighting stance body balanced fists elevated i had hit him i had not hurt him but i was committed by the convention of our culture that transcended the difference in our stations a person who hits another had better be ready to fight the scion stepped forward leading with his left fist his right cocked for the punishing followup in that moment i saw faith standing frozen to my right and spirit to my left my older sister was terrified but my younger one who now had a pretext to stay was intrigued i ducked and dodged of course fights are an integral part of youth and though i never sought themperhaps i should say because i never sought themi had had my share i am a quick study on most things and pain is a most effective tutor i had been hurt so many times that my response had become virtually instinctive it was not that i had any special competence in fisticuffs or any delusion about winning but i could at least put up a respectable defense considering the disparity in our forces like the scion i had been an unwilling student but i had mastered the essentials the scion turned with a sneer unsurprised at his miss only a complete fool stands still to take a direct hit he retained his poise he had only been testing anyway he stepped forward again jabbing with his left still saving his right for the opportunity to score he was too smart to swing wildly he knew he would catch me in due course unless i fled in which case he would have undistracted access to faith this was in its fashion merely a preliminary to that access he was perversely showing off for her impressing her by beating up her little brother he had no need of her pleasure or her acquiescence just her respect to feed his id he was the dragonslayer who would get the fair maidin his own perception young as i was and inexperienced as i was i still understood that the sexual drive is superficial compared to the human need for recognition and favor this man could have bought willing sex elsewhere or possibly even had it from faith had he chosen to dazzle her with some costly gift or tour of the realm of the rich but that would have lacked the cutting edge of this little drama the thing a person works for has more value than the thing too easily obtained also it seemed to be a requirement of his need that the girl he got be inferior someone to be coerced in an alley rather than wooed like a lady a certain kind of upbringing fosters that attitude to that type of perception sex could not be enjoyable unless it was dirty meanwhile i dodged again not allowing my thoughts to interfere with the immediate business of selfpreservation the scion shifted to face me again satisfied to bide his time while faith watched now i was fielding information about him the way he moved the standard procedure he employed the glances he made at faith to be sure he was sufficiently impressing her he was larger and stronger and healthier than i but not actually faster and certainly not more versatile he was using no imagination in his attack relying solely on basic moves he was in fact limited by his arrogant attitude and his certainty of success he came at me a third time and i ducked a third timebut this time i did not dodge aside i launched myself at his knees tackling him my shoulder striking his thigh in front and shoving him back the force of my strike and the surprise of my attack gave me an advantage i lacked in conventional combat but this was not convention this was the street the rules were not exactly what the scion might have been taught here the scion stepped back surprised but did not fall he had maintained good balance as he had been trained to do and it is in fact very hard to dump a balanced opponent but he had lost his poise as i had anticipated he was unprepared to deal with atypical strategy the odds remained uneven but not as much so as before i scrambled away before he could adjust and club me i had hoped to dump him on his back but simply lacked the force still my confidence grew and i began to hope i could after all take him i have always been an excellent judge of people whether that judgment is positive or negative it is my special talent this was now my key to victory an opponent understood is an opponent potentially nullified had this one simply gone after me with full force at the outset he should have pulverized me because he preferred to posture he had given me opportunity to utilize my own strength the scion came at me another time shaken and angry he had intended on object lesson now he was serious i had heightened the stakes he feinted with his left hand as usual expecting me to duck again instead i pulled back his knee came up in a manner that would have cracked my chin had i performed as before as it was it missedand i stepped in to grab his leg i had learned this early a person on one foot is largely helpless this is a liability of such martial arts as karate or kickboxing blows with the feet are powerful but if the other party gets hold of a foot thats trouble i hung on preventing him from recovering his balance while staying out of the reach of his fists he hopped about on his other foot absolutely furious at his loss of dignity especially with faith watching but unable to do much about it his training evidently had not covered the handling of such an exigency spirit tittered which didnt help i had him but i didnt know what to do with him i couldnt really hurt him in this position and the moment i let go i would be in trouble it was like riding the tiger how does one safely get off of course he could have broken my hold quickly by lying down and grappling for my own feet but i knew he wouldnt do that it was counter to his selfimage that was my advantage of understanding again but i had grown too confident myself and made an error i had not judged what he would do if trapped in a position of indignity the scion reached into his shirt and brought out a miniature laser weapon it flashed and the beam seared into my left side causing my shirt to smoke and burning a line across my flesh i yelped and let go for i had to get clear of that beam before it penetrated to an inner organ and cooked it a laser can do a lot more damage than shows because of the invisible heatray component it doesnt have to vaporize the flesh to make it useless the man made an exclamation of victory and stalked me aiming his laser it scorched my buttock making me leap out of the way he laughed i could not dodge that beam of light if i fled him not only would i lose the fight but faith would be subject to his will if only she had fled when i gave her the chance if i did not depart he would soon score on my face perhaps destroying my vision i was in real trouble then the scion cried out and dropped the laser i took immediate advantage of his distraction and charged in to the attack those burns had eradicated any faint reticence i might have had i stiffened my fists and clubbed him on ear and neck as hard as i could he fell back seeming hardly to notice my blows though i knew they stung he bent to pick up his weapon with his left hand and i kneed him in the nose exactly the way he had intended to knee me before in a moment blood was flowing across his face the laser skittered away from his misdirected hand he turned one hand to his face cupping the blood and jumped for his saucer it lurched upward it seemed he still had sufficient command of his body to control it in a moment he was gone now i looked at spirit realizing what she had done you used your fingerwhip i cried as though accusing her she smiled smugly whirling her finger to recoil her weapon the fingerwhip was a spool of translucently thin line that hooked to her middle finger when she flicked her digit just soshe had practiced this diligently in privatethe weighted tip carried the line out rapidly to its full length of a meter that plus the reach of her arm gave her a fair striking distance invisible the whip might be but she could snap coins out of the air with it that line could really sting and sometimes cut into the skin spirit had savaged the scions weapon hand disarming him it had not been a fair tacticbut of course the laser itself had not been fair she had rescued me from a nasty situation this was not the first time though it was the most significant i decided to drop the matter children were not supposed to have weapons but spirit had won the whip on a bet a year before and had made a point of mastering it she had become the junior champion of the schoolyard partly because of her finesse with her finger and partly because of her indomitable fighting spirit oh yes she lived up to her name once she had been tagged four times by an agile whip opponent suffering scours on a leg both arms and one ear but only came on more intensely until her opponent a boy of her own age had lost his nerve and yielded the issue without being struck himself he had realized that if he continued spirit would score and her flicks had already come so near his eyes that it was obvious that discretion was the better part of valor pain could make her scream it could not make her yield nerve not skill had won her that battlebut since then her skill had increased of course a fingerwhip is a little thing not capable of dealing deathbut i knew from that time on that i never wanted to have my little sister truly angry with me i had never betrayed her secret and neither had faith and we were not about to now we had better not tell our folks about this incident i said picking up the scions laser and pocketing it after noting that its charge gauge read about half several good burns remained in it now i had a secret weapon too and the others would keep my secret silently spirit nodded acquiescence i put my arm around her small shoulders and hugged her my thanks for her help she melted against me letting down now that it was over however tough she was in combat she did need emotional support and this i could offer we understood each other faith came out of her stasis you shouldnt have done that hope she reproved me shakily i exchanged another glance with spirit we both knew faiths naпvetй was a necessary aspect of her selfimage i guess i got carried away did you see his nose splat spirit said enthusiastically i didnt really mean to do that i admitted i was aiming for his chin but he went down too fast all that blood faith said horrified she seemed oblivious of what could have happened to her had we not driven the scion off and this was just as well faith had some clothingpatching material that she kept for possible emergencies in connection with her dress she used this to repair and conceal the damage the laser had done to my clothes the burns on my flesh would simply have to heal we hurried on home and by the time we got there faith too had agreed that it was best that we not mention this incident to our parents chapter hard choice maraud they came resplendent in the military uniform of the maraud police delivering the foreclosure on our property i mentioned the debt and mortgage our father took on to insure an education for his children he was in arrears on the payments of course because all peasants were that was the way of life on callisto my father major hubris was an intelligent man with minimal formal education he knew very well that the big landowners were systematically cheating the peasants but didnt know how to stop it i had progressed far enough in my education to have a fair notion of the situation and was confident that by the time i reached maturity i would be able to set about reversing the downward trend for our family but until that time the hubrises were vulnerableand that vulnerability had abruptly been exploited foreclosurethat finished us before we could begin to fight back we had three days to vacate unless we could pay off the mortgage in its entirety before that deadline of course we could not people do not get into debt if they have the wherewithal to escape it that clause of the contract is an almost open mockery of the hopes of the peasants if there had been any reasonable hope of paying on demand you can be sure the landowners would have passed a law to eliminate that hope my father put in a call to our creditor who had been reasonably tolerant before this was colonel guillaume of an ancient military family now retired to his wealth and not really a bad person as creditors went that is he cheated the peasants less than some creditors did treated them with reasonable courtesy and did seem to have some concern for their welfare the colonel did not speak to my father personally of course the secretary of one of his administrative functionaries handled that matter that was all we had any right to expect why my father asked and i perceived the baffled hurt in his voice why foreclose with no warning have we not behaved well did i make some error in the tally if i have given any offense i shall proffer my most abject apology i did not like hearing my father speak this way to me he had always been strong the master of the household a column of strength now his darkly handsome face showed lines and sags of confusion and defeat as though the column were cracking and crumbling under a sudden intolerable and inexplicable burden his newly apparent weakness frightened and embarrassed me and made my knees feel spongy and my stomach knot i saw little beads of sweat on his forehead and shades of gray in his short curly hair but his hands bothered me more for now the strong fingers clenched and unclenched spasmodically behind his back out of the view of the secretary in the phonescreen but in full view of my eyes and the tendons flexed along the back of his hand as if suffering some special torture of their own but most of all it was his voice that bothered me that cowed selfeffacing almost whining tone as if he were a cur submitting to legitimate but painful discipline sorry not so much for the strike of the rod on his flesh as for the infraction that caused this punishment to be necessary i had never before seen him this way and wished i were not seeing it now a bastion of my selfesteem rooted ineluctably in my perceived strength of my father was tumbling this is an insidiously unpleasant thing for a child it is as if he stands upon bedrock and then experiences the first tremor of the earthquake that will destroy his house the secretary was female of low degree not unsympathetic but compelled by her own employment to deliver the cruel response the hubris account is three months in arrears on payments of course my father cut in showing at least this token of mettle we are all behind on payments but i am due for a promotion to tallyman for my quadrant and that will enable me to recover a month this year perhaps two months if there is no sickness in the family he paused disliking the sound of his own voice pleading the honored colonel must have some more specific reason the girl looked at him sadly there is another message but i dont think i should read it my father smiled grimly read it girl you know i cannot actually he was partly literate having taught himself a little by looking at faiths homework assignments but he preferred not to have this generally known ninety percent of the peasant population was illiterate and most of the rest were not clever readers and it seemed the big landowners and politicians preferred it that way literacy could lead to peasant unrest in this i was sure the authorities of callisto were quite correct illiteracy meant ignorance and ignorance was more readily malleable how was it then that faith and spirit and i had been permitted to enroll in one of the few good schools expensive as it was there had to have been a bribe making it more expensive yet i had never inquired about that and never would if we children had our secrets to preserve so also did our parents have theirs i knew that if my father had done it there had been no other way the girl frowned if you insist seсor she was being overly polite for peasants were normally not dignified by the title seсor or as it is in english mister peasants were supposed merely to be things rather than people it seems to be a notification of a charge of truancy and abuse against your children she said looking at the document my children he exclaimed baffled surely seсora there is some mistake b sierra scion of a leading family has lodged a charge of unwarranted aggression against the children of hubris she said apologetically suddenly it made awful sense i looked at spirit who nodded we were to blame we should have told our father instead of concealing the episode i had never thought the boorish scion would report us it should embarrass him too much to have it known that a fifteenyearold peasant boy and twelveyearold peasant girl had balked his attempted rape of their older sister i cannot believe this my father said my children are well behaved i have sent them to school beyond the mandatory age the charge is that they made an unprovoked attack on him as he passed on his gravdisk he took a fall smashing his nose but managed to recover his disk and get away because they are only children he is not demanding criminal action but they must vacate the city i wondered as i heard that whether that could be all there was to it if the scion had been angry enough to make a formal complaint he must seek more revenge than our departure my father turned to look at me he saw the guilt on my face thank you seсora he said to the screen i did not properly understand my situation the colonel says he is sure it is a misunderstanding the girl said quickly but it is better for you to leave it is awkward to offend such a family as this the colonel will make a domicile available for your family at the plantation the colonel is most kind we shall consider the call closed and the screen faded spirit and i both started to speak as we returned to our house from the payphone station while faith blushed my father silenced us all with a raised palm let me see if i have this correctly he said with a calm that surprised me now that he had a better notion of the problem it seemed he had more confidence about dealing with it the young stud floated up and accosted faith and you two fought him off silently i nodded the scion burned hope with his laser spirit said we had to do something my father looked at me again and i pulled out my shirt and showed the burn streak on my left side now bright red and painful it was a certain relief to have this known for i had had to keep myself from flinching when i moved my arm he sighed i suppose it was bound to happen faith is too pretty faith blushed more deeply chagrined for her liability of beauty she was the lightestskinned among us strongly showing that portion of our ancestry that was caucasian and which accounted in part for her pulchritude i never understood why beauty should not be considered equal according to every race of man and every admixture of races but somehow fairness was the ideal spirits developing features of face and body were almost as good as faiths but her darker skin and hair would prevent her from ever being called beautiful i was perversely glad to see the tension relieved youre not angry certainly im angry my father exploded i am infuriated with the whole corrupt system but we are victims not perpetrators i only wish you had found some more anonymous way to defend your sister we are about to pay a hideous price for this mishap i felt the rebuke keenly how could i have saved faith without antagonizing the scion i didnt know and now it was too late to correct the matter but i knew i would be pondering it until i came up with a satisfactory or at least viable answer actually hideous price turned out to be an understatement but none of us had any hint of that then now i must explain our situation my father said my mother had quietly joined us as we returned to our house our forfeited house and now she sat beside faith and took her hand comfortingly my mothers given name was charity and it was an apt designation though it did not match the normal run of names any more than the rest of ours did we were a family somewhat set apart being i think more intelligent and motivated than most and it showed in our names our surname hubris meant literally the arrogance of pride it was a point of considerable curiosity to me how we had come by it but i also had a certain arrogant pride in it for it did lend us distinction my mother charity was not and had never been as pretty as faith was now but she was a fine and generous and supportive mother who though i should blush to say it still possessed more than a modicum of sex appeal she was not a creature any man would be ashamed to have at his elbow we three children were as different from our parents and each other as it was feasible to be yet charitys charity encompassed all our needs she had a very special quality of understanding an aspect of which i believe i inherited but her use of it was always positive in contrast to mine seeing her now her dark hair tied back under a conservative kerchief her delicate hands folded sedately in her lapfaith inherited those handsher rather plain features composedyet should she ever take the trouble to enhance herself the way faith did that plainness would vanishi felt an overflowing of love that lacked at the moment any proper avenue of expression she was my mother a great and good woman though a peasant and i sorely regretted bringing this affliction to her had i only knownyet of course i should have known how could i have thought we could humiliate a scion with impunity here in a dome on classridden stratified callisto colonel guillaume has offered us a place in the plantation dome my father said we must consider this offer on its merits which are mixed we must move from the dome of maraud the charge against our family can only be abated that way he held his hand aloft again forestalling spirits impetuous interjection yes dear im sure the incident was not as the scion states it and theoretically in a court of law both sides should be heard but our republic of halfcal callisto i must clarify is actually two nations of which ours is the lesser thus the other is called the dominant republic of callisto but i interrupt my fathers speech is weighted toward the wealthy and it would be your word against his there would be no justice there we have been given the chance to avoid such a legal confrontation and indeed we must avoid it for it would surely lead to penalties we cant pay and therefore prison spirit subsided she grasped the distinction between the ideal and the practical when it was explained to her no peasant ever prevailed in an encounter with the elite class the whole system was engineered to prevent that the advantage of the plantation my father continued making a fair presentation for he always tried to be fair and usually succeeded is that that is my place of employment i would no longer have to make the daily trips between domes and that would save time and money i could be with my family more and perhaps begin to gain on our mortgage arrears he smiled tiredly i should clarify that even though we are being foreclosed and evicted our debt remains as a lien against our family line and must eventually be cleared if we are ever to achieve higher status there will be a rental on the plantation domicile the good colonel did not get rich by being foolish about such details but it will be a convenient and pleasant accommodation he paused and we knew there would be another side to this there was always another side to anything in callisto that seemed too positive for a peasant family the disadvantage is that the coffee plantation is maintained at half earth gravity i am not sure you children quite appreciate what that means half gravity may be fun for occasional play and it is possible to spend several hours in it each day without harm but permanent residence within it is deleterious to human health the living bones decalcify and weaken until it is no longer possible for a person to survive in normal earth gravity such as is maintained in the dome of maraud the process is gradual and painless and harmless as long as residence in that gravity is maintained it is the bodys natural accommodation to the changed environment it would be possible to return to full earth gravity within a year physically though with some discomfort but it becomes more difficult with time and after two years no one returns but spirit burst out my father nodded it is as my daughter points out no temporary choice we are making today if we go to live in the plantation dome we shall have an easy and peaceful life for we can be sure no scions reside there but our branch of hubris will never be anything but coffee handlers it is not a bad employment there is honor in doing any job well and half our national export is coffeebut we should never again have any choice now it would be possible to ferry you children to school in maraud for the rest of the current term but after that you would have to join us full time at the plantation for your scholastic district will be there unless we arrange to have you legally separated from the family no my mother exclaimed that ended that she would tolerate almost anything for the sake of family unity except the dissolution of it family is important to us of callisto we are as i explained a latin breed reputed to be hotblooded and in this respect perhaps we are whatever we did we would do together as a family it was our weakness and our strength my father glanced at faith giving the eldest child leave to speak but faith wrung her hands without opinion whatever you decide father he glanced next at me i was naturally bursting with questions but had to settle for one we have to get out of maraud the coffee dome isnt good where else can we go it was really half rhetorical for the planet outside the domes was airless and tracegravity the only place to go was another dome city in the other half of the planet the dominant republic where there would be no charge outstanding against the hubris family but i knew from my school studies that the dominant republic was just as hard on peasants as halfcal wasand we had no connections there no job no friends no residence if they admitted us at all which was doubtful we might just be worse off than we were here there was a silence as each of us turned the grim reality over individually jupiter spirit exclaimed my father glanced questioningly at her we can emigrate to jupiter she explained we can bubble off from callisto and float to the big planet where everyone is welcome and everyone is rich and be happy ever after my father did not suppress her foolish notion directly that was not his way instead he asked her leading questions letting her find her own way toward the truth what bubble did you have in mind well she faltered there are tourist and trade bubbles arent there and big freight bubbles she turned to faith youve taken contemporary economics in school havent you dont bubbles go through the whole jupiter system all the time yes faith said but the moons of jupiter are mostly latin while most of the commerce is done by united jupiter which is mostly saxon we dont speak the same languagethat is our people speak spanish and theirs speak englishand they dont like our governments what with the saturnian bias of ganymede and the dictatorships of europa and callisto we dont like our governments spirit blurted that is why we want to leave and we the hubrises do speak their language i put in warming to spirits notion as i got into it thats the big advantage of the schooling we had faith and i can write it too but charity and i cannot my father pointed out still the colossus of north jupiter does claim to accept freedomseeking refugees and there are many latins settled there we could probably find some bubbles there that conduct much of their business in spanish or at least are bilingual but thats academic the halfcal government would never grant us leave to emigrate why not spirit demanded they want to get rid of us dont they they should be happy to help us on our way my father shook his head not so child they have assorted international agreements and covenants that restrict free emigration and in any event halfcal would hardly care to advertise that its own people are eager to leave they may want us gone but they wont let us go i always knew our government was crazy spirit said pouting theres a way i murmured hesitantly all eyes centered on me what flap our arms and fly there spirit inquired skeptically that angered me i made a motion of sticking someone in the posterior with a pin and spirit jumped and that diluted my anger for she always did play our little games well a bootleg bubble i explained theres one hiding in kilroy crater in the valhalla complex right now just waiting for a full load my father whistled you children have sources of information the government lacks well its just gossip i admitted but i believe it the government knows about it faith said they just dont care they consider it pirate business pirate business that suggested volumes callisto had first been settled by spanishspeaking colonists five centuries ago who brought in slave labor to work in the first plantation domes then frenchspeaking buccaneers raided halfcal and used it as a base for their operations the name of our great city maraud is a legacy of that period in due course the slaves revolted there were massacres and finally two centuries ago the buccaneers were expelled but their influence remained in this area barely covert and it was said that modern pirates of space had influence in the halfcal government certainly there was a lot of pirate money around from the illicit drug trade and we all knew the corrupting power of money so it was not surprising that officials winked at innocuous or even illegal activities i doubted that pirates were actually involved in refugee bubbles for there could not be much money in that but certainly individual entrepreneurs could be you would go on such a bubble rather than to the coffee dome my father asked and i grasped now that he had not really been surprised by the suggestion adults too had their private sources of information oh sure spirit agreed immediately it would be fun oh my lord how little she knew there could be danger and discomfort my father warned but if the family stayed together my mother said that was i believe the turning point after that we found ourselves committed to the exodus we would flee callisto chapter flight into vacuum i have only an inkling of what my father did to organize for our horrendous trek across the surface of callisto i have not run a dateline for this entry because it follows the last without change of locale a foolish consistency as seсor emerson said many centuries ago is the hobgoblin of little minds probably he did not want us to know for it could hardly have been completely legal officially we were preparing to vacate the premises actually we meant to vacate the planet all of our private holdings were liquidated on the gray market and the money used to buy thirdhand surface suits for each of us together with compact food packs and water filters there was enough left over to cover the down payment on a junky lowgravity transporter that was all we could not keep our toys and dolls and treasured books surface suits had very little room for extra things even if we hadnt needed the pittances the sale of those things brought spirit tried hard to conceal her tears no longer quite so thrilled about the journey and i went bleakly about the business of cashing in we knew what was at stake i kept the laser pistol however squeezing it into an exterior pocket and i knew spirit kept her fingerwhip as far as i know no final payment was made on the mortgage it was not that we sought to cheat colonel guillaume who had done the best he could for us within the limits of his philosophy but that the foreclosure already represented a fair profit for him since we had built up a fair equity over the years which he would not have to transfer to the coffeeplantation residence perhaps he knew what we intended and did not report us to the authorities for that reason as long as his hands were technically clean and he made a fair profit he did not mind our effort to seek a better life elsewhere certainly he could have stopped us had he wished to we left at night in order to avoid any police watch again it would not have been possible to escape the dome of maraud if the authorities had really cared to prevent us but we were only peasants they were hardly concerned if we took it upon ourselves to depart the good life we supposedly had here i should explain that leaving a dome is no simple matter callisto is an airless world terraformed only in particular spots it is the same with all the moons of jupiter and indeed throughout the solar system other than earth the domes are made of huge bubbles grown in the massive atmosphere of jupiter floated to the local surface by means of standard antigravity shields cut in half and cemented to surface plates the fit had to be strong and tight or the pressure of the air inside would blow the dome apart and right off callisto so entrance and egress were only by air locks and these were not carelessly supervised the citydome of maraud is kilometers in diameter so that each of its inhabitants can have a floor space of at least ten square meters of course family units like ours increased their effective floor space by living in twostory homes anyway there were only two locks big enough for vehicles and only one of these functioned at night so that part of our course was set mother and the girls bundled down in the cargo cage while i got to sit up front with my father i know this is teenage foolishness but it made me feel important and i felt as if i were a real adventurer in the control cabin of a sleek jupiter navy spaceship copiloting through the starry galaxy of course navy ships do not cruise the galaxy the relativistic limitation confines mankind largely to his own solar system still this was the way my imagination went imagination allows more leeway than does reality which is perhaps why we come equipped with it what a horror it would be to be forever restricted to reality special order of garbage my father called out to the technician in charge of the lock that damped my fantasy somewhat garbage is not exactly the stuff of high adventure still this too was a kind of fantasy at least i prefer that description to the alternative of calling my father a liar my father proffered a folded paper the technician took the paper and glanced at it it was a standard twentydollar bill an obvious bribe the authorization seems to be in order the man agreed pocketing it get that garbage well away from here he pressed the buttons and the airlock panel slid clear the garbage of course was my mother and two sisters hunched in the cage with our limited supplies i wondered whether they appreciated the humor my father drove on it was a pedal car of course as few motors operated conveniently in a vacuum and very little power was needed on the airless lowgravity surface inside the dome the pollution of ordinary motors was unacceptable and distances were short so the pedalers made sense there too it occurred to me that the dome of maraud was very like an ancient walled city small and crowded but secure from the enemies without in this case the enemies were vacuum and low gravity and terrible cold this was also one reason that projectile weapons were not used inside the dome the substance of the dome could reflect a laser beam fairly harmlessly but a powerful enough projectile just might make a hole and such a nightmare was not to be risked we secured our suits which hung on us awkwardly made sure the three in back were secure and sealed our helmets the lock panel slid closed behind us the warning klaxon sounded and the air pressure dropped i had been outside the dome before of course on field trips in school so i knew what to expect but this time it was excitingly real for we planned never to return there was no hospital tank along to rescue us if we suffered a suit blowout and no home for us to relax in if we turned back they might not even open the lock for us we were committed with an uncompromising finality that awed me in a somewhat squeamish manner faith sat up suddenly in the cage pointing to her left leg that leg was not very shapely in the suit but that was not the point a thin plume of vapor jetted from a pinhole there hastily my mother slapped a seal patch on it pressing it tightly in place these were old battered suits which was why we had been able to afford them some problems were to be expectedbut this served to remind me as if i needed reminder that the danger was real and immediate if any of us suffered a fullscale blowout that person would be lost our suits inflated and grew taut as the last of the air went without any other problem fortunately there is not much actual force behind a pinhole leak and an external patch can readily contain it i gave a silent sigh of relief the outer panel on the lock slide open and we pedaled out onto the barren surface of callisto we were truly on our way the distaff contingent of our spaceship sat up and more or less joined us once we were clear of the lock we could not readily talk with each other for these primitive suits lacked radios and of course there was no atmosphere to conduct our sound but there was sound it was conducted through the vehicle and our suits we heard as it were through the seats of our pants it wasnt very clear since there was also the rattling of the pedal car but it was better than silence spirit leaned forward over the top of the cage and touched her helmet to mine isnt this fun she cried so loud that i jerked my head away headtohead conduction was much more efficient valhalla here we come that last was through the seat much dimmer valhalla is the monstrous system of concentric rings associated with a huge old crater extending out about fifteen hundred kilometers from its centera significant fraction of the planets surface maraud is about one hundred kilometers outside that formation and the bootleg bubble was hidden in an old crater hangar about two hundred kilometers within it so we had a good three hundred kilometers to go we could travel up to forty or fifty kilos per hour in this trace gravity however so that was all right the city domes you see use gravity lenses to concentrate gravity inside them bringing it up to earth norm what we simply call gee this is actually another aspect of the gravity shielding used to make saucers float above ground and bubbles float between planets there is no such thing as blocking out gravity but it can be diluted or intensified in limited regions by the lenslike shields somewhat the way light itself can be affected by a properly curved lens thats a considerable oversimplification the actual science of gravity manipulation is far too complex for an amateur like me to comprehend but i am sure that gravity variation is the key to the human colonization of the solar system because it makes both travel and residence feasible anywhere in space not easy understand but feasible because of the enormous savings in energy required for these activities my mind reviewed what i had learned in school for it was suddenly more relevant to my immediate existence the human species had originated on the planet earth but population had expanded voluminously until there really wasnt room for everyone for reasons that werent entirely clear to me this caused people to react violently and they were afraid there would be a bad nuclear war that would destroy everything but then the discovery of gravity shielding popularly and not too accurately called antigravity or nullgee had enabled the extra people to emigrate to the other planets and moons of the solar system and the threat of internecine war had faded for a while for a whilethat is a significant qualification according to my history texts the crush of overpopulation on earth and diminution of resources had been set back by some five or six hundred years as it happens those years have passed and we are now back to the point populationresourcewise where we were just before the discovery of the technique of gravity manipulation so we face the problem againonly this time gravshielding isnt enough to abate it that makes me nervous when i think about it the early colonization of the solar system proceeded rapidly for the shields enabled man to hoist huge masses into space the problem of air and food and water remained however so there were limits it was like mans discovery of the lever it enabled him to multiply his force but not indefinitely one enterprising company had fitted a gravity lens to an ocean liner and sailed it through the air but it was clumsy outside its natural element subject to errant winds and when it sailed too high the passengers suffered from the thinning of the air airplanes had similar problems actually as they flew beyond the normal atmosphere efficient as an airplane may be in air it becomes clumsy in vacuum for its wings cannot plane through nothing so in the end the compact simple tough bubble became king of space from the outside a bubble most resembled a planetoid with portholes or a little round meteor with craterlets on it but inside it was a temporary world bubbles floated out to all the other planets and moons and fragments carrying gravity lenses and construction equipment that could operate in a vacuum bases were established throughout the solar system in the course of the first century following the nullgee discovery new nations sprang up in the likeness of old as individual earthly governments operated competitively to establish their domains in space the american continents of earth centered on the richest prize the gross planet jupiter and its moons while the asians settled for the nextgreatest prize beautiful saturn with its rings and many small moons the smaller or more distant planets considered less desirable were left to the lesser powers of that day the africans who got the hot inner worlds of venus and mercury the europeans who got uranus the moslem states who got neptune and its oilrich satellite triton and the remainder somewhat haphazardly distributed among other special interests a number of the other powers claimed shares of frigid pluto and its satellite charon hoping eventually to discover and exploit rich resources there there was no established population on charon or pluto however they were just too far out and the sunlight there was too dim to be usable for power this was part of the education i had suffered in school which i now parrot back as if it represented original thinking on my part would it were so i happen to have a flair for geography so i did well but most of my fellow students professed to find it boring i could make fairly precise matchings of each planet or moon with an equivalent political entity of six hundred years before on earth no one else saw any point in such a game and i cant honestly claim it is more than idle entertainment oopsdid i write that the moslems of earth took neptune i would have flunked that question on an exam already my school learning fades and becomes confused it was mars the moslems took neptune waslet me think nowthat went to the australians yes now i have it straight i experienced queasiness that interrupted my chain of thought described above i tend to think too much as i may have confessed before say fun spirit exclaimed brightly against my helmet were passing out of the lens true enough the lens concentrated gravity in maraud to earth normal but outside the dome gravity thinned out since this was the depressed area three or four times as broad as the dome gravity doesnt come from nothing after all now we were coming into the true natural surface attraction of callisto which was a little more than a quarter earth norm from one gee to onetenth gee to onequarter geeit was vaguely like riding ocean waves i have not had direct experience with any large body of water but can imagine it maybe we were riding gravity waves the outer surface of callisto is bleak barren and frankly dull our world is the most heavily cratered significant body in the solar system for the past billion years of new meteoric strikes have only replaced old craters with new ones not changing the total number one might suppose this would make for a singularly variegated terrain but that is not so right here on the surface it simply wasnt that interesting on other planets there may be deep oceans and high jagged peaks not so callisto and our sister planet ganymede these are two iceball worlds of low overall density because of the ice and though the surface is crusted with rock and dust the thick mantle of ice below prevents any really spectacular mountains from forming im not sure im getting this across you see ice is as hard and stable as any other rock at the local temperature of degrees kelvinim not as good at figures as geography but thats an easy one to remember one hundred degrees celsius above absolute zerobut at the local noon which of course has no relation to the earth time we use inside the domes it can be fifty degrees warmer and deep down below the pressure can heat it some too so in the course of millions of years that ice does soften and flow a little this planet has been around for four billion years or so so the flow obliterates the extreme features result shallow rounded craters standing as it were shoulder to shoulder rim to rim and one inside another and overlapping this world is made of craters and none of them are any effort to navigate there are no cutting edges on callisto you might say the features of the surface have been eroded by water not water coursing over from above as on earth but slowly squeezing out from below thats why we were moving along so well in our wheeled vehicle there was very little natural obstruction the sky was more interesting this was night on the surface as well as inside the dome but jupiter was full and his baleful light flooded the rolling rills of valhalla jupiter was anything but dull with his violently contrasting bands of atmosphere and the various gaseous eyes staring at us surely jove was watching our puny efforts with disdainbut he was our destination i was of course sorry to leave my home world for all my experience was invested here on callisto and all my prior hopes for success had been defined by the halfcal culture and hierarchy but i knew that in those bands of turbulent color on the jovian planet was opportunity as vast as jupiter himself we would certainly be better off there we would no longer be peasants there i looked directly up trying to see the other gravity lens the one above us close such lenses dont just fix the gravity inside the domes they govern the light we receive this can be hard for people who dont reside on moons to understand so ill try to make it simple light is affected by gravity technically the curvature of space that we call gravity so a lens that bends gravity waves also bends light waves properly formed a large gravity lens can be used to focus the light of the distant sun on a smaller area making it proportionally more intense theres a lot of energy in light as a magnifying glass can demonstrate when used to set fire to things since the suns light is much less intense out here at jupiters orbit than it is at earths orbit we need to focus it to match what our bodies and our plants are used to we are all transplants from earth really though we may have been born or seeded here a few centuries cant erase a few billion years of evolution so above each domecity is a huge gravity lens that is twentyseven times the area of the dome and the lens focuses the wan sunlight to that amount and it shines in through the domes transparent roof to light and warm the city exactly as would be the case on earth well not exactly earths copious atmosphere filters out many deleterious aspects of the radiation so our twentyseventimesconcentrated sunlight would burn us if we took it straight but the material of the dome is designed to filter out the harmful radiation substituting for the missing depth of atmosphere and so the net effect is similar the same is true for the agricultural domes they are literally greenhouses this is convenient to do on an airless planet since nobody lives outside to complain about being deprived of sunlight naturally the focused brilliance at the dome is at the expense of the twentyseventimesaslarge area around it which receives very little light we had not noticed any difference because we pedaled through this zone at night but it would have been night by day also near the dome if you see what i mean its really more complicated than that because callistos day is the same as its period of revolution around jupiter sixteen and twothirds earth days one facehalfcalsalways faces jupiter the other always faces space so we have eight and a third days of continuous light and then a night just as long we humans dont like that it doesnt match our biological rhythm so we exchange light with a sister city around the globe san pedro in the dominant republic san pedro is always in darkness when maraud has light and vice versa so theres always sunlight one place or the other we never have clouds or bad weather of course the way earth does in fact we have no weather at all when maraud is in sun we use it for twelve hours then refract it around the planet in the form of a concentrated light beam using a chain of vertical gravity lenses to san pedro in this manner we have our night in the middle of the callistian day while they have their day in the middle of their night when they are light they send us twelvehour segments of daylight this is the most fundamental and absolute system of cooperation between the two nations of our planet and is inviolate if halfcal and the dominant republic went to war with each otherand sometimes historically it has come to that for we are a bickering cultureneither would abrogate the light exchange without it life as we know it would be virtually impossible on callisto we depend on the sun for almost all our energy for we have no great deposits of oil or uranium and lack the technical and industrial base to establish a hydrogenfusion power plant but my glancing was wasted for the huge elevated gravity lens was not visible not only did it operate only in daylight it was not physical at all it was generated in space forming between key points there was nothing to see still my eye sought it out much as it sought the gaze of a person in a picture looking in another direction this foolishness is inherent in my nature i seek constantly to relate to people and things directly even when i suspect it is unwise or impossible my attention wandered to the other large moons of jupiter all closer in than ours ganymede off to the side of the colossus its brightness at threequarter face it was almost halfway in toward jupiter from our vantage that is its orbit is just over one million kilometers out while callistos is just under two million we would pass that inner orbit on our way to jupiter but would not pass close to ganymede itself because it revolved about the planet more than twice as fast as we did and would rush to the far side when our bubble passed as if avoiding us just as well the recent political revolution there seemed to have made things even worse for peasants than before as the ancient poet coleridge put it they burst their manacles and wear the name of freedom graven on a heavier chain but of course europa was little better while the innermost big moon io zooming all the way around jupiter in less than two earth days was hardly habitable even with terraform domes no no hope for us on the other moons down near the horizon behind us i spied a speck of light i didnt recognize it wasnt a star for it was moving shifting somewhat erratically above the landscape as if guided by some human hand saucer i exclaimed whats it doing out here at night for there was very little interdome travel by night as callisto is essentially a hinterworld with no major industry other than agriculture unlike the hyperactive denizens of major worlds we preferred to sleep at night the maraud authorities wouldnt chase us would they spirit asked my parents were consulting with each other helmet to helmet but i couldnt hear their dialogue to my annoyance shouldnt i agreed tersely were not breaking any law were just leaving the city as ordered and the planet she added if they found out about thatand they might suspect the way we snuck out maybe i agreed uneasily i would have disparaged the notion out of handsince i knew the maraud authorities did not care about usexcept for the fact of the saucer there had to be some reason for it to be out here and we could not safely assume that reason had nothing to do with us the light zoomed toward us in moments we recognized a private pickup craft used by explorers to collect samples of minerals from the planets surface callisto was extremely shy of heavy minerals which made them all the more valuable prospectors were constantly ranging out with metal detectors to search for what few nuggets there were a lode of iron ore could make a mans fortune even mineral dust was far more valuable on callisto than it was elsewhere except on ganymede most of our metals had to be imported from the inner planets of the solar system and even with the gravity shields that was expensive this craft was typical it had a nether power scoop and a fairsized storage compartment and a sealed cockpit with windows looking forward upward and down that meant the occupant did not have to suffer the inconvenience of wearing a space suit the way we peasants did cheaper saucers were not sealed they might be hardly more than flying platforms and a miscue could dump the operator off not so this one i envied whoever could afford this sort of vehicle sealed afloat instead of suited and landbound like us the saucer came right up to us evidently using a metal detector to spy us out the metal was the main value in a pedal car it could be melted down and lose only a fraction of its price and it would be very easy to spy from the dome however there was not a great deal of metal here for most of the transporters mass was plastic for a saucer to come out in the hope of salvaging a vehicle like thisno that didnt make much sense it all came back to the original question why would anyone be looking for us legal or illegali think our status was now hazywe remained only refugees nothing people completely unimportant to anyone except ourselves the saucer paused to hover directly over us putting us in shadow that hardly mattered we werent trying to draw on jupiters pale radiance for power then a bright beam of light speared down at us from a unit by the cockpit blinding to our jovelightacclimatized eyes it found us and blinked off and on again rapidly several times the saucer was signaling us it was of course impossible to communicate by sound through the vacuum when there was no direct physical contact saucers used radios to talk to each other and the city domes but of course we didnt have a radio we didnt have a flashlight either and in any event didnt know the blinking communication code we didnt have anything that wasnt essential to our progress across the surface or our journey through space because everything cost precious money we were unable to make any meaningful response so my father just waved and pedaled on the nether hatch in the saucer opened the scoop pincers descended slightly holding something they were going to drop us a message the pincers descended in order to get below the gravlens it was possible for objects to pass right through it without interfering with its function gravity does not obey ordinary rules once below the pincers cranked open to release the message capsule it was a brightorange cylinder that seemed almost to glow even in the shadow suddenly our transporter swerved violently to the left i was jammed into the right wall of the vehicle we must have hit a craterlet craters arent all landscapesized they graduate on down to pinhead size and some of those can be almost as deep as they are broad they have less mass to flatten them outno im wrong how can a hole have massor maybe it is that they are fresher so have not yet melted down to gentleness geologically speaking any crater less than a million years old is an infant born yesterday yet my father surely would have seen it and avoided it anyway it was a bad jolt spirit perched high had to grab my head to keep from being flung out of the vehicle i must recreate what followed partly from logic as my entanglement with spirit prevented me from paying full attention the message capsule missed us and struck the rock to our right it exploded on contact gouging out a new little crater that one really was fresh the impact of the flying debris bounced off our vehicle and the expanding gas shoved the transporter across the sand we were very lucky no sand holed our suits that capsule was no messageat least not the kind we had anticipated that was a bomb chapter fight for life belatedly i remembered that capsules were colorcoded in an obvious manner as it could be exceedingly awkward to open them in a vacuum to check their contents glaring orange was the code for explosives explosives are normally used for excavation work it is not feasible to light fuses or whatever in a vacuumoh yes they do have a fuse that burns in empty space with its own oxygen built inbut it takes special equipment to start it going so most small explosives are contactdetonated the effect of this one did not seem great but of course this was a minicharge and the debris settled out almost instantly because there was no air to buoy it had that bomb struck our transporter those of us who were not directly injured would have died from suit destruction even a little bomb is devastating when it detonates in your face my father had caught on and swerved just in time we had struck no craterlet the saucer swerved to get above us again i saw its pincers holding another bomb there was now no doubt about its hostile intent but though the immediacy of the threat somehow abated the fear i should naturally have felt my curiosity remained undimmed who was trying to do this to us and why my father swerved again and braked and the second bomb missed us to the left front this time all of us were hanging on firmly so neither the swerving nor the jolt of the ground from the explosion dislodged us the forward bumper took the brunt of the flying debris and we all ducked low so the rest passed harmlessly overhead this was nervous business though sand is sharp and while space suits are tough they arent that tough still the saucer pursued it was more maneuverable than we were and faster i knew we could not escape it long i didnt know how many bombs it had but all it needed was one score on our vehicle each cylinder was small and the saucers hold could contain hundreds of them weight wouldnt make much difference with the gravity shielding a full hold weighed about the same as an empty one the pincers carefully lowered each bomb below the shield before releasing it as i mentioned otherwise instead of dropping the cylinder would remain in the chamber until it banged into something there and that gave me a notion if i could somehow jam a bomb back into the hold or set it off before it dropped i got out my laser and took a shot but the two vehicles were jogging about so violently relative to each otherim sure it was mostly us but it seemed at the time like the saucer which is a useful exercise in perspectivethat i couldnt aim well and i missed i wasnt at all sure the laser beam would detonate the bomb anyway light and heat were one thing abrupt collision was another in any event if the bomb did explode above us shrapnel could rain down on us and wipe us out even if it also took out the saucer what good would it do us then maybe it was best that i had failed i had no business depleting the charge in the weapon uselessly the third bomb missed behind us as my father accelerated once more outsmarting the saucer pilot actually it is very hard to align with an erratic target pure chance gave us the advantage if you consider having a chance to survive such a threat an advantage the saucer was in no danger it was the aggressor these misses were too close i knew they couldnt go on much longer then spirit jammed her helmet against mine look she yelled the ice caves she meant the excavations made by the city of maraud to mine clean ice a community of a hundred thousand people needed a lot of water and the recyclers were always breaking down and it was too expensive to replace them with new and reliable ones so it was simpler just to quarry the water out of the ground if there is one thing callisto has in abundance it is ice the bedrock ice is very close to the surface in some places and here there was a combination stripandtunnel mine the top ice at this site was blended with minerals but the deep ice was as clean as nature had formed it four billion years ago huge chunks of it were blasted free with bombs similar to those being used against us now and gravity shields were used to float the icebergs to the dome where smaller pieces were cut and taken inside for melting and using there was always an iceberg perched near the dome our guarantee that one thing we would never suffer was thirst i leaned over to touch helmets with my father who was intent on his pedaling steering and the saucer he was really working hard but he kept his helmet still for me the ice caves i shouted we can hide in them get rope he yelled back and i realized he had been angling for this all along i didnt know what good rope would do but i scrambled out of my seat and across faith in the back delving for the flexible cable every outside vehicle had for towing and such in a moment i found it as the vehicle swerved in crazy patterns preventing the saucer from getting a good line on us i realized the saucer was floating too high so my father could see when the capsules were being released and could dodge out of the way before they arrived things didnt fall very rapidly out here in quartergee faster than they would in atmosphere of course as the prompt settling of the dust showed but any distance made the slower pattern of natural acceleration evident human reactions geared for earthtype acceleration were quite ready to cope with callisto acceleration the saucer however was catching on first it angled toward the ice mine as if to block us off from it then realizing that this ploy was ineffective because we could zigzag toward the mine anyway the saucer floated lower so as to cut the fall time and prevent us from dodging effectively my father made a throwgesture with a free arm and i caught on i could use the rope against the saucer it had been floating too high for the rope to reach before but now it was coming down close enough my father was still outthinking it i made a lasso noose as i eyed the saucer if i could loop that extended pincers i could put it and the saucer out of commission the lower the saucer got the more in reach it got i flung the loop but missed i wasnt experienced at this i didnt know how to lasso a moving object in lowgee the dynamics were all wrong in addition that hovering bomb made me excruciatingly nervous if it dropped now could i catch itand do so gently enough to prevent it from detonating i doubted it spirit climbed back to join me moving lithely she always had been an active type able to fling herself about like a little monkey she put her helmet against mine dad says jump she cried and desert the family i retorted no with the rope dummy here ill do it she reached for the lasso then i understood in lowgee we could jump much higher than normal it wasnt as simple as jumping four times as high in onequarter gee it depended on technique and the center of body mass i hadnt had much practice at this either but i had a general notion as the saucer swooped low lower and closer than before i launched myself upward carrying the loop of rope in both hands i imagined myself a rocket jetting from a planetary berth with an important payload it felt like straight up but of course it was at an angle with the inertia of the vehicles forward motion slanting me there was no atmospheric drag to slow me i shot straight for the saucer i was amazed though i shouldnt have been the power of my leap should have taken me up a meter within the dome which translated to somewhere in the vicinity of four meters here allowing for the uncertainties of the situation that was how high the saucer now floated i came right up under the bomb and with my two hands looped the rope around the extended pincers then i fell away to the side slowlyand saw to my horror that i had dislodged the bomb or at least failed to prevent it from being released i grabbed for it but that was futile i was already out of reach and it was falling at the same rate i was it was traveling right toward the transporter i watched helplessly as that terrible cylinder descended time dilated for me everything was in slow motion my family faced destructionand i could only watch then spirit jumped up and caught the bright capsule in her hands still aloft she flung it from her behind the vehicle she had been alert bless her and had done what i could not once again she had backstopped me and perhaps saved us all the bomb exploded as spirit and i landed on either side of the transporter both of us managed to get turned to face forward and hit the ground running for we still had that forward inertia it was rough but i managed to keep my balance and so did she we jogged to clumsy stops well behind the transporter the rope was tied to the saucer pincers at one end and anchored to the land vehicle at the other the two machines were tied together the three oldest hubrises were in the transporterand who was in the saucer spirit rejoined me touching helmets sierra she said what my mind was distracted by more important things than her chance remarks the scion on the saucer suddenly it came clear the one we had humiliated naturally he was out to get revenge and he had not been satisfied with our departure from the dome of maraud out here at night he could destroy us and get away with it we had fled the dome of our own volition leaving the protection of its law such as it was we had become fair targets there wouldnt even be any inquiries sierra must have been keeping track of us unsatisfied without the taste of blood the arrogance of scions was almost beyond belief a personal humiliation by a peasant was justification for murder in this persons view but not open murder for then it would be known that he had acted in a cowardly manner bombing a pedalpowered vehicle from a saucer the nature of his humiliation might also become known so his revenge had to be private and complete yes it made sense at last the saucer wrenched upward as its pilot realized that something was wrongand it skewed crazily as it snapped on the end of its tether the rope provided with outdome vehicles is tough for it has to stand up to the abrasion of sharp rocks and the stress of hauling a vehicle out of a mine cavein that saucer could not break free with a gravity lens a saucer can lift any amount that will fit in its hold because the load has no weightprovided the lens is between the load and the planet but the rope anchored the saucer to the transporter below the lens with its full quartergee weight this was too much to lift the propulsive rockets werent designed for significant lifting only forward thrust what a lovely trap with its pincers unit immobilized the saucer couldnt drop any more bombs we had muzzled it as well as tethering it because the pilot was sealed inside he couldnt go to the airless cargo hold to untie or cut the rope not unless he had a space suitwhich was unlikely trying to scramble into one of those bulky things in the confines of a cockpit was so awkward as to be something a scion would not consider anyway on the other hand we couldnt let the saucer go without being in trouble again it was similar to the way i had grabbed the scions foot really incapacitating us both only then hed drawn the laser oops if he had a laser now no that seemed unlikely no laser cannon was mounted on the saucer itself as lasers werent very useful for cutting this ice of the mine it simply melted flowed and refroze in an instant absorbing an enormous amount of energy in the process it takes as much energy for a laser to do its work as it does to do the work any other way there is no such thing as free power other than what we draw from the sunlight so the ice had to be cut physically without wasteful heating anyway if the scion had had a laser he would have used it instead of the clumsy blasting cylinders so it seemed we really had evened the odds then my mind which never knows when to stop brought up another thought the scion could have a laser in the cockpit but not have used it because that would have holed up our suits and killed us without destroying the evidence of the murder a person or a family could run afoul of blasting cylinders by error perhaps but there had to be another party to fire a laser at five separate people so i could not afford any complacency on that score the transporter reached the ice mine hauling the saucer along on its tether on the shallowcrater region of the planet the saucer had the advantage when it was loose for there was no place for a vehicle to hide or avoid it but the mine was deep convoluted and jagged not having had the necessary billion years or so to melt into anonymity this terrain was no picnic for a ground vehicle but it was downright dangerous for a lowflying saucer on a tether if we let the scion go here he would probably just have to float home but if we did that and the saucer did not go home we would be trapped in the mine unable to proceed to our rendezvous with the bubble safety in the mine was no good when we had a time limit for crossing the landscape the saucer could hover indefinitely outwaiting us we had no great supplies of food or water and in any event had to reach the bootleg bubble before it departed without us so we had to hang onto the saucer but could we haul it all the way to the bubble that was unlikelyand if we did the operator of the bubble might decide to take off before we arrived fearful that the saucer represented the authority of an official our predicament had changed its nature but not its urgency my father was no expert driver since few peasants ever got much practice with vehicles of any type and his legs had to be tired from all that pedaling but he was strongly motivated spirit and i came to the brink of the mine and watched the action there were roads winding around and down past tiers of blank ice walls and the whole cavity was like a giant inverted dome with high ridges of icerock projecting between many of the levels and spires rising where there were turnarounds any of these could smash up the saucer pretty badly if it happened to be unlucky enough to collide with them the gravity lens made the saucer light but it could not change its mass a crackup would be just as devastating as one in full gravity the winding roads were designed for exactly the kind of vehicle my father was driving by no coincidence so now he had the advantage of the terrain he wheeled around the spires dragging the saucer along trying to snag it on a projection he knew it was not safe to let the saucer go and he was not a forgiving man the scion had tried to kill him he would now try to put away the scion i felt a certain horrified elation of battle and pride for my father he was normally a reasonable man but the time for reason had passed spirit and i had humiliated sierra before my father was out to finish him but the saucer followed skillfully maneuvering around the obstructions keeping the rope slack scions had plenty of leisure to learn to master their craft this one floated with precision i saw that this tactic wasnt going to be enough there were too many open spaces in the mine and the moment the saucer had the chance to get clear as it might by snagging the rope on a sharp edge of icerock so that it would saw through the rope or if there were any alternate way to drop a bomb my eye was distracted by spirits motion there were whole piles of icerock fragments that had been bulldozed clear of the roads and she was checking through one she was always curious about things how could i blame her i had the same attitude she saw me watching and made a throwing motion emptyhanded then i caught on these rocks were weapons we started in with a will hurling headsized rocks at the saucer the quartergravity and irregular edges made it easier to grasp and throw large pieces but they didnt go very fast and our aim wasnt very good again we faced the problem of mass weight is only one element of substance one of its many dimensions and it was as hard to accelerate a large chunk here as it would have been in full gee maybe harder for the weight we did heft caused our muscles to assume that this was the amount of mass we had to throw so we constantly misjudged it soon we shifted to smaller chunks and schooled ourselves to overthrow and then we got the range and power and began scoring on the saucer as it trailed the transporter in a diminishing spiral down into the center of the mine those rocks might be light and slow but they were as ornery in their stopping as in their starting and solid enough to dent the saucers metal hide and shake the whole mass of it as they struck a bomb exploded below the saucer and we knew one of our rocks had jogged it out of the hold those capsules were only lightly anchored so that the pincers could take them without risk of setting them off now they were being shaken loose and that could mean a whole lot of trouble for the pilot still it wasnt good enough the saucer was getting too far away from us so our rocks were losing accuracy and effect we had to keep up the distraction or it would get above the transporter and shake loose a bomb this would be difficult and risky with its pincers incapacitated but if any bombs were floating free in its hold the scion needed to get rid of them anyway certainly it was too much of a risk for us to tolerate that wasnt just a transporter down there that was our family we jumped down the slopes bounding from level to level as each was separated from the next by only two or three meters soon we were back in range because we were going straight in while the vehicles were traveling in spirals a straight line really is the shortest distance between two points then i saw that they were approaching a major staging area where the various vehicles normally operating in the mine could load and turn around here the saucer would have plenty of maneuvering room im sure my father would have avoided this region but he lacked our vantage and probably could not see it coming and in any event his road was curving right to it without any turnoff we had to resume our barrage keeping the saucer occupied but as they entered the clear area while spirit and i desperately hurled more icerocks the saucer dropped almost to the floor of the mine had its gravity lens malfunctioned i doubted it because those units were very stable and reliable they resembled in a fashion permanent magnets and lasted almost indefinitely once activated requiring no external source of power that was part of what made them so useful a gravity lens is like a sail on an ancient earth ship a tool to utilize the forces around it a sail taps the immense power of moving air a lens does the same with the ubiquitous gravity in the universe neither sail nor lens is likely to break down if properly used a beam speared out from the saucer oh no my mental reservation had been correct the scion did have another hand laser and now he was firing through the transparent forward port this was not the most effective way to use a laser because of the dispersion caused by the glass but even a weakened beam could readily hole a suit presumably the exigency of the moment forced the scion to get out of this trap any way he could maybe if he killed my father with the laser he would then have leisure to shake loose a bomb and cover up the evidence the threat was immediate spirit touched her helmet to mine ill foul the glass she cried you cant go down there i protested i should have known better she was already taking off carrying an ice stone spirit seldom let the voice of reason stand in the way of direct action i leaped after her knowing this was folly the scions laser would spear her before she ever got close to the glass but she had a lead on me and she was an athletic elf and i couldnt catch her we both went tumblerunning down almost on top of the saucer carrying our rocks spirit took a final leap and landed on the low saucer she had excellent spacial judgment that way i did not i missed naturally she was affected by the gravity lens when she touched the saucers surface the typical lens makes an onionshaped distortion in the gravitywave pattern into which the saucer or other object using the lens nestles above that distortion narrows and winks out as the gravity pattern reasserts itself gravity is powerful ornery stuff despite its reputation as the weakest of the four universal forces it can never be actually abolished it can only be channeled slightly if this were not so true gravity shields would disrupt the natural order horribly imagine the havoc that could be wrought in an atmosphere for example the gas above the shield would be literally blown out of its world by the pressure of the surrounding gas perhaps a monstrous whirlpool or tornado would form around that dreadful leak funneling the atmosphere out into space until it all was gone leaving the planet denuded and as naked as was callisto lenses would be terrible weapons with the potential to suffocate whole inhabited worlds an enemy could simply drop a lens from space and let it wreak its havoc as it descended since it itself would be subject to natural gravity and not be thrown clear of the planet well maybe it would have to be tied down to prevent being sucked up by the tornado it caused a minor detail and of course the first huge crude lenses had caused considerable mischief since their oniontops had projected so high that there was some of that tornado effect but fortunately the modern lenses were crafted to wink out at their tops fairly expeditiously just a few meters from their lenses and very little atmosphere was affected here on an airless world that didnt matter of course but it remained to my mind a significant matter the colossus jupiter would hardly allow lenses to be used on the moons that had the potential to disrupt jupiters own atmosphere if dumped there accidentally or otherwise there is obviously much politics in physics at any rate spirit lost her weight and had trouble staying on the saucer then she caught hold of the ladderdents that were there for workers and was secure the dents actually curved inside the skin of the saucer so that fingerholds were convenient sometimes it was necessary for a person in a suit to ride a saucer outside as when helping to load it so that was facilitated a weightless person could normally support himself by one finger even the slightest anchorage was all that was necessary i came to the foot of the slope and tried to be inconspicuous i didnt know what to do at the moment but had to be ready to do whatever offered when it offered i couldnt throw rocks for fear of hitting my sister yet if i didnt that laser might get her i was terrified for spirit but was helpless i should clarify that the telling of this requires much more time than the action did obviously the saucer was not sitting there quiescently for ten minutes while we set up to smudge its window it may have been as little as thirty seconds while the scion was trying to get into better position for a killing shot at my father spirit squirmed across the saucer roof awkward in her suit then she reached down to the front vision port and smeared her icerock across it the glass was super tough and scratchresistant but some of the dust in the ice smeared maybe enough heat from the cabin radiated through the glass to cause the surface of the ice to melt a little it took the scion inside a moment to realize what was happening maybe he had felt the impact of spirits landing and assumed it was another big rock the saucer was now so low that i could see his shape behind the glass then furious he aimed his hand laser at spirit i dont remember digging out my own laser again the one i had ironically acquired from him after our first encounter and tried to use to detonate one of the bombs i had had it fastened in a compartment in my suit belt now it was in my hand as if possessed of its own volition i pointed it at the glass steadied my hand and squeezed off a ray i dont think my beam could have had any deadly effect i had only a minilaser with a little power and the angle wasnt good and the glass was dirty thanks to spirits continuing effort but the ray could have splayed as it passed through the glass and temporarily blinded the scion inside at any rate he didnt fire again and spirit was able to finish her smearing job without getting her suit holed no thanks to her impetuosity i scrambled across and pulled her off the saucer at last not wanting her to take any more such chances we have to get away from here before he radios for help i yelled as we touched helmets she nodded understanding we moved to the transporter where my father was unloading he knew we couldnt get that vehicle out of danger in time uphill around and around the spiral roads of the mine we had to abandon ship as it were we all got our belongings into our packs and strapped the packs on then my father started the transporter fixing its steering wheel and sent it rolling down a slope toward a dropoff as the brink neared he disengaged from the pedals and jumped free letting the vehicles inertia carry it and the trailing saucer over the edge down the steep embankment beyond the staging area with luck both it and the saucer would wreck and any pursuers would assume we all were deadat least until it was too late to matter but the wrench did not drag the saucer down the rope broke maybe it had been frayed in the course of the descent into the mine the saucer drifted free at last dangling a meter of rope its pincers twisted crooked it could not drop bombs but once its occupant recovered that saucer could be dangerous again too bad i thought ungraciously my father led the way through the mine he had been here before in his youth he had worked here before he got the more pleasant and safer job in the coffee dome i realized that age could be an advantage it provided time for broader experience the particular configurations of the mine would have changed considerably in the intervening years but not its basic nature we saw two lights coming over the mines horizon there were the scions allies probably other spoiled rich arrogant youths like him i jogged my fathers arm and pointed he looked and broke into a run we followed though running is not fun in space suits its not the weight but the clumsiness since they are not as flexible as human bodies and one must run spraddlelegged but we had to get to cover in a hurry soon we came to a sort of crevice in the ice wall broad enough for a man to enter we plunged in getting out of view of the saucers and worked our way along it until we were safe from any discovery from above we were lost in the deep shadow of the crack in the ice this was just as well for through the crack i could see one of the saucers casting about they were looking for us certainly the crevice closed in tighter so that we had to squeeze along in single file i began to get claustrophobic i was somehow afraid the separation in the ice would close up again crushing everything within it of course i knew better callisto is a dead world as these things go with no volcanism or plate tectonics even a tiny crack could remain undisturbed for a billion years if man did not interfere such fears are not rational but the perception of their irrationality does not necessarily make them depart i willed myself to react sensibly the planet presented no danger but the saucers did that ice as we slid along the walls was extremely solid and cold i felt its chill through my suit psychologically the space suits were insulated and heated charged for fortyeight hours of continuous usewhich was more than enough since we had only twenty hours to reach the bubble to be sure of catching it before takeoff and there more than likely was the real source of my chill we had used up two hoursand lost our vehicle here we were stuck in an ice crevice how could we ever reach the escape bubble in time then we squeezed into a regular tunnel the workmen had reamed out this section of the crevice preparatory to the next blast it was much easier to break off an iceberg along natural lines of cleavage cracking it away largely without heat but the charges had to be correctly placed or the whole thing would break up into clumsy fragments i understand there is a whole science of ice blasting that it takes many years to master as with any really specialized discipline the acquisition of water is too important to be entrusted to amateurs the tunnel cut deep into the bedrock ice then stairstepped up to the surface there was no sign of the saucers they had evidently given up the unpromising pursuit uncertain after all whether we survived the demise of our vehicle and satisfied to get the scion back to the city before he got into any more trouble that was our good fortune we had precious little other fortune though we would have an awful time crossing the surface of the barren planet afoot within our time limit my father pointed the direction to the center of the valhalla crater he had a good sense of direction but it really wasnt difficult to fathom what we needed all we had to do was proceed at right angles to the low rills that circled it of course we werent going all the way to the centerfar from itbut this direction would take us to the smaller crater where the bubble was kilroy crater we started off making great lowgee bounds we had a long way to go and not enough time maybe at first it was easy enough we covered many meters between landings despite the clumsiness of our suits we sailed over the rolling ridges and down through shallow troughs there is a technique to moving rapidly in low gee and we were necessarily acquiring it there is also a certain exhilaration to such velocity a sensation of power i thought of myself as some alien creature who existed naturally in these barrens leaping from site to site searching out some completely inexplicableinhumanterms item but anything becomes tedious or tiring in time my pack became heavier my suit started chafing in awkward places the burns i had received from the scions laser in the dome chose this time to make themselves felt more insistently and i wished i could stop but of course i couldnt the alien creature i had imagined had more freedom and fewer pains it deserted me the moment it tired of this quest and went to some more interesting site i think it used instantaneous matter transmission to jump to another galaxy a technology mankind has not yet developed and probably never will thats the problem with alien creatures they make us look inadequate our pace slowed not because of me but because of my mother she was not used to sustaining such high exertion if i found this travel uncomfortable how much worse it must be for her i went to help her but she shrugged me off it wasnt foolish pride on her partthere has never been anything foolish about charity hubrisso much as awkwardness two could not jump as freely as one then spirit came and took her right elbow and i the left and after a few stumbles we were able to move together and boost her along fairly expeditiously still we had kilometers to go in less than a day we were traveling a good ten kilometers per hour so theoretically we had timebut we did need to rest eat and even sleep some time and that cut us down it was foolish to reckon without the fatigue factor i now realized we had been busy all day getting ready to travel and would ordinarily have been sleeping now after three hours we had indeed covered over thirty kilometers by my reckoningbut that was the first flush of energy i was no longer sure i could make the full distance at all let alone in the time remaining certainly my mother could not that damned scion in the saucer had succeeded after all in wiping us out that must have been why there was no further pursuit he knew we could not make it afoot my brain seethed with impotent rage if we missed the bubble because of him if the foul scion won after all then what we would have nowhere to go and no way to get there we could not return to maraud and no other dome was within our range we would die in the barrens of valhalla i smiled with my private gallows humor our ragnarok was at valhalla we sat on a rock resting eating was complicated in the suits and so was elimination we knew how to do both but the whole business did take attention and time and wasnt much fun we started off again at a slower pace because of my mother i didnt know whether to be glad for the relief it gave me or sad because it made it ever less likely that we would reach the bubble in time we were locked into our situation what would be would be it was doom that we contemplated but i found myself too busy just keeping moving to suffer proper gloom in literature i had learned that work was supposed to be an answer to doubt and this seemed to be the case it takes effort to doubt and i did not have effort to spare for such a nonessential still some of it did leak through to my consciousness we traveled another three hours by this time it was obvious to us all that we would not make it we stopped again weary and my father beckoned spirit and me to him for a helmet conference while faith and my mother helped each other well camp here my father said the two of you will stand watch while the women sleep watch spirit demanded what for other refugees my father said succinctly spirit and i exchanged glances through our helmets i suffered another surge of admiration for the foresight of my father of course there would be other people traveling to the bubble from maraud and other domes it would hardly fill its load with just the five of us assuming it even knew we were coming we were now far enough along so that those other families should be converging on our route if any of them had goodsized vehicles and certainly some should spirit and i abruptly recharged got on it with a will we were not dead yet we not only watched we ranged out in an expanding circle she going one way i the other we leaped as high as we could from the surrounding ridges though these werent really very high trying to spot any moving thing i must say this about spirit she was twelve a child but she was always great to work with she had enthusiasm and competence and enough savvy to operate effectively i liked doing things with her such shared tasks always seemed to have more meaning than those i did with other people or alone maybe she was just trying to live up to her name as she interpreted it if so she succeeded admirably she was a child but i hardly knew her like among children or adults i fancied her dark hair flinging out as she bounded though of course there could be no such effect out here in the vacuum or in the space suit it was just the way i saw her in my mind i realize it is not fashionable to remark about ones little sister in this manner but i decline to let fashion interfere with truth we spied nothing more hours went by and the glare of jupiter seemed to turn baleful and our enthusiasm was slowly replaced by dread we came in to reportand discovered that faiths suit had sprung another leak actually it was the same leak the patch wasnt holding quite tight it was intended for temporary use to hold an hour or two until the suit could be brought in for permanent repair and now it was giving out she had her hand on it holding it closed but that only slowed the leakage and it was obvious she would not be able to travel well we couldnt even return safely to maraud now even if it happened to be politically feasible which it didnt that patch simply would not make it that far we did have other patches but it is bad business trying to patch a leaky patch and the effort tends to be wasted spirit and i went out again we had to find transportation to the bubble she spied it first with her sharp eyes and intense juvenile attention for detail a shape floating over a distant ridge she waved frantically attracting my attention and then i saw it at first i felt dread was it the scions saucer coming to finish us off no it was too large anyway even if it had been the scions saucer or that of one of his companions we still would have had to approach it we would perish out here alone so we simply had to take the chance we bounded after the shape we caught it for it was traveling slantwise past us so that we were able to intercept its path without matching its velocity it slowed and hovered in place waiting for us what a lovely sight i stood bathed in the light of its headlamp and pointed the direction of the rest of my family the floater moved in that direction it was a large vehicle a supply transport presumably bringing food and water and fuel to the bootleg bubble in that case we were really in luck my guess turned out to be correct but our luck was imperfect the pilot held up a sign with a figure printed on it the payment they demanded for the service of transporting us to the bubble truly has it been said there is no free lunch we had to pay we had no choice but it left us no margin after allowing for the thousanddollar entry fee to the bubble itself we were now essentially all the way broke yet the ride itself was fun and not merely because it represented our salvation from death in the vacuum they didnt let us inside we clung to handholds atop the vehicle and floated in its onionfield of nullgee over the terrain in three more hours we were there could we have made it on our own i like to think we could havebut i really am uncertain what counts is that we did get there chapter bubble bubble callisto orbit we stood before the bubble at last i was excruciatingly tired but excitement fended off my fatigue for the moment the bubble most resembled a cratered planetoid only the craters were actually recessed ports sealed with tough spaceglass the globe sat on the ground but i knew its gravity lenses abated most of its weight so it was actually featherlight it was about ten times my height im less than two meters tall but still growing call it a good sixteen meters for the diameter of the sphere its hard to judge with the naked eye but thats a standard size for small space bubbles they arent uniform actually because their patterns of growth differ but they do run pretty true to form the idea was that such a sphere would be halved with one section reserved for equipment supplies baggage and such and the other half providing eight cubic meters of living space to each of one hundred passengers it all worked out mathematically i had studied it in school but it was different seeing the great dull hulk of it looming before me blotting out part of the horizon the air lock opened and we scrambled in the supply vehicle had a separate lock designed for things that didnt need oxygen or air pressure for survival my father had had to deposit our shorthop payment there before we got our ride the bubble locks outer panel slid closed behind us and our weight decreased to about half its prior amount because of the effect of the shielding the pressure came up making our suits go slack faith was finally able to relax her hold on the leaky patch and straighten up that must have been a tremendous burden off her mind how many a voice demanded from a speaker it was good to hear normal speech again five my father said lifting back his helmet the rest of us did the same fifteen hundred dollars cash in advance the voice said my mother gasped we were told two hundred apiece my father said evenly the price has gone up pay or leave we knew we couldnt leave but we didnt have the money it had been all we could do to raise what we had i saw the little lines of desperation form in my fathers cheek but his voice was admirably steady we havent got it you should have sent word then get out no freeloaders here my father paused signaling us to silence then he said put your helmets back on folks they dont want our money well have to take another bubble in shock i fumbled at my helmet faiths face was as pale as death she knew she would die if she had to go out again but at the same time i knew my father was bluffing he would not let us all go out i looked at spirit and knew the same thought had come to her if the fee was now three hundred dollars each only three of us could go two would have to return to maraud my father and mother would sacrifice themselves to get the three children aboard but that wasnt right slowly her little face set with unchildish intensity spirit nodded answering my unasked question we were the youngest and most adaptable we would volunteer to return so that our parents could go after all we were the ones who had humiliated the scion and brought this trouble upon our family we were the ones most deserving of punishment we could conceal our identity somehow in maraud or maybe go to the coffee plantation the notion was not pleasant but it was viable you really dont have the fee the voice asked sounding disgusted only the fee we were told my father replied one thousand dollars in gold the supply vehicle took the rest to carry us here in gold in gold we had to liquidate everything we had thats enough for three and some for extras i opened my mouth but my father put his hand out to silence me without even looking how well he knew me there will be other bubbles he said we can wait for the next and perhaps its fee will not have changed our family travels together there was a sigh well for good gold it will have to do hand it over not without guarantee of passage for our whole family my father said firmly we must stay together unity is more important than schedule i knew my mother felt that way but with faiths suit leak compromise seemed essential well let you in but youll have to work to make up the difference agreed my father said his face relaxing i realized that the bubble pilots lust for our money was greater than any principle he might have had gold was universal currency unlike the chronically deteriorating scrip of the various moons by threatening to leave taking our gold with us my father had bluffed him out even if we had perished on the surface of callisto that gold would not have gone to this bubble so it was take it or lose it the man had taken it so we would have to work why not it was only a tenday trip to jupiter how much better this was than the alternative spirit and i had tried to offer shuck your suits the voice said we were happy to oblige we helped each other get out of our space suits and folded the bulky things and stacked them on the floor we should have no further need for them as the bubble would not again dock in vacuum and the bubble personnel would have a storage room to store them this more than anything else gave me a feeling of relief a person could relax when he took off his space suit we did however detach our packs and carry them in our arms my father produced our two bright gold coins the inner panel slid aside the panels were designed to move readily when the pressure was equal at either side but to balk when it was not an automatic safety factor to counter human error hard experience in space has taught our species many useful little things there stood a man in a grubby pilots uniform his hand out cells and he said as he took the gold theyre consecutively numbered you can find them get in them and stay keep the commons clear he brought first one coin and then the other to his mouth bit each and tasted it and smiled with satisfaction as he put them away i had not realized it was possible to identify a metal that way i would have tried an immersion test for density as gold is the most dense of the common metals and anything with greater density is bound to be more valuable the fact is you can tell pretty well whether gold is authentic merely by glancing at its size and hefting it in your hand but im not a trader or space pilot the man did not introduce himself or offer any other advice so we moved along the passage it really didnt matter where we stayed so long as we were aboard the bubble when it lifted for jupiter the passage angled up at fortyfive degrees then debouched immediately into what appeared to be a torusshaped chamber that is we stood within a giant doughnut only it was hollow while the hole was solid its outer wall curved down on one side and up on the other i should clarify that the outer wall of the torus was not the outer wall of the bubble we walked downward into this torus since the upper side curved until it was vertical the lower side curved level in just a few metersand just at that point the floor converted to a latticework of squares each square two meters on a side with a sliding panel in the center some panels were open showing cells below about two meters cubed numbers spirit exclaimed seeheres and next to it is this a prison ship these are the passenger rooms my father said dryly eight cubic meters apiece but were only assigned two numbers i protested we should have five cells or at least three for our entry fee a head poked out of one chamber startling us they have doubled up the man explained they make twice as much money that way but thats wrong my mother said what law does an illegal craft follow the man inquired sardonically what law indeed my father agreed i realized that weexcept for my fatherhad been naпve of course the refugeesmugglers would seek the greatest profit by jamming as many people as possible into the bubble and overcharging those we have cells and spirit said do you know where they are opposite side of the bubble the man said pointing up youll have to climb its not hard in this oneeighth gee and there are handholds better hurry before the next load comes therell be people scrambling every which way stepping on each others faces so many refugees i had supposed our situation was more or less unique but apparently many others were as desperate to leave the planet as we were it was a sad commentary on the nature of our society we thanked the man and hurried we followed the numbers up and around the torus chamber the handholds were really the ceiling lattice which seemed to be formed of sturdy netting the ceiling was close to four meters from the floor but not hard to reach at eighthgee so we climbed it readily enough and when it curved around toward the topside we walked on that netting until we spied cells and in the new ceiling which was really part of the same surface that had been the floor below if thats clear it occurs to me that a verbal or written description isnt enough so i will make a map of the complete bubble as i came to know it turn to the next page for that map and dont blame me if it does not match the standards of space navy specification blueprints how ever are we to stay in those faith demanded irritably when we are in space well rotate and the cells will all be down i explained feeling very educated idiot she snapped fatigue and nervous tension had worn out her temper understandably i know that i mean now faith is a very pretty girl but she was not very pretty now i was about to make some sarcastic retort but before i could work out something cutting enough for this occasion my father interceded adults seem to handle fatigue better than do juveniles maybe they are more accustomed to it well manage he said mildly as you can see others are doing well enough i peered up dimly through the translucent sliding doors i saw people in cells and down sitting comfortably on the floors and up remained empty now if your mother and i take one will you three children get along in the other my father asked and the tone of his voice made the suggestion sound eminently reasonable thats another adult talent it was of course more than a suggestion we should have two and a half cages spirit said belligerently we were all very tired and it was manifesting more openly as our certainty of survival increased even doubled up thats our share if one of you can find a free space my father said shrugging he really didnt want to argue the hatch to cell slid open a boy about my own age poked his head down ill take a roommate he called are you nice people well spirit began mischievously she was never too tired for a flash of humor ill take it i said its no fun rooming with sisters anyway actually it would have been okay with spirit but faith was too conscious of her maturity and would have made things difficult in various minor but cumulatively overwhelming ways spirit frowned but did not protest she knew she would get along with faith better than i would it was my position in life to protect faith from molestation on the street and spirits to preserve her privacy in the home it is a fairsized responsibility to have a pretty sibling spring up and catch the edge of the opening the boy advised i touched spirits shoulder and gave it a squeeze i would rather have roomed with her than with some stranger and she knew it this reminder was merely my gesture of thanks for her understanding we could not put faith in with a strange boy i tossed up my pack then sprang up and hooked my fingers in the opening then hauled myself on inside acrobatics are easy in eighthgee when i was clear of the entrance the boy slid the panel closed so we could relax without fear of falling through the floor i didnt worry about my folks i knew theyd manage i sat up and contemplated my companion he seemed to be my heightit wasnt possible to be certain while sittingbut more slender of structure with very thin arms his hair was short and brown like mine and his eyes were brown too and seemed a bit too large for his face but his features were well formed i decided i liked himbut my senseofpeople signaled warning there was something about him that didnt jibe whats your name i asked forthrightly whats yours he returned less forthrightly still that slight wrongness hope hubris my fathers a tallyman of the coffee dome was i mean i got into trouble with a scion and now we all have to get out he smiled it was a fetching compelling expression that transformed his face into something wholly likable some people have practiced smiles that are letterperfect but that lack warmth this was a natural one im helse my folks are servantswhen they find work they cant support me so im emigrating helse i asked thats an unusual name for this planet and hope isnt i laughed i guess a person can be named anything his folks want helse is the plural of hell they tell me im a hellion i was already sure he wasnt that violence was not his way but what he was i had not yet fathomed maybe he had more urgent reason to emigrate alone than economics the ice was broken we chatted a little about inconsequentials and my awareness of the oddness about him intensified he wasnt bad or dangerous just subtly wrong i liked him for he was at least as well educated as i and he wasnt mean my judgment of people in this respect is infallible after a time i checked on my folks faith and spirit were next to me in and our parents in the next one over they were already lying down for a nap go back and finish your conversation spirit told me its interesting but i was too weary for that or even to be embarrassed naturally there was no privacy of sound in a situation like this one would have to whisper to keep any secret from those in adjacent cells helse and i had not said anything confidential anyway i saw i had other neighbors in cells and the two corners and when the remaining cells filled up we would have eight neighbors in all i see this isnt clear so ill make a chart as i like to keep things straight the band of cells extended all the way around the bubbles equator four abreast numbered consecutively by rows with a circumference of about fifty meters at the equator but less to either side of it there was just room for twentyfour such rows or ninetysix cells and four more squeezed in somewhere around the edges our particular section was numbered like this the line along the center is the bubble equator the region of greatest centrifugal gravity when it is rotating it wasnt really a line any more than it is on any moon or planet but it helps a person to align things the cell numbers continued on either side upward and downward but it seems pointless to list all ninetysix anyway i was sure that i would get to know the people in all eight bordering cells soon enough once we were under way right now the brief exhilaration of desuiting and settling in and meeting my roommate was giving out and i just had to rest i returned to cell handing myself along from panel to panel readily enough said good night to helse though i suppose it was just about morning in maraud time and tuned out the universe sleep came like a ton of sand burying me for all that a ton only weighed an eighth of a ton in this gravity at one point i was dimly aware of other people entering the adjacent cells and of the clangs of the outer locks being secured i didnt let any of it disturb me helse lay parallel to me presumably sleeping too i heard him speak once to someone outside probably another person wanting to share the cell there was a hassle but it finally died down without the intrusion of any other person so if my presence here in cell had been an imposition it was legitimate now i had legitimized it by possession or squatters rights but helse had been instrumental in that effort for he could have had me booted i owed him one i woke to a hand on my arm steadying me i didnt want you banging into a wall when the bubble maneuvers helse explained i looked about blearily i was floating in air i flailed wildly for a moment then realized i was not really falling i used helse as leverage to get to a handhold and secured myself to a wall my stomach felt light and i had to swallow several times before convincing myself that i wasnt about to throw up but otherwise i was all right were taking off helse explained nullgee you can see out the port i hadnt realized the cubic chambers had portholes of their own and later i learned that many did not we happened to be lucky actually ours wasnt much it was only ten centimeters in diameter and the thickness of the outer shell of the bubble made it seem tubular i set my nose against it holding myself close by means of recessed handholds on either side and peered out i really didnt see much our cubecell was near the top of the bubblesphere as it rested on the groundbut it wasnt on the ground anymore so that was irrelevant i knew the propulsion was from the vicinity of the axis so here at the equator we would be looking straight out at right angles to our line of travel i see i have to explain about the drive like the little nullgee saucers bubbles have to use some form of active propulsion gravity lenses are fine but they do not move objects they merely lessen or eliminate the pull of gravity now you might think that all we had to do was cut off the gravity of callisto and jupiter would pull us right in to itself well jupiter was trying but we still werent free to respond we were in fact in orbit about jupiter as was callisto so we stayed right where we were releasing us from callisto was only part of the job we had not been released from the basic physics of our situation so we needed a jet to make us move the jet was now boosting us up at an angle to the surface of callisto that much i could perceive we no longer weighed anything so didnt have to worry about falling back to callisto but our mass remained and the jet wasnt strong so it was slow but gravity travel is slow in practice if you want to get anywhere in a hurry you have to use a spaceship not a bubble the bubble is the rowboat of space it is not exactly firstclass travel which is why we refugee peasants could afford it barely so all i saw apart from callisto was jupiter and it didnt even seem to be getting closer perspective is like that it seems you are getting nowhere jupiter was moving of course as our course wobbled somewhat uncertainly but that was irrelevant i pushed away from the port now helse looked out shouldnt we be going right toward jupiter he asked i saw that i knew something he didnt that gratified me we cant go straight to jupiter i explained were in orbit i know that he said miffed well approach jupiter in a big spiral because our orbital velocity joins our approach velocity in a compromise vector but at least we can accelerate toward jupiter to help tighten the spiral no good i said the closer an orbiting object gets to its primary the faster it orbits wed end up going so fast wed bounce out again what we have to do is slow our orbital velocity then well fall in naturallythough well still be orbiting faster he shook his head we slowso we go faster i dont understand that lots of people dont i said somewhat smugly he let it drop ill be glad when they spin the bubble so we have weight again with that i agreed heartily free fall is fine for a moment but it rapidly palls as the novelty wears off i had spent all my life in gravity mostly earth norm i could get along on less but my stomach definitely didnt like nullgee i think itll be some time though i said the jet drive doesnt have much thrust only enough to nudge us into the wall this is no space liner he laughed with a surprisingly high pitch no this is a little sailboat it was a nice enough analogy better than my prior thought about a rowboat back on the historical oceans of earth a thousand years ago there were all kinds of ships it was impossible to go to space in an open craft but the contemporary bubbles were as close to it as was feasible using mainly the ambient gravity fields of space for propulsion much as the little sailboats used vagrant winds on the planetary surface winds could let a person downand so could gravity we waited interminably the pilot made a circuit of the commonsthat was the torusshaped central halland advised us to remain in our cells until we got clear of the planet except for use of the heads the heads were the bathrooms there were eight of them which was supposed to be enough for one hundred people but we had about two hundred people so that meant twentyfive to a head we organized it by the numbersand cells and were at the line for head number suddenly my business there seemed overpoweringly urgent helse seemed to be in even greater distress than i may i talk to you privately he asked i realized that he meant he didnt want the people in the neighboring cells overhearing i moved close sure will you keep a secret he whispered in my ear not if you plan to do anything illegal or unethical i whispered back not certain whether i was serious we were all doing something quasiillegal by sneaking away from the planet like this the feeling of oddness about him returned and i wasnt sure i wanted to hear his secret the very knowledge could compromise my own situation somehow nothing like that he answered me but awkwardand ill need your help please do not betray me i squinted at him the urgency in his voice was manifest he was not joking i was becoming excruciatingly curious about his oddness ill keep your secret so long as it doesnt hurt me or anyone else i said but if you have for example a contagious disease common sense should indicate that secrecy is not he smiled instantly no nothing like that but i dont promise to help you i finished the secret is one thing inactive help is another all right he took a breath then leaned close to my ear again im a girl so thats it i exclaimed in a whisper as the oddness fell into focus hisher brow furrowed you knew what gave me away it was my turn to smile i didnt know butwell i have this sense about other people i know what their strengths and weaknesses are and what motivates them and how far i can trust them its not psychic its just a judgment i have after i interact with them a little maybe i pick up private signals from the body i dont know with you there is something wrong was something i knew you were a nice person but you didnt quite fall into place now i realize its because i was trying to fit you into a masculine mode and you wereare feminine thats a relief you dont mind she asked uncertainly i like to solve mysteries you arent odd anymore i mean not to my special perception probably no one else would have felt it at all but iwell thats my one real talent the thing that distinguishes me from other people id really hate to have it be wrong i deceived you pretending to be a boy you might have refused to room with me otherwise i dont care what sex you are if you dont care i reassured her i have two sisters i was going to share a cell with them but this is more fun and less crowded i considered looking at her with a changed perception how old are you youre my size sixteen she said girls dont get as big as boys i know my sister faith is eighteen and shes the same size as me and im not big but i fight for her becauseyou know i know she said smiling herself now with my perception of her as feminine the expression was cute she wasnt as pretty as faithwouldnt be even if she were all garbed and coiffed like a girlbut of course no one was as pretty as faithbut she was nice enough there is something sort of special about any girl theyre a distinct and intriguing species i have no brother to fight for me so i became a brother makes sense it did indeed the way men go after faiththats really why were here i stopped a scion from getting at her scions are bad ones she agreed any man is potential trouble i dont mean you youre a boy no offense and you dont want to room with a man i said working it out he would make demandsi guess we should have had faith join you but we didnt know no i wanted you helse said quickly we were still conversing in barely audible whispers of course it would look funny a mixed couple unrelated even at our ages and i still have to hide my nature i dont know who may be aboard this bubble or what may be expected when things get dull please dont tell anyone i promised i said a little stiffly its your secret ill keep it and ill need your help if you will give it you see the bathroom the rest of her problem illuminated youll have to use the male head thatll be awkward if if theres anyone else there she finished will you help me its something no person can do for another i pointed out embarrassed she blushed she would have to watch that in public i need someone to cover for me in case oh to stand by the door and make sure no man interrupts i said ill try oh thank you im most grateful actually im glad to get a half share of a cell instead of a third share you dont have to be grateful to me the truth was sharing a cell with a young woman not my sister was a prospect that promised to be interesting like most adolescent boys i had dreams of the opposite sex but lacked the courage to implement them it wasnt that i envied youths like the scion he was obviously a heel from the outset and should come to a bad end if we had not succeeded in ending him it also wasnt that i had any overwhelming procreational urge as far as i can tell mine is normal for my age but there are few convenient avenues of general acquaintance with girls available to boys in my situation and none for full sexual expression i knew girls were not mere sex objectsafter all spirit is a girlbut when society places a sexual emphasis on association it is hard to relate to the opposite sex as regular people here was my chance to really get to know a girl who was not my sister helse was looking at me as if trying to assess the nature of my agreement i fathomed her concern dont worry i said im a boy not a man i wont be grabbing for you thank you she said smiling wryly yet i was close enough to manhood to feel the desire to grab for her i had told myself that i valued the opportunity to have a young woman for a friend and i didbut there was an insidious and powerful undercurrent of sexual interest too i would have to guard myself because if she got the notion that i might appreciate her sexual qualities she would surely seek some other roommate and that would abolish all speculations licit and illicit i had a secret of my own to keep now our turn for the head came we slid open the panel and floated down head number was alongside the quadruple row of cells it was more triangular in cross section because of the curve of the bubble shell the commons was a doughnut but near the bubbles axis the chambers were lined up parallel to it this left a wedgeshaped space between the cellblock and the axis where storage sheds fuse boxes and bathrooms were squeezed in the bubble didnt need space for bathtubs or shower stalls as there was no spare water in space for this sort of nonsense people were expected to wash their bodies with small sanitary sponges that could be rinsed with half a cup of water we didnt even bother with that no sponges were left people were going to have to stink fortunately the air recycling removed odors as well i was going to let helse go in alone but she gestured me to join her i saw that there were other people nearby who might deem it odd if two boys our age showed such deference to each other feeling a trifle guilty i crowded in with her now the details of helses problem showed starkly there were two apertures for body excretions one for solids the other for liquids it was important that the functions be separated because the recycling processes were different solids would clog the liquid system and liquid would saturate the drycompost mechanism of the other i had known this intellectually without considering the practical side of it actually on a tenday hop the solid recycling would not be done within the bubble the holding tanks would be emptied elsewhere providing rich organic material for some agricultural dome the water however would be cycled through many times while we traveled with the facilities already being overworked by the crowding of the bubble any abuse could be disastrous helse would not urinate into the solids aperture such wrongdoing would soon be apparent as the tank fouled up she had to use the liquids apertureand there was a problem either sex could use the solidcollector funnel as that was set in a sort of potty chair with handholds to keep the floating body proximate but the liquids funnel was set at waist height in the vertical wall the wall that would be vertical when spin began i mean at the moment in complete free fallfor they seemed to be using the propulsive jet intermittently saving it for some later need so there was not even the trace thrust of accelerationall walls were of indeterminate orientation i had no trouble with the liquids funnel of course i merely hooked my toes in the toehold slots in the floor so that my body was fixed parallel to the wall and directed the flow appropriately there was a slight suction that brought the fluid in otherwise it might have floated out into the chamber in disintegrating bubbles an obvious liability the presence of a young woman did not bother me unduly for our family had never been squeamish about such things we had had to share a single bathroom and my sisters and i had long since passed the exploration stage but helse youll have to hold me against the wall she said her face was somewhat ruddy as mine would have been in a similar circumstance obviously she hadnt wanted male cooperation she had had to have it that was the solution of course i hooked my toes leaned back and caught her as she floated close she dropped her trousers or rather drew them down about her legs in the absence of gravity baring her bottom then she doubled up her legs and squatted against the funnel while i held her by the shoulders and gently shoved her in to the wall otherwise she would simply have floated away from it especially whenwell a rocket moves in space by jetting gas and a person would move similarly by jetting liquid i closed my eyes in deference to her modesty after the first guilty glimpse that verified that she definitely was not male but could still feel the slight motion of her body and hear the fluid striking the funnel then abruptly it became very exciting for me though my reaction embarrassed me i was lucky to have urinated first had i done it last i would have had more difficulty than she albeit for a different reason i chided myself after all she was only urinating why should this essentially pedestrian activity excite me so strongly in that fashion yet there was no question that it did then i opened my eyes and looked again not to further titillate myself though that was a consequence i realized i had seen something odd yes there it wasa small mark or tattoo in the crease where her left leg connected to her body three letters qyv she finished and drew her trousers back up thank you she said that was the help i needed sure i mumbled knowing i was blushing i hoped my erection did not show one advantage the female of the species has is the ability to conceal sexual awareness if she wishes in the female section they have bidets helse said youd have almost as much trouble using one of those umph i agreed preferring to change the subject though i was curious about what a bidet was we returned to our cell and two men headed for the head passing us in the commons i could tell the men didnt suspect anything we were just two teenage boys my blush must have faded or maybe it just didnt show well in the partial light against my naturally dusky complexion a female roommate couldnt have helped this way helse murmured as we climbed back into our cell she had certainly figured it well and played it correctly she had of course been lucky i was available but luck is a fickle mistress that is powerless unless intelligently exploited helse had gambled to the extent she had to and won and i respected that then a complementary notion occurred if i ever have to use the female head i began yes of course ill help you she agreed quickly there could be an occasion we settled down for more rest as there wasnt much else to do but now that my roommates femaleness had been so unequivocally brought home to me i could not quite relax that sexual barrier was up between us i kept thinking of the private glimpse of her posterior vicinity i had had certainly i had seen it on my sistersthough not recently on faithbut this was not my sister that made an enormous difference i wondered what the rest of her looked like when it showed she had done an excellent job of masquerading as a boy nothing showed her chest looked just like a masculine chest maybe she was flatbreasted no that was unlikely because her buttocks were too rounded and hershe was at the age of nubility and the upper part of her would certainly conform and my own reaction to her urinationi suppose it was because her act called more specific attention to that portion of her anatomy and the functioning of it a person may be stimulated to hunger by seeing another person eat why not a similar stimulation in genital matters at any rate i had learned something about my own organic responses the first requirement in the understanding of other people is the understanding of oneself anyway thanks she said i jumpedwhich didnt get me far in free fall i felt nervous thinking about someone that way when she was right there with me i did not believe in telepathy but my disbelief weakened at moments like that welcome i said and that at least was honest chapter betrayal i must have snoozedcertainly i needed more restbecause i was jolted awake when the warning klaxon went off we had separated far enough from the planet and were about to go into spin that meant gravity or a reasonable facsimile and we didnt want to be sleeping in midair when it started i had of course been doing exactly that but it started gently enough i heard noises from the hull and realized someone was out there in a space suit doing something theyre moving the drive unit around to the equator i said catching on if they angled it sidewise at the pole it would start the bubble turning pole over pole and its not designed for that so they have to fasten it where it belongs for proper spin then the room began to drift to the side now theyre starting the spin i said working it out in my own mind but at the start its spin acceleration so we feel it mostly sidewise once it gets up to proper torque well feel it outwards but its not much of a jet so its slow youre good at physics helse said i wasnt good at physics im not if the truth must be toldand i suppose it must heremuch good at anything apart from my judgment of people oh im smart enough in a general way that runs in our family except for faith who got beauty instead of brains but i owed my comprehension of the present situation more to the fact that males tune in to these things more than females do by training and inclination i knew helse was gratuitously complimenting me and the words meant nothing in themselves but i was flattered that she wanted to flatter me after all she was a year older than i a real girl a young woman i was sure that in normal circumstances the likes of her would not even have noticed the likes of me of course she needed my cooperation for the bathroom so she could keep her secret it figured that she would try to keep on my good side still i was unreasonably pleased i would have been pleased if a boy had complimented me similarly but i knew it would not have had the same force i wanted a genuine young woman to respect me it made me feel almost like a young man instead of an awkward adolescent so she was trying to manage meand i was eager to be managed slowly the spin increased until the outer wall became the new floor and the sliding door became a ceiling exit the slight push of the jet sidewise was constant not increasing while the effect of centrifugal force was cumulative so that it came to dominate it was good to have weight and orientation again in due course there was a jolt helse looked up startled just the drive unit being disconnected i explained they have to take it back to the pole and set it up again for normal forward thrust now that our spin is established it will maintain itself the rocket is needed to continue our acceleration toward jupiter well hardly feel it pushing at right angles to our new gravity but the bubble will get up respectable velocity in due course she smiled complimenting me again and i felt unreasonably good again helse had done nothing really to turn me on like this but i was thoroughly turned on for the first time in my life i was coming to appreciate the potency with which a woman could affect a manjust by being near him we had been sitting on the new floor wary of standing while our orientation was shifting now we stoodand i felt abruptly dizzy and had to lean quickly against a wall for support i saw helse react similarly naturally i had to set my brain scrambling for a facile explanation lest my newfound status as a knowledgeable person suffer erosion the spin i said this is a small bubble so we feel the effect when we stand upright our feet are moving faster than our heads and maybe they weigh more too so we get dizzy and we tend to fall sidewise because of the physics of the situation so its not something i ate helse said i dont have to get sick i wish she hadnt said that word we struggled with our equilibrium and our psychologies and managed to get ourselves less queasy and more balanced but we could hear the sound of someone retching in a neighboring cell let me try something i said struck by a notion i took my comb from my pocket held it aloft near the ceiling just above head level and dropped it the comb took about one second to reach the floorbut it didnt fall straight down it drifted four feet to the side and banged into the wall helse gasped how its the spin again i said pleased the hull is evidently providing us about half earthgravity which i think is standard for a bubble this size it has a diameter of about sixteen meters which means a circumference of just over fifty meters and so if it spins in ten seconds wait wait helse interrupted i want to understand really i do because i think comprehension makes me less queasy but ive had most of my education in jupiter measurements you know inches and feet and oh i wondered how she had picked up that education since it was normally affected on callisto only by the rich landholders and politicians who had dealings with the colossus planet but i did have some conversance with that clumsy system so i rose to the challenge the bubbles radius in feet would be perhaps twentyfive i said and its circumference here just inside the hull maybe one hundred sixty feet roughly so if it completes a full turn every ten seconds which seems reasonable a point on the hull will travel sixteen feet every second that gives us a velocity of sixteen feet per secondno i guess it doesnt because the deviation is tangential not straight thats all right she said quickly now i understand the principle but why did your comb fall sidewise well the floor of the commons our ceiling is a little over six feet farther in so while the hull moves sixteen feet the ceiling moved only let me see twelve feet so thats the velocity of my comb at that level when i drop it it cant match the velocity of the hull so it falls four feet behind oh yes she exclaimed yes of course and yet again she was flattering me so when we go up into the commons i concluded we had better lean a little to compensate for the effects and watch out how we jump because we may not land where we expect and our weight will be less on the commonsabout threequarters what it is here if this is halfgee hereand i really cant tell now so maybe its quartergee like callistothe commons will be threeeighths gee or threesixteenths or whatever anyway less i feel better already helse said maybe some time ill have the chance to explain something as useful to you she was giving me too much credit but i could live with it it was time for us to go abroad and meet our neighbors i reached up opened the panel and hauled myself into the commons spirit had done the same thing and other passengers were popping out of their holes some of them looking greenish yes i understood their nausea soon a number of us were standing on the new concave floor of the doughnut meeting each other camaraderie was easy for we all shared some significant experiences fleeing callisto and adapting to spingravity i introduced helse formally to my family hes traveling alone i explained his family couldnt support him any longer i made sure i made the he plain so that helse would know i was honoring her secret i suppose technically this was lying but i had given my word and it would have been a greater wrong to betray her still i felt a twinge and resolved to cogitate upon the ethics next time i had cogitation time on my hands is a lie ever justified by circumstances thats one you cannot answer in an offhand way our neighbors as it turned out were basically similar to ourselves they had been ground into intolerable poverty by the system or had incurred the wrath of some person of power or had simply come to the conclusion that they were on a deadend street on callisto they were not the very poorest for those could not even have raised the fare they were the descending middle class like us or the disillusioned specialists who could no longer tolerate the system there was a lot of demand for the heads at this point as people tried to get their motionsick stomachs in order helse and i had overcome our problem so were all right in that respect i saw that a number of people were remaining in their cells probably too sick to emerge time would help cure that i was sure the immense if cloudshrouded lure of jupiter summoned us all there we would somehow find the reprieve life had so far denied us it was a giant mutual dream and if it was short on practical details at least it was better than dwelling on the problems behind us how much better to float toward a dream than to sink into potential nightmare now at last it was time to eat those of us who were not sick were famished after the ardors of our departure from our lifetime homes a bubble crewman dispensed packages of food and drink from the storage space in the center of the vessel dropping them down through a hole in the net people watched amazed as those items angled to the side traveling twice as far horizontally as vertically i spread my explanation around but found that quite a number of people had already figured it out for themselves spirit always one to get into the spirit of these things practiced jumping up to the net which she could do with much less distortion by adjusting the angle and velocity of her takeoff then spreading her arms and flapping them as if flying on the descent soon she had all the children doing it and i suppose it was good experience a person should always be properly conversant with his environment the food was staple stuff allpurpose vitaminmineralprotein cakes and globed water no gourmet fare but quite good enough to sustain us this was after all not a pleasure excursion we have to see to the orientation of the lenses the pilot announced as we squatted in groups on the commons floor near our cells we need a volunteer to supervise the air lock while were outside ill do it an older man said ive floated a bubble before fair enough ill appoint you temporary captain for the interim your name is diego the man said bernardo diego take over captain diego the pilot said making a mock salute then he entered the air lock with his two crewmen diego settled down by the lock and the rest of us returned to our repast helse ate with us seeming almost to become part of our family and i guess that was just as well no one seemed to suspect her true nature not even spirit who could be unconscionably perceptive when that was least convenient but she was more interested in her flying and in the other people around us learning their names she was as good at that sort of thing as i was poor my talent is judging not remembering people thats why i am not naming people freely here i did know their names but i have already forgotten them and there is nothing to be gained by cudgeling my memory to recreate every last one we finished our meal and helse and i took our turn at the head again lining up by the cell numbers as before we as a group in the bubble were fortunate that the malefemale ratio of the total was just about even for there were four heads of each type and an imbalance would have been awkward i helped helse again no one found it remarkable that two teenage boys entered the room together for that was the nature of boys my mother and sisters went to their head together though three was crowding it and my father shared his turn with another family man it was really working out quite well considering the crowding one person could use the liquid collector while another used the solid collector and then they switched in this way no more time was taken than it would have for one person at a time we seemed to have a good group here for all that it had been randomly assembled maybe there just happened to be a large percentage of intelligent motivated people who couldnt abide the repressive halfcal system time passed how long does lens adjustment take i asked they cant stay out there forever lens adjustment a neighbor asked was that what they said i was in the head when they went out and didnt hear orientation of the lenses i informed him they appointed a temporary captain from our number while they were out but a gravity lens is not oriented from outside the man protested i remember his name now it was garcнa the lenses are not physical objects they are fields generated by a unit in the center of the bubble it has to be that way otherwise the spin would interfere with the gravity shielding and wed be jerking all over the cosmos i used to be a technician im not expert but that much i do know thats right i agreed chastened for not realizing it myself i excuse myself in retrospect by pointing out that we were then in a new situation adjusting to the spin in various ways eating our first bubble meal and meeting our neighbors so that the affairs of the crewmen were not uppermost in our minds probably that was the way the crewmen had intended it they had no reason to go out for thatand one of them would have had to stay inside to change the settings if they were wrong we had better investigate my father said he and i and garcнa made our way to diego to present our concern diego looked stricken you know youre right they dont need the lifeboat to check the lenses lifeboat i asked experiencing a sinking sensation that my trace weight could not account for this lock opens to the lifeboat diego explained thats why they didnt need space suits this time the boats sealed with its own supplies i believe they stored the gold in there for safekeeping now his face was as aghast as mine had been it took us some time to verify and believe it for our resources and information were limited and we didnt want to believe it we had to get out the space suits and go outside the air lock to search for the lifeboat that wasnt there but it was true the three bubble crewmen had decamped with the gold we were abruptly on our own without even a lifeboat in space we organized a meeting to discuss the situation and work out our options most of the refugees were in a state of disbelief surely the crew would come back they couldnt leave us stranded in space who would pilot the bubble how would we get to jupiter but as time passed more people believed we realized that there was close to in gold involved and that this old bubble converted from a retired pleasure craft could not be worth more than perhaps a similar amount was invested in supplies the crewmen had the money so werent bothering to carry through with their commitment they were thieves or swindlersand we had been taken some women became hysterical some people retreated to their cells refusing to face our situation but a solid nucleus remained to tackle the problem after all if we ignored it we would all perish we could not simply float forever in space diego argued in favor of reversing our thrust and descending to callisto and taking our chances there but too many people had cut their ties to the society below return would mean harsh treatment by the government of halfcal my father argued that if we could manage to operate the lenses and jet well enough to descend safely we could use them as readily to proceed on our original mission we could float the bubble to jupiter ourselves there were arguments back and forth but in the end we took a vote and my father was elected to be the new captain since he had spoken for the majority he immediately appointed diego lieutenant captain if something prevents us from going forward you will be the one to take us back he explained to the man you will need experience in handling the bubble just in case we are still a long way from jupiter meanwhile youre in charge of bubbleboard operations diego who had been working up an irritation of temper when he saw the vote going against him became mollified my father had acted to preserve harmony in the bubble and i noted this and learned from it a person who opposes you does not have to be your enemy anyone who knows anything about navigation come to me now my father announced we need all the expertise we have because im no space mechanic were a long way from the coffee plantation now and anyone who knows anything about supplies atmosphere recycling sanitary facilities or human motivation come to me diego announced weve got to keep this bubble healthy while its going wherever its going i hesitated then went to join diego helse tagged along with me as it turned out we were fairly well off diego found people to monitor the pressure and oxygenation equipment and check the funnel toilets he glanced at me and i was about to explain that i was good at human motivation but he spoke first youre hubriss boy arent you youll be in charge of food supplies first thing youll want to do is get up there in the net and make a count just to be sure we have enough uhyes seсor i said realizing that he was doing the same thing my father was appointing a potential malcontent to a responsible position my father had made diego secondincommand so diego was giving recognition to my fathers son it was a mutual backscratching operation but i suppose it did alleviate tensions and take your friend diego added helse was glad to participate she had been staying close to me so she wouldnt have to tell her secret to anyone else how this suddenly critical situation would affect her personally i didnt know but it was unlikely to facilitate her serenity we clambered into the webbed chamber i profited from my reasoning about the distortion caused by our spin but still it took me two jumps to catch the entrance aperture in the net our weight was much less here for we were near the center of the bubble in fact some of the packages were floating glancing off each other like molecules in motion it was a good place for storage since even the heaviest article could readily be moved here in free fall this doughnut hole space was only four meters in diameter so just by standing on the lattice net we had our heads just about banging the globe that enclosed the lens generator it was a strange sensation feet with trace gravity head with none but we really could not conveniently stand because the food packs and water bags and such mostly filled it some refugees had stored baggage up here sensibly enough so counting the food packs was a problem because they didnt stay put very well we could end up counting some several times and missing others completely it might average out and lead to a correct countbut this was too important to leave to chance without food we would be in deep and early trouble i stuck my head down out of the hole of the lattice i spied spirit who was naturally curious about what i was doing and tired of playing tell seсor diego we need a bag or something to count them into a big bag i called to her soon she was back with a voluminously bulging armful of the kind of netting used to sweep rooms clean in free fall she scrambled up with it using this pretext to get in on the fun it was all right we were able to use her help spirit could be extremely helpful when she wanted to be we counted food packs into the net there were quite a number but in time we got a close enough figure about how many will we need for ten days travel to jupiter helse asked i did some quick computations three per person per day for two hundred peoplethats six hundred times ten days i broke off oops thats not enough spirit said i worked it out another way weve already had one meal so thats two hundred we must have started with three thousand thats enough for a normal load of one hundred peoplebut were overloaded so theres only half enough why didnt they pack more helse asked suddenly it all fitted together they must have planned for one hundred but twice as many refugees showed up so they took us all because of the money then they realized they couldnt feed us all so they took the money and flew leaving us to starve in space spirit exclaimed angrily so it seems i agreed wearily they planned a legitimate venture but greed overwhelmed them and we are left to pay the price wed better make a private report to seсor diego so the people wont panic we glided down hitting the commons deck running so as not to be swept off our feet by its higher velocity i noticed this time that there was a constant movement of air for it had the same problem we did differing velocities at different elevations it tended to drag at the floor and to rush at the net ceiling well that helped circulate it so the purifiers could operate effectively we approached diego how many he asked twentyeight hundred i murmured he leaned against the curving wall you sure all three of us nodded solemnly he led us to my father who was at the control section of the bubble tell him diego said to me therere only half enough food packs i said my father considered the implications ill call another meeting he said grimly soon it was done my father summarized the situation so it seems we dont have enough food to make our journey he concluded how do we know the counts correct a man demanded diego doesnt want to make the trip so he could have my son made the count my father said and i realized how neatly diego had arranged it he must have suspected that the supplies would be short so made sure no suspicion would attach to him regardless it was true we didnt have enough food what about oxygen the man asked theres enough diego replied another crew checked that and most of the water is recycled its only food were short and i realized that whatever his preferences diego was trying to do an honest job had i interacted with him longer and paid more attention i would have perceived what i now did he was an honest man expressing honest judgments he had not urged our return to callisto because he wanted to be a leader but because he truly believed that was the best course snap judgments are treacherous we could travel on half rations my father said we would be hungry but we wouldnt starve and for ten days it should be bearable if it were longer we could try to use our refuse to grow edible plants but we really arent set up for that and in ten days that wont work but we can do it on what we haveif we wish to make the sacrifice i wont insist on that unless theres a clear consensus there was debate the democratic process does take time then we took a vote it was about four to one in favor of going on to jupiter diego amazingly voted with the majority we have better leadership than we had before he explained wryly to those who looked askance at him i think we can make it now with don hubris my father smiled thank you don diego and there was a minor ripple of appreciation for there is this about that polite title of don in our language it is generally used with the given name not the surname they should have said don major and don bernardoand indeed thereafter they did so i am not sure why they elected to misuse it this one time there are aspects of adult humor and interaction i have not yet mastered perhaps diego had simply not known my fathers given name before the navigation crew had a fair notion what it was doing seсor garcнa explained it for those of us who were interested and at this point most of the refugees were all of us wanted reassurance that we were not traveling into doom the details were somewhat technical for me but here is the way i understand it our bubble was now floating inside the orbit of callistothat is closer to jupiterbut moving ahead of callisto because of the increased velocity of the inner orbit we continued to jet in the reverse direction with the paradoxical effect of increasing orbital velocity in less than five days we would be a quarter of the way around jupiter from our starting point then we would use the gravity of the sun to slow us for we would be swinging away from the sun that would slide us closer yet toward jupiter we would also try to use the gravities of jupiters inner moons until we were close enough to orbit in the range of jupiters innermost rings at that point the jupiter border patrol would intercept us and we would claim our status as refugees from the oppression of our homeland they would take us in of course jupiter had a standard policy of absorbing refugees in search of freedom ah but life is seldom as neat and simple as it appears it was hell we were so blithely floating into chapter adjustment jupiter orbit i need not repeat the sequence of the pirate raid that occurred two days before this dateline and the horror that befell my sister faith it was a brutal awakening for all of us we had not before believed in the reputed savagery of the outlaws of space yet for me especially it was a turning point my belief in the fundamental goodwill of all men had been destroyed by the horse the horse damn that pirate for what he did to us all to our minds as much as to faiths body it was necessary for me to reconstruct my philosophy of life to cope with the ugly new reality i did not agree with this reality or even understand it but i had to live with it i am not sure i can successfully present the tides of my changed awareness so this may be disjointed or fragmentary but i will try on callisto in maraudah that name had a changed relevance nowi had succeeded in defending my sister from the lust of a strange man here in space i had not true my entire family had paid a gross penalty for my prior defense having to flee the planetbut what was the penalty for my failure this time i simply could not grasp it would it have been better to let the scion have his way could anything he might have done to faith have been worse than what the foul pirate had done i had to ask myself whether my victory over the scion had been illusory and i was uncertain of the answer of course i could not have let the scion have his wayyet how could i have reacted to truly preserve my innocent sister i had a deep and terrible guilt to settle in my own mind apart from the other present problems of existence i was jogged to awareness by friendsthey had been only casual acquaintances but suddenly now they were friends who were lowering me from my prison of suspension and untying my hands oh it hurt as the circulation returned for even my trace weight had caused the bindings to constrictbut it was in my mind that i deserved such pain as part of my punishment for my failure the pirates were gone the horse had kept his word such as it was departing with his crew leaving our valuables behind he had not promised not to rape merely not to rob or kill and to leave us alone there was it seemed a kind of honor among criminals but it was subject to a savage interpretation it galled me anew that i could not entirely condemn the horse he did have some spark of humanity in him though he was a bad man i would much rather have cursed him absolutely faith lay as she had been left not even trying to cover her shame i think she was still unconscious my mother rushed up to minister to her and the other women closed in as though whatever they might do was no fit matter for the eyes of males perhaps they were correct the men in turn clustered around my father and me as we stood chafing our hands and wrists and wincing from the pain we didnt know they murmured we couldnt know the pirate gave his word he kept his word my father said his voice oddly calm the agreement wasnt tight maybe he did us a favorteaching us the reality of space without killing us he turned to me and there was something blank about his countenance i had been concerned with my own horrorwhat then of his he had watched his daughter ravaged my son was right we should not have given up our advantage but that laser another man protested then halted the deal with the pirates had in fact traded the lives of several men including my father for the violation of my sister an aspect of reality laid siege to my awareness at that point which was worse the death of my father or the rape of my sister if i had had the power to choose between the two knowing helse came up and took me by the hand and led me to our cell and no one objected they knew i needed to be out of it for a while she put me on the floor as a nurse might place a nonresisting patient on a bed then jumped up to close the panel in the ceiling separating us from the rest of the bubble then she kneeled beside me i understand she murmured i can help you hope what do you know of rape i flared she took my unresisting hand and squeezed my fingers gently it was foolish i told myself but i was reassured the cell was deeply shadowed since only a little light filtered through the translucent panel from the commons and that was just as well for admixed with my horror was the shame of unmanly tears i know a lot about it she said oh sure my pain was turning on her the nearest object i knew this was unfair but i had little control the savagery to which my awareness had been subjected was too much for me to control i could not react in an intelligent manner she leaned down wrapped her arms around me and lifted me in the partial gravity and drew me close to her my head against her chest she wore a tight band to flatten her breasts to make her torso look masculine now she paused to release this and cradled my face to her abruptly feminine bosom and it was marvelously compelling she was indeed a woman and soft in the way only a woman could be and i felt her measured breathing and heard her steady heartbeat and i was pacified ill tell you about me she said speaking in a low and even tone so that others would not overhear i think she was talking in order to distract me from the raw shock of what i had just seen to give my soul a small time to heal but before long the nature of what she was saying penetrated and i really was distracted of course her monologue was not as succinct as i render it here from memory but it was as important i listened and was slowly amazed helse came from a family larger and poorer than ours living in one of the smaller citydomes she had been a pretty child and in order to gain money on which to survive they had rented her at the age of six to a middleaged bachelor landowner as concubine this was legitimate socially in that dome though it has no legal status there was merely an understanding that permeated that limited society from the poorest to the wealthiest it had existed thus covertly for centuries and it seemed no one really wanted to change it this landowner had never married because he was unable to relate to adult women he liked children and had the wealth and power to indulge his propensities his appetite was generally known but never openly bruited about and he was generous to those who indulged him thus helses family possessed of a pretty female child had not been directly coerced to put their daughter into his hands they had seized upon the opportunity to alleviate their poverty for the few years during which they had something worth selling helse had called him uncle and he had called her niece this was to facilitate a nonexistent relationship that would satisfy any question that might arise among occasional visitors or business acquaintances uncle was not a bad man and he did not brutalize her far from it he fed her well and gave her nice clothing and toys and presents if she expressed an interest in something she would have it the next day he also provided her with a series of excellent tutors who set about giving her a proper upperclass education yet this was not an adultchild relationship it was a courtship he courted her and she was delighted she regarded her position in his mansion as the privilege of being desirable other girls her age had vied for it but she had been chosen but she knew she had to submit to whatever he chose to do with her body and not all of that was fun this was the price of her gifts and good life if she ever once said no or intimated that she objected it would be over she had the constant option of returning to her familyand this was not a promise it was an unspoken threat it was not that she didnt want to go home but that it would be disaster to be sent home she had to succeed the kissing and fondling was easy enough but the culmination was painful he was a mature man and she was a child no amount of gentleness could completely alleviate that yet there were physical and mental devices and she knew he did not mean or want to hurt her he was driven by adult urges she did not understand but he wanted to believe that she liked what he did she learned to take relaxant medication and to dissemble her real reaction for uncle was most generous when most pleased experience made it easier and in time she developed a certain pride in her competence she became proficient in pleasing this man she was no prisoner she was able to visit her family sometimes for an hour sometimes for a night she brought them nice gifts that made all of their lives better this was done with the approval and cooperation of uncle who wanted her to be happy it seemed she pleased him more than others had and now reaped commensurate rewards but no direct word was ever spoken of her real place in uncles household she was his niece with certain poor relatives she liked to help in fact she was now the principal provider for her family her father found work only intermittently but helses work was steady she became important in her own eyes and perhaps she became arrogant but this was her right for four years helse was a little princess in uncles mansion her every wish catered to by his other servants he had an excellent staff and they too understood their situations perfectly there was no covert unkindness to her or embarrassing leaks of information they were in a fairly real sense an extended family each concerned with the welfare of the group when a high official of the city visited expressed a certain curiosity about rumors he had heard and spread some money privately to confirm them the staff members accepted the money and assured him with absolute sincerity that there was nothing to the rumors when he questioned the naпve child helse she gave him similar assurance with marvelous innocence yet he knew for he had other sources of information id like to know your secret he confessed ruefully how do you compel their loyalty and uncle had smiled and not answered this official was known to beat his own servants the fact was that apart from his sexual aberration uncle was a good and kind man and his staff protected him because all its members genuinely cared for him wealth alone could not purchase that but at age ten helse was getting too old past her prime as it were and had to make way for a younger girl she stifled her savage jealousy knowing there was no percentage in it she had known this would happen from the start the staff had made it clear she had to master adult grace in the face of the inevitable and if she was unable to stifle a genuine tear in parting this was not objectionable uncle gave her a generous separation bonus and it was over she was retired you liked it i exclaimed appalled you wanted to stay with the child molester for though i have rendered her narration as politely as i can i have no sympathy with it my family upbringing simply does not provide me with much tolerance for this sort of abuse of children i liked the life and i respected the man she qualified i wish i could have been his real niece he was not a molester merely a person with a specialized taste some men like young nubile women some like fat women some like other men or boys this one liked children uncle never raped anyone that shut me up obviously her uncle was a better man than the pirate horse i had to broaden my definitions there were however openings for experienced intermediateaged children helse continued and her family always needed money so she went to work for a new employer but this one had more violent tastes for him there had to be humiliation and pain it was not exactly rape for he had paid for what he wanted and obtained prior acquiescence it was more like submitting to necessary surgery with inadequate anesthetic the money was good however and she learned to endure this too the one thing she insisted on was that no injury be done that would leave a mark or scar on her face or any portion of her body that normally showed i expressed curiosity so she showed me some of the scars she did have on her abdomen and back i shuddered the origin of those must have been painful indeed she certainly had had experience being tormented by men but finally i got too old for any of that stuff she concluded i could no longer earn enough to support my family not without risking my health or life i had no better prospect than a life of formal prostitution so i squandered my nest egg on this voyage and concealed my nature so there wouldnt be any more trouble ive had enough sex especially painful sex to last me a lifetime that i could appreciate i knew she was telling me the truth her ploy had been effective the pirates had never even thought of raping helse but my point is a girl can survive it she said what happened to your sister is terrible because she wasnt prepared for it but there are worse things i have survived worse again i believed her obviously she had prettied up her story for me helse was a nice girlbut she had had experiences i had never dreamed of she maintained her emotional equilibrium her mind had not been devastated i realized that if faith could adjust her thinking similarly she would suffer far less i wish you could talk to faith i said i willif you want me to i reconsidered no that would give away your secret and i dont know that it would help her ill talk to her myself she could learn to pass for male she suggested that could save her a lot of trouble faith just isnt the type i said but spirit your little sister is in danger too helse said this time the pirates went after the obvious and were satisfied your sister faith stands out in a crowd every mans eye was on her from the start you tried to shield her but it was impossible next time they could go after the rest there are men like that i know she certainly did i thought of my little sister getting raped in the manner of my big sister and a kind of blackness clouded my minds eye spirits a good kid she can fight and she can keep a secret will you teach her how to pass if you ask me to there was something about the way she said that i realized that i did not yet completely understand her what do you want in return i asked i like you i dont understand thats why i like you i like you too but this is business if there is something you what i want cant be bought just ask me to teach your sister all right i said slightly nettled im asking you then ill do it my sense about people as ive mentioned is infallible but thats a matter of comprehending motive not of understanding every nuance it is possible for example to know that a man is honest without knowing how to operate his business helse was not deceiving me yet she did want something from meand she would not tell me what that was a paradox of a type i had not encountered before and it baffled me then i remembered something else would you answer a questionif i asked you yes hope she said when youwhen we were in the head the first timei didnt mean to look but i sawwhat is that tattoo on your thigh she sighed i promised to answer but you must promise not to tell all right i said i told you i used my nestegg money to pay for my passage on the bubble but i didnt tell you how i got the money my family had used up all that i had from uncle and the other employers and they dont pay that amount foryou know but i was still friends with uncle and i phoned him privately she paused a moment frowning his current niece answered the vid she was the second one since me a cute little girl i couldnt tell her i knew of course it jolted me though she shrugged then returned to her explanation i asked uncle how i could get to jupiter i wasnt asking for money just advice and he knew that i think he was flattered that i should think of him in that connection he sent me to a man and the man didnt want sex he asked me why i wanted to go to jupiter and i told him it was to find a better kind of work he said he couldnt guarantee the work but that he could facilitate my trip there all i had to do was carry a message to a certain person whose name was kife or so it sounded for that service i would be given the money to get passage and would be protected on the way the tattoo is my protection that tattoothree letters where no one can see them how do they protect you they spell kife she said hard q vowel y hard v all i have to do is say the word to any criminal who threatens me and he will stop if he doesnt i can show him my tattoohes bound to see that anyway if he means to rape meand that will prove im authentic but the mere spoken word is supposed to be enough so i will not be molested by criminals and of course lawabiding men will not bother me i shook my head you believe that no she confessed not completely thats why i conceal my sex but if i really am threatened ill try the word maybe criminals really are scared of kife after all if he can afford that kind of money just to deliver one message he must have a lot of power whats the message i asked she shrugged thats the funniest part i wasnt given any you were paid a thousand dollars to deliver no message three hundred for an individual the man said kife would understand when he saw me i was having trouble with this just the sight of you would tell him something are you sure you arenti mean that it is you he helse laughed for sex hope im hardly that special im thirdhand goods no one would pay three hundred dollars for my body for your sisters maybe for mine no she was probably right the going rate was less than a hundredth of thatas it had been for faith pirates didnt pay for what they could take by force did the tattoo hurt no the man gave me a sniff of gas and when i recovered consciousness it was over it didnt even sting gas then he could have she put her hand on my arm no hope there was no sex i can tell i was surprised because that is usually a matter of course with such men if he had wanted sex i would have done it and he knew that i just wanted to get to jupiter the land of hopeno play on your name hopewhatever the price i was put under so the tattoo wouldnt hurt that was all i sighed i was curious about the tattoo now im twice as curious theres something we dont know thats what you get for curiosity she said smiling in the shadow she was very pretty that way but please dont tell anyone just in case it is important i wont tell at this point i almost wished i hadnt asked i hate unsolved riddles however unconnected all this may seem in retrospect i have to say that helse had succeeded in what she set out to do she had broken my mood of shock enabling me to function more or less normally for the time being my father plunged into the task of navigation evidently he had come to his own terms with the situations of the bubble and of faith adults seem to have greater resources in that respect than people my age do diego got to work on bubble defense all of us who werent otherwise occupied went to classes on combat there was a retired martial artist among the refugees an old man whose days of competition were decades past but he possessed a lifetime of devastating knowledge had we had any warning about the raid of the pirates he could have prepared us for them but he too had been caught unawares he explained at the outset that there was little we could master in one or two days that would balk armed pirates so it was best that we concentrate on fairly simple crude defenses he showed us how to fashion weapons of incidental objects even wads of paper and how to protect ourselves when disarmed a girl does not have to submit to rape by a lone man he said getting right down to the point the one we sawthere she was helpless but usually it is just one man at a time she has teeth she has knees she has fingers the rapist has a nose and testicles and eyes we listened doubtfully i will demonstrate the instructor said he dug in a bag he had and produced a rubber mask with bulging pingpongball eyes and a huge beak of a nose a young woman for a volunteer please spirit jumped forward naturally i suppose she had not understood what had happened to faith so was not devastated no not a child a woman protested i glanced at helse understanding something she had said pirates dont worry much about age i said the instructor agreed unfortunately true children need protection most of allmale and female that startled me and i wasnt alone male he took spirit aside and talked to her explaining something in a voice too low for us to hear she grinned enjoying it i noticed she wasnt wearing her fingerwhip she didnt want people to know about that any more than i wanted them to know about my laser pistol then they faced the class i am a pirate rapist the instructor said donning the grotesque mask this child is the victim watch what she does he turned on spirit and clapped his hands on her shoulders hauling her off her feet in the partial gravity of the commons ha my pretty he cried i fell pirate that i am shall rape you to pieces he drew her in spirits knee came up suddenly there was a solid contact the man grunted and collapsed into a ball hey i cried horrified you werent really supposed to knee him but the instructor uncurled and got up unharmed and spirit was laughing joyfully i only kneed the outside of his hip on the side away from you silly she explained in a real situation i would have aimed better the class relaxed the point had been made girls had knees the instructor came at spirit again quickly drawing her in so close she could not bring her knee up effectively his hands closed about her throat choking her close as he was this was not completely effective but it looked bad enough but spirits own hands were free quickly she reached up to his face her fingers dug into his eyeand an eyeball popped out of its socket and flew through the air there was a scream from the classfollowed by nervous laughter it was not a real eyeball it was a painted pingpong ball from the mask he wore but again the point had been made girls had fingers and rapists had eyes a third time the instructor grabbed her now he pinned her arms under his own and held her close against him as they fell to the deck no knees no fingers were free his leering oneeyed mask face thrust down against hers as for a brutal kiss spirit opened her mouth jerked her head up and bit into the huge plastic nose the instructor roared in simulated pain but she ripped the nose from the mask third point made girls had teeth the instructor let her go and got up so who is going to rape this child he asked rhetorically if not the nose the tongue or the ear chew hard taste the blood and rape will be forgotten but when he lets go of you flee for your life he paused then added a sober qualification but if you are one and they are many or the rapist is very strong you cannot prevail hurt one and the others will kill you in that case it is better to submit there are worse things than rape which again was what helse had said the entire complement of the bubble was conscious of rape now and trying to defuse it to make it seem less evil but the memory of faiths ordeal remained fresh in my mind and i wondered we practiced other techniques of selfdefense but they were less dramatic both throws and strikes were less effective in partial gravity than they would have been in full gravity and we were more conscious than ever of our vulnerability to the superior weapons of the pirates we were now much better prepared for the next pirate raid assuming one came but not very confident about our ability to fend them off meanwhile my fathers crew kept tinkering with the gravitylens projectors shielding us against callisto gravity and leaving us open to the backward pull of the sun it took constant adjustment but we seemed to be on schedule and that was important because our half rations would not last longer than we had budgeted my description of our ongoing activities may make it seem as if we were lighthearted but this was not the case we were distracting ourselves from the fundamental grimness of our situation i brought spirit in for a quiet conference with helse youre a girl spirit exclaimed roundeyed i dont believe it helse opened enough of her shirt to show her strapped breasts this was the first time i had actually seen them and i felt guilty and slightly irritated for that feeling hope has asked me to teach you how to be a boy helse said i dont want to be a boy spirit protested im just barely getting ready to start being a girl if the pirates come again you be a boy i said firmly after what happened to faith and what helse has told me of the appetites of some men spirit nodded soberly not continuing the argument the way i had expected ill do it i saw those pirates too you know poor faith why dont you go talk to her now hope she needs you surprised i went leaving helse to teach spirit whatever was needed privately i knew spirit would pick it up rapidly for she had hardly begun to develop and was boyishly lanky she also had that spirit of adventure that made her good at new things faith was alone in cell and cell was empty for the moment as my parents were busy elsewhere none of our other neighbors were in their cells we could talk in fair privacy seeing her was a shock my older sister had always been beautiful but now she was not the past two days had made an unkempt wretch of her her fair tresses were tangled her clothing was creased and dirty and her eyes were hollowed and staring i had stayed away from her knowing i had nothing to offer except guilt for my neglect knowing that only my mother could do what little might be done faith i said tentatively afraid she would screech at me to be gone as perhaps i deserved i had heard her crying faintly on and off through the cell walls and so had known she was not resting easy that had intensified my guilt but not my courage what could i say to her really she looked up at me she was not catatonic as i had half feared hope she said her face brightening as she reached for my hands i missed you i failed you i said im sorry that was grossly inadequate and suddenly i was hopelessly choked the despicable tears pushing through my eyes and i tried to pull my hands away from her in some times past it has been socially acceptable for a man to cry but not in this century no no she protested you tried hope you tried no one could help me i brought it on myself the pirates did it i ground out bitterly ill kill am i still your sister she asked not loudly startled i paused for reflection what did she mean i am a good judge of character but this was a matter beyond my compass she was looking at me and i realized that i had to answer she placed great importance on this matter confusing as the implication might be of course youre my sister i said how could it be otherwise im not what i was she said she thought the rape had degraded her the fault is not yours i exclaimed no fault is yours you were the victim of again i paused suffering an ugly realization of a male i concluded my sister had been shamefully abusedand i was a member of the species that had done it i had a penis the weapon of the male i was culpable i had experienced an infernal excitement as i watched the horror of her humiliation i could not pretend otherwise it had been the same when i helped helse in the head my member was eager to follow the course of the pirates we talked more and i think i helped her feel better it was the least i could do she was still my sister but i was not sure i was still her brother the seed of selfaversion had been planted in me and it grew with a smoldering persistence i hoped god would smite me if i ever had another erection or even thought of touching a woman sexually male lust had destroyed my lovely sister and i could not afford to share any part of that evil chapter massacre jupiter orbit we were hungry but we were closing on the jupiter ring system in three more days we should be there another ship overhauled us my father looked worried friend or enemy he asked we cant take the chance diego said we must assume we have few friends in space well have to set an ambush but if theyre friendlywe do need food i didnt mean wed attack them unprovoked seсor we just need to be armed and readyand if they manifest as pirates well jump them and this time we wont let them go if theyre not pirates well never show what were ready for my father nodded sounds good to me that means well have to act normal with the women and children in evidence yes but at the same time we must be armed and ready we know the penalty for failure we know my father agreed grimly he hardly showed his reaction to the rape of his daughter but i knew he had been deeply wounded i think he maintained a firm presence because he was afraid my mother would collapse if he did not i would have considered this mutual bracing in crisis to be a good object lesson in human nature had it not been my own family concerned so my father carried on in a nearly normal manner while my mother stayed mostly out of sight and i think i understood them both and respected them for the way they handled it naturally i had to carry on too so as not to weaken the family effort the ship closed and locked onto our main air lock i wished there were some way to prevent this but the designers of bubbles had not anticipated the problem of piracy in deep space any ship could attach to and board a bubble all locks were interconnectable thus the best of intentions led to the worst of errorsas far as we were concerned the lock opened being worked from the other side and gaudily garbed bearded men trooped in they certainly looked like pirates my father went up to them were glad you have come were trying to get to jupiter but were short of food the man hardly looked at him bind the men line up the womenthe young ones well loot after were sated diego needed no more these pirates werent even making any pretence at honest dealing he drew a penknife and slashed at the nearest pirate cutting his sword arm the pirate screamed our other men pounced two to a pirate in moments almost bloodlessly our forces had made the pirates captive our preparation had paid off handsomely then something strange happened there was a thin keening sound not exactly painfulbut somehow i lost volition i had been sitting with spirit who was now garbed as a boy where we could keep an eye on both the pirates and cell where helse and faith were we were keeping both of them out of the action just in case though the rest of the bubble thought helse was male now i watched the pirates turn on diego and my father and throw them against the wall near the air lockand somehow i didnt react garcнa was near us oh no he muttered theyve got a pacifier a pacifier i knew what that was though i had never before experienced its effect personally it was an electronic gadget that broadcast a semisonic wave that interfered with the human nervous system it did not damage people or knock them out it merely diluted their concentration or their will to action it was like a soporific drug some rich men used these devices as sleeping medication and they were supposed to be useful in prisons and mental institutions and yes i had heard of them being used illicitly to make women unresistive to rape they were far too expensive for peasants to own the pirates must have stolen one in the course of their routine marauding and kept it in reserve for just such an occasion as this probably someone in their ship had orders to watch and turn it on when things went wrong for themas had been the case here i cursed that instrumentbut not vehemently for vehemence was not possible while it functioned i damned myself for my failure to overcome the ennui but could do no more than that i just sat there and watched my father get knocked about and bounced into the wall but spirit had more resistance than i did she had always been a spirited girl true to her name though she had been named long before the trait manifested somehow her neural chemistry differed she was able to assert partial free will she began to move toward the pirates they will hurt you i warned without particular emphasis i knew intellectually that we faced disaster but i just couldnt get emotional about it i was intellectually furious but not emotionally it was like watching a person in a drama do something stupid and identifying with that person while being unable to influence his action they wont notice me she replied she didnt sound excited the pacifier was working on her but not quite as effectively as on me why doesnt it affect the pirates garcнa asked as though this were a matter of idle curiosity then he answered his own question the field can be disrupted by certain countercurrents the pirates can have little generators on their bodies giving them protection it was strange to be discussing this so calmly while doing nothing about it then a pirate messenger came through the lock and whispered to the leader the leader looked alarmed then he set himself and started giving orders the pirates who were rounding up our unresisting men paused then turned them loose the leader raised his voice and addressed us all there is a jupiter ringuard patrol boat approaching now we dont want any trouble with them if they send an officer aboard we want you all to convince him that we are traders making a business deal with you were selling you food and were haggling over the price but its friendly he paused looking around fetch me some children he ordered his henchmen the pirates ranged out in search of children they took spirit and me and we went unresisting though i saw spirit grimace it was uncertainty that restrained her rather than inability to act she wasnt sure what would happen to the rest of us if she resisted they took helse out of the cell thinking her to be a boy my age but left faith who looked disreputable at this time one tiny silver lining for her perhaps they rousted out several smaller children soon eight of us were standing together before the air lock the pirate leader drew a great long dagger of a knife he caught a sixyearold girl by the hair and yanked her head back exposing her neck he set the blade against her throat now hear this he cried to us all ill slit this throat myself the moment anyone squawks and my men will do the same to the others at his gesture the other pirates drew their blades and menaced the rest of us so youd better convince that officer folks the pirate leader concluded unless you figure im bluffing then you do what you want and well do what we want because theres a price on all our heads if they recognize us and we wont have anything to lose if that officer catches on hell be dead too so you can just take your choice between the robbery we have in mindand your children the worst of it was he wasnt bluffing it did not require my talent to fathom that these men really were killers worse than the first bunch they had made no pretence of being anything other than pirates from the outset now well turn off the box the pirate leader concluded you will have volitionbut we have your children the pirate by the air lock turned off the box suddenly i had strength of will again but there was a blade at my back and i knew it would be worse than futile to bolt we had no way to coordinate to run together and nowhere to go if we did run we had all been disarmedand half of us really were children despite all our preparations we were helpless that bothered me i think almost as much as our predicament the fact that we had been caught unprepared after thinking we were ready now an officer of the lawjupiter lawthe very type of person we most wanted to meetwas coming and we could do nothing three pirates took the two smallest girls and a baby boy through the lock into their ship the boy whimpered and his mother moved nervously but he went along these were the ultimate hostages the most vulnerable of our number i could have identified all their parents by their reactions had i not already known until we had these children safely back we were completely nullified i glanced at our martialarts instructor and saw him standing with a grim expression he knew better than anyone that the pirates device of protection was too effective all we could do was cooperate and hope for a favorable break the space officer arrived he was wearing a conventional space suit emblazoned with the great red ball of the jupiter service he was the representative of the foremost power in the solar systembut in person he was a small somewhat pudgy man seemingly uncertain he would have been nothing if it werent for the devastating guns of the navy ship trained on both our vessels how easy it would be to alert that ship and maybe get us all blasted to pieces but that would hardly be to our advantage we had to gamble on the lesser evil of the pirates mercy lesser evil there would be more than one woman raped this time i was sure and anything we had of value would be taken and some of our men would be beaten god i hated this what are you up to here the officer asked in english the language of the dominant power on jupiter there are of course four major languages used on jupiter but the speakers of the other threefrench spanish and portuguesedid not maintain space patrols that made english the most truly interplanetary one in jupiterspace thus did economics translate into culture the pirate chief smiled ingratiatingly we are only traders sir peddling staples to these travelers the officer turned to face our group true we are doing business my father said in halting english this hurt me too my father was lying at the behest of our enemies and i hated to see him thus demeaned i have never liked lying and i felt unclean for him at the some time i knew we had no choice even if spirit and helse and i were to bolt and escape our captors as we might reasonably do if we acted in unison we could not save the three smaller children and their deaths would be on our hands it was like a fingerbending hold that a bully puts on another child to force him to tell the teacher the two are only playing i hate that sort of thing but the only practical answer i ever found to it was to avoid the situation once your finger is caught its too late for sensible solutions you have to go along so i understood the situation exactlybut a special kind of rage seethed in me pirates like this should be extirpated from the face of the universe the officers brow wrinkled i realized he did not understand my fathers strongly accented english quickly i spoke up in better english my father says we are doing business i explained and realized that now i shared the lie directly damn how i hated every aspect of this drug business the jupe officer demanded no drugs my father assured him honestly enough in spanish and that negation needed no translation see that you dont well be watching you the officer turned abruptly and departed it seemed his shuttle craft had latched on to the other port of the pirate ship so he had to pass through that ship to leave us in a moment we felt the tremor of the shuttle craft disengaging and jetting away back to its mother ship that test was over but i did not feel much relieved now release our children my father said the pirate leader considered and in that moment he reminded me uncomfortably of the way the horse had pondered after we had turned his men loose ah yes the children he turned his head and yelled into the ship you through with the brats just about a voice called back just about i experienced a new chill what were they doing with these children then they brought the children back the two little girls were naked and crying a pirate carried the baby boy who was also naked but silent the man stepped out and threw the boy to the floor a paroxysm of horror passed through our group the boys eyes were open and staring and his chest was still he was dead now it was apparent that the little girls had been raped it seemed every man in our group launched himself at the pirates but then the pacifier box came on again and the charge became a shambles its impetus gone the broadcast interference was not psychological it was physical no amount of determination could overcome this paralysis of the voluntary functions the pirate leader drew his sword smiling grimly he seemed to be enjoying this he had wanted us to see the children and to react as we did and to be cut down to helplessness again you made trouble for us we dont like that my father was closest to him the pirate raised his sword in a twohanded grip and swung it savagely i saw as if it were in slow motion the blade cut into my fathers side it sliced through clothing and rib cage and into the lung and the blood poured out like the living thing it was i knew in that moment that we should have blown the whistle on the pirates when the jupe officer was here we had been held passive by a threat to hostages who were even then being savaged we had had nothing to lose had we but known it we had been too trustingand now were paying the hideous price would the pirates really have dared to kill the jupe officer now i doubted it for it would have meant the end of the pirate ship possible complete destruction by a military missile now it was carnage ruthlessly the pirates hacked apart our men who were unable to resist they left none alive such was the enervation spawned by the devilbox that all we could do was moan in soft horror we couldnt act they hurled the bleeding bodies into a pile then sheathed the swords and came after the women some unsatisfied with what they saw started rechecking the cells i saw someone open the panel of number where faith still hid i remembered that helse had taken the opportunity provided by the presence of the jupe officer to return to that cell no one had been paying attention to her among the pirates so she had gotten away with it but that minor escape had accomplished nothing for there was the pirate at the cell the man looked down then paused as if struck then he closed the panel and went on what had happened the pacifier box prevented any attack against any pirate meanwhile another pirate took hold of my mother bringing my attention back to closer events the cell well around the curve of the commons was difficult to see anyway i had positioned myself to have it in view without being close enough to attract attention to it the pirate literally tore the clothing from my mother while she tried feebly to pull away crying i felt a truly terrible ragebut still it did not translate to my body my nerves might as well have been cut so that my limbs would not respond it was hard enough just to turn my head there was a crash my head jumped around spirit possessing more volition than the rest of us and perhaps more common sense had reached the unguarded box picked it up and smashed it suddenly we all were free i ran to help my mother who was on her back the pirate tearing at the shreds of her underclothing as he came down on top of her neither he nor she realized that we refugees had been freed to fight i leaped to land on his back my hands reaching around to his head trying to pull him back though my weight bore down on him i was so crazy with grief and rage and horror that i remembered none of the precepts we had been drilled in i just put his head in a bearhug and shoved with my feet angrily he shook me off half rising and reaching for his sword he was so powerful i couldnt possibly hold him i realized belatedly i should have grabbed a hammer or something and smashed him on the head now i was in trouble but the pirate grunted and collapsed my mother had remembered one of the lessons and jerked up her knee the moment she had leverage and scored on his crotch the fight was mostly out of him there followed an amazingly savage conflict as the other women and children recovered their volition and sought revenge for the brutality of the pirates they clawed at faces and bit at hands and kicked at anything in reach the pirates were burly men accustomed to violence and bloodshed but they had not before been betrayed by their pacifier box they werent used to having the victims fight back there were a dozen pirates in the bubble five times that many women pounced on them like vicious harpies i saw one woman kneel on the head of a pirate while another drove an iron knitting needle into his ear as deep as it would go it took only a moment for the man to stop jerking and screaming i saw another trying to castrate a pirate with a sharp letter opener an antique that had surely been saved as an heirloom since letters had not needed such service for centuries an immense and truly horrifying well of violence had been tapped and i saw that we were in our deepest essence no better than our enemies injured and bleeding the surviving pirates beat a disorganized retreat and slammed the air lock closed in moments their ship disengaged and fled we were left with our victoryand our grief we had had sixty grown men in our complement all had been slain in the pirates orgy of killing while we were helpless three pirates also lay dead in their blood and the baby boy the two raped little girls stood staring not grasping any of this i went to my father hoping somehow to discover him alive but knowing better i looked down through burning eyes at his corpse how terrible his fall how ignoble the deed nothing in my fathers life or philosophy justified this dreadful termination and i by getting my family into the trouble that forced our exodus had been the cause in a moment i felt someone at my side it was spirit i clutched her to me sharing my agony with her we had never dreamed of desolation like this now the women were scattered across the commons suffering their separate reactions no trace of their violence of a moment ago remained the departure of the pirates had excised the savagery in us some had found their husbands and were keening their grief kneeling and bending their torsos forward and back letting out part of their pain others were standing absolutely still and silent just looking down i realized that there is no set formula for the abatement of intolerable loss we must do something spirit said i wrenched myself away from my horror realizing she was correct we had suffered an appalling disasterbut disorganization would only exacerbate our situation we had to have a new leader who would see to whatever had to be done but who with no men remaining among us use your talent hope spirit told me she sounded so practical that i looked at her her eyes were staring out of her head like those of a little automaton but she was right again her shock simply had not yet progressed to her vocal cords how she would react when the full impact affected her i did not know some horrors like some joys seem to be too massive to grasp all at once i thought a moment then recalled a woman of grandmotherly age huge and ugly and competent she was concha ortega a darkskinned widow who was traveling with her three grandchildren not one of those children ever misbehaved none of them had been among those taken hostage by the pirates which perhaps would enable her to be more objective than she might otherwise have been i saw my mother making her way toward us she was an awful sight her hair was ragged her clothing shredded and there was a glazed look about her take care of mother i murmured to spirit and departed i knew my little sister would do what little could be done i made my way to seсora ortega who was hauling the body of a pirate toward the air lock excuse me doсa concha i said to her i am hope hubris major hubriss son you must be our new leader she viewed me contemplatively by what authority don hope do you appoint me to such office she was extremely imposing with halfcropped gray hair lineencased eyes and much mass of body and i felt like the stripling i was as that gaze fell on me its just that i know i said all our men are gone and you are the best woman you understand discipline you know what to do you must lead or we shall be leaderless and perish in space she pondered briefly you are right little man she said it must be done i have suffered no recent losses i can put my mind to this problem thank you doсa i said retreating seсora ortega raised her voice addressing the entire bubble we must provide proper burial for our dead she announced we must show proper respect proper respectshe had hit a note that resonated grief was piercing but respect was vital it was the dues paid the dead under seсora ortegas direction the bodies were moved to the vicinity of the rear air lock and laid out there in such style as was possible considering the absence of facilities and the scantness of gravity in that region the survivors closed the eyes of the men washed the bodies with sponges from the heads and reclothed them for burial the signs of devastation were removed as much as possible so that the men appeared to be sleeping there was a problem with the bodies of the three pirates no one wished to do them honor we hauled them to the front air lock and dumped them unceremoniously we closed the lock and made ready to use the override control to open the outer port without first decompressing the lock that would hurl the bodies into space unburied unlamented no my mother said looking up from my fathers body speak charity hubris seсora ortega said what would you do with this rubbish i would use it to greet the next pirates who come my mother said and there was a note in her voice that sent a chill through me there was a murmur of surprised agreement among the women how confidently would a pirate enter if he discovered three of his kind mutilated and dead in the air lock of the bubble supposedly waiting to be fleeced excellent notion doсa charity seсora ortega agreed i noticed how careful she was to employ the ceremonial address providing respect to the living as well as to the dead she was indeed the proper leader we shall save those bodies for such use we shall post the warning of the skull on the stake for in earths past savage tribes had demarked their ranges by such means plain warning to intruders then she paused in thought should we evacuate the air from that lock even the children knew the consequence of leaving bodies in air and warmth there would come a horrendous stench grimly the women decided to leave the air in the lock that ugly business done we returned to the rites for our gallant men normally death is a family affair in our culturebut not all the men had adult kin here in the bubble while some families had made this trip without men so everything was awkward and it seemed best to handle it as a community effort we arranged to have all the men suitably prepared and we tore up one black gown donated for the purpose into strips for black armbands of mourning for all even though we were all hispanic there were differences in the details of our customs so again we compromised on the single uniform service there were suggestions of the roman rite and the gothic rite with our scant and precious incense burned and the lips of some men anointed with oil dena concha led us in singing the psalm de profundis out of the depths have i cried to thee o lord i trust in the lord my soul waits for his word oh it moved me i had to believe that the lord would accept my father and treat him kindly then a few complimentary words were spoken for each dead man and there was general praise for the group of them doсa concha did a good job she had been through it with her own husband who had died some years before so understood the needs of the families though she had not herself been touched this time i fancy myself as being not superstitious or overly emotional but that quiet sincere service helped me tremendously when she praised my father calling him don major and describing in a few words his integrity and bravery in leading our group toward jupiter tears of sheer joy mixed with those of grief in my eyes and the terrible burden of his loss eased significantly it is truly bad to lose ones father but it is best that he suffer a heros demise im sure the others felt the same as she spoke of their own men it was of course impossible to bury them in a sanctified cemetery or to place them in crypts with flowers or to kiss the earth as it was thrown into the coffins and we elected not to use the few simple candles we possessed not wishing to tax the airrecycling system with so much open flame we decided to do the best we could to bury them temporarily outside on the bubble a select crew donned space suits and took the bodies one by one out the rear lock we were not relegating them to space but securing them to the outside of the bubble in plastic wraps and whatever else could be made to serve so that they would be preserved by the cold and vacuum until the time they could be properly interred on planetary ground we could not keep them inside the bubble of course and outside was as perfect a deepfreeze as exists they would be preserved intact for eternity out there so it was done and we sang the canticle benedictus with the antiphon ego sum resurrectio et vita i am the resurrection and the life the earth had figuratively been thrown into the graves and the necessary formalities were over seсora ortega explained gently that though we all should normally be permitted to retire to our justified grief it was nonetheless necessary for us to keep the bubble functioning and on course we would never be able to give our men proper burial if we did not survive ourselves so she declared an end to formal grief leaving only the armbands as if a year had suddenly passed she asked those of us who were able to function to join her in operating the bubble this would not she assured us signify any lack of feeling or any affront to the dead but rather our recognition of what had to be done in a most difficult situation the way she expressed it it was easy to agree we had chosen well in this leader when a small crew of those women who had some grasp of the principles of gravityshield navigation had been assembled seсora ortega dismissed the rest of us to our cells the best thing you can do right now is mourn your dead in privacy she said send them to heaven with your prayers i know what you are feeling my own grief is long behind me and it occurred in better times than these you suffer now but i remember in this way she returned informally what she had denied formally the timely expression of grief we went to our cells but it was not a simple retirement i realized abruptly that my mother should not be alone in her cell i spoke to faith who had remained in her own cell throughout thus missing much of the horror of the pirate encounter it was not that she lacked feeling for our father but that the full appreciation of his death added at this time to her existing state could have destroyed her yet i feared for the welfare of our mother too please join her i asked faith you can understand and comfort her better than i could for you are a woman faith looked at me with a headtilt of startlement then swept back her hair and climbed to the next cell she knew her own dismay had been preempted by a greater one but now spirit was alone i hesitated knowing this was not right for her either helse arrived go with your sister hope she said i am not bereaved except to the extent i knew and respected those members of other families who died i will try to help someone who needs it i felt a warm surge of gratitude toward her thanks i joined spirit in her cell spirit abruptly flung her arms about me buried her face in my shoulder and bawled it was at that moment of letdown that the enormity of our tragedy struck me until then the continuing exigencies of our situation had caused me to hold much of the horror at bay except when i thought specifically of my father now it overwhelmed me too i clung to my crying little sister and sobbed as vehemently as she chapter to love and be loved jupiter orbit but a person cannot cry forever spirit bounced back first somewhat wasted having washed much of the first rush of grief out of her system i knew she still suffered but already she was coming to terms with it i had to follow her in that recovery for i was now the oldest male in our family and that is a thing of special significance i would not presume of course to order my mother around but it would be my position to formulate family initiatives and make suggestions that i knew my mother and older sister would take seriously so i forced my own continuing agony of soul into a compartment like the cell i slept in closed the panel on it as well as i could and required myself to function my mother and sisters could grieve i would have to endure there were meals to be fetched and distributed though our shortage was now ironically less acute because of our diminished number seсora ortega asked me to resume my prior capacity as food distributor and to expand my activities as necessary since i was now the oldest male in the bubble oh yes that woman knew how to make a young person do her bidding i agreed and got to work and found that there was indeed reprieve from grief in work we had to reorganize the heads for it was senseless to reserve half the bathrooms for males who no longer lived i asked spirit to explain to women how they might be able to use the male facilities by assisting each other as i had assisted helsebut cautioned her that she should present this as her own idea and to leave helse out of it as helse was still considered a boy if seсora ortega suspected that helse was older than i or that she was female seсora ortega did not say i think she did suspect and did us both the quiet favor of assuming that helse was a boy a few months younger than i women of grandmotherly age can be discreet they have had a great deal of time to learn that art there was further cleaning to be done removing bloodstains from the floor and walls of the commons helse and spirit and i helped with it all keeping ourselves constantly busy it may seem that my grief for my father was shallow since i was soon functioning in virtually normal fashion and am not referring to it in every paragraph of this narrative i protest that this was not the case my father was much in my mind but i knew i could not bring him back no matter how much pain i felt and it is pointless to grow repetitive here i worked to help alleviate the suffering of the living including especially the members of my own family and i hope i succeeded in this i discovered that in this effort was the most effective reduction of my own pain so do not slight me for my seeming neglect i have written as much of this aspect as i care to though it hardly does justice to the reality spirit had found another girl her age who of course had suffered similar loss and they spent the next night together that freed me to return to helseand i needed to do that because she maintained her masculine masquerade and only i could help her in the head how she managed that one night by herself i do not know perhaps she borrowed a mop handle to push against the far wall and hold herself in place it cannot have been comfortable the first night i was back with her after the slaughter i found it difficult to relax let alone sleep i tossed about in the partial gravity but it was not my own discomfort that haunted me so much as my fathers he was outside in the cold now was he shivering did he gasp for air in the cruel vacuum of course notyet as i drifted off to sleep i phased into a dream awareness of major hubris alive and well to my gratified surprise but i knew even in the dream that it was not so and that if i embraced him i would feel the absolute chill of space in his flesh i felt it my duty to advise him of the truth that he was evidently not yet aware of for my father always preferred to be in touch with reality even when it was not pleasant whereupon surprised he turned slowly to a staring corpse with a great red wound in his side he looked in that instant like jesus christ and i could not scream in horror lest i defile an image i was not worthy to approach i shuddered awake finding helse holding me oh death is no thing of joy i would help you if i could helse murmured but this is not like the other not like the case with faith i have had no direct experience with death leave me alone i snapped i shouldnt have done that and dont know why i did it and was sorry immediately but unable to apologize grief is like that too grief is not necessarily any prettier than death and the griefstricken do not wander like lambs grateful for the shepherds guidance they can be more like wounded wolves snapping at those who would help them she did leave me alone and i slept intermittently again but i had not escaped my nightmare it came at me again and again like a ravening monster its moist teeth seeking to rend my flesh it was guilt the personification of my neglect could i have done something to avert the tragedy why had i had such ennui when the pirates were slaughtering our men why had i stood silent when the pirates hoodwinked the officer from the jupiter patrol certainly the pirates had held three children hostagebut those children had been doomed anyway and by my neglect our entire group had become vulnerable why hadnt i screamed the truth to the officer it seemed so simple in retrospect i had known the pirates were not to be trusted i banged my fist against the wall in frustration i woke again feeling helses restraint on my arm hope youll hurt yourself she protested i ought to kill myself i flared i let my father die but there was the pacifier you tried to shut up i shouted and spun through the same cycle of selfreproach and inaction as before she shut up and again i tried to sleep if i did i got no satisfaction of it for the horror and guilt stalked me relentlessly gradually i realized that the truths i cached away in emotional compartments during the day only gained strength to conquer me at night when my resistance was down and the most fundamental truth was the one i had glimpsed before when faith was raped a man was a creature of murderous lusts and i was a man i might as well have raped my sister and murdered my father myself only circumstance had put me in the camp of the victims rather than that of the perpetrators i was a damned creature because of my anatomy and nature i contemplated my erect member and cursed it you are the cause of all this i ranted you dont care who you hurt for i knew that a sword is but a symbol of the phallus and when it plunges into a living body and causes blood to spurt that is a symbolic sexual act that is why women are not much for violence they lack the weapon i ought to rip you out by the root again i woke to find helses hands on me preventing me from attempting what i had threatened in the dream my rage was swiftly replaced by chagrin for of course she had seen me handling my aroused private but she said nothing and i remembered that the male member was no stranger to her she knew better than anyone else the nature of the lusts of the male i turned my back on her and struggled back to a semblance of sleep once more this time i made it fairly well through the arbitrary night of the bubble the following day was grueling my intermittent nights sleep left me illprepared to fend off the emotional horrors i went about my business in grim silence spirit tried to speak to me but i repulsed her then cursed myself for it when i saw her silent hurt tears but i did not try to make amends it was as though my emotions were under the type of interdict the pacifier box had instilled so that i could lash out verbally but not apologize i saw that there were others as morose as i and some refused to come out of their cells to eat one woman went into the head and did not emerge when someone finally checked they discovered her dead she had cut open an artery in her thigh and bled to death on the bidet suicide i knew exactly how she felt helse guided me to our cell early hope you are dying on your feet she told me i think i can help you now nothing can help me i muttered but i was so tired and dazed that i offered no resistance then perhaps as much to hurt her as from curiosity i asked that pirate who started to go after you and faithwhy did he quit i spoke the word she said that was what i had suspected but had the pirate left them alone because he feared qyvor because he thought they were two teenage boys i resented the fact that my parents had had no such magic word to protect them what grief we all might be spared if we could deter malice with a single spoken syllable when helse had secured the cell and had me alone she used some cloth to block the faint light spilling in around the panel putting us in darkness then she dropped to the floor and moved about away from me two meters cubed is not a lot of space for two people but i was in the corner and she was in the opposite corner i could hear her without seeing her in a moment she was back please remove your clothes she said what i asked dully i am nude i want you to be too i dont understand i know i can help you sleep well she came to me and took hold of my shirt and started to remove it for me i resisted helse if anyone should look in here i told them i would talk to you and straighten you out you have been bristling at everyone no one will look or listenand anyway ive blocked the cracks they cant see in from the commons they could wrench open the panel idiot if you dont have your clothes onthey will know spirit already knows shes a child yes again she worked at my shirt this time i let her do it i didnt know what she was up to but it was better than the nightmares i faced when i slept after she got the shirt off she worked on the trousers now i was afraid to stop her for she seemed to know what she was doing while i was a mass of confusion she bid me stand and i stood and she undid my belt and took my clothing down i simply let her continue until she had me naked she ran her hands lightly over my body in the darkness not excluding the genital i was aroused of course it could hardly have been otherwise there was something about being undressed by a woman this way she evinced no shock or surprise and i was reminded again that she had done things with men i had never imagined but such would not be the case with me i was no pirate or seducer of children she made me lie on the floor using some wadded clothing for cushioning then lay down on her side beside me her warm bare thigh touched mine and her cool soft breast rested against my left arm i hardly dared breath hope i want to tell you about sex she said ive been listening to you talking in your sleep and i think i understand your problem you saw the pirates rape your sister and you think its your fault you think all men are like that youre afraid one day youll rape someone she was right on target i said nothing well you wont she said im not as sharp as you are about judging people but i do know something about this all men are not alike in any way some are terrible like the piratesbut some are so gentle and nice they would never hurt anyone most are in between like your fatherand you they all like sex that has nothing to do with the way they are but the bad ones use sex to hurt people and the good ones use it to make people happy the pirates were not getting pleasure of faith they were punishing the people of the bubble thats different just because you have thisat this point she put her hand firmly on my rigid genitalit doesnt mean youre bad i know you hope i know you as well as i possibly can in a week i know you are good you get angry you make mistakes you sufferbut you are good you have nothing to hurt meor anyone still the vision of the pirates raping my sister haunted me and of the one trying to rape my mother between those two was the murder of my father inextricably linked i never wanted to share any part of the life or lust of those pirates i remembered how my member had swelled when i saw faith raped and it damned me at this very moment similarly it had a will of its own and i could not trust it its the difference between a theft and a gift she continued when you steal something or take it by force you hurt someone but when you accept a gift you hurt no one and both the giver and the receiver profit the gracious acceptance of a gift is a gift in itself all you have to do is decide never to steal never to cheat or deceive or force and always to accept a proper gift then you will know you are not like those pirates and never will be you will know that you have tamed the fires in you and turned it to proper advantage i pondered that it seemed to make sense all right she waited but i did not move i was holding my fire tame i dont think ive quite convinced you yet she said you will still have nightmares you still think you can hurt me if you let yourself go yes i was afraid that if i moved at all i would do something terrible im going to make you know its not true she said this is the one thing i can do for you to repay you for helping me for keeping my secret i thought she was going to talk to me again explaining how i was normal and it was all right to be normal but she didnt speak she shifted herself about climbing on top of me i refused to move a muscle not from any antagonism to herit was impossible to feel that now for her sleek womans body electrified me wherever it touched my fleshbut because any motion at all would represent a commitment one way or the other she held herself above me then lay full length on me her breasts resting on my chest her thighs falling outside mine she brought her head down and touched my lips with hers and it was as though i was being propelled through space without moving at all i had never known that mere touch could have such an effect still i did not move she shifted herself again getting her balance then used one hand to catch and guide my member pointing it the way she wanted she raised her hips then slowly settled on me again so gently and easily that i could hardly believe it was real i found myself inside her now tell me this is evil she murmured letting her thighs settle all the way against me and bringing the rest of her body down so that she lay as she had before her breasts pressing me down only one detail had changed a small detail yet with an overwhelming significance still i would not move or speak it was fear as much as stubbornness i really did not know what to do and was afraid that anything would be wrong and would make her angry or hurt her tell me you are raping me she said putting her hand behind my head as her whole body pressed more tightly against mine her weight was light less than halfgee it might have been uncomfortable in full earth gravity but even so her body was the most wonderful thing i could possibly know tell me you love me she whispered and now her tone of challenge had become one of urgent pleading when i still was silent she dipped her head and kissed me again but this differed as the other position differed from before from the prior kiss this time her mouth was open and her tongue came through to touch mine i was at last overwhelmed i love you i breathed around our tongues and was transported by a paroxysm of amazing sensation i woke it seemed an eon later helse lay beside me her hand holding mine she squeezed my fingers and i knew she was awake what is it that you want that cannot be bought i asked remembering what she had said before you know it now i knew it now i discovered to love and be loved i said but why me youre a decent person and you need me she said simply i need you i agreed and slept again my hand in hers without illdream in the morning bubble time i found her still beside me sleeping still i could not see her except as the vaguest outline and i discovered i did not dare touch her body for fear that everything would turn out to be illusion i realized that she had been kind to me and more than kind she had shown me in an absolutely believable manner that sex itself was not evil in the time following that realization was to expand and deepen becoming a fundamental aspect of my philosophy this was helses invaluable gift to me my honest acceptance of my male nature but right then i did not perceive that essence so clearly i was only aware of helse herself and of my need for her had she given me her body for a night to tide me through the storm of my guilt and grief or was there more to it than that i had said i loved her and indeed i did in that overwhelming flush of feeling that a person my age and temperament is capable of it was sudden but profound but she she had not said she loved me and she was a year older than i in my desperation to know i reached out and found her shoulder she woke immediately and caught my hand in hers helse i said but then could not find the phrasing for the question yes hope she murmured iswill there be another time she brought my hand to her lips and kissed it sending a sweet tingle through me if you ask me ask you i repeated perplexed i wont do it for you next time hope she explained you will have to ask me then i will do it that wasnt enough of an answer i struggled to formulate my objection i dont want your acquiescence that could be for any reason i want your love she frowned against my palm i never said i loved you hope i know but i love you she sighed you are less experienced than i am hope you mistake rapture for love your emotion is shaken by tragedy it is right for me to ease your confusion in my fashion but not to ask too high a price when you are able to put it in perspective you will know that love is not made in a single night i jerked my hand away from her hurt she apologized immediately hope i did not mean to imply your emotion is not real or strong only that it is too soon to distinguish passion from love i have been loved for a night by many men by day they have other interests had i loved any of them i would have been hurt for my love is not just for a night give me leave to protect myself from heartbreak as i protect my body from abuse by concealing it from strangers i began to understand a little better but you could love me if you were sure of me it is my dream to love and be loved still that gentle evasion she was being honest with me and i appreciated that but still it was hard to accept i sat up disgruntled wanting more than i had any right to ask may i kiss you she asked i would like that i said somewhat stiffly she got to her knees leaned across found my face and kissed me her lips were warm and moist and her body where it touched mine was wonderfully soft when you ask and it is granted it is good she said i wish i could ask for your love she smiled a faint gleam of teeth in the dark and separated we dressed then went out in the guise of two boys to visit the head helse had opened a door to a new dimension to me the dimension of love but some things had not changed chapter sacrifice jupiter orbit bubble life was routine as far as possible i still felt the terrible loss of my father and knew it was worse for my mother and sisters helse had taken a huge segment of my aroused emotion and turned it positive so that i had a kind of internal counterbalance but my mother and sisters lacked that i realized that thanks to helses gift i was now stronger than they like a shipwrecked sailor who has found a barrel to cling to while others had nothing i could not share my support with them and could not even confess its nature for they believed helse was a boy like me except spirit she caught me alone in the course of the day and had to needle me how was it brother she asked snidely a host of flip answers escaped before i could formulate any of them verbally i love her i said simply she glanced at me a long moment having the grace to be embarrassed im sorry i put my arm about her shoulders forgiving her i know how it is i said remembering how snappish i had been before when my internal problem radiated sparks at other people i had no need of that anymore youre still my sister youre the only one who shares that secret still im jealous she admitted you have no need to be you arent competing with her yes i am if you had to throw one of us into space which one would it be the way to counter a question like that is to reverse it if you had to throw faith or me into space which would it be that depends who im mad at at the moment but spirit turned sober considering the implication when you grow up and love a man ill try not to be too jealous i said oh go ahead and be jealous she muttered but she smiled then in the treacherous way she had she returned to her opening question tell me what its like she begged please hopei really want to know spirit was twelve did i have the right to tell her about sex i had just learned about it myself of course we both knew the sterile mechanics as taught in school and the applicable terms we also both knew that such things had almost nothing to do with real sex or love i remembered the way older children both male and female had teased me in past years about my curiosity and ignorance it seemed to be a conspiracy of silence and i had never believed it was justified i resolved not to do that to my sister i was inside her i said carefully and heaven was inside me i wish it could have lasted forever what about all the pain and blood she asked and i saw that she was really worried she too had seen the rape of faith i should have been aware of her natural reaction before i had to reassure her about the other side of sex as helse had reassured me so she would not fear it there was no pain or blood nothing but joy but give me your hand i took her small hand in mine and squeezed it cruelly ouch she shrieked thats rape i said then i took her hand again smoothed it out caressingly and kissed it thats love she looked at her extremity but thats only my hand just one part of youand me i agreed another part was used to hurt faith terriblybut last night i used it to love helse the difference is in how you use it thats what she taught me spirit smiled quirkily i thought you used it to pee she was being humorous resisting the notion as i had resisted it during the night too simple a telling does not necessarily get the point across because the listener isnt ready to believe so i took stock again pretty much as helse had that too i agreed but not last night just about every part of the body has more than one use like the mouth that is used to eat and to talk or the nose used to breathe and smell you just have to keep in mind which use you want yes its hard to talk with your mouth full she agreed she still didnt accept it i caught her shoulder making her face me suddenly finding it vitally important to spread the new message when you grow older spirit and you love a boy and he loves you dont be afraid of his body what he has for you is not cruel and not dirty its a form of love the great crime of the pirates is that they take something perfect and abuse it making it terrible dont judge all men by them oh i dont judge our father by and how do you think you and i came to exist there is that she agreed with a wan smile but her brow furrowed again still i dont know ask helse i said she will tell you i will spirit left me i hoped i had not wished something on helse she would have preferred to avoid i talked with seсora ortega to learn how we were doing on our voyage she squinted at me youre the lad who appointed me captain she said with the trace of a grim smile yesterday you looked ready to die today you are alive youre the right person i agreed that funeral service really made me feel better and i had a good night ill be all right now are we on course a good night she repeated if i didnt know better lad id think you had discovered love maybe she was teasing me it was impossible to know how much she had guessed she got down to serious business quickly no were not on course she said frankly our girls arent as apt as the men were we havent had the training the mechanism is simple but the application takes practice so were handling the vectors clumsily oh were getting there but it wont be on the original schedule well have to stay on half rations well it could have been worse i moved on to talk with children i did not consider myself a child anymore and certainly it had been a mans duty i did with helse but my talent related well to the young folk i tried to cheer them for they had the least resources to comprehend or deal with the calamity that had befallen us all we set up games in the commons even organizing a soccer match using a tightly wrapped bundle of paper refuse for the ball it really wasnt much in this confined and curvaceous space and with the trace gravity but it did bring a few smiles to some faces and kept the kids occupied i felt this was the most useful thing i could do for now spreading some of the balm helse had provided me as it were helse joined me in the afternoon she still looked just like another boy but now i fancied i could perceive feminine contours and mannerisms in her hidden from other eyes i still had not seen her body clearly in its natural state and now i wanted to knowing the rapture it offered me i have been talking with your sisters she said with a wry smile i dont like keeping secrets from spirit i said knowing my little sister had wasted no time on her factfinding mission she said you said you love me and had great joy last night its true i admitted she asked me and i told her i wouldnt lie to my little sister i didnt think you would mind spirits curious about everything but she never betrays a confidence then you dont mind if i tell her she shrugged anything no of course i dont mind i sent her to you i dont want her to be afraid she shook her head you are remarkably open i frowned no im not open with everyone spirit is special we dont deceive each other we fight sometimes but we always understand if she had a similar experience she would tell me now that shes seen her sister raped she needs to understand that it doesnt have to be that way yes of course i was surprised thats all men usually talk about such things to other men not to their sisters spirit is different i repeated firmly not faith faith is more like an ordinary sister she braced me helse said i had to tell her my secret i dont see why i said annoyed i try to protect faith but i dont share secrets with her she really cares for you hope she appreciates what youve done for her the siblings are much closer in your family than they were in mine i envy you that faith saw the change in you today and she worried but i didnt talk with her today still she noticed shes not totally out of it hope shes recovering your support really helped her oh i was pleased she must have figured it would take more than a talkingto to put me back on track yes she guessed there was a liaison and she thought i was male i felt myself abruptly blushing she thought she hoped it wasnt so but she feared for your orientation right now under this terrible stress so i had to tell her i guess you did i agreed still embarrassed id better talk to her no need she was relieved i think she thought she could be responsible for you turning away from the opposite sex because of the rape she was concerned for my reaction to what happened to her i asked amazed rather than for her own horror shes got that basic hubris spirit of unity its a precious quality she would do anything to spare the others in her family the humiliation she suffered i guess i didnt give her enough credit i said ruefully she worried about me i was concerned too maybe in a slightly different way thats why i acted you sure did i agreed in one hour you changed my life forever i think faith and i are going to be friends yes i think so i was both embarrassed and gratified embarrassed for the way i had evidently seemed to those who were close to me and gratified for the way they had tried to help after that i talked with faith myself explaining what helse had done for me im not ashamed to be a man i told her i dont for a moment condone what happened to you but its all right hope she said she looked better now she had washed herself and brushed out her hair she was indeed recovering having more inner strength than i had credited we have all had a terrible education in the past few days im glad you found her i should have known better than to worry how is mother i asked cautiously i was glad to see faith regaining her equilibrium but i wasnt certain how far it went hope we have to take care of her i thought i was badly off untilits so much worse for her what can we do for her i asked surprised by my sisters animation faith had always been relatively sedate and retiring spirit was the wild one in our family and i was in between now faith was turning more decisive could her awful experience have changed her outlook helse told me a pirate tried to rape mother and you fought him off more or less i agreed spirit smashed the pacifier box so the rest of us could fight i wasnt very effective spirit really saved us all i dont wantthatto happen to charity hubris faith said firmly shes our mother hope so if the pirates come again and we cant stop them she broke off evidently not finding it easy to speak her thought well stop them somehow i said with a certain bravado if they have that awful pacifier box or something she took a breath and swallowed if it comes to that hope i want you to send them my way not mothers way i stared at her horrified faith you know what they do she smiled wanly i think i know as well as any woman can but what have i to lose now hope we cant let our mother be defiled i hate even to think of this i exclaimed we should kill every pirate who comes into this bubble yes we should but if we cantthen we must handle them another way promise me you will do it if it needs to be done i resisted but she kept at me somewhat the way helse hadand in the end i had to yield and give my promise there is something about the way a woman can importune a man even if she is his sister but i felt unclean perhaps it was prophetic for within an hour after that the pirates did come again not the same onesbut already the term pirate was generic we did not know at first that they were pirates their ship was in good repair and bore the emblem of the mars merchant marine that did not signify much because for reasons of interplanetary commerce many nonmartian vessels elected to register with mars martian taxes were less than those of jupiter uranus or earth and fuel was cheap there as the socalled red planet had much of the fuel of the solar system but mainly as i understood it from my school studies mars had extremely lax laws governing the wages and treatment of spacemen the large trading companies could operate more profitably by economizing on safety measures and payrolls and retirement benefits so they enlisted with the planet that permitted this the maritime powers of jupiter professed to deplore such shoddy mechanismsyet quite a number of their ships operated under the emblem of mars so a martian trader ship could be anything except we naпvely supposed a pirate they locked onto us and opened the air lock there was a pause before the inner door opened and we knew they had discovered the dead and spoiling pirates but soon the inner panel slid aside and a man in a white uniform stood before us we had an innocentseeming group of women near the lock to greet the intruders hidden around the curve of the commons we had armed women ready to fight viciously if that proved to be necessary normally women were not warriors but the brutal experience of rape and murder had forged a new temperament in many before we allowed more of the same we would fight and kill we all understood that twice we had overcome intruders and twice had our situation reversedand twice suffered grievously experience is a cruel but effective teacher spirit garbed as a boy was one of the display children they were innocently playingbut she was armed with her fingerwhip and the others had small knives if the others turned out to be pirates she and the children were supposed to scream in simulated or genuine panic and flee clearing the way for our fighting forces if anything resembling a pacifier box made an appearance spirit would go for it but if the children were caught they would fight we had to give the outsiders a chance to prove they were legitimate just in case they were for we were in desperate need of food and help we dared not alienate legitimate visitors you folk must have had a bad time the martian officer said in spanish looking about as his men followed him through the air lock all were cleancut and wore sidearms not swords we discovered quite a mess in your air lock its all right now we dumped the stuff in space and fumigated the lock my mother was in the innocent group of women she had roused herself from her grief to participate in this for she knew she was only one of many who had been abruptly widowed and that someone had to carry on even as we children had to protect her she tried to protect us that was part of what it meant to be a family i was coming to appreciate the full significance of it in this adversity major hubris had been lost but his family carried on as if his strength had been bequeathed to each of the survivors we were raided by pirates she said all our men were killed well thats over now the officer said we shall carry you on in to jupiter where you will be granted refugee status collect your things were on a schedule and havent much time dont bother with extra clothing well issue you uniforms from our stores slowly i relaxed this was almost too good to be true if they towed us the rest of the way in to jupiter our hunger and fear was over i turned to meet helses eyes the two of us had been relegated to the center chamber of the bubble the doughnut hole we were deemed too old to be innocent children and too young to fight but we would fight if it came to that to protect the precious remaining food stores as it was we were out of the action but could see everything plainly helse did not seem to share my relief her eyes were squinting her mouth grim that renovated my alarm did she know something i didnt uncertain the women in the commons below looked at each other leave the bubble my mother asked and i realized the officer had not actually spoken of towing but of carrying obviously you cant remain here the officer said reasonably drifting in space your supplies diminishing vulnerable to the vagaries of fate you are fortunate we spotted you fetch your valuables you dont want to be classed as paupers when you arrive the women seemed almost reluctant to believe their good fortune slowly they dispersed while the merchantmen smiled at the children one man produced a box of bright candy balls and proffered it he was promptly the center of juvenile attention as the youngest flocked to accept the goodies we had not seen candy since leaving callisto even spirit suspicious at first in due course sidled close to the friendly man and accepted a treat my mouth watered i was not yet so old that candy didnt appeal look what were missing i muttered never accept candy from a stranger helse said grimly i thought at first she was joking then was doubtful the smallest child abruptly sat down she had been greedily consuming the candy she did not seem sick but she did not get up another child joined her then a third soon all of them were sprawled on the deck spirit was one of the last to go and i could see she was fighting it but her knees buckled and betrayed her seсora ortega marched up what is the matter she demanded alarmed the officer faced her the candy is drugged but dont worry we have the antidote the children will not die if it is administered within an hour drugged seсora ortega gazed on him with wild surmise then you are merely men who labor hard on short wages and who have been too long in space the officer said you are the leader here have your women deposit their valuables with us his eyes traveled across the others who were now frozen in horror they had actually fetched their most precious things at the behest of this man we are not bad fellows if you treat us right we are not interested in killing anyone or even hurting anyone we believe in honest quidproquo any woman who desires a unit of antidote may purchase it from one of us my mother was one of the first to understand my child is among those drugged how may i purchase her reprieve you have money the officer inquired gold gems none my mother replied then you must earn it the officer glanced meaningfully at his men after a pause a burly older crewman stepped forward and gazed at her for a moment i saw her through his eyes a woman in her forties no young thing but still a fairly handsome figure of her sex the kind a middleaged man would find comfortable i began inwardly to curse the condition of masculinity then felt helse move slightly beside me and remembered her lesson the evil was not the use but the abuse ill give you my little vial of fluid woman the crewman said he held a small bottle but his entendre was obvious these were more sophisticated rapists they compelled the womens cooperation without overt violence but for all its nonviolence it remained rape my muscles clenched dont do it seсora ortega cried to my mother theyre bluffing the officer shrugged glancing at the collapsed children we are not killers certainly that decision is yours we can only remain with you for an hourafter which time it will hardly matter any woman who prefers to take a chance with her child is free to do so as i said we do not wish to coerce anyone the hypocrite i started to move but helse put her hand on my shoulder and though her touch was light it held me back helse had known better than i about the candy her judgment probably remained better i sank back my teeth clenched my mother looked at spirit who was now unconscious she wavered afraid to gamble with her childs life probably the men were bluffing and had only put knockout medicine in the candy they seemed more like unscrupulous opportunists than hardened killers surely men who spent much time in space did get hungry for women though why they didnt bring women along with them in their ship was a mystery but they were also pirates and we knew how careless of life pirates could be if they were not bluffingi felt the same stress my mother did that was spirit my little sister if i let her die when any action of mine could save her how could i even endure myself i tried to use my talent to determine the intentions of the men but i simply had not interacted with them enough to judge i could not tell to what extent they were bluffing i will buy her life my mother decided the crewman smiled i started climbing down into the commons going through the hole in the netting and using one of the guy ropes that held the netting in place so that i would not sail down sidewise and attract unwanted attention no helse hissed dont do it hope you can do nothing except make it worse i paused knowing she was right yet how could i remain idle while my mother prostituted herself to save my little sister while i debated this hanging on to the guy rope my other sister faith approached me she had put on makeup and arranged her luxuriant hair and looked like a goddess she wore a rather tight skirt and blouse the half rations seemed not to have diminished her at all probably she accepted them as just another diet i cant let this happen she said a new horror gripped me faith stay out of it she met my gaze you understand hope the terrible thing was that i did understand faith felt she had nothing to lose now she could redeem her lost honor in some measure by saving her mother and sister from this awful dilemma you promised hope she reminded me i could not say her nay though i hated every aspect of this slowly unwillingly i nodded faith made a tiny quirk of a smile i had in my fashion given permission and this was a thing she required i had implicated myself in the decision and would have to defend it i was sending her in to be rapedagain faith took a breath and walked up to the men she was slender and full and lovely and young standing out like a beacon amidst gloom and in a moment all their eyes were locked on her it was obvious that none of these men would choose any older woman if he had a chance at this young one i could appreciate the feeling myself shamed as i was by the thought i would choose a girl like faith instead of a woman like my mother god what abominations infested my thoughts how many children can i buy faith asked them softly faith my mother exclaimed shocked better me than you mother faith replied i am already lost you must care for the family and charity hubris could not deny her any more than i could faith turned back to the men breathing deeplyand when she did that she was spectacular how many all of them the officer said impressed given time his gaze flicked to a lieutenant beside him see to the valuables no faith said you shall not rob us also no the officer seemed amused take meon your ship nothing else faith my mother repeated the officer glanced again at the other men whose mouths were virtually drooling yet again i could appreciate their thoughts though i resented my very ability to do so to have a creature like this with them all the time no onehour stand you drive an interesting bargain young woman faith half turned and her body accented itself somewhere along the way she had learned a lot about sex appeal what pittance does anyone here have compared to what i offer my mother put her hands to her face but did not speak again she knew what the rest of us knew it did make sense once more the men considered its the same deal i made as a child helse murmured in my ear i had not seen her climb down to join me since i had been distracted by the uncomfortable drama of the commons i think these really are merchantmen pirating on the side its not necessarily a bad life if they like the girl these arent really violent men they just dont think it is wrong to coerce a woman into sex but shes not doing it because she wants to i protested somewhat irrelevantly yes and no few decisions in life are completely voluntary shes doing it for her family she is making a sacrifice for your benefitand for every other person in the bubble i had to file this away for later digestion take this young woman aboard the ship the officer said give her decent accommodation he reached inside his jacket and brought out a packet of vials passing it to my mother who stood in seeming shock the men left the bubble and faith went with them i feared i would never see her again the ship disengaged and jetted toward jupiter faith had bought our reprieve with her body i could only hope it was a fair deal my mothers eyes were glazing with the reaction but she took a vial and opened it and tilted its liquid into spirits mouth carefully so the child would not choke other women did the same with their children i shook myself and went to the group several vials were left over i opened one and put a drop on my tongue the fluid was completely colorless and tasteless it could have been pure water i thought about that then left without speaking if it was only water it meant one of two things either the children would dieor the drug in the candy was not truly toxic either way the merchantpirates had deceived us but what else had i expected helse rejoined me what is it hope water i said in disgust im not surprised you suspected why didnt you say something before all men are pirates at heart she caught herself i mean figuratively some are violent like the outright pirates some are disciplined and honorable like your father most are in between as i told you before they take what they can get but they prefer not to have too much of a fuss they dont mind lying to get their way if they can get a woman to submit without violence without any real danger of hurting the children such men consider this to be smart management thats just the way they see it but then faith sacrificed herself for nothing helse caught my hands in hers no hope she did it to protect her mother and sister from risk or shame she refused to gamble with their lives i knew this yet felt constrained to argue but if if we had called that bluff those men could have turned savage and raped the women violently they were armed they could have killed anyone who tried to stop them the danger was not just in the candy it was in the men honorable men would never have used coercion faith understood that so she offered them something better because she was beautiful and willing to deal they accepted they werent alltheway bad they just wanted sex she made it easy for them to be generous theyre still pirates i hissed theyre fallible men theres a difference but my sister condemned to horror your sister is so lovely i think some ranking officer will soon claim her for his own i have told her some of the arts of pleasing men in time i turned on her ferociously you told her helse stepped back hope she asked me she wanted to know i think she suspected something like this could happen and she felt guilty for hiding when your father was killed she had to redeem herself she had to make the sacrifice the others were making i clenched my fists not answering in time she may command an officers love and be well treated helse continued her future may be more secure than ours is by practicing the arts of prostitution i gritted as you practiced them on me i was sorry the moment i said it but helse only smiled she had learned to accommodate my moods she must have done the same as a child with uncle we do what we must to survive hope women dont have the brute power of men compromise is forced on us all our lives i practiced my skills on you to help you not because you forced me do not be angry with me my lover i was angry but mostly with myself if you taught my sister well enough she will have the captain of that merchant ship in thrall i hope so she drew on my arm turning me to face her as we stood above our cell please understand hope faith was publicly raped she believed she had been rendered forever unclean worthless for marriage this was a psychological thing not a logical one it was part of her selfimage i remembered how faith had asked me whether she was still my sister yes i understood about selfimage i had been going through a similar mill myself logic alone is not enough to change such deep perceptions all that was left to her was to do some good thing for her family helse continued she really cared for the rest of you though she thought herself unworthy she found the thing she could do and she did itand that key sacrifice may ironically bring her as much good as what she did for the rest of us she would never have married a man she considered to be good for fear she was unworthy of him but a bad man is all rightand if he turns out later to be a good man she will be able to accept that too because she did make her act of expiation it was her dishonor she was sacrificing for the best possible cause i was not sure i followed her logic or agreed with it but i hoped she was right how much better it would be for faith to be happy than miserable by whatever rationalization but still i hated the way it had worked out helse was educating me in the real ways of men and women and it was not an education i liked yet i knew deep down that i did have to come to terms with the realities of the human condition worse was to come hardly six hours passed before we were raided again we saw the ship bearing down on us and it was no merchant vessel this time we hid all the children in the cells with orders to remain there until the pirates had gone no matter what helse and i were included but we were sent back to the doughnut hole with the remaining food packs perhaps the women did not realize how well we could see what was going on from that vantage spirit still groggy went with us as it didnt seem wise to confine her alone the pirates burst in with drawn daggers and it was obvious from the outset that resistance would be futile evidently news had spread that this was a helpless bubble and they were flocking in to take advantage of it that too caused me to seethe with suppressed outrage why couldnt they have flocked in to help or at least signaled the jupe authorities where we were so they could fetch us i was ashamed for my speciesthe male species the women fell back cowed by the blades they had no equivalent weapons and there were too many men to overwhelm by force of numbers its submitor die helse murmured and if the women die the children are alone and maybe dead too they know that thats my mother down there my sister just sacrificed herself to prevent yes it is ironic dont blame your mother for what she does a week before i never would have understood now i did whether i would have without faiths recent sacrifice or helses present help i dont know but now i understood that the women had to do what they had to do to stay alive and protect their families i understood but my revulsion overcame me as i saw a hairy dirty pirate strip the clothing from my unresisting mother i launched myself toward them determined to kill the foul rapist helse caught me around the shoulders her inertia shoving me into the containing net i tried to fight her off but she clung with a strength in that moment equal to my own and even in my desperation i could not bring myself to apply real force on her still i managed to achieve a partial disengagement and soon would get away from her spirit she whispered help me hold him my sister snapped out of her remaining stupor throwing off the lingering effect of the drug she bounced across and caught me about the legs in this trace gravity i could move her about by flexing my body but i could not dislodge her but our mothers getting raped i hissed none of us dared talk loudly for fear we would only bring the knives of the pirates to bear against ourselves i know it spirit said and did not yield i continued to struggle and helse was tiring she was as big as i and weighed as much but the distribution differed i had more muscle and better leverage because i was male and now my advantage was telling but helse managed to get hold of my head her shirt had torn open and her chestband had slid askew in the struggle now she hugged my head to her halfbared breast if you go i will follow she rasped there is something uniquely compelling about the breast of a woman my will to fight was sapped i lay with my face half against the net half against her breast and did not move but in that position i could see a woman below probably she was not my mother i could not tell for most of her naked body was obscured by that of the pirate on her even if her whole body had been clear except for her face i might not have been sure for i had never seen my mother naked only by the face could i recognize her and that i could not see yet if she was not my mother she was someone elses mother and she was getting raped it did not matter that she was not resisting for to resist was to die i struggled again determined to do something to stop it but spirit took a tighter hold on my legs and helse nearly smothered my face in retrospect i think that might be the nicest possible way to die smothered by a breast but at the time i was almost tempted to free myself by biting her thank god i did not let it be helse whispered let it be hope those women are trying to save our lives at the expense of their honor their honor is not of the body it is of the spirit that coincidental use of the word that was also my sisters name had a strange effect on me suddenly i knew that if there was one person i had to protect more than my mother it was my sister helse took my silence for negation please hope give over it must be it was a woman getting raped and here were two girls urging me to let it proceed they should have protested more vehemently than i didbut they were more realistic than i was a man fights a woman compromises it was true in this microcosm as in the macrocosm the pirate thrust and the womans body jumped i tried again to launch myself helse clung to me with her divine deathhug ill tell you i love you she breathed pleadingly she didnt love me i knew that she was older than i and more mature in more than the physical sense i was beneath her but she cared enough to pretend she loved me in order to protect me from myself that small share of love seemed inordinately precious why should i struggle here as if indulging in my own rape when i could please her by relenting i relaxed and turned my face in to her helse squirmed about sliding her breast down and met me with a kiss it was savagely sweet i wanted to believe that she loved me at least a little for i surely loved her but at the same time i knew that i was forcing helse to do something untrue to sell a profession of love as another woman would sell her body that wasnt right and this acquiescence of ours was permitting my mother to get raped now my other thought comparing our situation to that of my mother returned more strongly in an ugly transmogrification my love for helse seemed to identify with my mothers horror it was as though the flesh so tightly against me was my mothers as though i was participating in that rape i knew it wasnt literally so but it was figuratively so and the stigma was there emotionally im sure the time was not long but it seemed an eternity then the pirates were gone and the air lock was closed and we children were free to return to the commons helse restored herself to her boyish state resetting the band about her chest and pinning her shirt together you sure are pretty when you show spirit remarked to her i had to agree silently this was the first time i had actually seen helses breast you will be too very soon helse told her patting her strapped bosom as if it were a thing to be allocated impartially among females thanks for helping me i had to my crazy brother would have gotten us all killed i was silent they were probably correct we climbed down i expected to find the women disheveled and sobbing and hiding their faces and i was afraid to face my mother but it had to be done i was completely surprised all the women were in good order clothing intact hair brushed out eyes clear no one was crying or hiding it was as though nothing had happened helse caught on before i did say nothing she whispered in my ear nothing aboutyou know we found my mother oh im so glad youre safe she said smiling at us we were sleeping in the loft helse said my mother glanced at her with the merest suggestion of irony knowing it was a lie and thankful for that lie of course young man she agreed was my mother really still ignorant of helses sex or was she competent at keeping secrets perhaps she had seen more of our struggle in the loft than we realized if we honored her privacy she honored ours later in our cell helse explained it to me in more detail degradation is mainly in the mind she doesnt want you to share her humiliation because that could further hurt the family the kindest thing you can do is to forever refuse to acknowledge that any man but your father ever touched your mother there must be no stain on the honor of hubris is the whole universe made of hypocrisy i demanded hurting anew sometimes it seems so she agreed but it is a good thing your family does for itself i wish i had belonged to a family like that so soon after faith sacrificed herself to prevent this very thing i exclaimed what faith sacrificed herself for has been preserved helse reminded me never say otherwise i was blind at that moment to the significance and youyou told me you loved me just to keep me quiet youre a woman too im a woman too she agreed i was perversely furious at her but i loved her too and maybe for much of the same reason and will you do what you did before just to keep me quiet will you give me your body and pretend to like it yes oh damn i cried and then it was literally crying the tears flooding from my eyes helse held me and comforted me and in time we did make love and she had the grace not to profess love only caring and it was wonderful i couldnt accept what she was doing in one part of my conscience but in another part i knew it had to be and that i couldnt live without her so i accepted what had to be accepted her sacrifice and mine chapter food jupiter rings i wish i could skip over this period but it would not be honest to do so it had seemed our situation could not get worse but we had a cruel reeducation coming our problem was composed of two things food and travel we were still short of food but might have managed if we had floated to jupiter on time but the women didnt know how to operate the gravity lens efficiently so we were making little progress that meant our food was less than adequate we had assumed we could get by on half rations but as the days passed and jupiter loomed larger with appalling slowness we knew we could not all of us were losing mass though we were not starving we conserved bodily energy by sleeping much of the time but still our food dwindled we cut to quarter rations trying to stretch it out a few more days but our progress past the rings of jupiter seemed maddeningly slow it was gradually apparent to even the most unwilling eye that we were not making it i spent a lot of time in the cell with helse sleeping in her arms but hunger vitiated sex if not love it was enough for a time just to be with her talking and resting and enduringbut inevitably the need for food intruded i dreamed of discovering some hidden cache of food packs that would allow us all to glut ourselves but it never was true spirit took it worse than i did she was a growing child and she needed proper sustenance she spoke of big rockcandy mountains and oceans of chocolate syrup and gingerbread houses when she started longing for potatoes and spinach i knew it was serious she had never liked spinach we had to do somethingbut what we could not conjure food from vacuum i took to staring morosely out of the portholes the jupiter ring system is not nearly as spectacular as saturns but it is extensive enough it reaches out almost as far as saturns rings do but it is so diffuse it is hardly worth noticing in fact for many centuries the astronomers of earth were not able to see the ring systems of jupiter or uranus or neptune so assumed there were none with the typical logic of our species the primary ring is fifty thousand kilometers inside the orbit of amalthea and thats where the jupiter border patrol operates amalthea is just a rocky ball kilometers across its gravity is so slight that no one has bothered to put a residential dome on ittheres not enough gravity there to focus effectively you see since next to nothing concentrated tenfold is still next to nothingbut there is a space depot amalthea is just beyond jupiters political territorial limit so we had to get inside its orbit the rings really werent obvious even from up close most of the particles were the size of large grains of dust a ship traveling at high relative velocity through the rings might suffer abrasion but our gravitysailing bubble just nudged through the diffuse field harmlessly some particles were large enough to spot from some distance just hanging there in their orbit blithely minding their own business and i would trace them with my eye as long as i could was this an analogy of the human condition i wondered every individual traveling alone going his own wayyet caught in the gravity well of some huge primary each person thought he was unique and perhaps he was differing as much from his neighbors as each particle differed in outline from other particles yet in the aggregate we were indistinguishable did it really matter which of us survived and which did not no single particle made a perceptible difference to the ring helse came up beside me and touched my shoulder she never did more than that when in her boy disguise but it was enough it carried the implication of all she was when we were alone we cant go on this way she said i looked at her startled we cant she smiled not we youme we thewholebubble the food is almost gone i was foolishly relieved i had come to depend on helses love whether real or feigned it was like a beneficial drug to which i was addicted but of course the problem of the food was critical we had all known a crisis was comingbut none of us had any solution except to hope that we would be spotted by some random swing of the jove patrol and rescued woe betide the pirate ship that got in our way this time we would not again allow our rescue to be balked that way but we knew we werent far enough in yet space is huge and jupiter is huge and we were a mote among motes lost we still had to clear the outer ring pass the orbit of amalthea and reach the primary ring the territorial limit at the rate we were proceeding that would be at least another weekand we had food at quarter rations for two more days spirit arrived another heads clogged she announced brightly she looked drawn as we all did from slow undernourishment but her spirits remained reasonably high she had always been that way venting her angers and griefs rapidly and stabilizing at an optimistic level and i had always liked her for it she was generally good company most brothers and sisters fight a lot but we fought less than most and now not at all that cuts us down to three heads i said the tanks are full probably if wed had full rations thered be no heads left working now why not change the tanks she asked we have no replacements its usually done planetside the full tank gets traded for an empty one and the contents go to the organic soil bank valuable stuff you know you dont find fertilizer like that floating around in space she wrinkled her nose i should hope not but we ought to do something about she broke off as if realizing something then elevated a finger floating in space why not what are you talking about i demanded spirits foolish notions were likely to have some sense to them why not just dump the stuff into space then the tanksd be empty and the headd work again and we wouldnt have to double up sure i said why dont you just volunteer to suit up and do that okay i will she said defiantly and pushed off she will too helse said dont i know it i headed off after my impetuous sister sarcasm can be dangerous with spirit in this manner all three of us ended up volunteering for the tankevacuation detail we suited up and helse handled the safety ropes while spirit and i went out onto the hull you see the bubble was spinning one revolution every ten seconds or so so what was partial gravity inside was like partial repulsion outside as the same centrifugal force tried to hurl us away at a tangent so we had to be guyed and that meant someone had to pay out the rope or take in the slack when necessary so we could operate without snagging or tangling it was the sort of job the regular crewmen would have been good atbut of course there were no experienced people among our remaining number we used the front lock since the merchantpirates had cleared it out i carried a bag of tools from the bubble toolshed while spirit clambered out with juvenile agility to catch the first rope in the questionmarkshaped eyelet provided for it bubbles have sets of such projections for just such emergencies now i appreciated the foresight of the design even a child could figure out these thingsand that was a good thing for us we were actually better fitted to come out here than the women were because of our size and alertness which was part of why we were permitted to do it my mothers natural protectiveness had to yield to expedience as it had in other cases once the line was secure spirit waved me on and i handed myself along to join her it was a bit like mountain climbing in my fancynaturally i have never climbed a mountain there being none on callistofor the moment i left the nullgee region of the lock the outward pull began the farther i progressed toward the bubbles equator the stronger it got tugging me at an angle of course it was slight even at its worst but i was not at peak strength because of the reduced food and the psychological effect was considerable the whole universe was down and turning that made my perch seem precarious indeed i paused at the first eyelet hanging on and looking out first i saw the bright distant sun really a superbrilliant star i could readily block out with my smallest finger at arms length still it emitted enough light to make it day in space that light might be only one twentyseventh as intense here as it was at earth but we were used to it the way we saw it and it was quite enough for all normal purposes then there was jupiter so vast my whole spread hand could not block it out yet i knew that the enormous planet was subservient to the little star i could hardly blame my primitive ancestors thousands of years ago on earth for believing otherwise i understood that from earth earths nameless moon looked the same size as the sun that meant that each looked very roughly half again as big in diameter as ganymede looked from callisto the moon i could understand but i had no mental picture of the sun seeming that size what a brilliantly blazing ball it must be spirit nudged me out of my reverie i get that way sometimes thinking too much at a time and have to be corrected i nodded and she scampered on around to the next eyelet while i made sure the rope did not snag now the curve of the bubble concealed spirit from helse though i could see both i waved to helse who waved back then i followed the rope to spirit the location of the refuse tanks was clear enough as they were intended to be serviced from the outside there was an effective airlocktype mechanism in each that prevented any direct aperture through the hull from being opened all i had to do was release the pressure of the tankenclosure chamber then unbar the tank itself and slide it out it seemed simple enough yet i knew that things were seldom as simple in practice as they were represented to be in the instruction manuals i hooked my toesthat reminded me for no obscure reason of the manner i used the head insideand got to work on the first one it didnt matter whether it was one of the working ones or one of the clogged ones they all would need cleaning out soon enough i brought out the big wrench hooked its safety line around my wristeverything had its own safety line out hereand adjusted it to the pressurerelease valve you see the matter in the tanks is deposited at close to the same pressure as the interior atmosphere the suction of the tubes is mainly forced ventilation that pressure cant be released from inside even if the bubble were opened to space and all its air puffed out the toiletlocks would prevent the tanks from exploding into the interior thats a necessary safeguard for an obvious reason these bubbles are pretty sophisticated devices when you think about it safetyrigged in so many ways that it is literally possible for a crew of ignorant refugees to sail in space for some time with little to fear from error of course their ineffective piloting could lead to an extended trip and starvation and they could be at the mercy of merciless pirates but the bubble itself was pretty safe suddenly the valve let go these things were corrosionproof of course and reliable they worked as they were supposed to work even on an ancient bubble like this a jet of vapor shot out catching me in the chest and shoving me away from the hull even a small shove is effective when youre not braced for it i sailed out turning end over end until my safety rope brought me up short helse reeled me in that was what she was there for but though i had been in no actual danger i was shaken had i not had the rope i would have been flung into deep space and no one could have recovered me outside space was dangerous in its completely passive way and now i experienced the fear of it this did not incapacitate me i shoved it into that corner of my mind required for unpleasant refuse my emotional toilet tank and proceeded with my job but the new enhanced awareness of space remained with me and now i felt vulnerable i think in retrospect that this was more significant than i was aware of at the time helse brought me to her reeling me in hand over hand put her helmet against mine and made a kissing expression then she hugged me clumsily in the suits spanked me and sent me back to finish the job i got back to my location the pressure had been depleted now the tank was conveniently loose in its socket i slid aside the retaining bars and drew it out spirit helped for the thing was large and awkward i held it pointed at space while she took the wrench and loosened the emptying lid this was a matter of turning a nut then swinging out a bar nothing came all the way free because of the danger of losing it in space the tank itself had a tether chain long enough to give us sufficient freedom to operate perhaps the designers had anticipated this need to dump in space also when we had the lid off we had tp get the refuse out this was a dense brown mass there are chemicals or enzymes in the tanks that commence the processing of the matter the moment it enters so this was already part of the way composted but it remained fecal matter i saw spirit wrinkling her nose inside her helmet though of course there was no smell here in the vacuum odor like sound requires atmosphere or some other direct conduit now how were we to get it out of the tank we had no tool for this and neither of us was inclined to reach in with our hands but the problem solved itself as i clung to the tank by its base the far end of it swung out centrifugally and the matter in it was drawn by that same force into space i almost thought i heard a sucking sound as it escaped the tank but of course that was illusion such a sound could have been transmitted to me via metal and suit but no sound existed vacuum does not have to move about the way air does vacuum isor perhaps it is more correct to say vacuum is not i can picture someone reading this and protesting but how did the vacuum squeeze in from space that person is a fool as soon as the mass emerged it fragmented tiny bubbles of gas shoved it apart the large chunks sundered into small ones which in turn broke into smaller ones in moments it became a cloud of particles drifting slowly away from us even if there had not been some remaining internal pressure it would have fragmented because of the tidal force of this orbit causing that portion of it closer to jupiter to move marginally faster than the portion more distant the tideit was the same thing we experienced within the bubble i think in reverse our feet being carried around faster than our heads spirit put her helmet against mine jupiter rings she exclaimed and of course it was so we had initiated a new ring systemof base material very base that might be a real surprise for some party scavenging for ice or minerals in space just let him bring it into warmth and atmosphere we reloaded the empty tank and bolted it tight then went on to the next one the job was easier and faster now that we were familiar with it the eight tanks made a double circle beside the equator four to the north four to the south as we worked on the ones farthest from our air lock we could see the bags containing the bodies of our men nothing showed for the bags were tied but even that much instilled in me a certain quality of dread we were alone with our dead we kept on working for there was nothing else to do we dumped a second tank and a third and a fourth but the awareness of those bagged bodies was on me i wondered which one was my father sadness welled up in me the realization that major hubris was gone that i would never see him again he had been my bastion against the uncertainties of life the backbone of our family without him we were largely formless there was now a void in my life an emptiness in the physical and spiritual form of my father and out here it seemed as intense as the void of space around me major hubris would have known what to do about the squeeze between travel and food i saw spirit clinging to the hull and knew by the attitude of her body that she felt it too and that she was crying she might have bounced back readily but the onus of loss had not forsaken her i climbed across and put my suited arm around her suited shoulders squeezing her comfortingly we had lost our father and our sister but we still had each other and our mother then we went back to work doing tanks and watching their contents merge with the ring system of jupiter some of those particles we had sown might remain in orbit for a billion years it was slightly awesome to realize that my frozen refuse might outlive me by that length of time it reminded me of a facsimile exhibit i had seen in the maraud museum of the fecal deposit of a dinosaur that had been ossified or petrified or whatever and preserved intact for eternity while the reptile that made it was gone a fecal fossil maybe eventually some creature from galaxy andromeda would come and take a soil sample from this ring run it through his alien laboratory and draw conclusions about my nature would he assume i was nothing but a big chunk of fecal matter my gaze came to rest again on the bagged bodies as if drawn by some spiritual gravity the women had strapped the bags to the hull irregularly using the same eyelets we were using we had to reset our ropes for each pair of tanks and for the last set we had to route the ropes past the field of bags i did it leaving spirit clinging to the equator as i brushed by one of the bags my equilibrium suffered maybe it was the vertigo of shifting weight and torque as i rounded the hull toward the pole the air lock where helse waited most of the bags were near the rear air lock but some were here i paused to let the sensation passbut it did not pass the feeling intensified until the whole universe seemed to spin crazily about me and i was spinning too opposite it and opposite myself my head and feet were curving through each other moving without motion i realize that doesnt seem to make much sense but thats the way it was my head seemed to be orbiting one way and my feet another and the separate portions of my body each traveled different and mutually incompatible ways in retrospect i conjecture that my days on half and quarter rations were taking their toll as well as the shifting forces of rotation i was being subjected to i was nearer breakdown than i thought at the time but maybe it was other than that for a moment this disorientation was pleasant but then it frightened me for i was afraid i would fling loose of the bubble with such force the rope would snap and i would be forever lost i was losing what little control i had over my destiny and that was frightening a person can bear up under a lot more stress if he believes he has reasonable control than he can if he feels completely subject to the uncaring whim of fate i screamed in my helmet and clung to the nearest solid thing it was the body in the bag i felt its human contour i reacted with horror but my clutching fingers would not let go i felt the tears of grief and terror on my face and was ashamed for them but it was as if none of my body was subject to my mind anymore then the bag moved i was so far gone i did not even scream again i clung to it wrestling it perhaps trying to put it back flat against the hull where it belonged if there is one thing more appalling than death it is undeaththe revival of a corpse but the thing pushed back against me and got me clear and sat upexcept that up was down here or at least sort of sidewaysand shed the bag the frozen head turned to face meand it was my father major hubris son you are starving he reproved me you must not go on this way i had to answer him we are out of food i explained his remark was so reasonable as my fathers remarks had always been in life he shook his head no hope you have food if only you will use it shed the scales from your eyes and eat what food i asked bewildered much as i had been as a child when he was instructing me in some new thing we have searched the whole bubble there is nothing i will not permit your mother and sister to starve because of your ignorance he said firmly you are now the man of the family and so it is your responsibility to see to their welfare you will provide food for your mother and your sister and that lovely girl of yoursand yourself you must all eat well to restore your strength for the ordeal to come the worst has not yet passed you will do what is necessary but there is no food i wailed son you know better than that he reproved me becoming mildly annoyed at my obtuseness he had always encouraged me to be intelligent not in the sense of remembering long series of numbers but in the sense of perceiving the obvious there is plenty of food you must make a fire of course to cook it you can handle that cook it i asked bewildered what food where here he said and extended his hand to me but the hand was empty i thought about that for a long time but could make no sense of it surely my father would not suggest we feed on vacuum then i heard a screaming in the background it went on and on then slowly the whole scene faded out and i was blank when i recovered awareness i was back inside the bubble my mother was tending me thank god she breathed when she saw my eyelids flicker he wakes i dislike sounding stupid but this seemed to be the occasion for it what happened i asked discovering as i spoke that my voice was hoarse you were wrestling with a frozen corpse my mother said and screaming i watched her face as she spoke and saw how lean it had become the fractional rations were costing her her health she had been gradually becoming plump as years passed she was losing that mass now and though it lent her an ethereal beauty i knew it was not good then i picked up on the other thing that screaming i had heardof course it had been mine i had really strained my vocal cords by the feel of my throat now but why had i been doing it i spoke again how helse and spirit brought you in unconscious she explained they thought you had overextended yourself and had a breakdown we got you out of the suit and wiped the blood from your mouth no wonder she had worried then i remembered another thing we didnt finish emptying the tanks spirit says you did six thats enough for my mind was not yet clear for what mother for the time we have she finished reluctantly then i remembered my fathers message we have food i said only i dont know where she asked me what i meant and i recounted my experience outside it was a hallucination i know i concluded but it certainly seemed real he was so surebut i couldnt understand not a hallucination she corrected me a vision but what was he showing me i demanded his hand was empty it was never your fathers way to tease she said seriously he always spoke his mind you still do not understand i shook my head it makes no sense to me if there had been somethingbut there wasnt then it was a true vision your father did not mean you to understand directly but then why should he major hubris spoke through youto me he knew i would understand i dont see how that can conjure food where there is none my mother only smiled sadly your father has spoken i thank you hope for conveying his message she stroked my forehead now rest my son you have done well there will be food she got up and went to consult with seсora ortega i slept again for i was weak exertion and hunger had debilitated me more than i had supposed when i woke helse and spirit were with me in the cell helse was dressed in a dark blouse and skirt so that now her full figure showed and her hair hung down about her shoulders she had always kept it pegged up somehow before so that it looked boyishly short she had been losing weight like the rest of us but her youth was better able to accommodate the loss and she was now almost as pretty as my sister faith had been in a different way the two girls had evidently been talking but they stopped when i started hearing i almost wished i had feigned sleep a little longer to listen but i rebuked myself immediately i had no need to spy on my friends whats up i asked you look serious we have food now spirit said gravely you can smell it i sniffed and caught the odor of roasting meat thats great i said why arent you eating it instead of sitting here with me spirit looked meaningfully at helse were not sure we should use it my mind came fully clear where is it from helse laughed somewhat abruptly from your vision hope i scowled hunger had not improved my sanguinity you think i made that up no spirit said i saw our father sit up and talk to you i hauled him up i said he couldnt have moved or talked in the freezing vacuum of space even if he had been alive i must have gone crazy i cant even say for certain it was major hubris it could have been any of them but i do believe you spirit said father gave you a message and mother understood it were a family thats the way we work together he showed me an empty hand he showed you his hand she agreed her eyes now fixed as if she were going into a trance herself i turned to helse what does she mean helse gazed at me with a kind of translucent horror your father offered himselffor food something awfully cold closed in on me then as if i were still in space and the heating element in my suit had quit i felt the screaming working up again like a rising gorge his hand that was your vision to eat hisbut i neverthats cannibalism your father expressed to you his will he told you to feed your mother and your sister and that lovely girl of yours and yourself are you going to go against your fathers expressed will something else jarred lovely girl i asked then i realized oh no i told my mother the whole vision i gave away your secret i hung my head in chagrin im sorry helse i never intended tomy word is sacredi was so overwhelmed by the vision that i never thought i know helse said you kept my secret hope and so did spirit it was your father who told on me he never gave his word but he didnt know he died before he his ghost knew she said you cant hide truth from a ghost but your mother asked me helse said so i changed my clothing i would not try to make a liar of your father he was a good man thats how charity hubris knew it was really major hubris speaking spirit said he knew something the rest of us did not you knew i said but i never told anyway mother consulted with seсora ortega who suggested this was a test of the vision and when they saw that helse really was a girl they agreed it was a true vision and we would have to do as father said so now we have food as father intended he probably mentioned helse deliberately so everyone would believe i thought about the way concha ortega that tooknowledgeable grandmother had remarked on my improved attitude surely she had suspected and she was clever enough to play her hunches competently i thought about the way my mother had submitted to rape to preserve her children from the threat of rampaging pirates and then pretended that rape had never happened now she was taking my vision at face value though it was logically suspect we had gone along with her before because family pride was better than the reality now helse and spirit were going along with her againbecause we needed the food it was after all pointless for us all to die when there was food available so there was sense behind my vision and sense behind their endorsement of it yet it seemed to me that more than sense was operating here are you ready helse asked you sacrificed your secretfor this i said to helse how could i seek to refute your vision hope she asked innocently you stand by me the way my mother stands by my father women do what they must you know that and you too i told spirit taking her hand i saw him sit up out there spirit said i saw him hold out his hand to you and perhaps she had or believed she had spirit was always my staunchest supporter when it counted then i must be ready i said how any of us were going to choke down what the brave women were serving i didnt know but it had to be done too many sacrifices had already been made for it to be otherwise chapter refugees welcome jupiter rings i choose not to dwell unduly on the following days i did get sick and so did spirit but we both came back and tried again and again until we were able to retain what we consumed the meat was perfectly fresh of course and clean for no spoilage occurs in space the women served it wellcooked in very small portions so that it was impossible to tell from what part of what animal it might have come the women ate too with the same affected unconcern they had evinced after the mass rape i had always suspected the female sex of being weaker than the male but i did not think so anymore strength is so much more than muscle after the first few meals it was not so bad i even started helping with the cooking by foraging for fuel for the fire first they had used the precious candles saved from the funeral service but soon these were gone and other combustibles were required there was wood in the bubble for furnishings and the packaging for the original food packs was flammable it was a very small controlled fire for we could not afford to overload the airrecirculation system with a lot of pollutants so we did have enough fuel but it was always a grown woman who donned a suit and went outside for more meat to that extent we children were preserved in our innocence seсora ortega and the other women chose to accept my vision as they had interpreted it not one of them broke ranks on this though i was sure not all of them really believed in supernatural visitations or messages they knew what had to be done and they did it without fuss or fanfare exactly as they had throughout their married lives what a fundament of strength was thus subtly revealed so we survived and even began to regain weight thanks to the gift of our men we all knew i think that had any of those men been alive to speak their wills they would have told us to do exactly what we were doing the bubble had been forged by necessity into one large family as close as any other united by a complex of vital compromises and secrets we navigated and studied and slept and played games of all sorts for morale was as important as physical condition slowly we drew nigh the primary ring of jupiter now that we knew we would make it our attitudes improved we spent more time staring at jupiter swelling to giant size its cloud bands more prominent than ever violently coursing past each other with bubblestorms at the interfaces the details constantly changing in an overall pattern that was unchanging as we watched the great red spot came on the horizon like a monster eye trying to orient on us ah jove the ruler of gods our hopes expanded in direct proportion to this image in our sky all would be well once we achieved jupiter the kindly colossus of space jupiter within whose bands of clouds floated so many enormous bubbles each one a great city spinning like our little bubble for internal gravity since they could not stay afloat if they used normal gravity the citybubbles did not have to worry about vacuum outside instead they faced the phenomenal pressures of jupiters atmosphere yet they were the most highly civilized cities in the solar system and the life style of ordinary people within them was reputed to be fantastic we dreamed a little afraid and longed for what we hoped would be this is not to suggest that everything was smooth now conditions of enduring stress and confinement tend to accentuate and at times exacerbate interpersonal relations and we of the bubble were not exceptional in this respect all of us shared an unspoken guilt that tended to sublimate itself in those ways that were permitted expression i have heard sublimation spoken of as a useful alternative to unsocial behavior but i dont believe that when an emotion is suppressed it tends to manifest in something very similar to the forbidden thing and perhaps sometimes it would be best simply to accept the forbidden instead thus we had the smaller children saving their feces and sometimes eating them mocking the food that could not be identified that sort of thing i need not explicate further i spent time with helse openly now for my father had seemingly blessed our association no one objected overtly to our sharing a cell though perhaps there were private qualms but she and i did fight on occasion if only because i wanted her to love me and she would not let herself go that far to her the body was a thing to be used as expedient but the heart was specialwhich was one reason i wanted her heart i suppose i was greedy but that is the way of love spirit especially got difficult she had always been close to me and remained so but now she came to resent the time i spent with helse it seemed that when helse had masqueraded as a boy and spirit had shared the secret that was all right she was part of it but now that helse was openly female and there was no secret spirit felt excluded i should have been alert to the symptoms but as is so often the case i wasnt paying attention until too late i was caught up in my own concerns which were more immediate but less important than the psychological welfare of my sister until too late i hope not to make that error again spirit burst in upon us once when helse and i were sleeping in our cell in dishabille though not actually making love i had discovered that the adolescent fantasy of continuous sexual activity was exactly that fantasy helse would make love any time i asked her to and knowing that i found that usually it was enough just to be near her sex is less than love but more than the act often mere closeness suffices there you go again spirit cried as we sat up groggily fathers gone faiths gone mothers aloneand youre busy fooling with her there was a vicious freighting on the word fooling it was intended as an obscenity and in that context it became so there wasnt much i could say of course i was guilty at other times if not this particular time and as i just explained the technical act was only a fraction of it and not worth arguing i did not want to get angry because that would proclaim my guilt but i didnt know how else to react helse handled it with better grace her age and experience enabled her to navigate certain difficult passages more readily than i could i do not take your brother from you spirit she said i can never do that you are of his blood and i am not i do not love him as you do spirit faced her defiantly thats spacecrock you love him more than i do i started to chuckle at her miscue obviously spirit had not meant to say that prompted by helses statement spirit had reversed the emphasis inadvertently arguing against her own interest as can happen when a persons emotion overrides her tongue but helse reacted as if she had been stabbed oh she cried and scrambled to her feet and up out of the cell not even pausing for her clothing i stared after her so did spirit her anger forgotten i vanquished her she exclaimed amazed but you misspoke yourself i protested now it was spirit who reacted oddly oh i shouldnt have said that i blabbed her secret what secret she doesnt love i stopped looking at her with a dawning surmise spirit flustered reached for the exit panel id better go try to apologize i lost my stupid head i caught her preventing her from going you mean she does love me she always told me she didnt and my talent enables me to know oh you dont know half what you think you do spirit snapped when your emotion is tied in your talent cuts out she had stabbed me as deeply as she had helse i knew immediately that she was correct i had no basis to judge helses state of emotion because my own was suspect it was as if i was trying to move a heavy suitcase in free fall my effort moved me back as much as it moved it forward i had to be firmly anchored before i could be sure of the effect of my effort i think the laws of the mind are similar in this respect to the laws of matter shes older than i am i said falteringly it makes sense that i am less to her than she is to me if she felt otherwise why should she deny it she had to deny it dummy spirit said she thinks men dont love women who love them back shes always been used by men who only wanted her body no matter what they said at the time and when her body changed they didnt want her anymore so she knew if she really liked someone she shouldnt ever ever let on because she wrenched trying to break free of my hold on her let me go hope i could kill myself helses an awfully nice girl and ive got to tell heri dont know what but ive got to i let her go i sat against the wall meditating on what my sister had said it explained a lot i should have caught on to it myself with my vaunted talent for understanding people but ironically this failure was a valuable lesson for me for it revealed the glaring weakness in my talent i had to be objective i resolved never again to make that error but i realized that i couldnt patch it up with helse by trying to reassure her of my undying love she was constitutionally incapable of believing me her past experience could not be left behind the same thing that made her so well able to please a man made her unable to trust him oh i knew the power of an emotional fixation i had been ready to swear off sex forever after the rape of faith and only helses timely and forceful action had turned me about but i could not reassure her about her own fixation all i had were words and she would not believe them the men who had used her body during her childhood had not harmed her body they had poisoned her mind i was way too late to reeducate her subjectivity what then could i do i mulled it over and finally worked it out my mother actually had shown me the way the reality of our inner belief does not have to match that of our external professions in due course helse returned she remained unclothed probably no one in the bubble had noticed or cared since i was the oldest male in this limited community if anyone realized that we were having a difference that person knew enough not to interfere she looked resigned evidently spirit had caught up with herit could hardly be otherwise in such limited spaceand apologized for blabbing spirit could be exceedingly winsome when she was contrite and surely her apology had been accepted but helse believed the damage could not really be undone she had returned bravely to confirm the disaster i gave her no chance i must apologize for what my sister did i said before helse could speak she said she loved me more than you do and of course thats true but it was extremely unkind helse paused taken aback that isnt what she oh maybe she garbled it i said blithely but i know you dont love me and im learning to live with that im sorry spirit misinterpretedwell she is my sister and she has a hot little temper and but im trying to tell you please helse i said holding out my arms to her i need you so muchdont tease me anymore let me hope that one day youll feel about me the way i feel about you dont deprive me of that one illusion illusion she exclaimed hope i i continued to extend my arms to her she hesitated then came to me i kissed her passionately and after a moment she responded in kind we proceeded naturally to the act of love yet there was a certain difference perhaps i should say diffidence about it on her part and on mine because we each knew we were deceiving the other it may even be that that reservation made the experience sweeter certainly for me the term love was no euphemism for any other thing love was exactly what it was when the desperation of our merging eased she drew apart a little her face showing concern hope this isnt honest i dont say it i cut in again leave me with at least the dream that some day youll change your mind i was perhaps overplaying it and she knew it but this was a unique situation for me the message i had for her was other than the one i professed and she knew it she smiled defeated that one illusion she agreed and kissed me softly and in that single gesture there was more joy than in all our prior congress we chose to share the illusion of illusion jupiter was now so big that it was no longer an object in space it was becoming our primary in perception as well as physics so close so closeour ordeal was almost over and yetand yet if we reached jupiter and were saved and found places in that great societywhat then of the relation i had with helse she would have to report to kife or qyv and who could say what would become of her thereafter or the new situation might simply change her attitude she was a pretty girl and i a mere stripling she could do better than me in that society the illusion of her nonlove for me might turn out to be no illusion there so i viewed our potential rescue with a certain undercurrent of apprehension for the love of helse had become more important to me than life itself right now while we sailed the waves of gravity in space she was mine a day later the jupiter patrol found us at first we feared it was another pirate ship or an opportunist merchanter but soon we saw the big round jove circle with the red spot in it and recognized the lines of a ship of the space navy and knew this was authentic contact at last they locked on and boarded us the officer who spoke to us was a sleek neat brisk correct woman there would be no sexual solicitation here please identify your origin she said in english naturally the representative of the mighty colossus did not bother to learn the language of mere refugees but we were in no position to complain i spoke up since my english was as facile as any we are refugees from callisto fleeing the oppression of our government we seek sanctuary at jupiter the woman frowned perhaps you people are not aware that there has been an election on jupiter and extraplanetary policy has shifted political andor economic refugees are no longer being accepted you will have to go elsewhere i was stunned but there is nowhere else we used our last reserves to get here we are out of food our batteries for running the lifesupport systems are low our men were killed by pirates our women raped i broke off realizing that i shouldnt say that maybe i could qualify it some of yes we are familiar with the standard refugee story she snapped you people expect us to believe that all of space is infested with ancient buccaneers in pirate hats and pantaloons holding you up at swordpoint for gold this is the twentyseventh century and we are not so credulous we will give you supplies to take you to europa or ganymede and we shall tow you out beyond our territorial limit that is all it is high time you moon folk started taking care of your own problems instead of foisting them off on us appalled i translated her words for the others i could hardly believe it myself here we had finally arrived at the political sanctuary of mighty jupiter the planet of all our dreamsand were not welcome what had happened to the great melting pot of the solar system it is a terrible thing to have ones hopes so brutally dashed i think we were all in something like a group trance we stood there unprotesting as the jupiter work crew swarmed over the bubble emptying our refuse muttering in english they thought we could not understand that now they knew we were liars because we could not have come all the way from callisto because the refuse wasnt enough for such a trip restocking our supply of food packs replacing our oxygenation units and the batteries for our general environmentmaintenance equipment tuning the gravitylens generator and replacing the waterrecycling filters they were so competent it was small wonder that they did not believe we could have made the trip we claimed we were after all only incompetent refugees they evidently assumed that some ship had towed us here and rehearsed us in the story to tell in an attempt to play upon sympathy they were also so efficient they hardly checked the bags tied to the outside of the bubble assuming them to be junk storage another evidence of our sloppiness yet we needed all of their help for only luck had prevented something crucial from failing but we needed help less than we needed the enormous gift of sanctuary on jupiter they were generously giving us trifles instead of the essence now they could write up a report about all the good they had done for thankless refugees oh yes they were as good as the female officers word i refrain from applying the vernacular description for a female of questionable ethics tempting as it is they towed us out beyond the orbit of amalthea to the outer ring and turned us loose with the admonition not to return to jupiter territorial space on pain of being blasted out of it povertystricken foreign freeloaders they let us know politely were not wanted in the decent godfearing territory of mighty jupiter after all we didnt even speak the language maybe they were bluffing about the blastingoutofspace we were unlikely to risk it certainly they had the physical capacity to do such a thing the jupiter states possessed the mightiest military force in the solar system excepting possibly that of the saturnine republic my mother shook her head as she absorbed my translation looking abruptly haggard she had been prepared for anything except this and we thought we had known rape she said i pondered that and concluded she was right i may have overstated the phrasing of the jupiter rejection for the female officers speech was always politely delivered but the essence is accurate they definitely did not want us so what could have been more cruel than the abrupt destruction of our aspirations physical rape came and went it was possible to cover it up to pretend it never happened but this rejection could never be undone now we had almost literally nowhere to go we knew that none of the major moons of jupiter would give us safe haven they were all overpopulated povertyridden and oppressed by the autocratic governments that seem to sprout like weeds in the wilderness of the socalled third system jupiter in fact if not in theory hoped that we would simply disappear in space and never appear again we were not jupiters problem and we could be ignored for this my father had died and my mother had submitted to degradation for nothing i found helse looking out a port watching magnificent jupiter whirl by shrinking visibly as we were towed from it like the shrinking of our dream give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free she murmured quoting from memory the historical sonnet the new colossus whose tradition the united states of jupiter supposedly carried on the wretched refuse of your teeming shore she was crying of course and so was i chapter hell planet space we held a group meeting in due course to discuss our situation we were the wretched refugee refuse yearning to breathe free who had learned the hard way not to believe all that was quoted in the geography texts but we still had to decide on some course where were we to go well we would not go hungry we had a full supply of food packs now courtesy of the surplus stores of rich jove and the bodies of our men remained anchored to our hull i wondered whether the jupiter patrol workmen might actually have spotted the nature of those bags and played stupid so as to avoid the awkwardness of having to dispose of them perhaps even giving them decent burial it might be politically inexpedient to accept bodies while rejecting living people had they inspected those bodies they would have discovered how they had died and it would have been more difficult for the jupiter patrol to maintain its official ignorance of the pirate problem jupiter like our women preferred to ignore certain unpleasant realities probably they had the physical capacity to deal with the pirates but lacked the political motivation it was all understandablein its sickening fashion we knew we could not return to callisto starvation in space would probably be preferable to what the authorities there would do to us to cover their own embarrassment at our very existence we were after all tangible evidence of the failure of their system they might not care to correct that failure but they would certainly labor diligently to cover it up everywhere concealment seemed preferable to correction ganymede and europa were little better io was largely uninhabitable and its few residential domes were reputed to be horribly overcrowded no salvation there that left the outer moonletswho would hardly be likely to welcome our motley assemblage of women and children yet we did have to go somewhere for we could not live indefinitely in space hidalgo spirit exclaimed seсora ortegas head turned toward her and we all paused for consideration out of the mouths of babes we discussed it hidalgo is a planetoid no bigger than amalthea in a stretchedout orbit between mars and saturn but it was no ordinary fragment for a couple of centuries ago jupiter assumed sovereignty over it and more recently hidalgo had become an actual state of the united states of north jupiter the only nonplanetary body to be granted that status it was now a major tourist region huge pleasure domes were set on it spinning on their bases to provide the kind of gravity the tiny planetoid could not the population there was not hispanic but was polyglot and multiracial our kind could surely merge with their kind there was always work for domestics and that was one thing our women could handle our children could get superior schooling there and grow up as free citizens hidalgo we reasoned was so far out from jupiter proper that the ban against refugees might not apply spirit in her intuitive fashion had come up with a truly intriguing prospect but there were formidable problems hidalgo did swing out past jupiters orbit which was the basis for jupiters claim in it but that did not mean it was close to jupiter physically it was a tiny tiny mote in space virtually impossible to discover by random search with a clumsy bubble we would need an ephemeris a detailed listing of the locations of bodies in space and time these locations were given as triplecoordinate sets computercalculated so that it was possible to pick a precise date and time and get the exact spacial coordinates of the desired object relative to the sun and its position in the galaxy without the ephemeris we could look until we died of old age for that grain of sand in the immensity of solar space we also did not have a drive system capable of getting us there the jet we had was barely enough to move us around the jupiter eclipticthat is the plane of the equator and inner moonsand hidalgo is far outside that the efficient jupe workers had recharged our jet for it like everything else associated with this bubble was near exhaustion but no matter how fresh the jet was it was grossly insufficient we needed a powerful ion drive that would accelerate us at a significant fraction of gee to aid our gravity lenses to put it in simplest terms we needed to add a more powerful motor to our sailboat we could not simply center on a distant speck like hidalgo and fall in to it there was not enough gravity there to bring us in within a century or so and we needed more supplies food oxygen electricity all for a much longer journey lots of things like that if we wanted to get there alive that was why we decided to raid an outpost on io that planet might not be worthwhile to settle on but it would do just fine for a supply raid the badlands sections had all sorts of technical facilities for monitoring the volcanoes and radiation intensity and such and there were many study foundations there performing obscure research they were well funded and surely had plenty of supplies to spare io is the most active planetary body in the solar system bar none and that sort of thing is a magnet for scientists we knew they had huge supplies of food and medicine and surplus equipment for every type of bubble and ship most important they had complete libraries of ephemeridae i think it did not occur to any of us consciously at that time that what we contemplated was in fact piracy all we knew was that we would die in high space if we did not float to a haven somewhere and that the jupe authorities had rejected us it becomes much easier to justify strong measures even illegal ones when your life depends on them we also could not afford to doubt that everything we required for our extended journey through space would be available on io for if we made our play and did not achieve our needs we were doomed we were in fact making a gamble whose boldness would have appalled us a month before experience had altered our horizons drastically the period of revolution for io is one and threequarters days you might think that would make it easy to intercept just park for a day and wait for it to swing around but it doesnt work that way we were in orbit ourselves and as we knew orbits are not lightly shifted so we had to use our precious jet to jockey around letting io catch up to us using its gravity to wrestle us back in line an expert navigator could have done it in a few hours it took us two days but we did get there io was formidable as it loomed close one volcano was bright shades of yellow orange brown and red the whole planet looked as if it had been recently scrambledand geologically speaking it had you see io is not like other worlds that may be the understatement of this narrative it resembles them as a maddened sabretooth tiger on ancient earth resembles a sleeping denatured pussycat other worlds such as our own callisto may seem almost dead io is screamingly alive the closer we got the more i remembered about it and the less i liked what we planned it wasnt the human opposition i feared it was io herself theres really too much to tell here ill try to touch on the essence only io just over four hundred thousand kilometers from jupiter should have one face locked on jupiter the same way it is with callisto and the others but europa the next moon out interferes forcing io into an eccentric orbit that means her circuit isnt round and her velocity isnt constant she moves at different speeds and turns her face back and forth as though bothered by someone hovering just behind her shoulder this has to do with the fundamental physics of the situation tidal forces develop and these are not mere little tugs it is more like a giant hand squishing an overripe orange making the juices squirt and the peel buckle that tidal action generates heat keeping much of the interior of the planet molten this in turn means constant change new volcanoes keep popping up and spewing out their stuff and dying down and the ground shifts restlessly so maps are soon outdated and no one can really say ahead of time what the details of the landscape will beespecially on the active face facing jupiter thats the bad face the gorgonface the uninhabitable one that spits sulfur in your eye and pollutes that whole region of space with radioactive debris the one we were headed for but what choice did we have we glided in it was night locally with the inside face away from the sun but glowing with its own savage vents truly this was hell we were coming to io is one terrible lady we floated along at a reasonably safe elevation looking for our target we had to select it by night then hide the bubble and make a foray afoot so there would be no hint of our intent we agreed there should be no violence we were raiding for what we had to have but we were not criminals we would pretend to be a scientific party that got isolated by a vagary of volcanic activitya completely credible story on wild ioand once inside the dome we would hijack the crew using a mock bomb and make them provide the supplies we needed peaceful hijacking had for centuries been a staple tool for the impoverished desperate it was indeed a desperate strategy but if we won it would give us our fair chance for refuge if we lost at least it would be quick we had to do it we spotted a dome but it was too small it wouldnt have enough supplies we moved on and spotted anothertoo large we didnt want to tackle any more than we had to even our minimum requirement might prove to be more than we could handle finally near a massive rocky escarpment we discovered a mediumsized observation dome with several transport bubbles docked beside it this was our target we floated down behind the escarpment which resembled a wrinkle in that orange i mentioned before and seemed to be an ideal place to hide our bubble but as we closed on it we discovered that perspective and darkness had deceived us this was a far more massive outcropping than thought it was a mountain range with the highest peak some eight or nine kilometers tall back on callisto we had seen no hills beyond a few hundred meters high so this was awesome none of us had had experience with this exaggerated type of terrain that is probably why we erred so disastrously we landed in a comfortably small niche in the mountain tucked down well out of sight of the dome we stalked even an observation dome with the most powerful telescopes could not see through a mountain of sulfur we werent sure we could complete our mission before dawn so we wanted the bubble to be properly concealed helse and i were in the raiding party because we spoke english the common tongue of scientists in this region of space my mother and spirit stayed behind with thirtyfour women while twentyfive women formed the raiding party in addition to the two of us seсora ortega led us i think we all felt the excitement of adventurebut also knew it was grim business i had heard it said that a person is most truly alive when death is near and i think there is some truth in it our first problem was getting down to the dome we had parked near the base of the mountainbut that little ledge of a kilometer or so became abruptly gargantuan when we approached it afoot again we had perceived it as it would have been on callisto a very gradual decline much broader than it was tall it was not so it was the other way around the cliff was of sulfur dioxide ice yellow underfoot maybe there was other rock beneath but that was the surface it wasnt slippery fortunately but it was unfamiliar and we didnt trust it there were small cracks and pocks and crevices in its layout visible in the generous light of jupiter but we feared these could mask more dangerous nether flaws in the structure but we traversed the more or less level portion without untoward event headed toward the dropoff the descent was horrendous we took one look over that awesome cliff and hastily roped ourselves together like ancient mountain climbers i think we all suffered from acrophobia in that moment but we had to get down to the base where we could proceed on the level to the target dome we let ourselves down the cliff on the rope paying it out one person at a time watching the party leaders stepslide down the steepening slope helse and i were in the middle of the party even so it was one frightening descent the projecting edges of the mountain were like the blade of a pitted cleaver we had to chip away the sharp corner and form a niche for the rope so that it would neither slide nor fray we wanted it to feed through exactly where and when we wanted it to gravity here seemed to be more than on callisto though it is possible our time in lowgee had distorted our perception though io is a smaller moon it is far more dense one might suppose that surface gravity would be the same for two worlds of equal mass even if their diameters differed but that is not so the smaller one has greater surface gravity because that surface is closer to the center so though io actually is slightly less massive than callisto it is almost twice as dense and that makes the difference io is sized like earths lonely moon but is a little more so in diameter density and mass and a lot more so in activity apart from this the suits made us clumsy a suit in vacuum in a familiar region is manageable but in atmosphere and on an awkward surface it becomes more clumsy there is environmental resistance there was very little planetary atmosphere here but we felt it nonetheless but mainly our problem was the sheer height of our start i hesitate to repeat myself but it is difficult even to rationalize the impact this elevation had on us from space a niche in the foothill of a mountain may seem minor especially when it is down near the larger plain but one kilometer is after all a thousand meters and that is awesome up close it seemed that if we fell we would fall foreverand somehow perversely my apprehension made me almost want to fall to get it over with a fall at quartergee would not be nearly as ferocious as one at fullgee but my nervous system had evolved on earth and it reacted as it would have on earth i was almost paralyzed with the fear of that height close your eyes helse told me helmet to helmet pretend its only a few yards meters coward that i was i did and it helped but soon i was looking again reminding myself that i hadnt been acrophobic while in the bubble on the bubble had been another matterbut i believe that was understandable out here it was the feel of weight and the uncertainty of the rope that jittered me rather than the actual elevation had i for example been using a reliable flying suit this same elevation and slope would hardly have bothered me at least this is what i now prefer to believe so i scrambled over the dread ridge in my turn just as if i felt no fear and helse followed me and with that conquest of my hesitancy my apprehension abated without actually disappearing commitment does seem to help the women before and after us seemed to have no problems though i was sure each experienced similar qualms the vista below was dramatic the surface of io was a tapestry of orange even in the reflected light from jupiter dark runnels showed where some recent flow of sulfur had passed and bright flameor whatever it should be called since no fire as we know it can burn in nearvacuumshowed at a roughly circular vent to the right the observation dome was near this vent partly sheltered by a lesser escarpment it looked precarious to me but i suppose theres no way to gather significant data on a sulfur volcano except by sitting beside it for a while and making onthespot notes i wondered what the life expectancy of such researchers was probably that was a superstrong superinsulated dome able to withstand what it had to but probably too the researchers possessed a certain quality of courage a person did not have to be a muscular warrior to be brave as the women of our bubble were showing we were stepsliding down the steep slope at about five kilometers per hour so we had a halfhour descent to do that was all right but what i wondered about the return trip and how much rope did we have not any kilometer length for certain sure enough the rest of us had to set ourselves against the slope clinging to sulfurice while our endperson separated herself and us from the anchor at the top she left a trailing length so that we could use it to haul ourselves up the vertical portion of the slope and over the lip but that was all on our return trip we would have to climb unaided to that point i didnt like it now that we were no longer anchored we proceeded more swiftly too swiftlyi tried to brake for safety but the onrush of sliding women hauled me along in moments we were out of control inexperience was telling i think someone screamed as i mentioned it is not a complete vacuum on io the sulfur dioxide gas is around especially near the hot vents where it cant freeze out so sound is theoretically possible maybe it was conducted along the ground or the rope anyway there was reason to scream we were sliding toward a sharper dropoffand judging from our present angle this one had to be virtually vertical i dug in my feet with renewed desperation chewing up a mass of chips and dust so did helse and the women but the drag of those in front who were completely out of control was too great we were all being hauled to that dread brink then a woman toward the front drew a knife she sawed at the rope and in a moment it parted then she dug in her heels and the rest of us did likewise and this concerted effort was effective at last and slowly we slowed but as we crunched to a nervous halt we watched the first five women tumble over the brink led by seсora ortega maybe it was just an irregularity leading to a gentler slope below in that case they would be all right just bruised and perhaps angry at the rest of us for cutting them loose it was an anger we could accept we worked our way sidewise finding a better slope avoiding the ledge we each jammed our heels in at each step making sure we would not get out of control again though this slowed us enormously then we moved down when we got below the level of the ledge we looked across anxiously to see what had become of our leading segment there was nothing the ledge overhung a developing crevice that widened into a channel for an avalanche almost vertical those women might as well have fallen straight down what could we do but go on we could not even see the lost women let alone reach them let alone help them in the highly unlikely chance they survived even the time it took to make the effort would prejudice the success of our mission all of us had known this trek would be dangerous now we had the proof a similar fate would befall the rest of us if we didnt complete our mission so we paused helmets bowed in silent mourning for doсa concha and the others that was the best we could do io had taken her first victims i was very much afraid they would not be her last ones we continued down there were other ledges and other crevices none of them having been evident during our approach in the bubble we proceeded slowly and avoided them once bitten thrice shy this mountain had a great deal more character than we had anticipated and now every trace irregularity loomed monstrously had we had any inkling of the enormity of the challenge the descent would represent we would have landed elsewhere and avoided such a hazard but that was most of our problem ignorance and inexperience both were being rapidly abated and we did at last make it to the base but it took us almost an hour twice as long as budgeted we untied ourselves and marched across the orange surface the woman who had cut the rope was now our leader i didnt know who she was and suspect most of the others shared my ignorance but it didnt matter she had tried to decline the title but the rest of us insisted by gestures she had saved herself and the rest of us by her quick action her snap judgments promised to be most reliable there is indeed a place for hasty decisions and that place is the surface of io for there simply is not time to consider all aspects of many alternatives at comfortable leisure our new leader sought the ridges not trusting the snowfilled recesses but these ridges though only a few meters high were irregular and fragmented so our firm footing exacted a price of devious routing we had to jump over crevices and some of them were pretty wide and deep even with low gravity this was nervous business sure enough one of our women slipped as she jumped over an especially bad one and fell down into it the crack was about thirty meters deep closing into a dark crease she was wedged down there unmoving we started to lower a rope to her to pull her out then we saw her suit it was deflating the fall had punctured it perhaps it had snagged on a sharp projection her air was gone further effort on our part was pointless we could not reach her in time to do any good as it happened i recognized the suit of this woman she was the mother of one of the smaller children her loss became more poignant in that moment as i thought of what we would have to tell that child seсora ortegas grandchildren too would have to be told there was a grim business coming after we returned to the bubble even if we completed our mission without further casualties these were real people not strangers who were dying after that we avoided the worst cracks though this meant risking the yellow snow from some of the low areas fumes sprayed up making little domes of frozen gas and particles like decorative waterfalls these were really miniature volcanoes i realized harmless as long as we didnt step in them this was the land of volcanoes we tramped on for hours sacrificing time in favor of safety dawn came as the moons rapid orbit brought it a quarter circle around jupiter in ten hourswhich hours we had used up in our prelanding survey and then in our suitingup and organization and slow descent and march we had grossly underestimated the time such routine required on callisto dawn outside the dome is pretty but unremarkable since we have our own daynight schedule inside the domes here dawn was immediate and forcefulin fact more savage than we had imagined sulfur dioxide sublimates to gas in the ambience of day on io it is frozen only during the night with the first touch of sunlight the snow around us began to heat and convert as that light slowly intensified this conversion became explosive the gas expanded upward and outward filling the vacuum swirling past the irregular features of the landscape we were soon amidst an upwardflinging storm in addition the ground quaked io was now in the close swift phase of its orbit about jupiter and the tidal force was manifesting the entire body of this world was being squishedand her molten interior was squirting out of every available pore this was not a volcano it was an entire planetary face of eruptions we were caught in an awakening hell and this surely was the physical location of hell i realized hell did have to be somewhere if it had any reality at all and this was conveniently located satan could ship the newly damned souls out here at lightspeed by the busload less than an hours trip from earth and dump them out amidst the burning sulfur and leave them to their own miserable devices where could they go and we like the unlikely fools we were had come here voluntarily our souls would not have far to travel when they departed our bodies we had to rope ourselves together again lest the rising winds of the filling vacuum blow us away new crevices were yawning and the constant shaking of the ground was as deeply unsettling to our attitude as to our bodies we were accustomed to a stable planet where could we hidefrom this we plowed on toward the target dome huddling against the titanic forces of nature being unleashed about us when a person fell two more picked her up when a segment of our line of people was blown toward a crevice the rest of the line dug in instantly and pulled them back we were learning to react correctly but vicious io would not permit us to continue so readily she opened a battery of jets almost beneath us the ground cracked open and a line of ejecta spewed out immediately behind helse the sulfur sand and gas rose like the cutting edge of a knifeand what it cut was our rope suddenly the last eight women in our line were separated from us we perceived their suited outlines dimly through the haze we tried to rejoin thembut now the vent widened as if seizing on its advantage and the wash of gas and sand expanded the ground beneath the eight of them broke up fragments of it were blasted out raining down in a larger pattern a central plume of eruption formed surrounded by an envelope of swirling gas we could no longer see our friendsand i suspected that was just as well they could not have survived that blast it may seem that i lacked emotion as i watched my companions perish i think this was not the case my emotion was stifled suppressed voided because i knew there was nothing to be gained by it for me or the others i had concerns of survival too pressing to be dissipated by the energy of emotion so i watched with a kind of numbness unable to comprehend the larger significance of what i saw and plodded on the woman before me doubled over i saw her suit deflating a particle from the eruption had holed it i tried to clap my hands over the puncture but it was useless her remaining pressure leaked out around my clumsy gloves and she was dead before i knew it i saw her face inside the helmet bloating out the eyesoh god depressurization is a terrible thing my numbness suffered another jolt i realized that there was absolutely no merit in my survival that particle could have holed my suit as readily as this womans only pure chance had dictated that she had occupied that spot in its trajectory instead of i had we been moving ahead a trifle faster i would have been there slower and the woman ahead of her would have been there similarly it had been luck that cut off the eight women behind us it could as readily have been nine that would have taken out helse at that point my speculation balked there was nothing to do but salvage the dead womans oxygen tank fumblingly i moved it to my suit as a potential spare for whoever might need it my suit had had about twentyfour hours of service remaining at the start of the io venture but some of the other suits might have less i disconnected her body from the chain and we went on already i wished ardently that we had never landed on terrible io but it was far far too late for any change of mind the angry planet was not through with us she would not be satisfied i realized until every one of us was dead a new gas vent opened this one at a slant and its blast shoved the twelve of us who remained rapidly forward toward the dome we were headed for this might have seemed fortuitousbut we already knew the danger of tooswift progress and didnt like this we tried to slow down to control our route and our destinybut the vent only increased its exhalation while the ground shook violently impeding our footing and we had to move at ios will not our own the consequence of this loss of control was not long in coming we found ourselves charging a vent overflowing with sulfur lava the viscous brightyellow material flowing slowly across out path it would have been easy enough to avoidif the wind behind us had not been shoving us directly into it we saw it coming and tried to veer left to get around it but the lead women were already too close they were carried right into the glowing mass their suits inflated like bubbles and burst with the sudden heat overload one woman just at the edge of the flow managed to brace her feet and turn and point left helse and i and the woman now in front of us scrambled desperately leftand the braced woman pulled on the rope helping us crack the whip so that we could gain impetus to avoid the lava it worked and we scrambled to relative safetybut the woman who helped us could not maintain her footing and was carried on into the lava she fell headlong her suit immersed for a moment before the rapid heat expansion lifted it to the surface and popped it she died helping us to live and so did several of the women closest to her the rope burned through setting our end free more sacrifice for usand we didnt even know their names they had surely known ours though for the sacrifice had been too deliberate they were preserving us so we could speak english to the scientists of the dome and complete our mission i dont care if io is literal hell i am sure those gallant women went to heaven helse and i and three women cleared the lava we survivedwe five of the twentyseven who had started this trek and we still werent at the dome the lava flow was following a great ushaped channel we were now in that channel ahead of the flow and knew we had to get out of it quickly the lava was moving slowly but that could change quicklyor a reverse gust of a gale could drive us back into it all low ground was treacherous while lava was spewing we spotted the edge of the escarpment that sheltered the observation dome this rose into a mountain not more than two kilometers high but it was as jagged as the other there should be shelter from wind and lava in its lee as this was not a volcanic structure it seemed that solid rock floated on the halfmolten crust of the planet much as continents were supposed to do on planets like earth we were very glad to have this solidity amidst this horribly living surface security was hard to come by here in hell it was effective the wind cut off as we passed into the mountain shelter and the ground was more stable here we stayed at the base close in knowing better than to try to climb the impossibly steep slope looming beside us therein was the final error in our judgment of io the foot of the mountain was not a straight line it wound in and out in a series of sculptured bays it was really quite pretty in its fashion with the sulfur changing shades of orange depending on the angle of the sunlight and shadow and the direction from which we viewed it massive and somber an island of stability in this ocean of violence it seemed almost to lean over us protectively the sun rose slowly higher as we walked further warming the region the yellowish atmosphere was thickening then the avalanche started i think a volcanic tremor actually set it off but it was the softening sulfur snow that made it ready to happen too late we realized what we had been flirting with when we cozied up to this mountain the entire face of it seemed to slide snow flew up in a yellow cloud obscuring the more solid motion but we could tell by the rumble that shook our bodies through ground and vapor that there were massive boulders within it this probably happened every morning as the mountain warmed while at night the sulfur dioxide solidified and coated it again the mountain was more or less eternal as this region went not so its clothing of snow i knew that avalanches tended to flow in channels as the material took the easiest route down thus it would concentrate mostly in one bay or another by the time it struck the bottom but which bay our survival depended on our choice of locale by common consensus we drew into one bay we would ride it out together but helse at the end suddenly unlinked herself and bolted terrified she had panicked and done the worst possible thing i set out after herand was brought short by the rope that linked me to the three women with anger and desperation i untied myself while the rumble swelled around us then i launched after helse i didnt know whether i could catch her and fetch her back in time but i had to try i suppose that was brave of me i really didnt think about that at the time i just knew i had to save helse i sprinted after her making better time than she in the clumsy suits because i had more power but by the time i caught her it was too late the avalanche was upon us i wrapped my arms about her and threw her down seeking to protect her with my body though knowing it was useless the mass of the falling material would crush us both to death in an instant my last thought was that this was as good a way to die as any embracing the woman i loved butit didnt happen a few chunks of discolored snow fell beside us that was all the noise was all about us however swelling to a crescendowhich then stifled out the horrendous fall of sulfur had comeand we were alive we climbed back to our feet somewhat dazed i wondered how i had been able to hear so much and realized that the atmosphere had filled out considerably as the snow sublimated sound was indeed possible in the normal fashion now the avalanche had settled in the other bay where the three women waited now that bay was filled with the rubble of the mountain we examined the monstrous orange pile cogitated a moment and went on as usual io had given us no other course we trudged on burdened more by the horror of twentyfive women dead than by the fatigue of the trek but now we walked some distance out from the base of the mountain though that put us at the fringe of the wind and belching ground we knew how far out we had to be to avoid the main mass of an avalanche because we had just seen an avalanche we could walk within that range but had to be ready to bolt out of it at the first sound of a slide sure enough before long we felt the rumble of another avalanche and saw the clouds of yellow snow we were clear of it but i was developing a profound dislike for that color i think for the rest of my life i will associate yellow with hell we were beyond the threat of the snowslide but sympathetic vibrations in the ground opened new crevices at our feet and we hastened right back toward the mountain snow scylla and charybdis the perils of the left and rightwe had to be alert and quick to avoid them both then we rounded an outcropping and spied the station dome never had a structure looked more beautiful to me we bounded up to it to the tinyseeming lock at its baseand were met by a suited man he didnt even try to question us he conducted us right inside and soon we were in a blessedly warm chamber breathing fresh air feeling full earth gravity the gravity around the dome must have been reduced as it was wherever a gravity lens focused the waves but we hadnt noticed that shows how far gone we were best of all was the feeling of security there were no storms in here no jetting vents no lava flows and no avalanches we could relax without risking prompt extinction it was like a crushing burden evaporating from our bodies the head scientist showed up immediately to question us he was an older man obviously from jupiter he had short gray hair large spectacles that would have been fashionable half a millennium ago and of course he spoke nothing but english our original plan was no good despite our ability to speak the language the fake bomb had been lost with our companions and we had no way to hijack this station even if we had wanted to carry through too much had happened we did not care to honor the memory of the women who had sacrificed themselves by the commission of a crime perhaps this was illogical but it was the way i felt and i believe helse agreed so we simply told the scientist the truth the man shook his head in polite amazement they actually towed you back out to space he asked referring to an earlier part of our story i find that awkward to believe that was the word he used awkward he was trying to avoid implying that we were not telling the truth believe it mason an associate told him the new administration has instituted a gettough policy on immigration no more hispanics but the governments of the moons are notoriously repressive the scientist said what other recourse do these people have evidently to die in space the other returned wryly it was obvious that the scientists were humanitarians unacquainted with the specifics of political policy the scientist masoni was not certain whether that was his given or his surnamereturned his attention to us so you plotted to hijack this station to obtain suppliesto go where hidalgo i repeated but thats impossible hidalgo is on the far side of the solar system at the moment we had planned to get an ephemeris to locate it exactly i said such details hardly mattered now that we had failed mason went to a computer terminal here is our ephemeris he said punching buttons the screen illuminated showing threedimensional coordinates seehidalgo is just about as far away now as it is possible to be you could travel more readily to mars or earth at the moment my weight seemed to increase we didnt know we thought it could be close to jupiter it is closein season you happen to seek it at an inopportune time then we have nowhere to go i said thinking again of the twentyfive women who had given their lives for this hopeless mission we had never had a chance from the outset perhaps some other year i would be better able to appreciate the irony mason pondered politics is not my specialty but i think you would be well advised to seek asylum on leda there is a jupiter military station there whose commandant is of hispanic descent i suspect he would interpret the law more liberally than did those you encountered before youre not arresting us helse put in the scientist refocused on her arrest you for what you have told me that would be selfincrimination as i explained i am not a political man and if i were i suspect i would not endorse this particular brand of politics he shook his head smiling besides you remind me too much of my niece helses face froze i realized she was thinking of the supposed uncleniece relationship she had had as a child prostitute for all the apologies she had made for that system it was evident that she wanted no more of it leda i said quickly the next moon out from callisto but too small to house a population indeed mason agreed returning his attention to me helse relaxed realizing that the scientists remark had been innocent its diameter is hardly ten kilometers that would be about six miles in your measurement no kilometers is fine i said he really didnt know our culture i realized that scientists while certainly intelligent people were not educated in things beyond their fields miles was his cultures unit of measurement outside the scientific and technical arena not mine he smiled leda would fit within the shadow of one of our sulfur mountains here but if you can reach it i think it would be worth your while we can reach it i said optimism returning if we can get the supplies we need and an exact course its pretty far out eleven million kilometers from jupiter he agreed checking his figures on the terminal though he surely knew them in his head about twentyfive times as far out from jupiter as is io but i think we can let you have a good drive jet and sufficient supplies helse came alive again you can the scientist smiled we suffer frequent losses here owing to the violence of the geography we study this is one loss i shall be glad to sustain but we were going to hijack you she cried chagrined he looked at her pretty face you did my dear you did then perceiving her reaction he asked did i say something wrong i realized we would have to tackle this headon do you have a picture of your niece i asked perplexed mason gestured to a desk there was a picture of a family of three my brother and his charming wife and their daughter megan a charming girl i stared at the picture there was an uncanny resemblance between helse and the pictured megan the scientist had not been joking about being reminded of his niece how old is she i asked mason considered i do lose track of time in a place like this i can tell you quickly about the past five eruptions of vent c here but mundane details like the party of my brothers politics or the age of his childlet me see you have it on file his associate reminded him oh yes thank you mason punched more buttons and got the information she was born in that would make her twenty now if i have not lost track of the date this year i fear my picture is becoming dated too so the resemblance was illusory or at least misplaced megan was four years older than helse instead of the same age as the picture showed still they might resemble each other in the manner of sisters but i saw that megan was full caucasian not mixed latin as helse was nevertheless this was enough to reassure helse mason really did have a niece and obviously adored her but she had never lived with him and if she had he would not have abused her he reacted to helse the way he would to a true niece there was no untoward aspect my talent told me this now sometimes experience makes us overly suspicious helse was blushing now evidently pursuing a similar series of thoughts the scientist set about providing us with what we needed drawing on the expertise of his staff to do a far better job of it than we could have done our mission it seemed had after all been successful chapter when will it end we had to wait till evening for the atmosphere to freeze out so that a bubble could safely float across the dangerous landscape of io by day a chance volcano could sweep it right out of space helse and i ate and slept comfortably reveling in the civilized facilities of the dome and the kindness of the scientists who seemed rather pleased to be entertaining young folk like us i think in retrospect that this was the happiest period of our odyssey despite the recent deaths of the women for now we had genuine hope not all men were pirates or callous officials i think if i ever have occasion to do any scientist anywhere a favor i will do it unstintingly at last refreshed we set off a technician transported us along with the supplies in a small bubble in minutes we traversed the distance it had taken us dreadful hours to cover afoot we came in sight of the nestled home bubble helse touched my arm we were not in our space suits now they were unnecessary hopehow are we going to tell them somehow that aspect had been suspended from my awareness for several hours twentyfive women were dead the mothers and only surviving parents of so many of the children what could anyone say to soften that tragedy ill have to explain i said the idyll of the day ended like the illusion it had been and cruel reality returned we watched our small bubble close on the larger one when i spooked and ran there at the avalanche helse murmured why did you come after me hope preoccupied by the grimness i was about to have to convey i answered her absently i had to try to save you idiot without you i might as well be dead you thought we were both dead when the slide struck yes shows how much i know about avalanches you turned out to be right blind luck she said i panicked you were ready to die for me and instead the sensible women died i agreed pure chance neither of us knew what we were doing that bothered me even in my distractionthe reminder that no merit of mine accounted for my survival it had bothered me briefly when the woman in front of me had her suit holed now it hit me harder because i had no immediate distraction of survival i was no better than any of those women who had died only a freak of fate had preserved me it was as though a mans boot landed on the ground where live ants walked and three were squashed and two were spared without the man even noticing at times like this i wondered whether i believed in god surely god was not like the booted man heedless of human welfare or merit but if he were not then what was he like if he had decreed after due consideration that sixty men and twentyfive women should die while trying to do the right thing while brute pirates prospered what kind of a deity was he i think i love you helse said the bubble nudged into contact with the other and the air locks kissed and held we had arrived something penetrated my distraction what helse smiled never mind did you say she shrugged and now the air locks opened and my onerous duty was upon me i could not question helse further but perhaps i did not need to we were met at the lock by a small group of women oh they found you hope hubris one said i had to concentrate to remember that her name was seсora martнnez we were so worried when neither party returned neither party iwe have bad news and good news i said seсora martнnez peered past me where are the others thats the bad news i said only helse and i made it all the others your mother did not find you seсora martнnez asked her face drawn the cold of the outside closed in on me my motherwent out she led another party of twentyfive she had a premonition you were in trouble that there would be deaths in your party if someone didnt come to help helse turned a staring face to me oh no hope there were deaths i said dully my mother and her partydid not return seсora martнnez shook her head we thoughtshe would be with you when did she leave at dawn that meant the second party had been out on the surface of io all day following our route all day in hell we could look for them in the bubble helse suggested the station technician who had piloted us here spoke up anyone traveling afoot on the surface leaves a trail the eruptions and evaporation of the day obliterate it but if they are still alive and moving that new trail will show up now i knew with a sick certainty that nothing would be found the odds were against any human party surviving a full day on ios inner face how well we knew that yet we had to look quickly we transferred the supplies and installed the new drivejet this one was much larger and heavier than the old one and was fashioned in a circle it would blast a ring of fire or more properly a tube of fire surrounding the rear air lock it was securely fastened in place we would not be able to move it to the bubble equator to institute spin in space but for that we still had the old little singlejet drive which we could store near the lock inside when not in use be careful not to short the lead wires when its inside the technician warned us it will jet in air as readily in space and you wouldnt want that to happen yes we were sure we wouldnt the technician finished and bade us farewell the locks sealed and the two bubbles separated then both took off and floated low across the hellish surface of the planet looking for a trail there was nothing our own trail of the morning had been obliterated of course and no other evidence of life showed sulfur was condensing on the mountain slopes and settling like snow on the plains below leaving clear spaces around the active volcanoes new tracks should have been evident in that fresh snow the second party of women was gone with no more trace than the first killer io had had another feast we did not know how bad it was seсora martнnez said tearfully none of us had known at length the second bubble parted company with us having done what it could my memory of this period becomes hazy spirit and i sat in the cell our mother had used trying vainly to comfort each other to ease our common loss helse brought us food from time to time but left us mostly alone it had been terrible when our father died and numbing when faith sacrificed herself but this was the worstbecause our mother charity hubris was all that we had left of our family except each other there was an amorphous intangible ambience of emotion that had to coalesce somewhere like sulfur dioxide precipitating at night and now for each of us it had no object except the other that settling out had to be accomplished but it took time when we came out of it a few days later like two survivors of holocaust we went about the bubble and took stock it was a disaster area we had hardly been alone in our mourning the children of those other fortynine women had been coining to similar terms some of them hadnt made it i had never thought of children as suicidal types but i could not condemn them for it spirit and i had had each other some of the others had had no siblings to be entirely alonei had come near enough to that abyss to comprehend its nature and i understood the bodies of those children joined their fathers in cold storage on the hull of the bubble so we were spiraling out toward leda our only remaining hope using our strong new jet to accelerate our orbital velocity which in the normal paradox of such travel caused us to proceed outward at reduced velocity we knew where we were going thanks to the spot ephemeris the kindly scientist mason had printed out for us and had only to follow instructions to take advantage of the gravity wells of europa ganymede and callisto to boost us to much better outward progress so even though leda was a tiny mote far out from jupiter we expected to reach it in a month of floating this would have been impossible for us before for ledas sidereal period is days and we could have taken that long just to catch it once we reached its orbit but a good drive unit makes a tremendous difference when one adds a powerful outboard motor to a sailboat one ceases to worry as much about the wind we had really become a crude spaceship in fact the trip might have been impossible regardless of schedule without that new drive this was because the gravity lenses kept us within the jupiter ecliptic the disk of space extending outward from its equator where the rings lie but leda like all the outer moons has an inclined orbit twentyseven degrees tilted instead of falling within one degree of that plane like the inner moons so we had to go that far out of the ecliptic or we would never have a chance to align the scientists had plotted it out for us otherwise we should have been lost our bubble complement was now ten grown women and seventytwo children counting helse and me as children the women had done an excellent job but they had been under strain piloting the bubble and caring for the majority of us who had sunk into the depression of new orphanism i would have grieved longer but i saw how selfish that would be it was time for me to pull my weight helse had been helping all along now spirit and i moved in taking instruction from helse and helping her teach the other children we learned to take sightings on jupiter and ganymede and callisto threedimensionally triangulating our relative position by using the little hand computer the scientists had provided for this purpose then modifying the gravity lenses to correct our erring course for our course was never precisely on target by itself it always had to be adjusted naturally we could not simply orient on leda and jet toward her leda not only was not visible from here she wasnt there she would be there only at the precise date and moment the ephemeris indicated so we had to take triple sightings on familiar objects in space get our angles precisely check the time to the second use the ephemeris to pinpoint exactly where those three objects were so we could calculate exactly where we were then calculate how far that deviated from where we should be fortunately the scientists had also provided idiot sheets that spelled out the steps in very simple bitesized statements complete with blanks for the new figures we learned to set the degree of thrust of the drive unit again according to computations it was a challenge and in its fashion it was fun we felt like little spacemen and we were soon the grown women were able to retreat into purely nominal supervision and get some needed rest but now we were passing through the midreaches and pirates still clogged the ecliptic we spied a ship overhauling us and knew it was trouble we held a quick council of war and decided to offer no resistance normally sex was all the pirates really wanted and it no longer seemed like a prohibitive price to pay we would have been glad to have any of the lost women back from io if sex was the price of her rescue what is one act compared to life but helse took the precaution of changing to her boy costume and she set up half a dozen of our oldest girlchildren including spirit similarly then most of us retreated to our cells and left the ten women to do what they had to do with luck no one would be hurt and each women would not have to service more than two or three or four men it came to me then how far our attitudes had progressed or regressed in the course of our savage experience we no longer even expected anything other than piracy and forced sex from strangers and hardly considered any course of action other than that which would get us through with the smallest loss the children of the surviving mothers took it for granted that prostitution was the proper course just as they accepted the cannibalistic consumption of their fathers to abate their hunger we had suffered more than physical degradation yet at the time it seemed rightand in retrospect it still seems right we did what we had to do how can that be wrong i should be out there helse muttered as we heard the lock open im old enough and god knows ive had experience i reacted with horror never you i breathed i love you and did you love your mother she asked i swung my arm up hitting her the action was unpremeditated and the position awkward so my arm only grazed her head in passing but i was immediately chagrined of course i knew what she meant as my second thought caught up with my first i had loved my mother and let her prostitute herself why should it be otherwise with helse there was an inconsistency in my philosophy im sorry i whispered she smiled wanly and put her arm around me i understand hope i understand but you must accept that it is not only your family that can make sacrifices for you that woman at the lava flow threw away her life for us those women meeting the pirates now are not our relatives but they are doing it for us you must permit me to do for you what i can and for the others of this bubble she was right but i could not say it the thought of some foul pirate embracing her treating her as the horse had treated my sister faith filled me with a blinding horror i love you i repeated as if that had any logic i know you do hope and i love you there need be no pretense between us anymore i know you are the one man who would never hurt me her words filled me with a blaze of emotion that i felt physically in my chest radiating through my body i know the biologists say the heart is not the true font of love that it is all in the mind i sometimes think biologists doubt that love exists at all but what i felt was in my breast and brain i leaned over and kissed her and fire seemed to play about our touching lips then we had to break for we heard the tramp of pirate feet along the commons and if anyone saw us kissing helses masculine ruse would quickly enough be discovered i will never hurt you i agreed passionately and i believed it what terrible ironies fate inflicts on us they were pirates all right we heard their guttural exclamations as they examined our women who had gone so far as to make themselves as reasonably attractive as possible donning dresses and loosening their hair i hated all of this but knew it was necessary it was better than the violence and bloodshed that otherwise would come these were real brutes it seemed they werent interested in acquiescence they wanted violence i heard them hitting the women i heard the screams i started to get up to go out there in a furybut helse held me back she was correct of course as she had been before when my mother had been out there my headstrong reaction was sheer mischief i settled back shivering with rage and i realized that helse was doing service with the older women it was her chore to keep me out of the action to save my life if nothing else from the consequence of my adolescent folly one woman was thrown on the deck immediately above our cell we heard the thump of her body and that of the pirate who bestrode her and saw their fuzzy outlines through our ceiling panel i wished i could slide open the panel and stab a blade upward into the pirates body then the woman screamed and it was an ugly sound she had been terribly hurt still helse held me back and of course i could not even get out of the cell while the bodies lay astride it once more i waited in silent shivering fury while helse clung to me and stroked my hair as she might the fur of an aggressive but imperfectly disciplined guard dog the pirate finally got up and moved away we heard screams elsewhere it sounded as if cells were being opened children hauled out our program of accommodation of pacifism was not working helse issued a stifled scream i looked at her startled there was blood on her shirt as i watched in the dim light i froze for the moment and watched it dripping down from our access panel helse happened to be under it so had caught the first drops how bright red that blood was we exchanged a horrified glance the blood had to be coming from the woman who still lay above us and it could not be the result of any minor scratch the pirate had stabbed her a new scream rent the air close and loud spirit i cried with instant recognition the pirates were hauling her out this time my rage could not be constrained i jumped for the panel shoving it violently aside blood dripped down on my head as part of the womans body sagged into our cell i had to push her out of the way i saw her staring eyes and the terrible wound in her side she had been cut so deeply she had already bled to death or perhaps her heart had been pierced i hauled myself up my vision tunneling to only one thing the pirate his bloodstained blade was jammed in his waistband and he was halflying on the deck reaching down into spirits cell he cursed suddenly slapping his face and i knew spirit had used her fingerwhip on him that reminded me of my laser pistol which i had not thought to have about me idiot that i was now i needed it then the pirate scrambled forward dropping into the cell as i cleared mine i dived after him i caught him about the head trying to draw it back trying to choke him but my strength and weight were too slight he roared and brought a hairy hand back catching me by the hair yanking me forward spirit i gasped she reacted as if she were a part of my own body she pounced on the knife at his sash and snatched it out while he was preoccupied with me this was like our fight with the scion so long agoone month ago an eternitybut this was more serious this man would kill us i brought up my knees as the pirate pulled me over his head i clamped my legs against his ears resisting him upside down i saw spirit take the knife and survey her prospects i felt a kind of chill right through the heat of the combat at the calculating way she considered i have said before that i would not care to oppose my little sister when she was really angry it remains true then she gripped the knife in both hands and stabbed the pirate in the belly he grunted and let go of me he grabbed at spirit but she drew back as far as she could in the cell jerking out the knife so as to let him bleed the pirate roared stalking her evidently not seriously damaged or at least not sufficiently aware of it what brutes these men were i knew the noise could summon his companions they would ignore the screams of women and children knowing they were merely victims but the pirates might come to the aid of one of their own in trouble we had to shut this one up until we got him safely dead i tried to circle his bull neck again but he threw me against the wall that distraction however laid him open to attack again spirit launched herself her feet pushing off violently from the walls of the corner her twohanded knife spearing toward the pirates face he saw it coming and reared back trying to protect his eyesbut there really is little room to maneuver in a cubed cell and he banged into the wall and though the knife missed i grabbed him once more by the head spirit thrust againthis time for the throat she scored for there was nothing weak or halting about her fighting nature once aroused the blade slashed into the exposed neck cutting it open from front to side digging deeply blood spurted out in a horrendous red jet she had severed not only the jugular vein but one of the deeply buried carotid arteries the pirate collapsed there was not much else he could do in the circumstance i extricated myself from his body and took the knife from spirits lax hand and shoved her up and out of the panel exit there was blood on her of coursebut there was blood everywhere it was chaos on the commons no one noticed us i got us both out and slid the panel closed then i hauled the womans body over laying it across the panel sealing off that cell then i shoved spirit down with helse and jumped in myself and slid the panel closed if anyone looks play dead i snapped we played dead anyway the three of us it wasnt hard to do for we were smeared with the gore of the woman and the pirate spirit was sobbing for she was not yet so hardened to the new reality that she could slaughter a man without reaction but she was fairly quiet about it and i knew she could stifle it the rest of the way if the panel opened she could do what she had to do she had always been the best at that in our family i held one of her hands and helse held the other lending her what little emotional support we could we all knew the pirate had deserved it that he was a murderer who had raped and killed virtually simultaneously one of our women who had offered him no resistance that he had then tried to get at spirit for similar atrocity and that she had slain him in selfdefense still she had killed him and she was only a twelveyearold female child justification did not make it easy for her time passed and the bedlam above diminished no one looked in though we cringed in fear as footsteps passed close eventually the pirates departed and disconnected their ship it was over apparently that cutthroat crew was so disorganized that the pirates didnt even make a count of their departing number or maybe they were used to taking losses and simply didnt care i climbed out it was even worse than i had feared all ten women were dead the pirates had callously raped and murdered them apparently as a matter of course leaving no adult witnesses nonresistance had been disaster this time we might as well have fought them from the outset at least taking more of them with us as it was they had made a literal wreckage of our bubble and of our hopes for sanctuary panels were broken walls were dented and food packs were ripped open and strewn about the commons the crumbs soaking up some of the blood that puddled around the equatorial region helse joined me spirit overcome by the horror of the killing she had done remained in the cell i would return for her as soon as i could right now i had to determine the extent of our losses i didnt know whether anyone survived besides the three of us or whether we had any supplies remaining or whether our equipment still functioned in short whether we had any reasonable prospect for continued survival more of us had survived than i had thought at first other children had been overlooked in their cells and others had thought to play dead even so twentyseven children had died our total number was down to fortyfive all children some of them in the almostsuicidal reaction to being newly orphaned only one pirate was dead the one spirit and i had killed i knew spirit would be missing or dead now if we had not dealt with that brute i was shaken but had no honest regret for what we had done as it was we had been lucky lucky we had managed to kill him and lucky we had been able to conceal his body and ourselves it had been a narrow and ugly thing amidst the battlefield carnage that was our bubble we held an impromptu crude service of mourning then buried the bodies on the hull bagged with the men helse and i did most of it we were now the two oldest survivors in addition we were relatively unscathed by this latest slaughter odd as it may seem to say it my parents and older sister had been lost before so i had a head start on adjusting while helse had always been alone in the bubble the children who had just lost their last parent had a more immediate shock to bear how well i understood there is no need to dwell on what followed when the necessary cleaning up was done and our supplies were surveyed i assumed the leadership of the bubble it wasnt that i was any natural leader it was that there was no one else helse was the oldest but she was no leader and the children somehow expected the commands to issue from a man or a grandmother they would follow me i assigned the most competent surviving children to navigation duty they did know how to do it once their shock of emotion backed off i assigned others to mess duty handing out the food packs there were enough of these though a number had been destroyed in wanton vandalism by the pirates our diminished number more than made up the difference but this was no casual assignment because i knew and they knew that if the rations ran short again these would be the ones to select and haul and thaw and carve and cook the meat they had to be tough realistic kids and they needed time to prepare themselves the most important thing i was doing was unspoken i was trying to establish a viable social order these orphans had to have something tangible and social to relate to to replace their lost families now we had a group family much tighter than before because the need was greater than before with discipline and caring and stability and that helped them to survive emotionally as well as physically it was my talent coming into its own at last exerted as a lifepromoting force i tried to come to understand the specific needs of each member of our family and to accommodate that need as well as was possible when a child cried someone was always there to hold his hand or hug him or talk to him when a child stumbled someone always came ta help him up when he laughed someone laughed with him when he mourned someone mourned with him when he went to the head someone accompanied him for the accommodations were sized for adults so a child alone could have trouble helse and i took turns telling stories inventing whatever fantasies seemed most to appeal for there is immense comfort in group storytelling as our prehistoric ancestors knew many of us took to sleeping on the commons floor for it got lonely at night in the individual cells sometimes we formed big circles and slept holding hands in a sort of daisy chain even for me that helped my dreams were less nightmarish when i felt the touch of other hands in mine it worked amazingly well in hours it seemed we had become fused into a desperately close community we knew this was all that lay between us and the physical and social void beyond we survived but what would we do when the next pirates came when would it end chapter violation of trust jupiter eclipticwe planned cynically for the next pirates we knew now that pirates were as random and savage and uncaring as sulfur volcanoes and should be treated with similar dispassionate respect if we wanted to live and to reach sanctuary at leda we would have to accommodate that reality we had a gauntlet to run and we could not avoid it so we had to prepare for it we were childrenbut we had lost our parents and siblings to pirates the realities of space had forced themselves upon us in most brutal fashion we were children who had been bloodied i repeat this point perhaps in a kind of explanation or apology for the cynicism of the things we contemplated which may disturb people who have not experienced what we had we had i believe it is fair to say as fair a notion of necessity as any space crew of any age could we concocted plans discussed them and acted them out in little playlets searching for flaws for we knew any error or oversight could be fatal this became really part of our therapy instead of telling stories now we were developing scenarios the important thing is that we did this together giving respect to all views making even the smallest child feel importantfor indeed the smallest was important we considered attacking pirates with knives but realized that only a few men would get cut before the others destroyed us we were after all children and could not fight adults on any even basis and any delusion that we could would be fatal we thought of poisoning their food andor waterbut had no poison and anyway pirates didnt come to eat and drink they came to rape and kill in retrospect i marvel at the psychology of the pirates apparently civilized restraints break down the moment civilized enforcement ends at least for certain types of men they raid and destroy simply because they enjoy pillaging and hurting and in space the refugees are easy targets i find it very difficult to sympathize with such an attitude but at least i think i understand it now the pirates are that dreg of society that is least civilized and that mankind as a whole would be best off without mighty jupiter preferred to treat the refugees as if they were such dregs but that was because the refugees were easy targetshelplesswhile the pirates would have been more difficult to deal with i was to spend long hours considering mechanisms to rid our species of the pirate trash and if ever i have the means to implement any such notions i shall do so to whatever extent i am able this is my promise to myself we went over every kind of defense both likely and unlikely we finally settled on a threestage program stage one we would present ourselves as sweet innocent orphan children and beg the pirates not to hurt us if they were nice or at least not homicidal all would be well after all the scientists on io had been nice we could not assume with absolute conviction that every man in space was evil many of the children did not really believe that but they grudgingly accepted the hypothesis because helse argued the case so feelingly and helse in her female dress was very pretty i had thought appreciation of prettiness was an adult trait but revised my thinking when i saw how she swayed even the smallest children in fantasy tales the pretty girl is always good and children do seem to take that on faith though it is of course suspect stage two if they were not nice and sought to kidnap rape or kill any of us or got angry when we rejected their candy spirit would give a signal she would blow a whistle provided her at which point every child would instantly draw a knife or nail or other sharp instrument and plunge it at the eyes or nearest other vulnerable region of the nearest pirate if that succeeded every pirate would be blind or castrated and presumably helpless then we could consider what to do next maybe we would have to kill them but we didnt have to make that decision right now we drilled on this stabbing at pirateshapedandsized dummies even our smallest children could run a mean spike into a crotch this was not the same as fighting pirates which we knew to be hopeless this was to be a surprise maneuver occurring explosively two seconds after that whistle blew a dozen or more pirates would be hurting and normally no more than that came aboard at one time stage three if for some reason we failed to incapacitate the piratesand realistically we deemed our chances to be no better than fifty percentand the situation was critical we would back off and helse would say to me do it and i would go out the second air lock with spirit or whoever else was handy standing by to cut off the drive for the few seconds id need to get past the ring of fire i would make my way around the outside hull to a particular refusetank release bolt that had been weakened and knock it off that would not only release the refuse it would empty the bubble of airbecause we would have jammed the automatic safety valve open that would finish the pirates it would also finish any of us who werent in suits so at helses signal all others would have to go to their cells and get suited in a hurry since the pirates wouldnt have their suits in the bubble we laughed uproariously at the joke we adapted about the pirate trying to rape a girl while in a space suit what kind of attachment would that suit have to havejuvenile humor gets quite fundamental even if they caught on they wouldnt have time to stop it their only recourse would be to flee immediately back to their ship and slam the air lock closed we would try to block the lock openjust a few seconds delay in closure would be all we would needbut if we failed in that we still would have saved ourselves from a larger disaster we liked this plan so well we almost hoped for an early chance to test it we spent hours perfecting the details spirit had to be suited from the outset because though she could cut off the drive from the insidethere was a simple makebreak switchto let me put she would not be able to do it again to let me in unless she herself survived the vacuum inside i had to use the rear lock because the front one might be encumbered by the pirate ship i really didnt want anyone else performing this particular office because if there were any error of timing and the drive came on again while i was crossing its deadly ring i would be cleanly sliced into pieces i trusted spirit to make no error i wasnt quite sure of anyone else spirit had always been my most reliable support even before we started this terrible voyage we rehearsed all three stages until we had them down pat we timed the last stage so we knew exactly how long people would have to get into their suits once i used the air lock we all got very quick about suiting up those suits now hung on hooks in each cell perpetually available and nobody touched another persons suit we had to play it close enough to take out the pirates and that was close indeed a thirtysecond delay in suiting could prove fatal there were fairly sophisticated wrinkles that we worked out chief among these was my physical position i had to have my suit on and stand by the lock so that helse could give me the signal from the commons to conceal my presence we made a baffle before the rear lock and decorated it with colored tassels lovingly fashioned of waste paper so it looked as if we were playing a childish game my suit too was decorated so that it looked fake some of the littlest kids showed surprising ingenuity in the details so we were readywhile those of us with most sense ardently hoped that we would never come to stages two or three if the pirates missed us and we made it unscathed to ledabut few of us really believed that would happen for a time however it seemed we would indeed be lucky we floated on for several days passing the orbit of callisto and no pirates came our rehearsals became precise then perfunctory we were now departing the jupiter ecliptic following the schedule set up by the io scientists almost i resented the time we had spent planning and rehearsing instead of finishing our mourning but it would certainly be best if we never saw another pirate we relaxed by gradual stages helse as the oldest surviving female became a den mother seeing to the needs of the smaller children within the framework of the community family and counseling some of the larger ones and i as the oldest male found myself becoming a father figure i resisted this aspect at first until helse explained to me the need of these children for someone to play this role we could not have a group family without a father the thing did not set right do it she told me it must be done and you are the one you set up the community family you labored to make it work you are indeed the father of it how can i be a father when im not even married i temporized half in humor but as i said it i felt a catch in my being marriage things were going smoothlyalmost too smoothly since the distractions of our serious preparations tended to abate our horror of recent lossesand there was no present need for us to be on duty the crew of kids was performing well enough and it was important that they be permitted to exercise this responsibility none of us could know who might be eliminated in the next pirate raid so the skills had to be distributed throughout our group we were not needed at the moment on duty helse guided me to our cell you could be she said when we were private could be what i knew she had something in mind but i wanted her to express it a father i smiled a father im only fifteen you have proved you are old enough i could be pregnant pregnant that particular aspect had never occurred to me i shared the ordinary adolescents selfimposed unawareness of the natural consequence of sex nature does not require awareness merely performance she laughed i didnt say i was hope just that i could be that it is possible you could be a father she was right im not ready i said but for youoh helse i want you forever and i want you she said hope ive never dared to love before but now i do now i do i dont care that youre younger than i am or that we were thrown together randomly weve been through more together than any regular couple and when you risked your life for me on io i knew really knew that i could trust you and i realized that she was leading up to something and i had a notion what and i wanted very much to have it but still i wanted her to say it what do you mean hope i want to get married that was what i had waited for but still i reacted carefully you mean an ad hoc marriage like the ones in the military service if you want that was her way of suggesting i try another tack this isnt the military service true id prefer a civilian marriage yes that was her way of agreeing we could arrange a suitable term if you wish i cut it short unable to hold back any longer what do you want helse i want anything you want till death do us part when helse loved i realized she loved completely now she was testing my love i hardly felt worthy but i was willing i knew i loved her absolutely and would never love another like this till death do us part i agreed and suffered a momentary spell of dizziness awed by the profundity of the commitment there were all kinds and lengths of marriages and this was the most binding oh lets do it now she exclaimed well it wouldnt be official without a priest i said she kissed me and my head spun again well do it by common law she said we can have a wedding it will be like a party for the children they can rehearse it and take partsand it will entertain the group while we travel and here she stopped and kissed me again passionately i had never before seen her so turned on and i liked it her love had been well worth waiting for maybe i had to love a younger man she said ive always been used by older men so i cant relate to them the same way but youyoure a virgin boy and youre all mine im yours i agreed overflowing with love for her i suppose her description of me as a virgin boy might have been taken as uncomplimentary yet i knew she didnt mean it to be so and it was true she had introduced me to love in all its forms outside the family love i had grown up with i dont know whether the harshness of our situation in the bubble had the effect of intensifying my emotion or whether i would have loved her as ardently anyway but certainly this was the most positive emotion of which my being was capable helse was older and far more experiencedbut i was the first man she had loved this way and that was enough and im yours she said i will be helse hubris the cumbersome double surnaming of our culture had gradually faded out in favor of the jupiter custom of using the masculine surname only helse hubris i agreed liking the alliteration liking the meaning liking every aspect of it you might think we would have made love then but we did not it could only have distracted us from the greater excitement of our engagement sex had always had a different meaning for us this was more vital we fetched spirit and put her in charge of operations she was delighted to participate she had it seemed gotten over her earlier jealousy of helse realizing that helse was no threat to our brothersister relationship indeed helse was not she had stabilized me during each crisis so that i was better able to help others including spirit yet i suspect i misjudged the nuances of spirits acceptance though i doubt i will ever be certain in what way the same emotional involvement that prevented me from using my talent to judge helse properly also interfered with my judgments of spirit of course i knew spirit she was my sister and closest companion and would never betray me in any way that was never in question still there may have been something the kids set it up with gusto they assembled stray bits of cloth into a wedding gown for helse and they made plans for a big cake these seemingly simple things were not simple in the bubble a choir formed and practiced singing the wedding march the problem of the lack of a priest was solved by working out a ceremony in which the two of us would exchange vows ourselves in the manner of the old quaker religion each speaking his or her piece and sealing the vow with a kiss that public kiss was very important the children planned to applaud it i found myself getting genuinely nervous they were making it too real too real that isnt what i meant to convey this was ultimately real this was the most solemn commitment of our lives maybe what i meant was that i did not want it to become too much of a show as if it were not genuine but weddings as i learned are not just for the nuptial couple the crowd must have its satisfaction too it took several days to put it all together and several major rehearsals spirit insisted that every single detail be right we worked up to full dress rehearsals orchestrating it right through to the kiss that kiss had to be right too the imps made us do it over and over just so not too long or too brief too intimate or too distant they even practiced their applause kids i learned the hard way though i really didnt mind this particular exercise despite helses tendency to break up with mirth in the middle of it are the worst sticklers in the universe for specific detail i wondered just what the difference was between a full dress rehearsal with all the participants and the official ceremony but knew better than to raise that question i suppose it was merely a matter of designation this one is a rehearsal that one is the production besides this was an excellent distraction from the tedium and grief we all would otherwise have had time to dwell on this was more than a wedding or a rehearsal for same it was group therapy so we didnt push the date we let the kids extend the rehearsals as long as they had a mind to helse looked wonderful in her homefashioned patchwork wedding dress she would have looked good to me in rags though i was in my space suit you see no one knew how to make a mans formal wedding outfit so spirit in her authoritative office of manager decreed that one suit was as good as another and insisted that i be garbed as a space captain on duty i even had to have the helmet on then ceremoniously i would tilt it back for the nuptial osculation i felt like an ancient knight in armor especially since the suit was decorated for camouflage embracing her was awkward not nearly as pleasant as it had been in nondress rehearsal where her body was all soft and feminine against mine and the inordinate laughter when one brat advised me to remove the suit on the wedding night because it didnt have the necessary attachmentthat actually made me blush which set the little fiends off anew but anything to make the kids happy and though i protested the unnecessary elaboration it was therapy for me too it made me really believe that helse would be mine forever we were amidst the umpteenth such rehearsal and i had just noticed that some mischiefmaker had pinned a label saying helse hubris to the gown so she would be able to remember her new name when the time came when our lookout sounded the alarm ship ahoy i felt dread suit up i told spirit and she scurried off to do it i was already suited coincidentally that was the lone silver lining in this cloud the other kids milled about uncertain what frame of mind to be in festive or frightened but soon they decided on both each fetched his or her weapon concealed it in the costume then returned to the wedding rehearsal this was stage one innocent children playing fine for them but i wasnt satisfied get suited i called to helse but someone needed to keep the children organized while spirit and i were busy with the air lock so helse elected to remain in her wedding dress if a pirate attacked her spirit would blow the whistle i didnt like this as helse in that gown was entirely too attractive but understood the need even so i would have argued but there simply wasnt time i was the nominal leader of the bubble but already i had learned that leadership exists largely with the consent of the followers and that compromise is essential and that the true will of the majority must always be taken seriously so i sealed up my suit and made sure spirit was ready to seal hers after blowing her whistle if it came to that we were ready for whatever might come the ship closed on us matched velocities and connected to our front portal as i watched it occurred to me that the mechanism of a ship and a bubble was very like that of a man and a woman the ship was long and slender resembling a phallus while the bubble was round in the manner of aspects of a woman and all too often the roles became ferociously literal the ship took hold and made an entry i thought as i heard the clang of merging locks the bubble had to receive sometimes this connection was pleasant for both parties but sometimes disaster for the bubble perhaps there is a fundamental parallelism in all things if we could but perceive it the air lock opened and the men came inand they did look like pirates i stood behind the baffle watching my hands sweating inside the gauntlets of the suit spirit had her hand on the whistle how well we knew how serious this could be what have we here the lead intruder demanded he could have passed for redbeard we are children seeking sanctuary helse informed him prettily our parents were killed by horrible pirates we are orphans in the void i hoped she wasnt overdoing it though her words were literally true for everyone except herself i had my helmet on but in the ambience of air could hear reasonably well i could also see them by peering though the partially filled netting of the doughnut hole that was between us the man eyed her appraisingly this was the first time helse had stood before a stranger to the bubble in her female guise oh i worried no women except you none she assured him innocently the man consulted the one beside him who could have passed for bluebeard slim pickings here whats the current market for children theres connections for small ones bluebeard said and girls of any age are in demand id say take all the girls and dump the boys good enough redbeard strode toward helse but this one well use ourselves here and now they were pirates all right i had a momentary vision of my sister faith spread out by the horse spirit blew the whistle she had probably seen the same vision we would not let helse suffer that fate pandemonium erupted the children drew their weapons and swarmed over the pirates their reactions were amazingly swift and sure maybe the smaller bodies of children permit faster interplay of the nervous systems never in all the entertainment projections i have viewed in maraud including historical recreations of ancient wars have i seen such a savage turn of events those children were absolutely vicious it was as if all the pain and horror of the past month was being released in fifteen seconds they scored oh they scored in a moment the men were screaming and blood was flowing blinded some men staggered around hands at their faces the blood leaking through their fingers others dropped to the deck clasping their crotches redbeard reeled back blood cascading from the side of his head where his ear had been he had suffered a near miss three children stalked him like rabid puppies their knives raised their teeth gleaming it was nightmare but it seemed that we had won i had underestimated the effectiveness of our ploy but we had reckoned without the resources of the pirate ship a new man appeared in the lock carrying a solid squat device take him out spirit screamed now half a dozen children turned well understanding the threat of an unknown weapon we needed ho pacifier here they charged the new pirate like little kamikazes but he was ready he pulled the trigger and the thing burped something splatted against the body of the nearest charging child it looked like brown taffy but it spread out tentacles as it struck wrapping around the body pinning the limbs the child fell bound by strong elastic bands three other children were close the taffy gun burped again catching each and the elastic enfolded each one child tried to cut the strands that enclosed him but there were too many though he severed two his arm remained bound by those he couldnt reach in time he might have worked his way loose but everything was happening in seconds this was a personnel control device incapacitating without hurting and it was effective the pirate swung the taffy gun around and the children everywhere paused realizing that they were overmatched more men appeared from the pirate ship take your pick the one with the gun said to them no sense wasting taffy on brats were going to kill anyway the other men drew knives and advanced on the children none of them seemed to care about the wounded pirates of the first wave who were moaning and in some cases dying helse turned to face me do it hope she cried and bolted for our cell where her suit was the pirate at the air lock aimed his gun and fired helse fell wrapped in taffy naturally they intended to salvage her i started back from the rear lock appalled but helse screamed from the floor do it dont wait for me do it or well all die i knew she was right the other children were scurrying for their suits and the new pirates were starting after them wary about ambushtraps i had to do my part and do it immediately or everything would be lost i could not fight off the pirates here or even rescue helse i didnt even have my laser pistol with which i might have taken out the pirate with the taffy gun then we could have turned it against the other pirates andbut this was foolish dreaming already the brutes were methodically stabbing the children they had caught we were at war i entered the lock glancing at spirit grimly she nodded standing beside the old drive unit her hand near the switch for the new one she was ready practice had made perfect quickly i worked the lock and moved out onto the hull anchored by my safety line i was afraid of the void but i had rehearsed this and knew exactly what i was doing i braced myself and the drive cut off on schedule and i dived across and anchored my rope on the nearest eyelet the drive came on again a wall of flame as seen from this vantage spirits timing was perfect now no one could follow me or stop me the tricky part was past i clambered around the hull carrying my massive wrench then i was at the key tank exactly as rehearsed i lifted the wrench ready to bash off the one nut holding it i froze the realization hit me now with full force helse was not in her suit caught by the taffy she could not get to it if i let the air out of the bubble she would die but if i didnt do this we would be subject to the will of the pirates last time they had raped and killed i visualized a pirate raping helse as the horse had raped my sister faith then my minds eye saw bluebeard slitting helses throat i knew this was not only possible but likely helse forgive me i cried in my helmet then i swung with all my clumsy force half hoping it wouldnt work the wrench caught the nut squarely and bashed it off the tank released without first having its pressure abated crashed out of its slot like a missile being fired i was thrown back and flew out into space myself this i hadnt rehearsed of course i had always stopped short of the final bash the last thing i saw before i lost consciousness was the plume of freezing vapor and debris from the bubble i fancied some of it was red red from the blood of my beloved whom i had sworn never to hurt chapter female mystique spacespirit was tending me when i woke i clutched at her arm was it all a dream i demanded desperately i wish i could lie to you to give you ease my brother spirit said i saw the marks of tears on her face and on her soul it was no dream helse dead the confirmation was no longer a shock i had known my love was dead i had killed her hope you must seal it off the way you did for the others we need you to pull us through otherwise helses sacrifice is for nothing remember she told you to do it she knew there was only one thing worse than losing helse and that was losing what she had fought for she had died as bravely as any of the other women had she had indeed known and had not faltered i cast about for something to lean on that would support my failing equilibrium and found it in an oath i shall extirpate piracy from humanity i swore i had not honored my oath never to hurt helse but if i lived i would somehow honor this one i had no notion how or when but i would do it from that point i strengthened helse had been my support before now it was spirit spirit was stronger than i i do not pretend this was steady or sensible i gyrated wildly but when i screamed with grief spirit understood and when i was lucid she talked with me and when i could function she encouraged me my oath and spirit these were the pillars of stability during my nightmare sequence the wildest tempests of my confusion and grief beat about these pillars and did not topple them and in time i was able to function again i may be presenting this as more coherent than it was i am human i seek to flatter myself and tend to avoid what damages my selfimage however much i try to be objective so if this narrative is a construct of favorable distortions it is as it must be in order to exist at all this narrative is itself therapy clarifying the elements of my existence and thereby enabling me to accept them with lesser abrasion than otherwise my talent is judgment of others to this degree i try to judge myself however suspect my result may be so i may record a somewhat enhanced version of my nadir and wish it had been so without a certain amount of beneficial illusion very few people would survive i put away my grief for necessary periods and did what had to be done and gradually these portions of equilibrium lengthened i helped the survivors bury the dead on the hull all except helse others did that for i could not look upon her ravaged face they buried her in her wedding gown saving only the little cloth tag with the name helse hubris that they gave to me as the final physical memento helse had loved me at the last this tag was the evidence of that and its value magnified accordingly o my love my love it was not to save yourself you died it was to save me for you were not afraid of rape but of my wild reaction to it and so i killed you indirectly as well as directly because you knew me too well too well i thought i loved you with the ultimate devotion possible but your capacity was greater than mine and your love was better than mine we cleaned up the blood and excrements of explosive decompression very little of it had escaped the bubble for the aperture of loss had been narrow not permitting the egress of substantial solid bodies little items like pencils and combs were lost bodies and food packs remained this was messy but just as well for we needed our supplies spirit of course had unjammed the valve in the head and allowed the air tanks to repressure the bubble before she went out to haul me in on my line from where i dangled in space she had cut the drive for that duration so that she could work alone i marvel still at her courage and competence in that adversity i owe my life as well as my equilibrium to her she was in this instance a twelveyearold adult only eight of us survived spirit and me and those six children who had reached their suits in time i remember their names but prefer to leave them anonymous i do not care to put a name to each individual aspect of my pain our rehearsed plan had gone astray because of the interference of the pirates i dont know how we could have prevented that since we had no knowledge of the taffy gun perhaps i should have anticipated the unexpected and kept my laser pistol ready but it had very little charge left and the crisis occurred so suddenly interrupting our wedding rehearsali dont even know whether such excuses are valid certainly i could have done more had i thought it through better still our final stage had been effective that was another part of the guilt i bore i had killed more children than the pirates had as nearly as we could figure it they had slaughtered fifteen the vacuum had strangled twentytwo but we had taken the pirate ship with us their air lock had been locked to ours fixed open our vacuum had become theirs all fortyfive pirates were dead their losses were greater than ours oh yes we had struck backbut it had been a pyrrhic victory we could not afford another such battle after we cleaned out our dead and said what perfunctory services for them we could we did the same for the pirate deadwith less honor we dumped them in a chamber of their ship then we searched that ship throughout much of it was ordinary stuff clothing food knickknacks but some of it was booty from other vessels gold precious stones spices fine watches and small sealed containers marked with letters of the alphabet c h l a i considered the last trying to figure out what the letters might stand for but spirit solved it drugs she exclaimed of course pirates are into the illegal drug trade these letters stand for english abbreviations cocaine heroin lsd angel dust now i saw it their real business would be shipping this stuff they only raid bubbles like ours for entertainment she was uncertain why mess with poor refugees when they can buy anything they want they obviously are rich excellent question it put me in mind of helses qyv mystery o helse i reeled spirit steadied me and i fought back to sanity helse had been used to convey a message of some kind perhaps to a pirateand here were pirates shipping drugs and seeking children was there a connection we can go back to the bubble spirit suggested mindful of my fadeout no wed better finish this job i said only two of the other children were with us here the remaining four were sleepsuffering in their cells all of us understood that need they had lost siblings and close friends and most of their peer group and the pseudofamily structure we had so carefully nurtured had been shattered helse had become like a mother to themhelse helseand so they had been orphaned again when already vulnerable oh yes i knew that feeling but i had to function and i had in spirit a support of amazing strength a childwoman who perhaps at this stage was more truly our leader than was i we need to take what supplies we need and cast loose we dont know how to operate this ship supplies we dont need mindzonking drugs weapons i said we are so few now we must have good weapons and replacement oxygen tanks for ours have been depleted by the decompression oh yes she agreed seeing it we located weapons including another taffy gunthe other had been swept into the head by the decompression and brokenand brought back to the bubble several good laser pistols and a whole pile of good fighting knives we found oxygen and nitrogen tanks and plenty of fresh water then we spied food supplies better and more varied than ours this derelict ship was a real mine of useful things we were now well setexcept that at this point we were just a few children ranged against what seemed like a universe of pirates the great majority of our refugee companions who had set out for a better world had found death instead even if we arrived at leda and gained sanctuary without further difficulty it would hardly be worth it for the survivors let alone the nonsurvivors true success was now beyond our reachthanks to the pirates i remembered my oath to extirpate all pirates they surely deserved obliteration we also discovered a holo projector and a small library of cartridges this was an excellent find we could have entertainment to distract us from the horrors of our memories we trundled the projector into the bubble finally we found a lifeboat fully stocked we could certainly use this we lacked the expertise to operate it but we would have time to study and experiment we couldnt move it by hand so we used rope to tie it to the bubble hoping to haul it clear of the pirate ship when we separated we had to string our lines so that they did not intercept the blast of the drive unit we used three hooked all around our equator each trailing back a hundred meters to intersect at the lifeboat if that didnt work then it didnt work at last we cut loose the pirate ship was now adrift its lifesupport facilities repressuring it automatically and warming it when the air lock sealed but with no living men aboard there would be a stink in there soon enough maybe it would drift forever in spaceor maybe some other ship would discover it then they might ponder the mystery of an operative ship that had lost its entire crew to suffocation we knew that such mystery ships had been found before for we had seen stories about them now we had an answer in this one case the rabbit had killed the wolf we moved on through space alone trailing the lifecraft on its triple tether i had to do more of the work of maintenance and navigation for we had lost key personnel i had a lot of learning to do but that was good for it kept me almost too busy to think the kids eagerly set up the holo projector and tried a cartridge marked animal fun we thought it might be a juvenile fantasy about animals or a documentary on the ways of wildlife as it once had been on unspoiled earth either way excellent distraction for children the scene formed a threedimensional image in air that could be viewed from any side it was a comely young woman and a donkey good enough the riding of animals was a popular subject with children the few equine animals on callisto were always in great demand for twominute rides but in a moment the kids delight turned to dismay i left my position by the lens control to see what was the matter the woman in the image had stripped naked andwell no need to detail it further it was a porn show i should have realized that pirates would stock that sort if our bubble had been filled with animals instead of people the brutes would have been raping and killing the animals hardly noticing the difference turn it off i said disgusted check all through the cartridges maybe there are some regular family shows in the pile but now that the children realized that this was supposed to be forbidden adult material they got interested they wanted to know exactly how a woman could do it with a donkey and why she would bother i gave up and returned to my station not caring to admit that i was curious too actually i needed no hardcore holos for my forbidden entertainment it came to me unbidden when i slept some dreams were inchoate almost formless fragments of horror that seeped out of the locked chambers of my mind like oozing blood and invaded that lonely illuminated spot of consciousness where i huddled it had been bad when my father died and when my mother died but helse had braced my equilibrium now helse herself was dead and all the shock of loss she had shielded me against by interposing her marvelous love now swept down on me in an avalanche of sulfur i tossed about and scrambled and wokeand found the waking nightmare was as bad as the sleeping one i had come to depend almost completely on helse on the love we shared and she was there no more i retreated from that reality into sleepwhere the oozing blood and sulfur lava were assuming shapes more awful than the shapelessness had been i screamed again i dont know how many times i cycled through it before helse came i must have been in an inbetween state of consciousness for i knew she was dead but she was welcome any way she chose to appear what brings you back i inquired almost socially hope i finally realized she said realized what i asked knowing this was crazy that it was no more than a vision like the one involving my father but so eager for her presence that i clung to whatever shred of interaction it offered about the tattoo why it protected me it identified me as a courier a courier i didnt follow her line of thought i was conveying something to kife something very valuable and secret so i had his name and the mark so no one would interfere with me it is death to mess with a courier and every criminal knows it kife must be very high in the hierarchy of thieves so i was safer than i thought i probably didnt need to masquerade as a boy im glad you did i said that way i got to room with you and to love you you are the first i loved she said but about the tattooyou can protect yourself too hope draw the letters on your thigh and when a pirate attacks you but im no courier i protested they wont know that they wont dare take the chance i think kife would destroy anyone who bothered even a fake courier just to make his point of course then the fake would have to settle with kife that might not be fun what were you carrying i asked the man gave you no message now i remember something i heard once she said becoming more real and lovely moment by moment she wore her patchwork wedding dress and oh i loved her with an agony of intensity they do not tell the couriers what they carry so the couriers cant give away the secret it is carried in little bags that they swallow which adhere to the lining of the intestine and can only be detached by a certain formula in solution so when the courier arrives he or she is given a drink and the bag is freed and passes on out harmlessly the bags can hold anythingdiamonds secret code messages concentrated drugsbut whatever it is kife wants it and only he has the formula to collect it without hurting the courier now my own memory confirmed what she was saying i had heard about this long ago and forgotten it so you were engaged in criminal activity i cried appalled perhaps drugrunning hope i didnt know she protested of course you didnt i agreed immediately hating to hurt her even in death kife used you exactly as the pirates used the others they must have fed me the bag while i was unconscious she said and when i got to jupiter kife would have collected she cut that off im glad he wont collect dont let him get my body hope i wont let him get your body i promised thank you she began to fade wait i cried i must apologize i promised never to hurt youbut i killed you i forgive you she said smiling i know you didnt want to kill me she faded further dont go i cried leaping to catch her stay with me helse to love and be loved that got to her of course in life or in death in reality or in vision she lived to share love she reversed her fade and intensified and became preternaturally natural and suffered herself to be drawn in to me i kissed her and she hesitated as she often had being afraid to confess love but i kissed her more passionately and then she melted as was also her way knowing she could trust me not to betray her not to betray her i had killed her but she caught my mood and took me in her arms as i started to draw away and comforted me i told you to do it hope to let the air out she said we had rehearsed it it had to be done i love you hope and i love you i said we proceeded to the natural act of love and she was a little unresponsive as though it was harder to do this in death but i took it slowly and it finished well enough her body did not even feel cold it was warm and soft and in the end she was moving with me hugging me as if there had never been any gulf between us then i slept and the turmoil of my dreams eased as it always did when helse comforted me i woke alone of course but i knew i had not been alone my visiondream had become too real the culmination too complete one of the distinctions between illusion and reality is the element of surprise of things happening not precisely as expected and i had had that experience helse had been with me i lay there and thought about it helse had been with me in spirit of course but not in body her body was frozen in a bag on the hull yet there had been a body i was sure of that a man may dream of love and of sex and his body may respond to the point of nocturnal emissionbut the experience helse had given me while she lived enabled me to know the distinction between fantasy love and reality for one thing there was no stain of emission in my clothing as there should be in fantasy sex there had been a physical girl with me i thought helse was dead and i surely had not visited her on the hull so if not helse who who had shared that physical expression of the longing of the spirit spirit that was my sisters name i recoiled from the thought disgusted but it seeped back at me refusing to be banished merely because it was detestable had helse been with mein spirit my nightmares of darkness paled as the nightmare of day came forward more strongly in my agony of loss i had suffered a vision as it seems i was wont to do i could have acted out that vision physically i should have known there was something wrong about it while it was happening but reason is not my strong point when im hallucinating i had not understood the message from my father at the time and i had not understood the significance of helses warmth and solidity and seeming unfamiliarity with the act i could not entirely condemn myself for my ignorance of the moment spirit howeverhow well did i understand her motives if she had been present as she could have been she would have been awake she loved me as a sister but she had been jealous of helse she had inquired about the nature of what helse and i did together i had explained to her the distinction between voluntary and involuntary sexbut did she appreciate the distinction between woman and girl or between romantic love and family love if she saw me hallucinating and heard me crying out for helse and she thought she saw a way to come to my rescue as she had when i fought a manwhat would she do i fought against it but could not completely deny the conclusion that spirit could have done it i was not sure that she had done it just that she could have emotionally and physically that perhaps she would have i really could not judge her reaction in this respect she was inscrutable opaque to my talent the only way to know was to ask her i sat upand spirit heard me and came to the cell i opened my mouth to ask herand could not speak i was abruptly aware how preposterous my question was are you all right hope she asked solicitously she was neatly dressed in blouse and pants her fine dark hair brushed out and she seemed well rested i realized that she had not suffered the loss i had once she had come to terms with the fact of our orphaning my support had been helse who was now gone spirits support was me had she or hadnt she i had to know yet could not ask she landed lithely on the floor of the cell low gravity made such acrobatics easy yet she seemed healthy enough and she was maturing her blouse did not conceal her nascent breasts and her pants fit her tightly enough to reveal a developing posterior she had a distance to go yet she was definitely on the way she would be a handsome girl in due course perhaps not beautiful the way faith had been but certainly enough to please any man had she already pleased a man damn it i had to know spirit i said were you with me when i slept hope i will always be with you she replied we are family no i mean she looked at me with disconcerting directness was it a stare of challenge you mean what i mean with me when when you screamed for helse why did the way grow more difficult the closer i got yes hope i tried to hold you down so you wouldnt hurt yourself i knew you were having a bad dream you were banging on the wall the way you did after father died finally i got you quiet and then i left you i had to check the lenses how had she quieted me i knew how helse had done it did ihurt you you cant hurt me hope that was no comfort it was what helse had said the first time we made love i mean she took my hand squeezing it gently as i had squeezed hers when i explained the different types of sex hope i am your sister i will do anything i have to to keep you safe i would die for you as helse did does anything else matter she was not giving me any direct answer she would die for me i believed it she would more readily do lesser things by her definitions other things did matterbut did they matter to her the same way they did to me there are things you must not do for me spirit her gaze was innocent like what like but i choked again like lying to you she asked ask me anything hope i wont lie wouldnt she i wasnt sure to her a lie was a lesser thing than death if she believed a lie would safeguard my mental health she would probably use it again i realized that spirit was made of tougher fiber than i was i found i could not pursue this matter furtherfor fear she would lie to me or that she would not you are my sister i said squeezing her hand always she kissed my cheek then she was off again running the bubble i knew i would never know the answer to my question perhaps i did not want to know did it matter really spirit was one terrific sister who it seemed understood how to do what was necessary and how to conceal what was necessary she had learned such arts from her mother she had just faced me and backed me down and i could not fault her for it could i afford to let my courage be less than hers i climbed out of the cell and went to help her run the bubble chapter pirate treasure space we traveled another period settling into routine it wasnt that we mourned our lost ones less but that there was nothing to do but go on and to keep ourselves busy so as to keep the nightmares away even if we hadnt been out in blank space away from the jupiter ecliptic in peril for our lives if we miscalculated the vectors of the enormous reaches of space we would have had to keep ourselves active until the specters faded there were few pirates out here for this was off the travel lane we almost missed them but we had set up another refuse tank for quickvacuum just in case however we were not left long to our own devices yet another ship overhauled us our luck had changed and we wished it hadnt this almost certainly meant more trouble we set up as before except that we cut our crew of innocents to two so the other six could have a better chance to survive the decompression we didnt like taking losses but had to play out our play if only to lull the pirates so our trap could spring we knew we had a defense that worked and we didnt want to compromise it the ship docked the lock opened and the first pirate entered i could not see around the curve of the commons since i was stationed right at the rear lock and our doughnuthole chamber was well restocked with supplies obscuring my line of sight but i heard them spirit was halfway around able to see both locks spirit blew the whistle the two children attacked i heard the scuffle hey what i demanded amazed there had not been time to ascertain the intentions of the intruders its the horse spirit hissed move hope the horse i stood frozen remembering the rape of my sister faith i had sworn to kill that man the men caught the children before suffering more than scratches and disarmed them two children could not attack five or six men with the same effect possible for thirty children attacking the same number we should have realized that the sounds penetrated my consciousness as if from a distance the horse come to our bubble again do it spirit snapped and closed her helmet that finally jogged me out of my stasis i closed my own helmet and jumped into the air lock already the pirates were coming around the commons and spirit was backing toward the drivecontrol panel almost tripping over the old small drive unit parked beside it i closed the lock decompressed it opened the outer panel and swung out ready to cross when the drive cut off we would lose two this time the innocents who would not be able to get to their suits they had known the risk and it had to be done i waitedbut the drive did not cut off at last i realized that the pirates had caught spirit before she could use the panel i had no way to cross the ring of fire that was the drive with the old small columnar drive there would have been no problem or we could simply have cut off the new one when the pirates docked so many little things we could have donebut it was now too late we could not spring our trap then i remembered something else and that made me feel worse yet we had weapons nowlasers and the taffy gun why hadnt we thought to use them one kid behind that gun shooting taffy at the pirateswe had never needed to go the vacuum route at all what had possessed us to overlook that grief and shock that was what we had had the sense to fetch the weapons but then had lapsed into our suffering and had never done the hard intellectual work of devising a new strategy of defense what a colossal error even spirit had missed it there was nothing to do but go back inside bad luck and poor planning had foiled our grand play maybe i could get to the taffy gun yet however it galled me that it should be the horse who had us at his mercy a second time the one who had initiated our descent into horror objectively i knew he was not the worst of pirates he was a rapist and robber and opportunist but not a wanton killer but he was a symbol in my mind and he had to be destroyed for the sake of my sister faith now i realized i might see him rape my sister spirit unless i found a way to get at one of our power weapons so as to take him out i reentered the main bubble the horse was there his laser pistol pointed at my midriff he was garbed exactly as i remembered him black shirt yellow pantaloons brightred sash and broad buccaneer hatall of it worn and dirty he stank the same too no wonder they called him the horse we were all captive exactly as before all our savage experience seemed to have changed nothing they bound us and set us in a line against the wall of the commons near one of the operative heads the two innocents were somewhat battered but the others werent hurt spirit and i had been removed from our space suits no hope of escaping to the hull now but maybe some chance would come to get to a weapon i shifted my wrists two pirates had bound us with lengths of rope about the crossed wrists and crossed ankles they had a light touch and had made the knots only tight enough to hold us effectively not enough to interfere with the circulation in our extremities they obviously knew what they were doing i didnt recognize either of thembut of course we had seen so many pirates since our first encounter that they tended to fuzz in my memory but for what it was worth i didnt think these particular two had raped faith while i thought the two standing with the horse had done so that provided me with a set of priorities whom to attack first when i had the opportunity the interrogation began where were all our other people how did we get the pirate weapons and supplies where were we going since we were now spiraling away from jupiter and out of the ecliptic the horse knew there was something strange about us and he sought to turn it to his advantage i realized that he was basically a scavenger seeking whatever other pirates had missed we did not answer him we all remembered his prior visit we owed him nothing then we shall do it the harder way the horse said im not much for torture and killing but i do like to turn a profit and i dont like being balked he looked us over you he said pointing to me youre the oldest and as i recall you had a fine piece of a sister youve managed to hide somewhere you will answer my questions i remained silent it was the only way i could get back at him at the moment he pointed at spirit strip her he said the two pirates beside him went over and hauled my little sister out untied her and ripped off her clothing though she struggled and tried to bite and scratch then they held her upright and naked before us the horse studied her not quite old enough he said with evident regret another year and shell be fine but i dont get my kicks from children anyway that wont make this kid talk it didnt before well have to go the other way he drew his knife i broke out in clammy sweat i had somehow been braced for rape much as i detested the notion but this was worse he was going to torture spirit the horse faced me this is your sister by the look of her put her in your clothes and she could be your little brother i dont want to have to hurt her but i will if you dont talk i ask you once will you tell me everything i want to know he wont spirit exclaimed guided by her i remained silent maybe the pirate was bluffing trying to scare me into talking the horse sighed okay well start with a finger he grabbed spirits left hand and wrestled with it until he had hold of her smallest finger while the two other pirates held her legs and other arm preventing her from struggling effectively it struck me how similar this process was to rape then without ceremony he brought the knife up and sliced into the base of her finger near the knuckle spirit screamed with eardeadening intensity and wrenched with all her strength but the pirate hung on and kept carving blood spattered out i rolled over trying to break my bonds and the children on either side of me started crying they had been toughened to the wounds of combat but this was different i could not get free i landed on my side my head on the deck something landed before my nose i stared crosseyed at it it was about five centimeters long and tattered at one end it was spirits little finger i looked up my eyes hazed by tears of shock and fury i saw and heard spirit sobbing her hand covered with her own blood i ask you again the horse said grinning are you ready to talk now i knew he wasnt bluffing he would keep cutting off parts of spirit until she died then he would start on another child what did it matter what he knew of the adventures of our bubble we had no secrets worth dying for but i tried one more thing kife i said suddenly i had the complete attention of all the pirates so youre into that are you the horse asked licking his lips all right show me the mark and ill turn you loose i have no mark i said i hadnt thought to mark myself and probably that wouldnt have been convincing since it wouldnt have been a tattoo a lie would get me nowhere and i really didnt have much taste for lies anyway lies were for pirates and scions the horse squinted at me cannily not everyone knows this but i do theres always a mark thats to stop impostors from making claims if you cant show me the mark youve got no claim and even with the mark you cant protect anyone else youre the only one exempt so show it and ill put you in that lifeboat youre towing and send you off and ill interrogate someone else here the trouble with the horse was that he was canny my bluff had failed i couldnt save spirit anyway let my sister go and ill tell you everything i said capitulating i wont let her go but ill let her be the horse said he gestured to the pirates holding spirit and they let go her arms and stooped to bind her ankles crying brokenly preoccupied with her mutilated hand she did not try to escape and of course it wouldnt have done any good if she had she tried to put her fist in her mouth but the blood was still flowing and she only smeared it on her cheek oh spirit better had they raped you one of the pirates who had tied us went over and gave her a bandanna and she wadded it against the stump all the fight had gone from her they put a blanket over her and let her sit down and she huddled in it the pain was evidently diminishingbut never again would she have that finger i swore again to myself to kill the horse who had savaged both my sistersbut until i had the chance to do that i would have to cooperate i could not watch spirit be tortured any more i talked i told the pirates everything summarizing our entire misadventure in the bubble the horse was especially interested in the qyv aspect and the body of the courier is frozen on the hull he asked yes i agreed shortly so you were the one who killed her not a pirate yes which means you will have to settle with kife i hadnt thought of that i suppose so i said resenting the very fact of agreement with him if i ever encountered kife however i knew it would not be amicable the horse smiled i will make sure you go free then i wouldnt care to be the one to deprive kife of his vengeance hes an ugly one he pondered still i understand those couriers carry some really good stuff wed better take a look at it no one of the other pirates exclaimed its death to mess with with a dead courier the horse asked whose body will be lost in space tied to a drifting bubble i think even kife knows where to cut his losses hell deal with her killer and let it go at that i dont know the other pirate said thats why im the leader here the horse said ill take the responsibility ill never have another chance to see exactly what a courier carries it occurred to me that if the horse let me go and kife caught up with me kife would learn from me of the horses part in this then the horse would be marked for vengeance too i had killed helse to save the bubble the horse would be interfering with the privileged material itself surely the horse realized this therefore he probably intended to kill me and the other children once he had all the information we could provide so we couldnt implicate him if kife tracked the bubble without any living witnesses he would discover that the great majority of the refugees including helse had died in prior encounters with pirates there would be no evidence that the horse had ever intercepted the bubble a second time he could probably get away with it it all depended on our being dead i had to kill himto save us all but still i had no way under the horses direction two pirates suited up and scrounged on the hull for helses body it took them some time for there were many bodies there and they had to inspect each one naked for the mark i had told them helse was female but evidently they werent sure of me so checked males too just in case actually it was probably hard to tell until the corpses were pretty well stripped anyway they found her and brought her inside the bubble i had never looked at helse after her death now i had to this i think is the most visceral grievance i have against the horse i had known helse was dead intellectually but some part of my romantic mind had remained hopeful that she might live now no part of my mind could doubt any longer my last faintly fond illusion had been banished the utter bleakness of reality took its chill hold on my soul i looked terribly compelled it was appalling they had cut away her wedding dress and brought her in naked she was not pretty at all in this state she was frozen like a statue her eyeballs and tongue protruding grotesquely her body bloated by the decompression that had occurred before it froze i would not have recognized her at all if i had not known it was her but it was the aspects of familiarity loomed larger as i slowly perceived them her brown hair her breasts the qyv mark at her thighoh helse the woman i had loved they tried to cut her open but she was like rock they had to thaw herand that was the worst thing of all we had thawed the bodies of our men for foodbut the adult women had handled that concealing it from the children as much as possible and i had not cared to watch but i understood that they had selectively heated only those portions they intended to carve leaving the main part of each body intact a leg for example could be heated and even cooked to a certain extent while on the bone and when it was soft enough to carve the edible flesh was stripped and the stillfrozen remainder of the body was taken back out to the hull helse in contrast was being thawed entire this was a much slower and uglier process for they did not use fire for fear of destroying what it was they sought the container anchored to her intestine in fact it took several days as i reckon it for the body to thaw to their satisfaction for the ice in the central body cavity melted very slowly for all that time we had to wait and watch tied and guarded by the pirates they released us periodically to eat and drink one at a time and to use the head but watched us so closely that we never had a chance to escape even poor spirit a shadow of her former vitality was permitted to rummage for bandaging material and replacement clothing only under the eye of a pirate she searched inefficiently unlike her normal manner and found nothing suitable and finally had to settle for soft underclothing from her own belongings she fastened these garments clumsily against the stump of her finger and anchored them to her hand with elastic so that it looked as if her whole hand had been amputated she refused to take any pirate painkiller for that was marked h my heart went out to her in her misery and agony but i was helpless she was so pale i knew the loss of blood had hurt her i couldnt even talk to her couldnt comfort her my little sister was dying in her sad way before my eyes the strength i had perceived in her was gone defeat and pain had robbed her of it even the two halfway decent pirates seemed sorry for her we slept at irregular intervals while the ice melted though we felt the chill of it as the air in the vicinity lost its heat in the contact with the deep deep freeze of space there was nothing else for us to do my mind ran over every possible plan to escape but all foundered in the face of the reality of being both bound and watched i wondered why they were taking the trouble to keep us alive for this period and could only conclude it was for further questioning in case some new mystery arose in connection with the couriers body the horse was a thinker in his fashion he did not discard things before he was quite finished with them including lives that made him more dangerous than the more directly brutal pirates once the capsule was recovered and opened our lives would be surplus so the thawing of helse was in fact a countdown on our own lives and when the chill of her body had dissipated the chill of our bodies would commence when i slept i dreamed and it was not fun i seemed to march through an inchoate crowd of faceless people all walking toward the brink of a yellow sulfur cliff all stepping over it and falling to their doom only i could perceive the oncoming disaster and i tried to talk to them to urge them to stop and turn about but they did not seem to hear me i discovered that they were roped together and i was roped with them my hands bound together i was being carried over the cliff too i woke sweating in the cold i was indeed roped along with the others and we faced the slowly warming body and smelled its faint but growing aroma we were approaching that cliff of doom and the dream was no fantasy but a rendering of reality my dreams or visions had a disturbing propensity that way i looked covertly at the pirate guarding us but he was alert no chance there i slept again huddling into myself and thought i woke to find the guard sleeping and nudged myself over to him and managed to get my fingers on his knife he woke then and opened his mouth to scream but i had the knife and my bonds unraveled before its blade and i brought it up and stabbed him in the face and saw the blood geysering out of his nose splashing across my hands which looked oddly like spirits hands and i woke and it was only sweat on my hands and the guard remained alert next time i dreamed i slipped my bonds and made a noose of the rope flung it about the head and neck of the guard and garroted him mercilessly watching his eyes and tongue bulge out of his head and it felt good it gave me a feeling of power to do that to himbut i woke and it was the head of my beloved helse my gaze was fixed on not the garroted pirate still she thawed i dwelt on that for a while compulsively helse was dead and my heart with her and now her body was becoming more of a horror to me than her death itself had been she had at least died quickly and probably not suffered much decompression in space horrible as it may look is about as clean a demise as a person could seek i understand consciousness is lost in the first second so the rest is never felt now she was being restored in a fashion and her restoration would destroy us all i felt anger frustration guilt and grief for her death but had to some extent confined these emotions before they ravaged me beyond recovery i knew that any breakdown on my part could lead to death for all of us so had not had the luxury of prolonged grieving but as i watched her body slowly soften it all came back with appalling and gruesome force all that we had suffered in the bubblewas it worth it could it ever be worth it or would it have been better if we all had died in that case the horse would be doing us a favor when he killed us ironically i drifted to sleep again and dreamed of my family alive as they were at the beginning of this travail and i was explaining to my father how i wanted to marry helse but he was perplexed because he thought she was a boy no she is a girl i said not even wondering how it was he did not know when he had known before and had told my mother and i drew off her clothing so he could see but what was revealed was not the sweet soft shapely flesh of the living woman but the cold hard horror of the corpse and i stared in shockand was awake again my eyes fixed on the reality waking was no escape from nightmare where had it all gone wrong how could i have avoided the unmitigated horror of this outcome i knew the answer i should have avoided contact with the scion in maraud that had been the start of the whole terrible chain of events had i only drawn my sister faith aside hidden her from viewyet this scion had come looking for us having seen faith before how could i have prevented that i simply was not competent to deal with the problem i had faced incompetence there was the root of it had i had competence i would have found a way to alleviate the situation had i had more experience or had a more knowledgeable person been there to guide me but now i realized that if i had somehow dissuaded the scion without offending him so that the crisis had never occurred it would have solved only part of the problem we the hubris family would have survived never having to take the bubble offplanetbut all the other refugees would have proceeded as before helse would have been aboard and had to seek another roommate and perhaps had trouble from the outset and the pirates still would have raided and raped and murdered and the jupiter patrol still would have rejected the refugees the end would have been the same death for all on the bubble including helse one way or another and i would never have met her and loved her and she never would have loved me a fantasy that saved my family without saving helse was no good it was not the scion i had to settle with it was the pirates i slept again and dreamed of the end of this dread sequence the thawing was complete and the fell pirate horse reached his gross dirty hairy hand up between helses spread thighs into her soft body raping her with his hand for raping was his business and rammed his gross fist around and around inside there while she struggled against the pirates holding her arms and legs and at last with a gloating gasp of satisfaction pulled out what was inside her it was large and green and shaped like a baby the baby i had planted in her but no it was not mine it was kifes he had raped her first putting in her the seed of her destruction putting his brand on her tender body i had a vengeance to make against qyv could i but survive to pursue it this whole pirate trade using and abusing innocent people now the capsule as the horse held it up to the light in lustful victory was small its proper size in my dream i was not concerned about such superficial changes of reality the pirates small eyes gleamed as he viewed the prize the ultimate pirate treasure the burden of the courier what did that container contain and i was curious too and guilty for that curiosity for by experiencing it i seemed to be supporting the death of my beloved even as my bodily reaction at the time of the rape of faith had seemed to support that act even in my private mind where i could conjecture freely i could not find an answer to my guilt how much better to have helse alive and leave the mystery intact i had no right to want to see the content of that capsule yet i did the horse broke it open and an object fell out a blob of something soft like mud green mud it fell on the body and spread out across the flesh like taffy the horse fearing to lose it tried to pick it up but it broke apart and part of it adhered to his fingers he stared at his hand watching his fingers dissolve and i realized that the green blob was a living thing some kind of alien being that fed on human flesh and now was consuming both the corpse and the pirate it had been quiescent until freed from the confining capsule now there would be no stopping it it would gorge until they were both gone the dead woman and the living man and then it would start on the rest of us already a pseudopod of it was extending across the deck toward me i woke in a new sweat and nothing had changed the body still thawed the odor of it slowly intensifying the dread cold still reaching out to touch me and the pirate guard still watched the horse and one of the other pirates had returned to their ship no doubt preferring to rest well away from the grim scene there spirit slept fitfully to one side sometimes moaning faintly the bloodstained undergarment enclosing her hand she looked so wasted and frail would this slow horror never end the sequence was interminable but in two perhaps three days perhaps morei really dont know how long it took that body to thaw completely everything is conjectureit ended as we watched dully knowing the end was coming in more than one sense that the reprieve helse had provided us by taking as much time as she could to thaw was over the horse returned from the spaceship he inspected the now limp and discoloring corpse nodded approvingly and took out his knife he cut carefully into helses abdomen as if performing surgery the cutting was largely bloodless and i could not see all of itindeed i did not want to see any of it but couldnt control my eyesbut i saw enough they had set her on a table raised a meter or so so the horse wouldnt have to squat down awkwardly the curve of the floor of the commons lifted me somewhat but still i had no clear line of sight to the incision he laid her open like the carcass of an animal severing skin and muscle and linings to get at the intestines this was just as bad as my dream then he drew out the guts of her in dark lengths intact squeezing and peering until he found the position of the capsule he made an incision in the intestine at that point and cut free the prize it was not as messy an operation as my horrified imagination had hinted but was more horrible in other respects maybe this was because my dream had portrayed it as a kind of rape while this was surgical my abhorrence of rape had been muted somewhat by the education helse herself had provided me but my reaction against the onslaught of the knife remained unabated for i had seen my father killed by the sword and the finger of my sister cut off but mainly it was the actual cutting of the flesh of my beloved had she been alive it might have been an operation we tolerate much more profound violations of our bodies in the name of medicine than we do in the name of pleasure the pirates crowded close intent on the capsule as the horse proudly held it up it was about two centimeters long and half a centimeter in diameter not impressive physicallybut its content could be invaluable the child next to me nudged me slowly i turned my head interrupting my own morbid fascination with the proceedings spirit was looking at me seeming much more alert and alive than before and when my gaze met hers her eyes flicked down to her bandaged hand i looked thereand saw she had a tiny blade hardly more than a sliver from some razor blade the women used to remove hair from their legs when they were allergic to depilatories when she saw that i had seen she hid the knifelet i realized that she had cut her bonds during the recent distraction of the pirates she must have picked up the blade while foraging for bandaging material and hidden it in the gore from her finger no wonder she had had so much trouble finding what she needed in the way of bandagingit had been this she was really looking for the pirates thinking her completely broken had not considered her any real threat so had not watched her as closely as they had the rest of us even in her shock and pain right after the loss of her finger my cunning little sister had been alert for some way to free herself and us no wonder she had fooled the pirates she had even fooled me now spirit was ready for action and she knew it had to be soon the children between us fidgeted as if uncomfortable then the one beside me presented the tiny blade shoving it toward me with his bound hands the children between spirit and me had not taken time to free themselves they knew i needed to be freed first they had the discipline of desperation we would have only one chance and we had to make it good i moved slowly using the blade to saw through the rope about my feet then i realized this was foolish the hands had to be first i nudged my companion and he moved his bound hands to mine and i sawed at his rope the blade was sharp for these items are fashioned in the factory bubbles of jupiter to last almost forever and my leverage was good the strands parted and in a moment his hands were free then he took the blade and severed my rope my hands too were free while i had dreamed vainly of such an escape spirit had taken practical action to make it possible but i could not move my hands freely lest the pirates see i arranged the rope so it looked tied and moved as slowly as before meanwhile the pirate awe of the qyv treasure abated enough to get practical we have it but we have a problem the horse said we dont know whats in it could be a diamondor could be an ampoule of quintessent h worth two millionor could be a deadly virus kife means to use to wipe out a major bubble do we gamble or dont we whered she come from a pirate asked glancing at helses body do they have virus labs there callisto the boy says the horse replied no advanced technology there no precious minerals either but she could have been a secondstage courier it could have started anywhere maraud is a center for bootleg retransfer the jupiter patrol is watching for drugs on the regular ships from the inner worlds but pays no attention to refugees so it figures kife would use one of them for something really important but jupes bouncing refugees now the horse pointed out why use a courier who cant get through the other pirate shrugged i dont know he mustve figured she would get through for some reason and it fouled up she would have been pretty enough alive pretty enough yes that figured faith might have gotten through and helse too if some male jupe officer spotted them regulations could be bent or ignored for that sort of thing yet i wasnt sure i had seen no evidence of corruption in the jupiter patrol and it had been a woman who turned us away so the mystery of kifes strategy remained i freed the hands of the girl on my other side and passed the blade on covertly we all worked on our footropes though the pirates were now so engrossed in their debate over the capsule that they were paying no attention at all to us but i knew it would take more than our bare hands and one tiny blade to overcome these rough pirates we had no real weapons and the men were so much larger and stronger than we were they could have overcome us barehanded there were weapons farther around the commons but we would be caught long before we could reach them assuming the pirates had left them in place what could we do to save ourselves i worked it out as my feet came free someone would have to distract the pirates while someone else reached the weapons we had no chance to plan this out before we would have to act so i had to hope our minds ran in similar channels i could make the best use of the weapons but i was farthest from them spirit was closest i looked again at spirit making a little signal with a finger she should go for the weapons she nodded to hell with that the horse exclaimed settling the pirates dispute we could debate it for years and never decide im going to open it and while the other pirates shrank back apprehensively he twisted the two halves of the capsule it burst apart and an object fell out giving me a shock of dйjа vu relating to my recent dream the pirates shied away as if afraid the thing would explode but it bounced harmlessly on the deck the horse stooped to pick it up when should we make our move now while the pirates were distracted or should we wait till we had no choice i decided that sooner was best but we did have to give the remaining children time to get free the more of us who burst loose at once the better a key the horse said disappointed a stupid little plastic key a key to what one of the others asked edging back toward it how should i know maybe to a safe that got shipped by some other route and has a booby trap to blow it up if any key but this is used on it probably a magnetic pattern imprinted in it no way to fake it but we dont have that safe then what good is this to us no good at all the horse threw down the key in a fury we sure aint going to kife with it three damn days gonefor this for nothing spirit got up and started walking toward the weapons for a moment the pirates did not even notice spirit walked exactly as if she were going to the head she had marvelous composure all the time i had thought she was broken she had been planning this then the horse spied her and caught on shes loose he started for her who forgot to tie i launched myself toward him we didnt have a chance of course there were eight of us and five pirates in the bubble at the momentbut each of them was a match for two of us unarmed and there were more in the pirate ship that would come at the sound of the commotion but we were desperate we had nothing left to lose i plowed into the horse who wasnt looking at me my impact spun him around in a moment he recovered grabbed me and threw me aside scowling he drew his laser pistol why hadnt i grabbed for that pistol first i might have gotten it if i had concentrated on that alone i had bungled my only chance now as if it were in slow motion i saw the ongoing panorama of the action the horse drawing his weapon the other pirates turning to face the rushing children one of the bad ones reaching for spirit at the fringe of the group but no he wasnt catching her he was clapping his hands to his face she had flicked him in the eye with her fingerwhip then the horse realized what was happening and brought his pistol around to bear on spirit instead of me i tried to roll into his feet to jar his aim but was too slow but spirit fooled him by leaping up into the storage compartment neatly curving through the hole in the net and disappearing among the packages of food up there his shot burned a package but missed her it was that curvature of the jump that had thrown him off we were used to it but he wasnt unfortunately we had no weapons stored up there spirit was safe for the moment but we had lost the war because the horse was striding toward the cache of weapons i scrambled to my feet maybe i could still get to a weapon first if i dived for it but i knew this was unlikely i was passing helses body on the table i reacted almost without thinking i picked up the corpse entrails and all lifting it readily in the partial gravity and heaved it at the horse it was strange touching helses dead flesh which was not soft but rather stiff but i knew she would approve of being allowed to participate in the fight this way the body struck the horse he spun around firing his laser into it not at first realizing what it was then he realized and his face snarled with disgust a length of intestine had strewn itself across his arm and he brushed if away and backed off meanwhile i was making progress toward the weapons thanks to helses intercession my dead love had given me a better chance down spirit cried from the far side of the commons she had sailed right through the center compartment and out the other side flat i didnt know what she had in mind since there were no weapons over there but knew better than to ignore the warning i spread myself flat against the deck hoping this was not all a bluff someone shoot that brat the horse cried then he turned and aimed his laser at me i could hardly move to avoid it since i was lying down there was a horrendous roar an earhurting sound and a blast of hot air fire exploded in the baggagestorage section and the netting disintegrated burning packages rained down curving in their fashion as they fell the pirates amazed tried to dodge them had spirit detonated a bomb among the packages but there was no bomb a pirate near the air lock screamed i lookedand saw him bathed in fire his hair and clothing were puffing into bright ash and his body was blackening he spun to the side his skin flayed from his body a jet of flame shot through the center of the bubble and down through the air lock directly into the pirate space ship there were screams as it fried unseen pirates there a laser that would have to be a laser cannon the kind mounted on a jupiter navy battleship we had nothing like that on board then it cut off after only a few seconds leaving us bathed in heat and gasping for air the metal of the air lock glowed red where the jet had touched it and the odor of burnt flesh was strong the pirates were standing motionless staring and i think some were temporarily blind those of us on the deck were better off being farther from the flame now i realized what it was spirit had ignited the small rocket drive she must have braced it against the rear lock and aimed it down toward the front lock searing through everything between it was a little weak jet when used to move the mass of the full bubble externallybut here inside it seemed devastatingly powerful she probably had it set on the lowest level of thrust otherwise she would not have been able to hold it at all but even that level which from outside might seem to be a pallid jet of half a dozen meters was enough to incinerate what remained in the storage compartment and to char what did not the ferocity of its passage heated the air explosively and the jet showed in air to extend the full sixteenmeter breadth of the bubble and beyond it had been perhaps a fivesecond burstand the bubble was in a shambles get their weapons spirit called i scrambled upbut the horse reacted as quickly swinging his pistol about again spirit i cried throwing myself flat again and trusting the other children to follow my lead the jet of fire came again it wobbled and part of it struck the side of the air lock near the pirate fire refracted forming a curving sheet of flame and sparks that caught the standing pirates glancingly it cut off a second time ill burn you all if you dont get those pirates spirit called but this time the pirates had been harder hit the horse was staggering having been brushed in the face by the flame and i got his pistol without resistance it took a third blast from the rocket before we had complete control but we did have it when i reached spirit i discovered the price she had paid for her valiant move she had been very close to the rocket and the thing was no toy she had held it in place by hand her extremities shielded by bandageclothing but her hands were burned and her hair singed she had closed her eyes tightly protecting them but her cheeks were blistered when she saw me coming and knew we had won she fainted poor heroic little girl i scavenged for balm for her skin and tried to get her comfortable then tended to the other pressing business we didnt push our luck we sent the two least obnoxious piratesthe ones who had tied our bonds loose rather than cut off the circulation of our hands and feet and who had let us use the head with reasonable frequencyout the cooling lock with instructions to close it behind them and separate the pirate ship from the bubble then we dealt with the horse and the two remaining pirates i had sworn to kill the horse and now was my chance but i found i was unable to do it directly i was not when it came to the test a calculating murderer i killed only in the throes of desperation yet when i looked at spirits stump of a finger and at helses mutilated body and remembered faith i suffered a helpless secondary rage we could not simply let these criminals go spirit had recovered consciousness by this time she was in pain from her new injuries and unsteady on her feet but her eyes bore on the horse with singular malignancy faith was her sister too and spirit had suffered even more directly and recently from the villainy of the horse spirit was no forgiving cherub wordlessly she held out one burned hand for the laser pistol i gave it to her not knowing what she would do but aware that she had more guts to do it than i did i saw that it hurt her just to hold the weapon but she gritted her teeth and took it in her left hand the one with the lost finger though she was righthanded and she aimed it and steadied it and firedinto the crotch of the horse he screamed and jumped but the damage was done spirit had castrated him with the laser then we forced the three into the trailing lifeboat after hauling it up to mate with the freed front lock we had not killed the horsebut blind and burned he might not live long anyway jammed into the lifeboat with his two cutthroat companions and set adrift in space certainly he would suffer to a certain extent the way we had certainly he would never rape another refugee girl maybe his pirate ship would search out the boat and pick him up maybe it wouldnt bother his fate was now in the hands of his associates as perhaps it deserved to be his blood was not technically on my hands that perhaps is my ultimate confession of weakness we had not actually lost any children this time but half our supplies had been destroyed and we all had emotional and physical scars several children had bad burns from the rocket and i feared spirits face would never be pretty for there would be blister scars on it when it healed but we survived and we had a little portion of our vengeance we bagged helses remains and returned her to the hull i saved the mysterious plastic key hiding it on my person my last memento of helse that and the helse hubris tag we cleaned up the rest in the usual manner it did give us something to do we settled down to traveling our route and tending our injuries spirit tough little creature that she was started recovering right away but i refused to let her do any real work until her skin scabbed over and started healing she was i still believe the toughest one among us and she had earned her rest chapter the final raid spirit eyed me speculatively one day hope youre getting too old old what was she up to now youre thinking about starting a beard oh men do you know i ran my finger along my chin but there really wasnt anything there what if the pirates come again to slay the men she had a point if women were subject to rape men were subject to murder it was best to remain young i fetched some depilatory from the diverse supplies that remained and went over my face rendering it fully boyish again thats not enough she said all they want is girls to rape i exclaimed you should be safe from that she pointed out startled and not entirely pleased for a reason i could not define i had to agree it might indeed be smart for me to learn to masquerade as a girl just as it had been useful for helse to masquerade as a boy if pirates came and blazed away at males and spared the girls this could give me my only chance to survive long enough to blaze back at them we would all have lasers ready next time of course still we had so often been betrayed by circumstance that we had to consider any possible advantage that might be available spirit got to work happily she had a marvelous ability to invest her whole attention in immediacies bypassing the horrors that tormented my more reflective mind she found a dress my size and made me change into it while the other children offered enthusiastic suggestions i even had to put on pantyhose to cover my hairy legs and girlish slippers naturally the brats fitted me with a padded brassiere to make my front look right giggling fiendishly i had become the entertainment of the hour they brushed out my hair which had grown longer in the past month and they tied a pretty red ribbon in it and instructed me in girlish nuances of expression and stance i was surprised by the amount the little girls knew about this sort of thing evidently they took their sex roles seriously from an early age i was not really enjoying any of this but they found it hilarious still it would be pointless for me ever to attempt such a masquerade before pirates unless i had it down pat so i did work at it trying to satisfy the piercing cynosure of the children when they began to nod approval i knew i was getting better spirit insisted on making it more of an ordeal she donned male clothing and postured before me in a gross parody of masculinity her ravaged face did help here i am your brother she declaimed i am here to stop you from getting raped unless you really want to be say sir to me sister the other kids laughed as if that were the humor of the century was this really the way the typical male came across to the opposite sex ship ahoy the lookout cried that would have to happen at the time i was ludicrously garbed just when we thought we were free of pirates well off the ecliptic another came i rushed for my space suit not sparing time to change every moment might count spirit did likewisebut of course she didnt mind her garb the way i did mine it was awful for me cramming the damned dress into the legs of the suit spirit had it easy male clothes are designed for space suits or vice versa in this respect it really is a male universe the other kids hesitated then decided to go for their suits too they were alive now only because they had been lucky enough to avoid the pirates and get their suits on in time they didnt want to gamble that way again but that left us without any innocents to test the intruders we all had laser pistols now so the innocents could attack with much better effect but still we all lacked confidence in that so it was to be suits for all a few children in a bubblethe suits would not be too surprising bubbles didnt leak but some people worried that they did then the innocents could simply slam their helmets on if we had to go the vacuum route i stationed myself near the rear air lock and spirit joined me while the others scrambled we two were the fastest because we had drilled specifically for this many times our suits were hung right by the air lock supported so that we could almost literally dive into them feet first we had everything tight except our helmets my slippered feet tended to slip around in the big suitfeet though and i hated the way my skirt wadded up around my middle you sure look cute sister in your suit and ribbon spirit teased me i put my hand to my head to remove the damned thing but my suit gauntlets were clumsy there was a crash the entire bubble shook almost knocking us off our feet they crashed into us i exclaimed shaken in two senses there was another crash worse than the first notheyre shooting at us spirit screamed then she jammed her helmet over her head i followed her example the automatic seal operated and the suits air puffed on the third shot punctured the hull on the side of the bubble opposite us the air sucked out with gale force i couldnt see the puncture but knew its nature from the direction of the rush of air spirit and i were drawn along with itbut we were farthest from the leak and were affected least i grabbed the netting above the commons as i flew by and spirit did the same she had had prior experience with explosive decompression i had not since i had been out on the hull before the opening was small for bubblehulls are tough designed to withstand pebblemeteorites and to selfseal to some extent but of course space artillery is designed to penetrate exactly such hulls the shell had formed a tube that let the air out it took about thirty seconds with diminishing intensity as the pressure dropped spirit and i survived itbut i realized that the other children probably had not they had required more time to suit up and their reactions were less certain they might have paused in surprise listening to the collisions of the shells against our hulland that would have been fatal once again we had been betrayed by the unexpected i looked at spirit through our helmets why had the pirates done it to hole a bubblethat was the deliberate murder of all within no rape of women or kidnapping of children was possible now the pirate ship docked against our air lock and the men used it keeping their ship sealed suited men appeared and began checking around inside our wasted hulk it seemed that all they wanted was salvage what should we do now if the pirates saw us they would surely kill us but we couldnt remain in the holed bubble long it was now useless we had no way to repair such a leak assuming the pirates left us any food or life support equipment when they finished we seemed to have a choice between a fast death and a slow one spirit had the answer she handed herself to a rent in the net and took hold of an armful of food containers she meant to pretend to be a looter would it work it might our suits were standard similar to those of the pirates in the confusion of looting we might manage to get aboard the ship after thatwell first things first i took an armful of food packs enough to cover my face panel somewhat and followed spirit down to the air lock i really didnt know whether this would work but didnt see any alternative we came to the lock and the pirate there waved us on in he closed the lock behind us and we stepped into the pirate ship it took me a moment to realize what was strange this was very like the bubble here just a chamber for access we had explored a ship before when we cleaned out the pirates with our vacuum so this was reasonably familiar but this present one was a larger and probably better ship we floated through the chamber and down a short hall toting our burdens then we came to something different the vacuumed ship had docked noseon so that its spin matched the bubbles spin and the whole thing had been like one extended passage from our lock indeed in the case of the horses ship our drive jet had fired right down its throat the length of the ship but this present ship had docked at the center so its nose and tail sections were projecting to either side and it was spinning around endwise to match the bubbles rotation it was always easier for a ship to match rotations since it would have taken energy to stop the bubbles spin not worth it for a temporary connection here it is best to make a set of diagrams i have drawn a center line to show the axis of rotation in each case as should be clear the two modes of docking lead to quite different dynamics within the ship actually the rate of rotations does not have to match as the airlocks have a builtin slip mechanism that allows opposite rotations of bubble and ship but what would be the point certainly it was impossible for the ship to maintain a longaxis spin while connected to the bubble so it had either to go to no spin meaning nullgee or to rotate end over end as it was doing this seemed unnecessarily clumsy my mind cast about for the rationale could it be that these particular pirates were accustomed to difficult maneuvers in space and performed them routinely that would imply a really professional crew more like a military unit than a motley collection of malcontents their completely callous holing of our bubble implied the same we were up against nononsense raiders this timeprobably a ship that deserted from a planetary navy and there was the explanation for the maneuver this ship had not docked at the nose because it couldnt it had a projectile cannon mounted in the nose instead of an air lock no other pirate ship had fired at us because such military hardware could not be mounted on ordinary space vessels they had to be designed for it a projectile cannon attached to the side of the hull of a spinning ship would be virtually useless and would severely shake the ship when it fired it had to be on the axis line so it could be fired without affecting either the spin or the balance of the ship since boarding became so awkward no chances were taken the victim was rendered completely helpless before the approach was made this was like a pirate with one arm afraid the girl might resist and hurt him so he shoots her just before he rapes her why was it that each pirate vessel we encountered seemed worse than the last even the horse had been worse the second time now we were at an intersection on either side a long passage extended down thats right we were floating at the nullgee axis and the opposite directions were both down because of that endwise rotation we had to pick one or the other without delay for a pirate was coming through the lock behind us i saw an arrow pointing decided that would be toward the residential section for no good reason male intuition is suspect and jumped spirit followed of course we did not sail blithely down the center of the passage that is not the nature of free fall as our experience in the bubble had amply shown we slid down one wall and as the pressure of that wall increased our angular momentumthat is the speed of our revolution around the axisour centrifugal force increased and we slid faster the process fed on itself so it was a bit like being on a giant slide whose slant increased as it progressed so that not only ones velocity but ones rate of increase of velocity quickened soon we were bumping along at an uncomfortable rate and had to catch the inset rungs to break our falls the packages sprang from our arms and went tumbling on down ahead a pirate emerged from a side halljust in time to be pelted by the onrushing packages he did not take it well a laser pistol appeared in his hand pointing with excellent accuracy at me as i clung to the descent ladder so we were caught but that had been inevitable so far we survived i lifted back my helmet surrendering for the moment there was no point in getting shot or in getting spirit shot perhaps we could talk our way into something less unpromising a woman he exclaimed in english i still had the red ribbon in my hair i started to protest but spirit nudged me so whatd you expect my sister to bea frog she demanded the pirates lips quirked it seemed he had some minor sense of humor you escaped from the derelict bubble derelict spirit demanded it wasnt a derelict not until you blasted a hole in it so it would seem the pistol still covered us come in here and get out of those suits we entered his chamber and climbed out of our suits i had a problem with modesty as my dress tended to snag above my waist how did girls stand it of course my bloomerpanties protected the essentials i lost a slipper in the suit and had to fish for it i realized now why girls often seemed so inefficient their costumes did it to them but at length i stood somewhat bedraggled before the pirate spirit in masculine attire was better off i knew that only the seriousness of our situation prevented her from teasing me about my feminine ineptitude how old are you the pirate asked he was evidently an officer as he wore some sort of insignia and seemed better spoken than the usual brutes probably he originated from uranus whose moon titania was the home of the englishspeaking people and which moon had a longstanding navy tradition mainly he was calmly selfassured fifteen i said no point in concealing that fact twelve spirit said he gazed at me appreciatively and appraisingly and i became aware of one reason women can cringe under the cynosure of men i wished i could be anywhere but here you are young the pirate officer said but that perhaps makes you cleaner you will serve one man per night commencing this night you will cooperate gladly no i cried horrified with better reason than he could know otherwise your little brother will be floggedby the man you do not pleaseand you will go without food or water till the next i believe in time you will cooperate willingly enough i was silent these pirates certainly knew how to make a girl perform all we could do now was stall for time the officer raised his voice to address the other pirates that were arriving now take these two to the guest room you will draw straws for order of satisfaction stunned we went to the indicated chamber it was near the end of the ship where gravity approached one gee it occurred to me that this endoverend rotation could be the normal mode for this ship as a slower turning rate led to greater effective gravity at the extremes compared to the other mode we had enough trouble establishing half or quarter gee in the bubble the ships smaller diameter would force a very high rate of spin to get similar effect and the difference in effect as a person moved inward from the hull would be formidable just standing could be uncomfortable but the present way there was relatively little differentiation it was almost like standing on a planet when not accelerating or shooting at a helpless bubble this ship needed no specific orientation in space and when it was accelerating that would provide temporary gee so this odd mode wasnt nearly as odd as it looked i had never seen it in holo shows depicting navy vessels but probably those were censored to avoid the undramatic aspects the guest room was set up in the fashion of an antique boudoir of the salacious version with mirrors on walls and ceiling and virtually the entire floor covered by the mattress evidently these pirates had entertained women before this was intended for only one type of guest i realized that this was the type of situation my sister faith had walked into for a moment we were alone while the pirates drew their straws i looked at spirit were in trouble i said in a gross understatement youre in trouble paleface she quipped but she turned serious immediately i can take your place we can change clothes i tried to conceal the extent of my horror at the notion no good i said they wont fit we could make it dark i wont stand by and watch you be raped i said she sighed like an adult that too of course maybe we can overpower the first pirate i could ram a knitting needle in his ear she said that works pretty well if i had a needle still no good theyd be on us when he didnt come out we no longer had our laser pistols the officer had competently deprived us of them at the outset we need to get to the captain and hold him up and hijack the ship she said if we could get to the captain and if we could make him do our will i said spirit these are pirates theyd as soon kill us as rape us we just dont have the the panel opened a gross burly bearded pirate came in girl get on the bed and spread em he said to me boy get to the side and watch when you get old enough youll get to do it too meanwhile you can learn he started to strip spirits gaze darted about the room seeking some possible weapon but i knew there was none her fingerwhip had also been taken from her pirates knew about such things her fingerstump had been sprayed with plastic bandage they knew about that sort of thing too these were englishspeaking pirates but they differed from the spanishspeaking ones we had encountered only in their language and efficiency maybe we had floated from the hispanic territory to the british elsewhere in jupiterspace there might be frenchspeaking pirates too certainly there had been in the past in callistos history i hesitated i really wasnt taking time to think all these things out as lucidly as i present them here our fleeting thoughts may be more suggestive than complete i could use the antirape measures against this man poking his eyes outbut that would surely mean a most unpleasant death for spirit and me there had to be a better way move girl the pirate cried grabbing my arm and yanking me onto the bed i fell and he jumped on top of me his clothing only partly undone his liquorsodden breath seared my face as his foul hand grasped at my padded front yet again i appreciated the position young women may be placed in no person in her right mind would enjoy this approach helse had been very smart to conceal her gender kife i said i hadnt known i was going to do it but the chain of thought leading to helse had lead naturally to her identity as courier so brutally fresh in my mind this did seem worth a try the man froze in mid grasp oh no he muttered you think a girl survives in space because of her muscle i asked following up my advantage i could tell the man was really shaken evidently qyvs notoriety extended throughout piratedom he backed off why didnt you say something before kife wants it private i explained ill probably get in trouble just for giving away my status and really i had become kifes courier for i retained the key in the capsule take me to your captain damn he swore im tempted to yes i heard about someone who did that once i said blithely thought he was real smart thought kife wouldnt know but kife always knows you know how long it took that man to die once kife caught him the pirate was uncertain again look girl i just drew straws i didnt know i saw spirit smirking at the end he couldnt even scream i said though he sure was trying to because of the blood you know in his throat they ran a hose into him up his nose and down his windpipe so he wouldnt choke to death on the gore before they were ready kife doesnt like it when someone dies before hes ready they hadnt done the eyes yet or the liver the pirate retreated farther what do you want girl he had evidently forgotten my demand to see the captain or hadnt taken it seriously i decided to play with this some more i was hurt and angry about the holing of our bubble and the callous murder of the other six children this might be a small vengeance but it helped i just thought youd like to know what youre missing they gave me one of his gonads for a souvenir pickled in brine course it was sort of ragged because he kicked some while they were pulling it off i dont think i ever saw so rugged a man look so sick so suddenly i never touched you girl i didnt know take me to your captain i repeated tiring of this sport but mixed with my fiendish glee at the nature of this reprieve was my sense of irony had helse employed her weapon of the name more freely she need never have died she hadnt really known what she had thus we found ourselves in the presence of the captain called brinker he was not one of the bushybearded types he was cleanshaven and his jacket fitted well he was small but looked very much like a nordic officer with pale blond hair and sharp almost chiseled facial features i became more certain than ever that he had deserted from the titanian navy taking his ship and crew with him i understood such things happened space around uranus wouldnt have been safe for him so he had crossed to jupiter and taken up the trade of piracy he seemed completely selfassured and carried a needlelaser sidearm in a holster visible in his left armpit its butt forward i wondered how this physically unprepossessing person maintained discipline over rough pirates now that he was not supported by the weight of military law and custom this was obviously a fairly taut ship say the word captain brinker said to me not in public i said aware that i was being tested i did not see brinkers hand move but abruptly the pistol was in it and there was the tingle of heated air beside my left ear suddenly i saw how brinker kept discipline he must be the fastest gun in space he could have burned me instead of firing past my head and i would not have had time to blink the pistol was already back in the holster but i sensed that it would be wrong to back down in the face of such a threat captain brinker did not respect those he could readily cow that much my talent of human understanding indicated though we had not interacted long enough for me to gain a clearer comprehension of the captains nature so though i was frightened i bluffed shoot me you know whom you will answer to the pistol appeared in his hand again its lensmuzzle bearing on my right eye but i had never been daunted by such threats afterwards when i had time to consider i might shudder with reaction but at the time of crisis i always stiffened my opposition when threatened this wasnt courage just the way i am some circuit in my brain cuts out under pressure so i stared into that lens and waited unspeaking again the weapon snapped back to its holster very well brinker said you shall have your private interview the pirate guards left the panel sealing behind them my sense was continuing to operate there was something amiss about the captain i had felt a similar unease when first meeting helse in her guise as a boy that was the key spirit i said in a normal voice do you remember helses secret she looked puzzled i remember another shares it her brow furrowed then straightened she was catching on are you sure almost in a moment ill tell captain brinker frowned what are you talking about you asked me to say the word i said while spirit unobtrusively moved away from me i can do better than that i can write it out for you i glanced about the chamber the captains small office do you have something to write with just spell it brinker snapped that of course was the test if i spelled kife the way it sounded i would show up as an imposter but i had another ploy now i saw that spirit had gotten herself close to an anchored metal cabinet so might have a baffle i took the plunge female i spelled aloud the pistol was back in the captains hand aiming at my eye explain yourself girl i suggest you not fire until you consider the consequence i said evenly though the cold clutch of fear almost brought me down i dread the thought of blindness if you are not concerned with the vengeance of kife you should think of the more immediate result of action against us i had slipped in the other key word deliberately so that it would seem like no bluff with the spelling held in reserve the secret you value most will be exposed if you kill us this chamber is not completely soundproofed one of us will scream the word while you kill the other i glanced toward spirit who now stood behind the cabinet out of the line of fire your men will hear and wonderand when they discover the nature of our bodies they will understand the potential you are speaking gibberish the captain said no i said here is the secret none of the three of us here are the sex we seem the captain did not seem to react be more specific i am male i said spirit is my sister and you show me the captain snapped the laser still zeroed on my eye i lifted my skirt and dropped my bloomers displaying my masculine parts this was hardly the occasion for modesty i signaled to spirit who stepped out and started to drop her trousers enough the captain said you have made your point how did you know i covered my private region straightening out my dress i have had experience with transvestism as you can see i have learned to recognize it in my profession such abilities are often necessary my employer does not like to have his name bandied about so i avoid the use of it when possible by using other means to conceal my nature again i was implying that my position as courier was to be taken for granted in a dozen years no one has realized i am a woman captain brinker said putting away the pistol i killed any who suspected if my crew knew i would lose my commandand more much more i agreed it is not to the advantage of any of us to have our natures revealed shall we deal on that basis and leave qyv out of it now at last i spelled it to remove the last trace of doubt about my connection what do you want i want my freedom i said to pursue my mission if i fail my mission i will have to seek a very fast very sure extinction i also want the freedom of my sister she is a courier too i was aware that she was testing me again so i steered clear of unnecessary elaboration no couriers dont travel in pairs she is only my sisterbut i will not make any agreement unless she is free if i set you free i have no guarantee of your silence brinker pointed out rather than risk that i will destroy the whole ship but first she would try to eliminate us cleanly hoping somehow to conceal our natures and hers from her crew i saw that she could not be moved on this aspect that would certainly protect you from my employers vengeance i agreed i trust you have no blood relatives he can trace yet i would rather live and you would too is there no compromise yes i will give you the lifeboat your sister remains with me as hostage it did make sense as i would never betray the captains secret while my sister was subject to her will and the captain would not kill spirit as long as spirits life guaranteed my discretion yet i could not do it spirit was all i had left the only remaining barrier between me and total desolation make another offer i said curtly no other offer the captain said now assured that spirit was important to me i may neither kill you nor let you go entirely free without imperiling myself it must be all or nothingor this take the compromiseor the consequence hope she means it spirit said do it she will not harm me for i have the same secret i can be the cabin boy and i will not be molested you must go freeto complete your mission my nonexistent courier mission my father my mother my fiancйeall sacrificed themselves for me i exclaimed in anguish you are all i have left spirit i cannot let you go hope i said i would die for you spirit replied this is not nearly as bad we may someday meet again and i saw the tears on her face and knew she was determined to make this final sacrifice for me i had to do it agreed i said to the captain almost choking over the word spiriti did not know whether i could survive without her or whether i wanted to yet it seemed it had to be done we are children and you are piratesbut we have seen as much of death as you have do not test us unduly i refuse to use my courier status to win free find another pretext to put me on the lifeboat i was serious i was on the verge of throwing it all in screaming out the captains secret and letting things follow as they would we understand each other the captain said i will send you back to the bed you will hijack the ship instead using our detonationcontrol panel your sister will have to do it she glanced at spirit you have the nerve girl i have the nervegirl spirit replied no more of this i said immediately knowing that mayhem was in the near offing either of those two would destroy the ship if pressed herself with it you are both male henceforth and i will exit as i am then listen lad captain brinker said to spirit and my sense informed me that she was not entirely displeased about this development i realized that it must be a lonely thing being the only woman in a crew of cutthroat men anonymously unable ever to let down her guard lest she be relegated to perpetual slave duty in the guest room she surely had to sleep in a locked chamber she might wish for the company of her own kind while preserving her secretand we had handed that opportunity to her brinker was letting it be understood that she was compromising in the face of necessitybut in reality she was arranging exactly what she wanted to be rid of me and to keep my sister this insight did not dismay me it reassured me the captain had no reason to betray us the captain tersely explained how to arm the detonator panel so that the pirate ship would be blown up if anything happened to the one in control then we were ready i would not need my space suit in the lifeboat and i already had a fair notion how to pilot it and where i was going except the ephemeris i exclaimed i must have that you know how to get it the captain said i nodded i looked at spirit one thing spirit said to the captain if my brother doesnt make it safely away you will do what i would do in the circumstance brinker finished yes spirit isnt bluffing i said the captain smiled grimly i think we shall get along i thought they would too there was an underlying similarity between them i embraced spirit beloved brotherfarewell i said not caring that a feminine tear showed on my face she looked so small trying to be brave her face scarred one finger missing but i knew she would blow up the ship if she had to beloved sister she responded i love you she kissed me with a passion that disconcerted me i turned to the captain you will see that my brother is well treated i said and was surprised at the coldness in my voice i had the fake weapon of qyv and the real one of the captains secret but in fact i believed i would find a way to come for brinker and kill her in the most humiliating and painful way if she harmed spirit and this was manifest in my tone i would somehow in due course destroy all pirates this i had already vowed but spirit was special you can be sure of it captain brinker was no gentle creature but she understood there was no bluffing in any of this we were all killers the captain activated her buzzer summoning the guard pirates take the girl back to the guest room her protection is fake and she will have to cooperate leave the boy with her for now well lock them up together until we tire of her the arriving pirates smiled broadly yes sir one said crunching my elbow with his huge hand i must have made a very fetching image of a girl the other grabbed for spirit who looked so cowed it was obviously not necessary to hold her securely i had seen that cowed look before that was when spirit was most deadly dangerous we accompanied the men docilely enough i noted how other pirates nodded their captain had come through again penetrating the difficult matter of the kife ploy it was not just brinkers ready laser that compelled respect it was her ability to solve the tricky problems protecting the ship when some other person might have blundered brinker was a good captain setting aside the issue of legality even the way the bubble had been holedthat had defused our trap before we had a chance brinker took no unnecessary chances we entered the longitudinal halland spirit exploded she kicked her guard pirate in the leg punched him in the gut and used him as a brace to shove off violently in a moment she was plunging down the passage toward the control room at the end hey the man cried stupidly going after her my own guard kept his hand on me and i being supposedly female and helpless made no move he hauled me toward the control room we passed through the door and stood on the floor which could serve as a wall when the ship was accelerating our heads were pointed toward the center of the ship far up the center passage spirit had made it to the destruct control panel and stood with her small hands locked on a lever let my sister go she cried spying us the pirate on duty gaped thats the detonator he said one tug on that lever and all our ammo blows spirit smiled and tugged the lever down every pirate in sight blanched tried to fool me huh she demanded ive seen these things before now ive armed it if i let go itll snap back and thatd blow a hole in your ship wouldnt it see how you bastards like breathing vacuum sames you did for our people turn my sister loose hastily my guard did so i rubbed my elbow brother i asked do you know what youre doing well die if but well take all these apes with us she said zestfully thats the way i like to go i spoke to the pirates i know my brother hes a powercrazy brat he thinks killing people is a game he used to smash all his toys for the fun of it hes not afraid of death if you dont do what he says captain brinker appeared what were hijacking your ship sir spirit called you pilot it where we say or ill blow it right out of jupiter orbit you ungrateful brat brinker exclaimed the laser pistol appeared in her hand i spare your life and you pull this get away from that panel go ahead kill me spirit gibed when i let go of this handle well all go boom sir a sweating pirate cried its true we cant take the chance the captains weapon swung to cover him dont tell me what to do brinker snapped who let that brat go the pirate closest to spirit turned his face turning waxy it was so quick the beam of the laser speared him through the right eye steam and fluid puffed out as the eyeball was burned and punctured the man staggered back clapping one hand to his face when i give an order i expect it to be carried out competently the captain said i had this matter settled and you have bungled us into a problem she turned back to spirit what do you want boy pilot this ship to leda spirit said the jupe military base theyd blow us out of space you might as well turn that handle loose now and get it done with spirit looked at the handle oh well she made as if to let it go and again the pirates blanched i stepped in the captains not bluffing kid we cant hijack this ship there spirit scowled i know but i sort of like explosions anyway she let go the handleand caught it halfway back a pirate grunted in horror but the captain didnt flinch it was evident whose nerves were steadiest well give you safeconduct to our lifeboat brinker said its fueled and stocked it can easily reach leda no good i said we cant even find leda without our ephemeris and we dont know how to pilot a spacecraft the captain spoke to a pirate suit up go to the bubble and fetch its ephemeris then to me there are instructions on the boat it is designed to be operated by any fool who may survive disaster in space even a teenage girl you can operate it if you can read english i can read english i said spirit maybe we should okay take my sister there spirit said then she did a dismayed doubletake fine little actress that she was oopshow can i go i have to keep my hand on this handle i will hold the lever for you the captain said spirit laughed so hard she seemed almost to lose control of the handle even i who knew her propensity for such seeming mischief was alarmed oh no you dont sir the moment i quit this handle youll shoot me and plant my sister in that bed captain brinker smiled and the pirates smiled with her this was rough humor they understood the captain too was playing to an audience obviously i ran the danger of the bed then it seems you must remain here guarding your handle while your sister departs is that good enough but i cant stay here forever spirit said playing it out with uncomfortably accurate intuition once my sisters gone the moment i quit my lifell be out the air lock she shook her head i guess i just better blow it up now and be done with it again the pirates froze nervously no one liked being subject to the whim of this vacillating child again the captain interceded with a skillful compromise i could use a nervy lad like you for my cabin boy spare the ship and ill see that youre protected spirit considered with childlike solemnity will you make a pirates oath on that pirates oath the captain agreed now just let me have that lever oh no you dont sir spirit repeated grasping the lever more tightly and lifting it part of the way back not till my sisters safe youre probably lying but at least i can save her accuse me of lying again and i will burn you where you stand the captain said evenly the captains right kid a pirate called he never breaks a real promise so now the pirate crew knew that the captain had to keep her word or stand diminished cleverly played indeed there would be no backtalk or grumbling when spirit was spared and of course it was true spirit was a nervy kid and would make a good cabin boy the pirate returned with the ephemeris i took it thanks brother i said to spirit dont blow up the ship until i get clear i reveled in the expression of the nearest pirate we had them scared all right i took one last look at spirit she met my gaze squarely and somehow it reminded me of the time i had tried to question her about the events of the night it wrenched my heart to part from her then i turned and moved toward the passage to the lifeboat chapter salvation after that it was routine i found myself in the lifeboat and the instructions were there and the controls were simple those instructions made all the difference had we had them for the last lifeboat we could have mastered it as readily the captain had kept her word i activated the drive and jetted off farewell spirit i cried as i saw the pirate ship and attached bubble receding behind me i did not yet know how to work the radio so could not broadcast any message but it wasnt necessary anyway such a broadcast might have alerted other pirates to my presence and i didnt want that i watched the pirate ship for some time making sure it didnt explode as if my concentration could affect it as time passed i was reassured that the rest of the bargain had been honored spirit was now becoming the captains cabin boy now i let the tears flow it hardly mattered i was dressed for it it was all right for a girl to cry i have no heart to detail my journey to leda alone the mechanics of it were absolutely boring and the mental and emotional aspect was horrendous now i had time to realize that i had in fact sold my little sister into more than a masquerade captain brinker evidently had no use for men in the emotional sensewhich meant she might have use for women cabin boys historically had been notoriously employed as homosexual objects now the captain had a cabin girl why hadnt i thought of that before because i could not afford to jeopardize my escape had i forced my sister into that bed after all to benefit myself i could not be sure but there was no joy in the contemplation i was the sole survivor of the original bubbletrek to the better life all the others had sacrificed themselves many of them directly for me at this stage i hardly seemed worth it over and over i rehearsed this in my mind trying to come to terms with my fundamental unworthiness on io i had known that no merit of mine justified my survival now as i neared leda i had no better assurance slowly i concluded that though i was unworthy i might be able to redeem myself in part i resolved to dedicate my life to the justification of the sacrifices that had been made for me i did not know exactly how i would do it but somehow i would i would make the universe know that the lives of all the gallant refugees had not been in vain with the powerful jet of the lifeboat i made it much faster than would have been possible in the bubble i radioed ahead having mastered the radio by this time and they gave me landing instructions and took me into custody when i turned off the jet and emerged they took me in at the station listened to part of my statement and told me there was no proof for it because i was a minor and there were no corroborative witnesses what irony there were no witnesses because they all had been captured or killed no wonder the pirates had free rein in space they shipped me to a refugeedetentioncamp bubble orbiting jupiter not far above the roiling atmosphere and dumped me in with a thousand other refugees gleaned from all around the jupiter system i had had no idea there were so many we had never seen another bubble during our odyssey but they must have been there if each of these people represented the lone survivor of an expedition like mine bounced back from jupiter on the pretext of a changed policy when in fact they had merely come to the wrong station for admissionit was appalling what monsters ran the government of mighty jupiter we were strangers to each other yet not strangers in experience the others had indeed suffered grievously and learned in the harshest possible way the realities of space they were not necessarily nice people these survivors like me they had learned to steal and lie and kill just to get by they had eaten human flesh they understood full well the horror of our situation i did not like being among them i would have felt more comfortable in the company of the nicer people who had made the sacrifices such as my own parents and sisters and fiancйe part of the horror of my situation was the knowledge that if i had been a better person i would long since have died the commandant of the detention center summoned us all to an assembly to announce that current united states of jupiter policy which was relevant for us would admit only those refugees who possessed viable commercial or artistic skills and therefore would not be a burden on society the rest would be returned to their planets of origin returned to callisto or for the others to ganymede or europa or some lesser moon horror overwhelmed us and the assembly became a riot they had to flood the bubble with sleep gas to break it up we well knew the fate most of us would face on our home moons few of us would be kindly treatedand those who were would still be locked into the very situation they had risked everything to escape i personally would face a charge of attempted murder because of the scion the verdict was sure callisto meant death for me i was not concerned so much for myself as death had brushed past me too many times to be any specter of the unknown i was concerned for my mission to vindicate the effort of the refugees who had already died i was the only one of our original party who remained to make that attempt yet i seemed to possess no skills or arts the authorities considered worthwhile they werent interested in information about halfcal history or culture they had passed out assorted tests in spanish and many forms and i had duly filled them all outbut they were coded by numbers not names and the authorities werent paying much attention i wasnt sure they were even reading the completed forms or whether the number designated for me actually matched the one on the forms i had been given probably my answers had been credited to somebody else and vice versa this sort of thing happens when men are treated like cattle my name was duly posted on the list of scheduled returnees i would have perhaps a month longer here while the remaining refugees were processed and the bureaucracy ground its inefficient wheels to produce the necessary transportation then a jupiter ship in the name of the home of the brave and the world of the free would deliver me to my doom so i am whiling away my time by writing this private history as it may become the only record of the travails of my family i have all day every day to rehearse my memories and piece it out to the best of my ability probably these poor sheets written in english to prevent comprehension by other refugeessomehow i value this immediate aspect of my privacy for all that i do want my story to be known after i am gonewill be destroyed with the other refuse of our camp once we are excised from the detention globe that will be a secret tragedy but even so this writing is a necessary therapy a coming to terms with my situation i am about to be eliminated and my dreams and vows with me i must tell someone of my pain even if only a sheaf of papers at least for a little while this enables my family and friends to live again if only in my appreciation perhaps i can arrange to mail this manuscript anonymously to the scientist of io who helped us mason anonymously because i do not want him to be implicated in my crimes there must be no direct connection between him and me i believe he would understand maybe he would show the manuscript to his pretty niece megan i am dreaming foolishly but i will try to send the manuscript in a situation as fouled up as this one my package might get through especially since they will not suspect a document written in english of originating in a hispanic refugee camp major and charity hubris my honored parentsi love you and grieve for you faith my lovely older sister whom i was unable to protecthow i wish i could have served you better than i did helse my loveo helse helse i dream of you yet my woman my bride my all i clip your name tag helse hubris to this manuscript hoping you would have approved and spirit editorial epilog here the manuscript ends the final page is discolored surely by tears and a full paragraph of text has been obliterated it is a point of curiosity what the washedout text contained but the words are largely beyond restoration only a few are decipherable among them twice spirit the helse hubris name tag is absent long since lost hope hubris at the age of fifteen had seen all his family lost or dead and he believed he was also slated for death it is not surprising that he was depressed and that the poignancy of his accumulated memories overcame him the official records for this period in the life of the tyrant are scant as the affairs of refugees were not at that time deemed important there is no listing of his presence in the detention bubble yet other details of his narrative have been corroborated such as the appearance of two hispanic refugees at a scientific observatory on the hellface of io and the fouryear residence of a pretty child in the mansion of a prominent politician of callisto so there seems to be little reason to question the general authenticity of the document we take editorial license to recreate the following sequence as the narrative seems incomplete without it an official discovered hope hubris at his cramped table formed from a surplus crate his head on the last sheet of his holographic manuscript clarification holographic is used in its sense of wholly hand written rather than in the more common contemporary sense of threedimensional projection of images though perhaps that also in a sense applies hey kid are you sick he asked in clumsy spanish hope raised his dark head to stare dully at the man no sir you can go to the dispensary for a pill no thank you sir i am merely tired whats that you have there nothing sir just some papers hope tried to put them away say thats english where did you get that sir its unimportant i was just writinga letter in english yes sir i studied your language in school let me have that the official moved to pick up the papers thinking they were stolen sir pleaseit is mine the official paused then tested the bedraggled young refugee you are fluent in english he asked in that language yes sir hope answered in kind let me see you write something in english hope took a separate sheet and wrote this is my statement that i am literate in the language of the colossus jupiter from whose fair and promising clouds i am barred ill be damned the official exclaimed dont you know that englishlanguage literacy is grounds for status as an alien resident in jupiter the eyes in the dusky face widened no one informed me of that sir the official shook his head maybe that form got lost in the shuffle happens all the time anyway its true come with me you are about to have your status changed and so this manuscript refugee written in the depth of despair saved the young life of hope hubris and thereby altered most significantly the history of mankind it is not possible to say whether it happened precisely this way but certainly it was the chance discovery of his literacy in english that qualified him for alien residency a subsequent reference by the tyrant himself confirmed this aspect the existence of this particular manuscript was not then known and it is very tempting now to suppose that this was indeed the document that did it there would be poetic irony in having the narrative of his failure convert that failure to success this aspect of course also resolves the mystery of helses use as a courier she too was literate in english having had an excellent private education so she also would have been granted sanctuary if she had survived her employer surely knew that we trust this clarifies the early nature of the later tyrant of jupiter he was not at all the monster his political and cultural enemies have claimed he was very much a victim of violent circumstance the marvel is not that he emerged emotionally scarred but that he retained his sanity and power of character conjecture is precarious but some further speculation on the concluding unreadable paragraph of his manuscript may be in order as this relates to a further mystery of his character obviously this paragraph concerned hopes little sister spirit and great emotion attaches thereto one must wonder why when one short paragraph is devoted to the memory of parents older sister and fiancйe all dead or degraded there should be a much longer passage devoted to the younger sister who perhaps survived best objectively it would seem that spirit was the least important figure of this number and suffered least though still considerably why then should she apparently be mourned more than all the rest it does not seem to make perfect sense the motives of the tyrant however have always made sense when properly understood he was a most intelligent forthright and practical person not given to emotional foolishness he was never known for extreme subtlety or deviousness he related with rare precision to the needs and feelings of the average man that is one secret of his inordinate success what he felt everyone felt few for example failed to applaud his savage campaign against the space piratesand this manuscript makes clear his underlying motivation there he was fulfilling his vow one must therefore conclude that if he wrote most feelingly about his little sister the state of his awareness warranted it it would be easy to take this as proof of the incest with which he has been chargedbut again this may be unwarranted direct evidence for such incest has never been presentedand there have been those who certainly would have presented it had they been able every investigation has foundered on uncertainty yet it does seem likely that hopes greatest emotional concern was with his sister probably the truth is this though hope hubris loved his parents and older sister in a family way and loved his fiancйe helse romantically his closest actual companion was spirit she understood him she fought for him sometimes with devastating effectiveness he literally owed his life to her she may have slept with him one time to ease his agony of bereavement and she deliberately sacrificed herself to free him from the last pirate she was the embodiment of blood relative friend and perhaps lover she was his strengthand when he lost her his competence as an individual suffered severely one can be sure he would not passively have awaited shipment back to callisto had spirit been with him at the end the two of them would have found a way to compel sanctuary note how rapidly the manuscript concludes once spirit departs from it it was as though hopes normally acute interest in detail and personality left him at that point helse could have been his supportbut he knew her only a month or so while he had known spirit all her life this spirit was in fact the most significant figure in hopes life and it was her loss that affected him most profoundly this insight may be critical to proper comprehension of the subsequent career of the tyrant though no other biography has remarked upon it others treat her presence as incidental to his career this was as the following manuscripts will demonstrate grossly in error hope hubris loved honored and needed his sister spiritall of his life this document is presented with compassion and pride by hopie megan hubris daughter of the tyrant june
