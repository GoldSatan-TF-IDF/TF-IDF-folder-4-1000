the litany of the seven kisses by clark ashton smith april i i kiss thy handsthy hands whose fingers are delicate and the pale as the petals of the white lotus ii i kiss thy hair which has the lustre of black jewels and is darker than lethe flowering by midnight through the moonless slumber of poppyscented lands iii i kiss thy brow which resembles the rising moon in a valley of cedars iv i kiss thy cheeks where lingers a faint flush like the reflection of a rose upheld to an urn of alabaster v i kiss thine eyelids and liken them to the purple veined flowers and close beneath the oppression of a topic evening in a land where the sunsets are bright as the flames of burning amber vi i kiss thy throat whose ardent pallor is the pallor of marble warmed by the autumn sun vii i kiss thy mouth which has the savour and perfume of fruit made moist with spray from a magic fountain in the secret paradise that we alone shall fine a paradise whence they that come shall nevermore depart for the waters thereof are lethe and the fruit is the fruit of the tree of life
