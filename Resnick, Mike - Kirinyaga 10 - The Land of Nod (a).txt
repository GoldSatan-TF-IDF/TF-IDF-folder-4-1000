the land of nod once many years ago there was a kikuyu warrior who left his village and wandered off in search of adventure armed only with a spear he slew the mighty lion and the cunning leopard then one day he came upon an elephant he realized that his spear was useless against such a beast but before he could back away or find cover the elephant charged his only hope was divine intervention and he begged ngai who rules the universe from his throne atop kirinyaga the holy mountain that men now call mount kenya to find him and pluck him from the path of the elephant but ngai did not respond and the elephant picked the warrior up with its trunk and hurled him high into the air and he landed in a distant thorn tree his skin was badly torn by the thorns but at least he was safe since he was on a branch some twenty feet above the ground after he was sure the elephant had left the area the warrior climbed down then he returned home and ascended the holy mountain to confront ngai what is it that you want of me asked ngai when the warrior had reached the summit i want to know why you did not come said the warrior angrily all my life i have worshiped you and paid tribute to you did you not hear me ask for your help i heard you answered ngai then why did you not come to my aid demanded the warrior are you so lacking in godly powers that you could not find me after all these years you still do not understand said ngai sternly it is you who must search for me my son edward picked me up at the police station on biashara street just after midnight the sleek british vehicle hovered a few inches above the ground while i got in and then his chauffeur began taking us back to his house in the ngong hills this is becoming tedious he said activating the shimmering privacy barrier so that we could not be overheard he tried to present a judicial calm but i knew he was furious you would think they would tire of it i agreed we must have a serious talk he said you have been back only two months and this is the fourth time i have had to bail you out of jail i have broken no kikuyu laws i said calmly as we raced through the dark ominous slums of nairobi on our way to the affluent suburbs you have broken the laws of kenya he said and like it or not that is where you now live im an official in the government and i will not have you constantly embarrassing me he paused struggling with his temper look at you i have offered to buy you a new wardrobe why must you wear that ugly old kikoi it smells even worse than it looks is there now a law against dressing like a kikuyu i asked him no he said as he commanded the miniature bar to appear from beneath the floor and poured himself a drink but there is a law against creating a disturbance in a restaurant i paid for my meal i noted as we turned onto langata road and headed out for the suburbs in the kenya shillings that you gave me that does not give you the right to hurl your food against the wall simply because it is not cooked to your taste he glared at me barely able to contain his anger youre getting worse with each offense if i had been anyone else youd have spent the night in jail as it is i had to agree to pay for the damage you caused it was eland i explained the kikuyu do not eat game animals it was not eland he said setting his glass down and lighting a smokeless cigarette the last eland died in a german zoo a year after you left for kirinyaga it was a modified soybean product genetically enhanced to taste like eland he paused then sighed deeply if you thought it was eland why did you order it the server said it was steak i assumed he meant the meat of a cow or an ox this has got to stop said edward we are two grown men why cant we reach an accomodation he stared at me for a long time i can deal with rational men who disagree with me i do it at government house every day but i cannot deal with a fanatic i am a rational man i said are you he demanded yesterday you showed my wifes nephew how to apply the githani test for truthfulness and he practically burned his brothers tongue off his brother was lying i said calmly he who lies faces the redhot blade with a dry mouth whereas he who has nothing to fear has enough moisture on his tongue so that he cannot be burned try telling a sevenyearold boy that he has nothing to fear when hes being approached by a sadistic older brother who is brandishing a redhot knife snapped my son a uniformed watchman waved us through to the private road where my son lived and when we reached our driveway the chauffeur pulled our british vehicle up to the edge of the force field it identified us and vanished long enough for us to pass through and soon we came to the front door edward got out of the vehicle and approached his residence as i followed him he clenched his fists in a physical effort to restrain his anger i agreed to let you live with us because you are an old man who was thrown off his world i left kirinyaga of my own volition i interrupted calmly it makes no difference why or how you left said my son what matters is that you are here now you are a very old man it has been many years since you have lived on earth all of your friends are dead my mother is dead i am your son and i will accept my responsibilities but you must meet me halfway i am trying to i said i doubt it i am i repeated you own son understands that even if you do not my own son has had quite enough to cope with since my divorce and remarriage the last thing he needs is a grandfather filling his head with wild tales of some kikuyu utopia it is a failed utopia i corrected him they would not listen to me and so they are doomed to become another kenya what is so wrong with that said edward kenya is my home and i am proud of it he paused and stared at me and now it is your home again you must speak of it with more respect i lived in kenya for many years before i emigrated to kirinyaga i said i can live here again nothing has changed that is not so said my son we have built a transport system beneath nairobi and there is now a spaceport at watamu on the coast we have closed down the nuclear plants our power is now entirely thermal drawn from beneath the floor of the rift valley in fact he added with the pride that always accompanied the descriptions of his new wifes attainments susan was instrumental in the changeover you misunderstood me edward i replied kenya remains unchanged in that it continues to ape the europeans rather than remain true to its own traditions the security system identified us and opened his house to us we walked through the foyer past the broad winding staircase the led to the bedroom wing the servants were waiting for us and the butler took edwards coat from him then we passed the doorways the lounge and drawing room both of which were filled with roman statues and french paintings and rows of beautifullybound british books finally we came to edwards study where he turned and spoke in a low tone to the butler we wish to be alone the servants vanished as if they had been nothing but holograms where is susan i asked for my daughterinlaw was nowhere to be seen we were at a party at the cameroon ambassadors new home when the call came through that you had been arrested again he answered you broke up a very enjoyable bridge game my guess is that shes in the tub or in bed cursing your name i was about to mention that cursing my name to the god of the europeans would not prove effective but i decided that my son would not like to hear that at this moment so i was silent as i looked at my surroundings i reflected that not only had all of edwards belongings come from the europeans but that even his house had been taken from them for it consisted of many rectangular rooms and all kikuyu knew or should have known that demons dwell in corners and the only proper shape for a home is round edward walked briskly to his desk activated his computer and read his messages and then turned to me there is another message from the government he announced they want to see you next tuesday at noon i have already told them i will not accept their money i said i have performed no service for them he put on his lecture face we are no longer a poor country he said we pride ourselves that none of our infirm or elderly goes hungry i will not go hungry if the restaurants will stop trying to feed me unclean animals the government is just making sure that you do not become a financial burden to me said edward refusing to let me change the subject you are my son i said i raised you and fed you and protected you when you were young now i am old and you will do the same for me that is our tradition well it is our governments tradition to provide a financial safety net to families who are supporting elderly members he said and i could tell that the last trace of kikuyu within him had vanished that he was entirely a kenyan you are a wealthy man i pointed out you do not need their money i pay my taxes he said lighting another smokeless cigarette to hide his defensiveness it would be foolish not to accept the benefits that accrue to us you may live a very long time we have every right to that money it is dishonorable to accept what you do not need i replied tell them to leave us alone he leaned back half sitting on his desk they wouldnt even if i asked them to they must be wakamba or maasai i said making no effort to hide my contempt they are kenyans he answered just as you and i are yes i said suddenly feeling the weight of my years yes i must work very hard at remembering that you will save me more trips to the police station if you can said my son i nodded and went off to my room he had supplied me with a bed and mattress but after so many years of living in my hut on kirinyaga i found the bed uncomfortable so every night i removed the blanket and placed it on the floor then lay down and slept on it but tonight sleep would not come for i kept reliving the past two months in my mind everything i saw everything i heard made me remember why i had left kenya in the first place why i had fought so long and so hard to obtain kirinyagas charter i rolled onto my side propped my head on my hand and looked out the window hundreds of stars were twinkling brightly in the clear cloudless sky i tried to imagine which of them was kirinyaga i had been the mundumugu the witch doctor who was charged with establishing our kikuyu utopia i served you more selflessly than any other i whispered staring at a flickering verdant star and you betrayed me worse you have betrayed ngai neither he nor i shall ever seek you out again i lay my head back down turned away from the window and closed my eyes determined to look into the skies no more in the morning my son stopped by my room you have slept on the floor again he noted have they passed a law against that now i demanded he sighed deeply sleep any way you want i stared at him you look very impressive i began thank you in your european clothes i concluded i have an important meeting with the finance minister today he looked at his timepiece in fact i must leave now or i will be late he paused uneasily have you considered what we spoke about yesterday we spoke of many things i said i am referring to the kikuyu retirement village i have lived in a village i said and that is not one it is a twentystory tower of steel and glass built to imprison the elderly we have been through all this before said my son it would be a place for you to make new friends i have a new friend i said i shall be visiting him this evening good he said maybe hell keep you out of trouble i arrived at the huge titaniumandglass laboratory complex just before midnight the night had turned cool and a breeze was blowing gently from the south the moon had passed behind a cloud and it was difficult to find the side gate in the darkness eventually i did find it though and kamau was waiting for me he deactivated a small section of the electronic barrier long enough for me to step through jambo mzee he said hello wise old man jambo mzee i replied for he was almost as old as i myself was i have come to see with my own eyes if you were telling the truth he nodded and turned and i followed him between the tall angular buildings that hovered over us casting eerie shadows along the narrow walkways and channeling all the noises of the city in our direction our path was lined with whistling thorn and yellow fever trees cloned from the few remaining specimens rather than the usual introduced european shrubbery here and there were ornamental displays of grasses from the vanished savannahs it is strange to see so much true african vegetation here in kenya i remarked since i have returned from kirinyaga my eyes have hungered for it you have seen a whole world of it he replied with unconcealed envy there is more to a world than greenery i said when all is said and done there is little difference between kirinyaga and kenya both have turned their backs on ngai kamau came to a halt and gestured around him at the looming metal and glass and concrete buildings that totally covered the cool swamps from which nairobi took its name i do not know how you can prefer this to kirinyaga i did not say i preferred it i replied suddenly aware that the everpresent noises of the city had been overshadowed by the droning hum of machines then you do miss kirinyaga i miss what kirinyaga might have been as for these i said indicating the immense structures they are just buildings they are european buildings he said bitterly they were built by men who are no longer kikuyu or luo or embu but merely kenyans they are filled with corners he paused and i thought approvingly how much you sound like me no wonder you sought me out when i returned to kenya nairobi is home to eleven million people he continued it stinks of sewage the air is so polluted there are days when you can actually see it the people wear european clothes and worship the europeans god how could you turn your back on utopia for this i held up my hands i have only ten fingers he frowned i do not understand do you remember the story of the little dutch boy who put his finger in the dike kamau shook his head and spat contemptuously on the ground i do not listen to european stories perhaps you are wise not to i acknowledged at any rate the dike of tradition with which i had surrounded kirinyaga began to spring leaks they were few and easily plugged at first but as the society kept evolving and growing they became many and soon i did not have enough fingers to plug them all i shrugged so i left before i was washed away have they another mundumugu to replace you he asked i am told that they have a doctor to cure the sick and a christian minister to tell them how to worship the god of the europeans and a computer to tell them how to react to any situation that might arise i said they no longer need a mundumugu then ngai has forsaken them he stated no i corrected him they have forsaken ngai i apologize mundumugu he said with deference you are right of course he began walking again and soon a strong pungent odor came to my nostrils a scent i had never encountered before but which stirred some memory deep within my soul we are almost there said kamau i heard a low rumbling sound not like a predator growling but rather like a vast machine purring with power he is very nervous continued kamau speaking in a soft monotone make no sudden movements he has already tried to kill two of his daytime attendants and then we were there just as the moon emerged from its cloud cover and shone down on the awesome creature that stood facing us he is magnificent i whispered a perfect replication agreed kamau height ten feet eight inches at the shoulder weight seven tons and each tusk is exactly pounds the huge animal stared at me through the flickering force field that surrounded it and tested the cool night breeze striving to pick up my scent remarkable i said you understand the cloning process do you not asked kamau i understand what cloning is i answered i know nothing of the exact process in this case they took some cells from his tusks which have been on display in the museum for more than two centuries created the proper nutrient solution and this is the result ahmed of marsabit the only elephant ever protected by presidential decree lives again i read that he was always accompanied by two guards no matter where he roamed on mount marsabit i said have they also ignored tradition i see no one but you where is the other guard there are no guards the entire complex is protected by a sophisticated electronic security system are you not a guard i asked he kept the shame from his voice but he could not banish it from his face even in the moonlight i could see it i am a paid companion of the elephant of ahmed i am sorry i said we cannot all be mundumugus he answered when you are my age in a culture that worships youth you take what is offered to you true i said i looked back at the elephant i wonder if he has any memories of his former life of the days when he was the greatest of all living creatures and mount marsabit was his kingdom he knows nothing of marasbit answered kamau but he knows something is wrong he knows he was not born to spend his life in a tiny yard surrounded by a glowing force field he paused sometimes late at night he faces the north and lifts his trunk and cries out his loneliness and misery to the technicians it is just an annoyance usually they tell me to feed him as if food will assuage his sorrow it is not even real food but something they have concocted in their laboratories he does not belong here i agreed i know said kamau but then neither do you mzee you should be back on kirinyaga living as the kikuyu were meant to live i frowned no one on kirinyaga is living as the kikuyu were meant to live i sighed deeply i think perhaps the time for mundumugus is past this cannot be true he protested who else can be the repository of our traditions the interpretor of our laws our traditions are as dead as his i said gesturing toward ahmed then i turned back to kamau do you mind if i ask you a question certainly not mundumugu i am glad you sought me out and i have enjoyed our conversations since i returned to kenya i told him but something puzzles me since you feel so strongly about the kikuyu why did i not know you during our struggle to find a homeland why did you remain behind when we emigrated to kirinyaga i could see him wrestling with himself to produce an answer finally the battle was over and the old man seemed to shrink an inch or two i was terrified he admitted of the spaceship i asked no then what frightened you another internal struggle and then an answer you did mzee me i repeated surprised you were always so sure of yourself he said always such a perfect kikuyu you made me afraid that i wasnt good enough that was ridiculous i said firmly was it he countered my wife was a catholic my son and daughter bore christian names and i myself had grown used to european clothes and european conveniences he paused i was afraid if i went with you and i wanted to i have been cursing myself for my cowardice ever since that soon i would complain about missing the technology and comfort i had left behind and that you would banish me he would not meet my gaze but stared at the ground i did not wish to become an outcast on the world that was the last hope of my people you are wiser than i suspected i thought aloud i uttered a compassionate lie you would not have been an outcast you are sure i am sure i said laying a comforting hand on his bony shoulder in fact i wish you had been there to support me when the end came what good would the support of an old man have been you are not just any old man i answered the word of a descendant of johnstone kamau would have carried much weight among the council of elders that was another reason i was afraid to come he replied the words flowing a little more easily this time how could i live up to my name for everyone knows that johnstone kamau became jomo kenyatta the great burning spear of the kikuyu how could i possibly compare to such a man as that you compare more favorably than you think i said reassuringly i could have used the passion of your belief surely you had support from the people he said i shook my head even my own apprentice who i was preparing to succeed me abandoned me in fact i believe he is at the university just down the road even as we speak in the end the people rejected the discipline of our traditions and the teachings of ngai for the miracles and comforts of the europeans i suppose i should not be surprised considering how many times it has happened here in africa i looked thoughtfully at the elephant i am as much an anachronism as ahmed time has forgotten us both but ngai has not ngai too my friend i said our day has passed there is no place left for us not in kenya not on kirinyaga not anywhere perhaps it was something in the tone of my voice or perhaps in some mystic way ahmed understood what i was saying whatever the reason the elephant stepped forward to the edge of the force field and stared directly at me it is lucky we have the field for protection remarked kamau he would not hurt me i said confidently he has hurt men whom he had less reason to attack but not me i said lower the field to a height of five feet but do as i say i ordered him yes mundumugu he replied unhappily going to a small control box and punching in a code suddenly the mild visual distortion vanished at eye level i reached out a reassuring hand and a moment later ahmed ran the tip of his trunk gently across my face and body then sighed deeply and stood there swaying gently as he transferred his weight from one foot to the other i would not have believed it if i had not seen it said kamau almost reverently are we not all ngais creations i said even ahmed asked kamau who do you think created him he shrugged again and did not answer i remained for a few more minutes watching the magnificent creature while kamau returned the force field to its former position then the night air became uncomfortably cold as so often happened at this altitude and i turned to kamau i must leave now i said i thank you for inviting me here i would not have believed this miracle had i not seen it with my own eyes the scientists think it is their miracle he said you and i know better i replied he frowned but why do you think ngai has allowed ahmed to live again at this time and in this place i paused for a long moment trying to formulate an answer and found that i couldnt there was a time when i knew with absolute certainty why ngai did what he did i said at last now i am not so sure what kind of talk is that from a mundumugu demanded kamau it was not long ago that i would wake up to the song of birds i said as we left ahmeds enclosure and walked to the side gate through which i had entered and i would look across the river that wound by my village on kirinyaga and see impala and zebra grazing on the savannah now i wake up to the sound and smell of modern nairobi and then i look out and see a featureless grey wall that separates my sons house from that of his neighbor i paused i think this must be my punishment for failing to bring ngais word to my people will i see you again he asked as we reached the gate and he deactivated a small section long enough for me to pass through if it will not be an imposition i said the great koriba an imposition he said with a smile my son finds me so i replied he gives me a room in his house but he would prefer i lived elsewhere and his wife is ashamed of my bare feet and my kikoi she is constantly buying european shoes and clothing for me to wear my son works inside the laboratory said kamau pointing to his sons thirdfloor office with some pride he has seventeen men working for him seventeen i must not have looked impressed for he continued less enthusiastically it is he who got me this job so that i wouldnt have to live with him the job of paid companion i said a bittersweet expression crossed his face i love my son koriba and i know that he loves me but i think that he is also a little bit ashamed of me there is a thin line between shame and embarrassment i said my son glides between one and the other like the pendulum of a clock kamau seemed grateful to hear that his situation was not unique you are welcome to live with me mundumugu he said and i could tell that it was an earnest offer not just a polite lie that he hoped i would reject we would have much to talk about that is very considerate of you i said but it will be enough if i may visit you from time to time on those days when i find kenyans unbearable and must speak to another kikuyu as often as you wish he said kwaheri mzee kwaheri i responded farewell i took the slidewalk down the noisy crowded streets and boulevards that had once been the sprawling athi plains an area that had swarmed with a different kind of life and got off when i came to the airbus platform an airbus glided up a few minutes later almost empty at this late hour and began going north floating perhaps ten inches above the ground the trees that lined the migration route had been replaced by a dense angular forest of steel and glass and tightlybonded alloys as i peered through a window into the night it seemed for a few moments that i was also peering into the past here where the titaniumandglass courthouse stood was the very spot where the burning spear had first been arrested for having the temerity to suggest that his country did not belong to the british over there by the new eightstory post office building was where the last lion had died over there by the water recycling plant my people had vanquished the wakamba in glorious and bloody battle some years ago we have arrived mzee said the driver and the bus hovered a few inches above the ground while i made my way to the door arent you chilly dressed in just a blanket like that i did not deign to answer him but stepped out to the sidewalk which did not move here in the suburbs as did the slidewalks of the city i prefered it for man was meant to walk not be transported effortlessly by mileslong beltways i approached my sons enclave and greeted the guards who all knew me for i often wandered through the area at night they passed me through with no difficulty and as i walked i tried to look across the centuries once more to see the mudandgrass huts the bomas and shambas of my people but the vision was blotted out by enormous mocktudor and mockvictorian and mock colonial and mockcontemporary houses interspersed with needle like apartment buildings that reached up to stab the clouds i had no desire to speak to edward or susan for they would question me endlessly about where i had been my son would once again warn me about the thieves and muggers who prey on old men after dark in nairobi and my daughterinlaw would try to subtly suggest that i would be warmer in a coat and pants so i went past their house and walked aimlessly through the enclave until all the lights in the house had gone out when i was sure they were asleep i went to a side door and waited for the security system to identify my retina and skeletal structure as it had on so many similar nights then i quietly made my way to my room usually i dreamed of kirinyaga but this night the image of ahmed haunted my dreams ahmed eternally confined by a force field ahmed trying to imagine what lay beyond his tiny enclosure ahmed who would live and die without ever seeing another of his own kind and gradually my dream shifted to myself to koriba attached by invisible chains to a nairobi he could no longer recognize koriba trying futilely to mold kirinyaga into what it might have been koriba who once led a brave exodus of the kikuyu until one day he looked around and found that he was the only kikuyu remaining in the morning i went to visit my daughter on kirinyaga not the terraformed world but the real kirinyaga which is now called mount kenya it was here that ngai gave the diggingstick to gikuyu the first man and told him to work the earth it was here that gikuyus nine daughters became the mothers of the nine tribes of the kikuyu here that the sacred fig tree blossomed it was here millennia later that jomo kenyatta the great burning spear of the kikuyu would invoke ngais power and send the mau mau out to drive the white man back to europe and it was here that a steelandglass city of five million inhabitants sprawled up the side of the holy mountain nairobis overstrained water and sewer system simply could not accomodate any more people so the government offered enormous tax incentives to any business that would move to kirinyaga in the hope that the people would follow them and the people accomodated them vehicles spewed pollution into the atmosphere and the noise of the city at work was deafening i walked to the spot where the fig tree had once stood it was now covered by a lead foundry the slopes where the bongo and the rhinoceros once lived were hidden beneath the housing projects the winding mountain streams had all been diverted and redirected the tree beneath which deedan kimathi had been killed by the british was only a memory its place taken by a fast food restaurant the summit had been turned into a park with tram service leading to a score of souvenir shops and now i realized why kenya had become intolerable ngai no longer ruled the world from his throne atop the mountain for there was no longer any room for him there like the leopard and the golden sunbird like i myself many years ago he too had fled before this onslaught of black europeans possibly my discovery influenced my mood for the visit with my daughter did not go well but then they never did she was too much like her mother i entered my sons study late that same afternoon one of the servants said you wished to see me i said yes i do said my son as he looked up from his computer behind him were paintings of two great leaders martin luthor king and julius nyerere black men both but neither one a kikuyu please sit down i did as he asked on a chair my father he said the floor is satisfactory he sighed heavily i am too tired to argue with you i have been brushing up on my french he grimaced it is a difficult language why are you studying french i asked as you know the ambassador from cameroon has bought a house in the enclave i thought it would be advantageous to be able to speak to him in his own tongue that would be bamileke or ewondo not french i noted he does not speak either of those answered edward his family is ruling class they only spoke french in his family compound and he was educated in paris since he is the ambassador to our country why are you learning his language i asked why does he not learn swahili swahili is a street language said my son english and french are the languages of diplomacy and business his english is poor so i will speak to him in french instead he smiled smugly that ought to impress him i see i said you look disapproving he observed i am not ashamed of being a kikuyu i said why are you ashamed of being a kenyan i am not ashamed of anything he snapped i am proud of being able to speak to him in his own tongue more proud than he a visitor to kenya is to speak to you in your tongue i noted you do not understand he said evidently i agreed he stared at me silently for a moment then sighed deeply you drive me crazy he said i dont even know how we came to be discussing this i wanted to see you for a different reason he lit a smokeless cigarette took one puff and threw it into the atomizer i had a visit from father ngoma this morning i do not know him you know his parishoners though said my son a number of them have come to you for advice that is possible i admitted damn it said edward i have to live in this neighborhood and he is the parish priest he resents you telling his flock how to live especially since what you tell them is in contradiction to catholic dogma am i to lie to them then i asked cant you just refer them to father ngona i am a mundumugu i said it is my duty to advise those who come to me for guidance you have not been a mundumugu since they made you leave kirinyaga he said irritably i left of my own volition i replied calmly we are getting off the subject again said edward look if you want to stay in the mundumugu business ill rent you an office or he added contemptuously buy you a patch of dirt on which to sit and make pronouncements but you cannot practice in my house father ngomas parishoners must not like what he has to say i observed or they would not seek advice elsewhere i do not want you speaking to them again is that clear yes i said it is clear that you do not want me to speak to them again you know exactly what i mean he exploded no more verbal games maybe they worked on kirinyaga but they wont work here i know you too well he went back to staring at his computer it is most interesting i said what is he asked suspiciously glaring at me here you are surrounded by english books studying french and arguing on behalf of the priest of an italian religion not only are you not kikuyu i think perhaps you are no longer even kenyan he glared at me across his desk you drive me crazy he repeated after i left my sons study i left the house and took an airbus to the park in muthaiga miles from my son and the neighbors who were interchangeable with him once lions had stalked this terrain leopards had clung to overhanging limbs waiting for the opportunity to pounce upon their prey wildebeest and zebra and gazelles had rubbed shoulders grazing on the tall grasses giraffes had nibbled the tops of acacia trees while warthogs rooted in the earth for tubers rhinos had nibbled on thornbushes and charged furiously at any sound or sight they could not immediately identify then the kikuyu had come and cleared the land bringing with them their cattle and their oxen and their goats they had dwelt in huts of mud and grass and lived the life that we aspired to on kirinyaga but all that was in the past today the park contained nothing but a few squirrels racing across the imported kentucky blue grass and a pair of hornbills that had nested in the one of the transplanted european trees old kikuyu men dressed in shoes and pants and jackets sat on the benches that ran along the perimeter one man was tossing crumbs to an exceptionally bold starling but most of them simply sat and stared aimlessly i found an empty bench but decided not to sit on it i didnt want to be like these men who saw nothing but the squirrels and the birds when i could see the lions and the impala the warpainted kikuyu and the redclad maasai who had once stalked across this same land i continued walking suddenly restless and despite the heat of the day and the frailty of my ancient body i walked until twilight i decided could not endure dinner with my son and his wife their talk of their boring jobs their continual veiled suggestions about the retirement home their inability to comprehend either why i went to kirinyaga or why i returned so instead of going home i began walking aimlessly through the crowded city finally i looked up at the sky ngai i said silently i still do not understand i was a good mundumugu i obeyed your law i honored your rituals there must have come a day a moment a second when together we could have saved kirinyaga if you had just manifested yourself why did you abandon it when it needed you so desperately i spoke to ngai for minutes that turned into hours but he did not answer when it was ten oclock at night i decided it was time to start making my way to the laboratory complex for it would take me more than an hour to get there and kamau began working at eleven as before he deactivated the electronic barrier to let me in then escorted me to the small grassy area where ahmed was kept i did not expect to see you back so soon mzee he said i have no place else to go i answered and he nodded as if this made perfect sense to him ahmed seemed nervous until the breeze brought my scent to him then he turned to face the north extending his trunk every few moments it is as if he seeks some sign from mount marsabit i remarked for the great creatures former home was hundreds of miles north of nairobi a solitary green mountain rising out of the blazing desert he would not be pleased with what he found said kamau why do you say that i asked for no animal in our history was ever more identified with a location than the mighty ahmed with marsabit do you not read the papers or watch the news on the holo i shook my head what happens to black europeans is of no concern to me the government has evacuated the town of marsabit which sits next to the mountain they have closed the singing wells and have ordered everyone to leave the area leave marsabit why they have been burying nuclear waste at the base of the mountain for many years he said it was just revealed that some of the containers broke open almost six years ago the government hid the fact from the people and then failed to properly clean up the leak how could such a thing happen i asked though of course i knew the answer after all how does anything happen in kenya politics payoffs corruption a third of kenya is desert i said why did they not bury it there where no one lives or even thinks to travel so when this kind of disaster occurs as it always does no one is harmed he shrugged politics payoffs corruption he repeated it is our way of life ah well it is nothing to me anyway i said what happens to a mountain kilometers away does not interest me any more than i am interested in what happens to a world named after a different mountain it interests me said kamau innocent people have been exposed to radiation if they live near marsabit they are pokot and rendille i pointed out what does that matter to the kikuyu they are people and my heart goes out to them said kamau you are a good man i said i knew that from the moment we first met i pulled some peanuts from the pouch that hung around my neck the same pouch in which i used to keep charms and magical tokens i bought these for ahmed this afternoon i said may i certainly answered kamau he has few enough pleasures even a peanut will be appreciated just toss them at his feet no i said walking forward lower the barrier he lowered the force field until ahmed was able to reach his trunk out over the top when i got close enough the huge beast gently took the peanuts from my hand i am amazed said kamau when i had rejoined him even i cannot approach ahmed with impunity yet you actually fed him by hand as if he were a family pet we are each the last of our kind living on borrowed time i said he senses a kinship i remained a few more minutes then went home to another night of troubled sleep i felt ngai was trying to tell me something trying to impart some message through my dreams but though i had spent years interpreting the omens in other peoples dreams i was ignorant of my own edward was standing on the beautifully rolled lawn staring at the blackened embers of my fire i have a beautiful fire pit on the terrace he said trying unsuccessfully to hide his anger why on earth did you build a fire in the middle of the garden that is where a fire belongs i answered not in this house it doesnt i shall try to remember do you know what the landscaper will charge me to repair the damage you caused a look of concern suddenly crossed his face you havent sacrificed any animals have you no youre sure none of the neighbors is missing a dog or a cat he persisted i know the law i said and indeed kikuyu law required the sacrifice of goats and cattle not dogs and cats i am trying to obey it i find that difficult to believe but you are not obeying it edward i said what are you talking about he demanded i looked at susan who was staring at us from a secondstory window you have two wives i pointed out the younger one lives with you but the older one lives many kilometers away and sees you only when you take your children away from her on weekends this is unnatural a mans wives should all live together with him sharing the household duties linda is no longer my wife he said you know that we were divorced many years ago you can afford both i said you should have kept both in this society a man may have only one wife said edward what kind of talk is this you have lived in england and america you know that that is their law not ours i said this is kenya it is the same thing the moslems have more than one wife i replied i am not a moslem he said a kikuyu man may have as many wives as he can afford i said it is obvious that you are also not a kikuyu ive had it with this smug superiority of yours he exploded you deserted my mother because she was not a true kikuyu he continued bitterly you turned your back on my sister because she was not a true kikuyu since i was a child every time you were displeased with me you have told me that i am not a true kikuyu now you have even proclaimed that none of the thousands who followed you to kirinyaga are true kikuyus he glared furiously at me your standards are higher than kirinyaga itself can there possibly be a true kikuyu anywhere in the universe certainly i replied where can such a paragon be found he demanded right here i said tapping myself on the chest you are looking at him my days faded one into another the dullness and drudgery of them broken only by occasional nocturnal visits to the laboratory complex then one night as i met kamau at the gate i could see that his entire demeanor had changed something is wrong i said promptly are you ill no mzee it is nothing like that then what is the matter i persisted it is ahmed said kamau unable to stop tears from rolling down his withered cheeks they have decided to put him to death the day after tomorrow why i asked surprised has he attacked another keeper no said kamau bitterly the experiment was a success they know they can clone an elephant so why continue to pay for his upkeep when they can line their pockets with the remaining funds of the grant is there no one you can appeal to i demanded look at me said kamau i am an yearold man who was given his job as an act of charity who will listen to me we must do something i said he shook his head sadly they are kehees he said uncircumcised boys they do not even know what a mundumugu is do not humiliate yourself by pleading with them if i did not plead with the kikuyu on kirinyaga i replied you may be sure i will not plead with the kenyans in nairobi i tried to ignore the ceaseless hummings of the laboratory machines as i considered my options finally i looked up at the night sky the moon glowed a hazy orange through the pollution i will need your help i said at last you can depend on me good i shall return tomorrow night i turned on my heel and left without even stopping at ahmeds enclosure all that night i thought and planned in the morning i waited until my son and his wife had left the house then called kamau on the vidphone to tell him what i intended to do and how he could help next i had the computer contact the bank and withdraw my money for though i disdained shillings and refused to cash my government checks my son had found it easier to shower me with money than respect i spent the rest of the morning shopping at vehicle rental agencies until i found exactly what i wanted i had the saleswoman show me how to manipulate it practiced until nightfall hovered opposite the laboratory until i saw kamau enter the grounds and then maneuvered up to the side gate jambo mundumugu whispered kamau as he deactivated enough of the electronic barrier to accomodate the vehicle which he scrutinized carefully i backed up to ahmeds enclosure then opened the back and ordered the ramp to descend the elephant watched with an uneasy curiosity as kamau deactivated a tenfoot section of the force field and allowed the bottom of the ramp through njoo tembo i said come elephant he took a tentative step toward me then another and another when he reached the edge of his enclosure he stopped for always he had received an electrical correction when he tried to move beyond this point it took almost twenty minutes of tempting him with peanuts before he finally crossed the barrier and then clambered awkwardly up the ramp which slid in after him i sealed him into the hovering vehicle and he instantly trumpeted in panic keep him quiet until we get out of here said a nervous kamau as i joined him at the controls or hell wake up the whole city i opened a panel to the back of the vehicle and spoke soothingly and strangely enough the trumpeting ceased and the scuffling did stop as i continued to calm the frightened beast kamau piloted the vehicle out of the laboratory complex we passed through the ngong hills twenty minutes later and circled around thika in another hour when we passed kirinyaga the true snow capped kirinyaga from which ngai once ruled the world minutes after that i did not give it so much as a glance we must have been quite a sight to anyone we passed two seemingly crazy old men racing through the night in an unmarked cargo vehicle carrying a sixton monster that had been extinct for more than two centuries have you considered what effect the radiation will have on him asked kamau as we passed through isiolo and continued north i questioned my son about it i answered he is aware of the incident and says that the contamination is confined to the lower levels of the mountain i paused he also tells me it will soon be cleaned up but i do not think i believe him but ahmed must pass through the radiation zone to ascend the mountain said kamau i shrugged then he will pass through it every day he lives is a day more than he would have lived in nairobi for as much time as ngai sees fit to give him he will be free to graze on the mountains greenery and drink deep of its cool waters i hope he lives many years he said if i am to be jailed for breaking the law i would at least like to know that some lasting good came of it no one is going to jail you i assured him all that will happen is that you will be fired from a job that no longer exists that job supported me he said unhappily the burning spear would have no use for you i decided you bring no honor to his name it is as i have always known i am the last true kikuyu i pulled my remaining money out of my pouch and held it out to him here i said but what about yourself mzee he said forcing himself not to grab for it take it i said i have no use for it asante sana mzee he said taking it from my hand and stuffing it into a pocket thank you mzee we fell silent then each occupied with our own thoughts as nairobi receded further and further behind us i compared my feelings with those i had experienced when i had left kenya behind for kirinyaga i had been filled with optimism then certain that we would create the utopia i could envision so clearly in my mind the thing i had not realized is that a society can be a utopia for only an instant once it reaches a state of perfection it cannot change and still be a utopia and it is the nature of societies to grow and evolve i do not know when kirinyaga became a utopia the instant came and went without my noticing it now i was seeking utopia again but this time of a more limited more realizable nature a utopia for one man a man who knew his own mind and would die before compromising i had been misled in the past so i was not as elated as the day we had left for kirinyaga being older and wiser i felt a calm quiet certitude rather than more vivid emotions an hour after sunrise we came to a huge green fog enshrouded mountain set in the middle of a bleached desert a single swirling dust devil was visible against the horizon we stopped then unsealed the elephants compartment we stood back as ahmed stepped cautiously down the ramp his every movement tense with apprehension he took a few steps as if to convince himself that he was truly on solid ground again then raised his trunk to examine the scents of his new and ancient home slowly the great beast turned toward marsabit and suddenly his whole demeanor changed no longer cautious no longer fearful he spent almost a full minute eagerly examining the smells that wafted down to him then without a backward glance he strode confidently to the foothills and vanished into the foliage a moment later we heard him trumpet and then he was climbing the mountain to claim his kingdom i turned to kamau you had better take the vehicle back before they come looking for it are you not coming with me he asked surprised no i replied like ahmed i will live out my days on marsabit but that means you too must pass through the radiation what of it i said with an unconcerned shrug i am an old man how much time can i have left weeks months surely not a year probably the burden of my years will kill me long before the radiation does i hope you are right said kamau i should hate to think of you spending your final days in agony i have seen men who live in agony i told him they are the old mzees who gather in the park each morning leading lives devoid of purpose waiting only for death to claim another of their number i will not share their fate a frown crossed his face like an early morning shadow and i could see what he was thinking he would have to take the vehicle back and face the consequences alone i will remain here with you he said suddenly i cannot turn my back on eden a second time it is not eden i said it is only a mountain in the middle of a desert nonetheless i am staying we will start a new utopia it will be kirinyaga again only done right this time i have work to do i thought important work and you would desert me in the end as they have all deserted me better that you leave now you must not worry about the authorities i said in the same reassuring tones with which i spoke to the elephant return the vehicle to my son and he will take care of everything why should he asked kamau suspiciously because i have always been an embarrassment to him and if it were known that i stole ahmed from a government laboratory i would graduate from an embarrassment to a humiliation trust me he will not allow this to happen if your son asks about you what shall i tell him the truth i answered he will not come looking for me what will stop him the fear that he might find me and have to bring me back with him i said kamaus face reflected the battle that was going on inside him his terror of returning alone pitted against his fear of the hardships of life on the mountain it is true that my son would worry about me he said hesitantly as if expecting me to contradict him perhaps even hoping that i would and i would never see my grandchildren again you are the last kikuyu indeed the last human being that i shall ever see i thought i will utter one last lie disguised as a question and if you do not see through it then you will leave with a clear conscience and i will have performed a final act of compassion go home my friend i said for what is more important than a grandchild come with me koriba he urged they will not punish you if you explain why you kidnapped him i am not going back i said firmly not now not ever ahmed and i are both anachronisms it is best that we live out our lives here away from a world we no longer recognize a world that has no place for us kamau looked at the mountain you and he are joined at the soul he concluded perhaps i agreed i laid my hand on his shoulder kwaheri kamau kwaheri mzee he replied unhappily please ask ngai to forgive me for my weakness it seemed to take him forever to activate the vehicle and turn it toward nairobi but finally he was out of sight and i turned and began ascending the foothills i had wasted many years seeking ngai on the wrong mountain men of lesser faith might believe him dead or disinterested but i knew that if ahmed could be reborn after all others of his kind were long dead then ngai must surely be nearby overseeing the miracle i would spend the rest of the day regaining my strength and then in the morning i would begin searching for him again on marsabit and this time i knew i would find him
