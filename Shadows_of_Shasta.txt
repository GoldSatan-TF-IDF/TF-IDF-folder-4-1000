foundations seamed and knit and wrought and bound by golden bars sierras peaks serenely sit and challenge heavens sentrystars why this book because last year in the heart of the sierras i saw women and children chained together and marched down from their cool healthy homes to degradation and death on the reservation at the side of this long chained line urged on and kept in order by bayonets rode a young officer splendid in gold and brass and newly burnished from that now famous charityschool on the hudson these women and children were guilty of no crime they were not even accused of wrong but their fathers and brothers lay dead in battleharness on the mountain heights and in the lava beds and these few silent survivors like israel of old were being led into captivity but unlike the chosen children never to return to the beloved heart of their mountains do you doubt these statements about the treatment of the indians then read this from the man the fiend in the form of man who for years and until recently had charge of all the indians in the united states from reports and testimony before me i find that indians removed to the reservation or indian territory die off so rapidly that the race must soon become extinct if they are so removed in this connection i recommend the early removal of all the indians to the indian territory the above coarse attempt at secondhand wit is quoted from memory but if the exact words are not given the substance is there and indeed the idea and expression is not at all new i know if you contemplate the indian from the railroad platform as you cross the plains you will almost conclude from the dreadful specimens there seen that the indian commissioner was not so widely out of the way in that brutal desire but the real indian is not there the special correspondent will not find him though he travel ten thousand miles he is in the mountains a free man yet not a beggar not a thief but the brightest bravest truest man alive every few years the soldiers find him and they do not despise him when found think of captain jack with his sixty braves holding the whole army at bay for half a year think of chief joseph to whose valor and virtues the brave and brilliant soldiers sent to fight him bear immortal testimony seamed with scars of battle and bloody from the fight of the deadly day and the night preceding his wife dying from a bullet his boy lying dead at his feet his command decimated bullets flying thick as hail this indian walked right into the camp of his enemy gun in hand and then not like a beaten man not like a captive but like a king demanded to know the terms upon which his few remaining people could be allowed to live when a brave man beats a brave man in battle he likes to treat him well as witness grant and lee and so generals howard and miles made fair terms with the conquered chief the action of the government which followed makes one sick at heart let us in charity call it imbecility but before whose door shall we lay the dead months after the surrender this brave but now heartbroken chief cried out give my people water or they will die this is mud and slime that we have to drink here on this reservation more than half are dead already give us the water of our mountains and will you not give us back just one mountain too there are not many of us left now we will not want much now give us back just one mountain so that these women and children may live take all the valleys but you cannot plow the mountains give us back just one little mountain with cool clear water and then these children can live and think of standing bear and his people taken by fraud and force from their lands to the indian territory reservation and after the usual hardships and wrongs incident to such removals with no hope from a government which neither kept its promises nor listened to their appeals setting out to try to get back to omaha think of these men stealing away in the night leaving their little children their wives and parents prostrate dying destitute they were told that they could not leave that they must stay there that they would be followed and shot if they attempted to go away they had no money they had no food they were sick and faint they were on foot and but poorly clad yet they struggled on through the snow day after day week after week leaving a bloody trail where they passed leaving their dead in the snow where they passed and this awful journey lasted for more than fifty days and what happened to these poor indians after that fearful journey they did not go to the white man for help they did not go back to their old homes they troubled no one they went to a neighboring friendly tribe this tribe gave them a little land and they instantly went to work to make homes and prepare a place for the few of their number still alive whom they had left behind then came the order from washington and the chief was arrested while plowing in the field in a speech made by him after the arrest and when he was about to be taken back the chief said i wanted to go back to my old place north i wanted to save myself and my tribe i built a good stable i raised cattle and hogs and all kinds of stock i broke land all these things i lost by some bad man any one knows to take a man from a cold climate and put him in the hot sun down in the south it would kill him we refused to go down there we afterwards went down to see our friends and see how they liked it brothers i come home now i took my brothers and friends and came back here we went to work i had hold of the handles of my plow eight days ago i was at work on my farm which the omahas gave me i had sowed some spring wheat and wished to sow some more i was living peaceably with all men i have never committed any crime i was arrested and brought back as a prisoner does your law do that i have been told since the great war all men were free men and that no man can be made a prisoner unless he does wrong i have done no wrong and yet i am here a prisoner have you a law for white men and a different law for those who are not white i have been going around for three years i have lost all my property my constant thought is what man has done this of course i know i cannot say no whatever they say i must do i must do it i know you have an order to send me to the indian territory and we must obey it afterwards speaking of the terrible days at the reservation this indian said to an officer we counted our dead for awhile but when all my children and half the tribe were dead we did not take any notice of anything much when my son was dying he begged me to take his bones back to the old home if ever i got away in that little box are the bones of my son i have tried to take them back to be buried with our fathers i may here add that in the meantime the brother of this indian who was left in charge of the tribe was accused of trying to get away also he protested his innocence but the agent had him arrested and brought before him then he ordered him to be ironed the proud free savage begged not to be put in irons but the brutal agent persisted the indian resisted and was shot dead on the spot think of the cheyennes last year they too had tried to escape from the reservation and reach their homes through the deep snow this was their only offense no man had ever accused them of any other crime than this love of their native haunts this longing for home they were dying there on the reservation more than half had already died and now when taken they refused to go back the officer attempted to starve them into submission they were shut up in a pen without food naked starving the snow whistling through the pen children freezing to death in their mothers arms but they would not submit knowing now that they must die they determined to die in action rather than freeze and starve like beasts in a pen at a concerted signal they attempted to break through the soldiers and reach the open plain an old man was carried on the back of his tottering son a mounted soldier pursued them and hacked father and son to pieces with the same sabrecuts a mother was seen flying over the snow with two children clinging about her neck the wretched savages separated and ran in all directions but the mounted men cut them down in the snow no one asked or even would accept quarter they fought with sticks stones fists their teeth like wild beasts they wanted to die one little group escaped to a ravine there they were found killing each other with a sort of knife made from an old piece of hoop and yet you believe manhunting is over in america it is impossible to write with composure or evenness on this subject one wants to rise up and crush things i have mentioned two tribes near at hand whose histories are not unfamiliar to the public ear but what if i should recite the wrongs of tribes far away far beyond the rocky mountains where the indian agent has to answer to no one you would not believe onetenth part told you the terrible stories of the cheyennes and the poncas are very mild chapters in the history of our indian policy under the stars and stripes these scenes are repeated year after year and they will be continued until they are made impossible by the civilization and sense of justice which righted that other though far less terrible wrong as that greatest man has said we are making history in america this is a conspicuous fact that no one who would be remembered in this century should forget we are making dreadful history dreadfully fast how terrible it will all read when the writer and reader of these lines are long since forgotten ages may roll by we may build a city over every dead tribes bones we may bury the last indian deep as the eternal gulf but these records will remain and will rise up in testimony against us to the last day of our race j m chapter i mount shasta to lord all godland lift the brow familiar to the moon to top the universal world to prop the hollow heavens up to vow stern constancy with stars to keep eternal watch while eons sleep to tower proudly up and touch gods purple garmenthems that sweep the cold blue north oh this were much where stormborn shadows hide and hunt i knew thee in thy glorious youth and loved thy vast face white as truth i stood where thunderbolts were wont to smite thy titanfashioned front and heard dark mountains rock and roll i saw the lightnings gleaming rod reach forth and write on heavens scroll the awful autograph of god and what a mighty heart these sierras have kissing the purple of heaven now and now in their awful deeps hiding the shrinking form of darkness from the sun the shaggy monsters that prowl there the mountains of gold that lie waiting there the mystery and the splendor oh keep with me my friend for a little while in the sierras breathe their balm and health see their sublimity feel their might and their majesty step upward as on stepping stairs to heaven and my word for it you will be none the worse in a canyon here deep deep away down in the darkness where night seems to have an abiding place where the sun sifts through the pinetops timidly where the loftiest trees tiptoe up and seem to strive to reach out of the edge of the chasm there gurgles a little muddy stream among the boulders about the miners legs as they bend their backs wearily and toil for gold here the smoke curls up from a low log cabin there a squirrel barks a nut on the roof of a ruined and deserted miners home and away up yonder where the deep gorge is so narrow you can almost leap across it the wild beasts prowl as if it were really night and great owls beat their wings against the boughs of the dense wood in everlasting darkness but high over gorge and wilderness gleaming against the cold blue sky towers mount shasta the monarch of the sierras here where the canyon debouches into the little valley once stood a populous mining camp and a little further on where the sun fell in full splendor a few farms of a primitive kind tended by brokendown old miners lay the old glory of the camp was gone and only a few battered and crippled men were left it was as if there had been a great battle of the giants and the victorious and successful had gone away with all the fruits of victory and left the wounded the helpless the halfhearted behind the mining camp at the mouth of the great canyon had been worked out so far as the placer mines went and these few broken men who remained as a rule were turning their attention to other things here one had planted a little garden on the hillside on a spot that had once been a graveyard there an old lawyer had grown grapevines all over and about the door and chimney of his cabin till men said it looked like a spiderweb but old fortynine only bored deeper and deeper into the spur of the mountain and paid but little attention to any of the changes that went on around him he had been working in that tunnel alone for nearly twentyfive years he was a man with a history men said a murderer he shunned men and men shunned him was he rich he professed to be very poor men said he must be worth a million would a man work on twentyfive years in one tunnel and all alone for nothing but if rich why did he remain still further down and quite on the edge of the valley stood another cabin and this was quite overgrown with vines and was quite hidden away in a growth of pines that gathered over it then there was an undergrowth of fruit trees that grew inside the fence and about the lonely porch on this porch had sat for years and years a tawny silent old woman she was sickly had neither wealth wit nor beauty and so so far as the world went was left quite alone but there was another and an allsufficient reason why neither man or woman came that way she was an indian do not imagine this a wild indian woman indian she was but remember the catholics had more than half civilized nearly all the native californians long before we undertook to kill them this indian woman would have been called by strangers a mexican woman she was very religious and had imbued her boy with all her beautiful faith and simple piety i know that the spectacle of an old indian woman and her halfbreed son represented as the morality and religion of a camp made up of civilized saxons will seem somewhat novel to you but i knew this indian boy and his mother well and know every foot of the ground i intend to go over and every fact i propose to narrate and if you are not prepared to receive this as truth i prefer you to close this page right here to make a moments digression with your permission let me state briefly and frankly once for all that the only really religious unquestioning and absolutely devout christians i ever met in america are the indians i know of no other people so faithful and so blindly true to their belief outside of the peasantry of italy be their beautiful faith born of ignorance or what i do not say i simply assert that it exists there is no devotion so true as that of a converted indian maybe it is the devotion of idolatry the faith of superstition but i repeat it is sincere and let me further say it seems to me whatever is worth believing at all is worth believing utterly and entirely just as these simple children of the wilderness believe without doubt or question i know nothing so beautiful may i say picturesque as the ummatilla indians of oregon at worship on sunday not a man woman or child of all the tribe absent not one voice silent when the hymns are given out in all that vast gaily colored and singular assemblage this is the tribe of which the white settlers asked and received protection last year when the shoshonees ravaged the country beat off the soldiers and slew some of the settlers and yet there is a bill before congress today to take away the few remaining acres from this tribe and open up the place to white settlers indeed it seems that every member of congress from oregon has just this one mission for the first and almost the only thing he does while there is to introduce and urge the passage of this bill whereby the red man is to be turned out of his welltilled fields and the white man turned into them in truth these very fields have long been staked off and claimed by bold bad white men who hover about the borders of this reservation waiting for the longpromised law which is to take this land from the owners and give it to them they nominate their members of congress on his pledge and bond and constant promise to take this land from the indian they vote for and elect the only member of congress from this state on that promise certain that their absolute ownership of this graveyard of the indian is only a question of time year by year the graveyard grows broader the fields grow narrower they grow less in number for now and then an indian is found wandering away from the reservation to his former huntinggrounds and ancient graves of his fathers he seldom comes back sometimes his murderers trouble themselves to throw the body in the brush or some gorge or canyon but most frequently it is left where it falls to say that all the people or the best people of this brave young state approve of this would be unfair untrue yet this does not save the indian who is doing his best to fit into the new order of things around him he is shot down and neither grand or petit jury can be found to punish his murderer but to the story this little piece of land where the old indian woman had lived and brought up her boy was rich and valuable it was therefore coveted by the white man at first men had said she will die soon the boy will then sell the hut for a song gamble off the money and then go the way of all who are stained with the dark and tawny blood of the savage death in a ditch from some unknown rifle or death by the fever in the new reservation but the old woman still lived on and the boy by his industry sobriety duty and devotion to his mother put to shame the very best among the new generation of white men in the mountains the singular manhood of john logan was the subject of remark by all who knew him with the few true men on this savage edge of the world it made him fast friends with the many outlaws and evil natures it made him the subject of envy and bitter hatred what power behind this boy had lifted him up and led him on surely no indian woman wholly unlettered in the ways of the white man good and true as she may have been had brought him up to this high place on which he now stood who was his father and what strong hand had reached out all these years and kept his mother there in that little hut with her boy while her tribe perished or passed away to the hated and horrible reservation down toward the sea who was his father the camp had asked this a thousand times the boy himself had looked into the deep pathetic eyes of his mother and asked the question in his heart for many and many a year but he never opened his lips to ask her it was too sad too sacred a subject and he would not ask of her what she would not freely give and now she lay dying there alone on the porch as her boy stopped to talk with the two children the babes in the wood and her secret hidden in her own heart and who were the babes in the wood little waifs fugitives hiding from the manhunters as a rule in early days when the settlers killed off the adult indians in their forays they took the children and brought them up in slavery but the girl the eldest stronger and lither of these two dark little creatures darting hiding stealing about this ruined old camp was so wild and spirited even from the first that no one wanted her and then she was dangerously bright and above all she did not quite look the indian men doubted if she really were an indian or no sometimes but i remember hearing old leathernose as he sat on a barrel one night in the grocery and squirted amber at the backlog say i guess by gol shes injun shes devilish enough she dont look the injun i know but its the cussedness that makes me know shes injun and when did she come to the camp asked a respectable stranger dont know thats it nobody dont know and nobody dont care i guess well dont you know where she came from children dont come down you know like rain or snow there were about fifty little children left in the mountainmeadow massacre they are somewhere these may be some of them dont you know who brought them here or how they came asked the honest stranger leaning forward and looking into the faces of the wrinkled and hairy old miners an old miner turned his quid again and again and at last feeling scant interest in the ragged little sister who led her little brother about by the hand and stood between him and peril as she kept their liberty drily answered along with his fellows as follows some said an old indian that died had her but i dont know fortynine knows most about her when hes short of grub and thats pretty often now i guess why she has to do the best she can o it was a sick looking thing at first why it wasnt that high and was all hair and bones growled out an old gray miner in reply to the man yes and dont you know when we called it the baby and it used to beg around about the cabins the poor little barefooted brat yes and when the baby nearly starved and eat some raw turnips that made it sick yes and got the colic yes and gambler jake got on his mule and started for the doctor yes an got in a poker game at mariposa and didnt get back for four days yes and the doctor didnt come and so the baby got well yes just so just so and old col billy bobbed his head and fell to thinking of other days this little piece of land where the old indian woman had lived so long and about which she had built a fence was very valuable indeed valley land was scarce here in the mountains and there was a young orchard the only thing of the kind in the country and then the roads forked there and two little rivers ran together there and that meant that a town would spring up there as the country became settled farms opened and the indians were swept away evilminded men are never without resources the laws are made to restrain such men but on the border there is no law enforced so you see how powerful are the wicked there how powerless the weak though never so well disposed in the far west if an indian is in your way you have only to report him to the agent of the indian reservation that is all you have to do he disappears or dies this indian agent is only too anxious to fill up his wasting ranks of indians they are dying every day and if they all should die sooner or later the fact may be known at washington and in the course of a few years the reservation and office would be abolished together and then each additional indian contributes greatly to the agents income for each indian must be fed and clothed or at least the agent is permitted to draw clothing blankets and food for every indian brought upon the reservation as to the indians receiving these things that is quite another affair well here were men wanting this land down yonder far away to the scorching south at the edge of the level alkali lands in a tule swamp where the indians taken from the mountains were penned up and dying like sheep in a corral was a bold enterprising indian agent who was gathering in under orders of his government all the indians of northern california he could appoint a hundred deputies and authorize them to bring in the indians wherever found the two children the babes in the wood had been taken to the reservation but being bold and active they contrived to soon escape and return to the mountains men whispered that the girl owed her escape to the great and growing favor in which she was held by one of the deputy agents who with his partner a rough and coarsegrained man had their homes in this camp the cabin of these two deputy agents dosson and emens stood not far from that of old fortynine but so far as i can remember the old man and the newly appointed deputy agents had always been at enmity this dosson was certainly a bad man he was in every sense of the word a desperado and so was his partner just the men most wanted by the head agent at the reservation to capture and bring in indians but whether this girl owed her escape or not to this ruffian dosson certain it is that on her return she avoided his cabin and when not in the woods hovered about that of old fortynine this enraged dosson beyond degree to add to his anger she now began to show a particular preference for john logan the idea of having an indian for a rival was more than this ignorant and brutal deputy agent could well bear and he set to work at once to rid himself of the object of his hatred the hard and merciless manhunter almost shouted with delight at a new idea which now came upon him with the light and suddeness of a revelation he ran at once to his partner and told him of his determination then these two men sat down and talked a long time together they made marks in the sand with sticks they set up little stakes in the sand and seemed delighted as they reached their heads out and looked down from the mouth of their tunnel toward the indian farm that night these two men stole down together and set up stakes and made corner marks about john logans land while he slept and then rolled themselves in their blankets and spent the night inside the limits of their new location having done this and sent a notice of their preemption to the surveyor general to be filed as their declaration of claim to the little farm with the orchard they entered complaint against john logan and so sat down to await results meantime this old woman sat alone with a great dog by her side sick and desolate waiting her sun of life to set piously waiting dark browed thoughtful while her tall handsome boy meek obedient with the awful curse of cain upon his brow the mark of indian blood was toiling on up in the canyon alone you had better be a negro you had better be ten times a negro were it possible than be onetenth part an indian in the west the indian will have little to do with one who is part indian and as for the white man unless the indian is willing to be his slave do him homage and service he would sooner take a leper in his house or to his heart up and above the indian womans house in the dense wood and on the spur of the mountain wound an old indian trail along this trail above the hidden house stole two little creatures tawny sunburnt ragged wretched yet full of affection for each other these were the two wretched children escaped from the reservation they were now being harbored by old fortynine for this he was liable to be arrested and punished knowing this he kept his gun loaded and standing in the corner of his cabin where the children slept at night how strange that this one man the most despised and miserable should be the only one to reach a hand to help these little waifs of the woods and who knew or who cared from where they came they did not look the indian though they acted it to perfection they would run away and hide from the face of man yet the girl under the passionate california sun was almost blossoming into womanhood they were called brother and sister god knows if they were or no break up tribes families as these had been broken up fire into a flock of young quails all day and who knows how soon or where the few that escape may gather together again or if they will know each other when they meet years after in the woods children are so impressionable they had heard some one in the camp call the old indian woman who sat forever on the porch in the dense foliage with the big dog beside her a witch they did not know what that meant but they knew it was something dreadful and they shunned and abhorred her accordingly yet the girl knew john logan her tall handsome son well and liked him too as they stole along the dim old indian trail their necks were stretched toward the old indian womans hut below they were as noiseless as two panthers at last the girl stopped stood still pointed and half pushed the boy before and in through the thicket past an occasional lonely cabin toward the widows woody home this old woman had long been ailing she was now very ill you are surprised to learn of sickness in the heart of the sierras i tell you that if you were to wash down mountains and uproot forests in the moon were such a thing possible the ague would seize hold of you and shake you for it nature is revengeful but to return to the wilderness what a wilderness this was only here and there at long intervals a little cabin down in the deep dense wood these cabins scattered as if the hand of some mighty sower had reached out over the wilderness and had sown and strown them there to take root and grow to some great harvest of civilization the narrow indian trail wound along almost entirely hidden by overhanging woods a trail that turned and twisted at every little obstacle here it was the prostrate form of some patriarch tree or here it curved and corkscrewed in and out through mighty forestkings that stood like comrades in ranks of battle where did this little indian trail lead to where did it begin how many a lovetale had been told in the shadow of those mighty trees that reached their long strong arms out over the heads of all passersby in a sort of priestly benediction where did the indian trail lead to to the west but leaves were strewn thick along it now the indian had gone to come back no more ever to the west points the indians path ever down to the great gold shore of the vast west sea leads the indians path and there the waves sweep in and obliterate his footprints forever the two halfwild children who had disappeared down the dim trail a few moments before now suddenly reappear they are eager and excited this boy cannot be above ten years old yet he looks old as a man the girl may be twelve fifteen or even sixteen age at such a period is a matter of either blood or climate she has a shock of unkempt hair she wears a tattered dress of as many colors as jacobs coat she has one toeless boot on one foot on the other she wears a shoe so big that it might hold both her feet down over this shoe rolls a large red woolen stocking leaving her shapely little ankle bleeding from brierscratches in her hand she swings a large coarse straw hat by its broad red ribbons her every limb is full of force and fire her voice is firm and resolute but not rapid hers is a splendid energy needing but proper direction her brother who puffs and pants at her side is named johnny but the wild west which has a habit of naming things because they look it has dubbed him stumps since he is short and fat he is halfclad in a pair of tattered pants a great straw hat and a full stuffy check shirt which is held in subjection by a pair of handmade woolen suspenders the work of his sister both are out of breath both are looking back wildly but stumps huddles up again and again close under his sisters arm as if he fears he might be followed and looks to her for protection she draws him close to her and then looking back and then down into his upturned face says breathlessly stumps oh stumps did you get em stumps the boy shrinks closer to his sister and again looking back and then seeing for a certainty that he is not followed he grows bolder and says git em carats look there and that un is yourn carats and you can have both of em if you want em for i dont feel hungry now carats and here he hitches up his pants and wipes his nose on his sleeve why stumps dont you feel hungry now then suddenly

and say goodbye the girl gives her left hand no your right hand carrie is bothered and slips the peach in her left hand behind and with a lifted face full of glow and enthusiasm says ill bring you a whole bag full of nuts i will and she reaches him her hand eagerly oh carrie i have a nice little surprise for you and if you wont tell ill let you into the secret you wont tell he comes close to her sits down his goldpan and resting his pick on the ground with his two hands on the top of the handle leans toward her and looks into her innocent uplifted face the girls eyes brighten and she seems to grow tall and beautiful under his earnest gaze i wont tell sir oh please to trust me sir i wont tell mr john logan the boy eagerly comes forward also i wont tell neither i wont tell neither so help me well then come close to me johnny come close up here and look in my face there why i declare the pleasure i now have telling you this is more than gold and i need money sadly enough youre awful poor

after and while she lives i am content the girl looks at the woods looks at the man and then once more at the woods and at last in her helplessness to solve the problem falls to eating nuts as usual while the man continues as if talking to himself this is the peace of paradise and see the burning bush now i can well understand that moses saw the face of god in the bush of fire oh the girl says to herself if he only would be cross if he only would say something rough to us if he only would cuss she resolves to say or do something to break the spell she asks eagerly are you going to give something to stumps and me i mean johnny and me yes yes tomorrow evening after my work is done and now i am going to tell you and johnny what it is it aint much its the least little thing in the world but i dont deserve any credit for even that its my poor dear old mothers idea she has laid there day after day on the porch and she has been thinking not all the time of her own sickness and sorrow but of others as well and she has thought much of you the boy stands far aside and at mention of this he jerks himself into a knot his head drops down between his shoulders his mouth puckers up and he exclaims oh hoka thought of me says carrie of you carrie and listen i must tell you a little story when i was a very young man and killed my first grizzly bear i bought a little peachtree and planted it in the corner of the yard as people sometimes plant trees to remember things well my mother she had the ague that day powerful for it was after melontime and she sat on the porch and shook and shook and shook and watched me plant it and when i got done my mother she cried i dont know why she cried carrie but she did she cried and she cried and when i went up to her and put my arms around her neck and kissed her she only cried the more for she was sort of hystericlike you know and she said she knew shed never live to eat any fruit off of that tree carrie stops eating nuts a moment but she will she will get well mr john logan she will get well wont she ah indeed i believe she will get well but whether she ever gets right well or not she certainly will live to eat peaches from that tree carrie weve talked it all over and what do you think why now listen i will tell you this tree that i planted and that my poor sick mother was afraid she would not live to eat the fruit from this tree was a peach tree carrie again takes out a handful of nuts from her pocket as if she would like to eat them she looks at them a second throws them away and hastens to one side i want to go home cries stumps i dont like peaches mr john logan i dont i dont so help me and the boy jerks at his pants wildly john logan turns to him kindly why you never had a peach in your little hand in your life then turning to carrie yes carrie there has grown this year high up in the sun on that tree side by side two and only two red ripe peaches why children dont run away wait one moment and i will go a little way with you as i was about to say these two peaches are at last ripe i own i was the least bit afraid even after i saw them there on that bough one summer morning that even then my mother might die before they became fully ripe but now they are ripe and this evening i shall pull them and tomorrow after my days work is done my sick mother shall eat one and you two shall eat the other carrie puts up her hand and backs away dont dont dont call me carrie call me carats carats carats like the others do why carrie what in the world is the matter with you if a body steals mr john logan if a body steals what had a body better do why the preacher says a body should confess confess it feel sorry and be forgiven i cant i cant confess and i cant be forgiven john logan starts you you carrie is it you then you have already confessed and he will forgive you but such stealing as this nobody nothing can forgive falling on her knees i i made my little brother steal your peaches you you made him steal my two peaches that i wanted for my sick mother you you carrie stumps rushed forward no no i done it myself i done it all myself i did so help me but i made him do it cries carrie i am the biggest and i knew better i knew better but we couldnt eat em here they are oh i am so glad we couldnt eat em and they fall on their knees at his feet together four little hands reach out the peaches to him eagerly earnestly as if in prayer to heaven the man takes their little hands and choking with tears says in a voice full of pathos and pity and uncovering his head with lifted face as he remembers something of the story the good priest so often read to his mother and there was more joy in heaven over the one that was found than over the ninetyandnine that went not astray chapter ii twenty carats fine a land that man has newly trod a land that only god has known through all the soundless cycles flown yet perfect blossoms bless the sod and perfect birds illume the trees and perfect unheard harmonies pour out eternally to god a thousand miles of mighty wood where thunderstorms stride fireshod a thousand flowers every rod a stately tree on every rood ten thousand leaves on every tree and each a miracle to me and yet there be men who question god at just what time these two waifs of the woods appeared in camp even fortynine could not tell they were first seen with the indian woman who went about among the miners picking up bread and bits of coin by dancing singing and telling fortunes these two indian women were great liars and rogues altogether i need not add that they were partly civilized the little girl had been taught to dance and sing and was quite a source of revenue to the two indian women who had perhaps bought or stolen the children as for the boy poor stunted starved little thing he hung on to his sisters tattered dress all the time with his little red hand wherever she went and whatever she did he was her shadow and he was at that time little more than a shadow in any way sometimes men pitied the little girl and gave very liberally they tried to find out something about her past life for although she was quite the color of the indian she had regular features and at times her poor pinched face was positively beautiful the two children looked as if they had been literally stunted in their growth from starvation and hardship once a goodhearted old miner had bribed the squaws to let the children come to his cabin and get something to eat they came and while they were gorging themselves the boy sitting close up to the girl all the time and looking about and back over his shoulder and holding on to her dress this man questioned her about her life and history she did not like to talk indeed she talked with difficulty at first and her few english words fell from her lips in broken bits and in strange confusion but at length she began to speak more clearly as she proceeded with her story and became excited in its narration then she would stop and seem to forget it all then she went on as if she was telling a dream then there would be another long pause and confusion and she would stammer on in the most wild and incoherent fashion till the old miner became quite impatient and thought her as big an imposter as the indian woman whom she called her mother he finally gave them each a loaf of bread and told them they could go back to their lodge this lodge consisted of a few poles set up in wigwam fashion and covered with skins and old blankets and birch a foul ugly place it was but in this wigwam lived two indian women and these two children men or rather beasts no beasts are decent creatures well then monsters full of bad rum would prowl about this wretched lodge at night and their howls mixed with those of the savages whom they had made also drunk kept up a state of things frightful to think of in connection with these two sensitive starving little waifs of the woods who were they and where did they come from sometimes these children would start up and fly from the lodge at night and hide away in the brush like hunted things and only steal back at morning when all was still at such times the girl would wrap her little brother if he was her brother in her own scant rags and hold him in her arms as he slept one night while some strange indians were lodging there a still more terrible scene transpired in this dreadful little den than had yet been conceived the two children fled as usual into the darkness back into the deep woods shots were heard and then a deathyell that echoed far up and down the canyon then there were cries shrieks of women as if they were being seized and borne away fainter and fainter grew their cries further and further down on the high ledge of the canyon in the darkness into the deep wood they seemed to be borne and at last their cries died away altogether the next morning a dead indian was found at the door of the empty lodge but the women and the children were nowhere to be seen some said the indian agents men had come to take the indians away and that the man resisting had been shot while the women and children were taken to the reservation where they belonged but there was a darker story and told under the breath and not spoken loud let it be told under the breath and briefly here also some drunken wretches had shot the indians carried the women down to the dark woods above the deep swollen river and then after the most awful orgies ever chronicled murdered them and sunk their bodies in the muddy river it was nearly a week after that the two children stole down from the wooded hillside into the trail where old fortynine found them on his return from work they were so weak they could not speak or cry out for help they could only reach their little hands and implore help as timid and frightened they tottered towards this first human being they had dared to face for a whole week the strong man hesitated a moment they looked so frightful he wanted to escape from their presence but his grand noble nature came to the surface in a second and dropping his pick and pan in the trail he caught up the two children and in a moment more was with one in each arm rushing down the trail to his cabin he met some men and passed others they all looked at him with wonder one even laughed at him and it is hard to comprehend this there were good men good in a measure men who would have gallantly died to save a woman men who were true men on points of honor yet men who could not think of even being civil to an indian or any one with a bit of indian blood in his veins is our government responsible for this i do not say so i only know that it exists a hatred a prejudice more deeply seated and unreasonable than ever was that of the old slavedealer for the black man fortynine did not return to his tunnel the next day nor yet the next this cabin wretched as it became in after years when he had fallen into evil habits had then plenty to eat and there the starved little beings ate as they had never eaten before at first the little boy would steal and hide away bread while he ate at the table the first night after eating all he could he slept with both his pockets full and a chunk up his sleeve besides this boy was never a favorite he was so weak so dependent on his sister it seemed as if he had been at one time frightened almost to death and had never quite gotten over it and so fortynine took most kindly to the girl and they were soon fast friends yet ever and always her shadow the little boy whom fortynine named johnny kept at her side as i have said before his little red hand reached out and clutching at her tattered dress after a few weeks the girl began to tell strange wild stories to the old man but observing that fortynine doubted these as the other man had she called them dreams and so would tell him these wild and terrible dreams of the desert of blood of murder and massacre till the old man himself as the girl shrank up to him in terror became almost frightened he did not like to hear these dreams and she soon learned not to repeat them one evening a passing miner stopped placed a broad hand on either doorjamb and putting his great head in at the open door asked how the little coppercolored pets got on pard answered fortynine kindly and with a nod of the head back toward the children playing in the corner they are not coppers no they are not i tell you that girl is not copper but gold yes she is pard she is twenty carats twenty carats gold well twenty carats come here come here carats called out the big head at the door the girl came forward and a big hand fell down from the doorjamb on her bushy head of hair and the man was pleased as he looked down into the uplifted face and so he called her carats and that became her name other passing miners stopped to look in at the open door where the big head had looked and talked to the timid girl and misunderstanding the name they called her carrie and carrie she was called ever afterwards but the boy who had been so thin soon grew so fat and chubby that some one named him stumps there was no good trying to get rid of that name he looked as though his name ought to be stumps and stumps it was in spite of the persistent efforts of old fortynine to keep the name in use which he had given him and this was all that fortynine or any one could tell of these two children and now how beautiful carrie had grown by the time the leaves turned brown often dosson saw her hovering about the cabin of old fortynine flitting through the woods with her brother or walking leisurely with logan on the hill down the dim old indian trail mother nature has her golden wedding once a year and all the world is invited she has many gala days too besides and she celebrates them with songs and dances of delight in the full bosomed teeming jocund spring i have seen the trees lean together and rustle their leaves in whisperings of love i have seen them reach their long strong arms to each other and intertwine them as if in fond affection as the bland warm winds coming up from the south blew over them and warmed their hearts of oak old trees too gnarled and knotted old fellows that had bobbed their heads together through many and many a spring that had leaned their lofty and stormstained tops together through many and many a winter that had stood like mighty soldiers shoulder to shoulder in friendships knit through many centuries the birds sing and flutter fly in and out of the dark deep canopies of green build nests and make love in myriads how the squirrels run and chatter and frisk and fly from branch to branch with their bushy tails tossing in the warm wind under foot ten thousand tall strange flowers and weeds and long spindled grasses grow and reach up and up as if to try to touch the sunlight above the tops of the oak and ash and pine and fir and cedar and maple and cherry and sycamore and spruce and tamarack and all these that grow in common confusion here and shut out the sun from the earth as perfectly as if all things dwelt forever in cloudland the cabin of old fortynine was very modest it hid away in the canyon as if it did not wish to be seen at all and it was right for verily it was scarcely presentable it was an old cabin too almost as old as little carats if indeed any one could tell how old she was but it unlike herself seemed to be growing tired and weary of the world she had been growing up as it had been growing down the moss was gathering all over the round rough logs on the outside and the weeds and wild vines each year grew still more ambitious to get quite to the top of the cabin and peep down into the mysterious crater of a chimney that forever smoked in a mournful and monotonous sort of way as if watchers were there vestal virgins who dared not let their fires perish on penalty of death drunken wretched cracked and crazy old fortynine the camp said he can never build a new cabin for he cant stay sober long enough to cut down a tree and the camp told the ugly truth why dont fortynine build a new cabin asked gar dosson one day as he passed that way with a string of fish in his hand and a coon on his back poor dear fortynines got the shakes so he cant get time it takes him all the time to shake and it takes all his money to buy his ager medicine poor dear old fortynine and the girl seemed to get a cinder or something in her eye as the sun settled low one afternoon and cast long creeping shadows over the flowery land shadows that lay upon and crept along the ground as if they were weary of the day and would like to lie there and sleep and sleep forever the stealthy step of a man was heard approaching the old cabin there was something of the tiger in the mans movements and it was clear that his mission whatever it was was not a mission of peace the man stands out in the clearing of the land before the cabin and peers right and left up the trail and down the trail and then leans and listens then he takes a glance back over his shoulder at his companion and follower gar dosson and being sure that he too is on the alert and close on his heels he steps forward again the man leans and listens but seeing no signs of life and hearing no sound he straightens up walks close to the cabin and calls out hello the house at the same time he looks to the priming of his gun and then fixes his eye on the door as it slowly opens he drops the breech hastily to the ground as the face of carrie peers forth beg pardon carrie my girl is it only you miss beg pardon but we are lookin for a gentleman a young gentleman john logan the man is terribly embarrassed as the girl looks him straight in the face and his companion falls back into the woods until almost hidden from view well and why do you come here skulking like indians the man falls back but recovering he says over his shoulder as he turns to go yes skulking around your cabin like that other injun john logan the man jerks the coonskin cap up on his left ear as he says this and tossing his head steps back into the thick woods and is gone later in the evening john logan gun in hand passes slowly and dreamily down the trail close to old fortynines cabin stumps and carrie are at play in the wood close at hand and come forth at a bound booh cries carrie darting around from behind a tree booh mr john logan continues the girl and then with her two dimpled brown hands she throws back the glorious storm of black abundant hair that all the time tumbles about her beautiful face why carrie is that you and stumps too i am glad to see you i i was feeling awful lonesome been down to squire fields again havent you the girl has reached one hand out against a tree and half leaning on it swings her right foot to and fro john logan starts just a little looks at her sighs sets the breech of his gun on the ground and as his eyes turn to hers she sees he is very sad yes carrie i i am lonesome at my cabin since since mother died all the time carrie i see her as i saw her that night when i got home sitting there on the porch looking straight out at the gate waiting for me her hand on the dogs head as if to hold him as he says this poor little stumps stands up close against a tree draws his head down and pulls up his shoulders yes her long bony fingers resting on his head holding him and the faithful dog never moving for fear he would disturb her for she was dead oh mr john logan dont tell me about it dont and the girls apron is again raised to her face as she shudders poor old woman with the holler eyes says stumps to himself in a tone that is scarcely audible but there never mind the strong handsome fellow brushes a tear aside and taking up his gun again tries to be cheerful and shake off the care that encompasses him and you got lonesome and went down to see sylvia fields didnt you again the girls foot swings and she looks askance from under her dark heavy hair at john logan carrie listen to me ever since i can remember my mother waited and watched for my coming at my cabin door but now only think how lonely it is to live there i cant go away i have no fortune no friends no people what would people say to me and of me out in the great world well i went to squire fields and i had a long talk with sylvia the girl starts and almost chokes been to see sylvia fields and with her booted foot she kicks the bark of a tree with all her might had a long talk with her then she whirls around plunges her hand in her pocket and swings her dress and says as she pouts out her mouth oh i feel just awful john logan approaches her why carrie whats the matter carrie still swings herself and turns her back to the man as she says half savagely i dont know whats the matter and i dont care whats the matter but i feel just awful i do i feel just like the dickens but carrie you ought to be very very happy with all this beautiful scenery and the sweet air in your hair and on your rosy face and then what a lady you have grown to be now dont look cross at me like that you ought to be as happy as a bird but i aint happy i aint happy a bit i aint then after a pause she continues i dont like that gar dosson he was here looking for you here looking for me yes and he called old fortynine old blossomnose i just hate him oh well carrie you know fortynine does drink dreadfully and you know he has got a dreadful red face mr john logan cries carrie hotly fortynine dont drink dreadfully he dont drink dreadfully at all he does take something for his ager but he dont drink well his face is dreadful red anyway answers john logan carrie swinging her foot and thoughtfully looking up at the trees says after a pause do the trees drink do the trees and the bushes drink john logan their faces get awfully red in the fall too carrie you are cross today carrie shrugging her shoulders and shaking her dress as if she would shake it off her snaps i aint cross yes you are and the tawny man comes up to her and speaks in a kindly tone but come many a pleasant walk we have had in these woods together and many a pleasant time we will have together still we wont ah but we will come you must not be so cross the girl leans her forehead against the tree on her lifted arm and swings her other foot she looks down at the rounded ankle and says almost savagely to herself shes got bigger feet than i have shes got nearly twice as big feet she has john logan looks at the girl with a profound tenderness as she stands there pouting and swinging her foot he attempts to approach her but she still holds her brow bowed to the tree upon her arm and seems not to see him he shoulders his gun and walks past her and says kindly goodbye carrie but the girls eyes are following him although she would not be willing to admit it even to herself as he is about to disappear she thrusts her hand madly through her hair and pulls it down all in a heap still looking at him under her brows still swinging her foot wildly she says do you think red hair is so awful ugly and what a wondrous glory of hair it was it was so intensely black and then it had that singular fringe of fire or touch of titian color which seen in the sunset made it almost red the man stops turns comes back a step or two as she continues i do i do oh i wish to moses i had tow hair i do like sylvia fields the man is standing close beside her now he is looking down into her face and she feels his presence the foot does not swing so violently now and the girl has cautiously and as she believes unseen lifted the edge of her tattered sleeve to her eyes why carrie your hair is not red and he speaks very tenderly carrie you are going to be beautiful you are beautiful now you are very beautiful carrie is not so angry now the foot stops altogether and she lifts her face and says no i aint i aint beautiful dont you try to humbug me i am ugly and i know it for last winter when i went down to the grocery to fetch fortynine hed gone down there to get medicine for his ager mr john logan i heard a man say she is ugly as a mud fence oh i went for him i made the fur fly but that didnt make me pretty i was ugly all the same no im not pretty im ugly and i know it oh no youre not you are beautiful and getting lovelier every day carrie softens and approaches him am i john logan and you really dont think red hair is the ugliest thing in the world do i really not think red hair is the ugliest thing in the world why carrie carrie starting back looks in his face and says bitterly you do you do think red hair is the ugliest thing in all this born world and i just dare you to deny it sylvia fields shes got white hair she has and you like white hair you do i despise her i despise her so much that i almost choke why now carrie what makes you despise sylvia fields i dont know i dont know why i despise her but i do i despise her with all my might and soul and body and i tell you mr john logan that here the lips begin to quiver and she is about to burst into tears i tell you mr john logan that i do hope she likes ripe bananas and i do hope that if she does like ripe bananas that when bananas come to camp this fall that she will take a ripe banana and try for to suck it and i do hope she will suck a ripe banana down her throat and get choked to death on it i do oh carrie this is very wicked cries john logan reproachfully and i must leave you if you talk that way goodbye and the man shoulders his gun and again turns away well do you think red hair is the ugliest thing in the world do you do you now carrie dont you know i love the beautiful red woods of autumn it is the mayday of the maidens life the may shower is over again and the girl lifts her beautiful face and says lightly almost laughing through her tears and oh you did like the red bush didnt you mr john logan and oh you did say that moses saw the face of god in the burning bush didnt you mr john logan i want you to tell me a story i do interposes stumps the boy had stood there a long time first on one foot then on the other swinging his squirrel pouting out his mouth and waiting yes tell us a story urges carrie oh yes tell us a story about a coon no about a panther no a bear oh yes about a bear about a bear cries the boy about a bear poor halfwild children sighs john logan nothing to divert them their little minds go out curiously seeking something new and strange just i fancy as older and abler peoples do in larger ways yes i will tell you a story about a bear and let us sit down my long walk has tired my legs and he looks about for a resting place oh here this mossy log cries stumps its as soft as silk you will sit there and i here and sister there john logan leans his gun against a tree hanging his pouch on the gun yes i will sit here and you carrie here oh john logan i just fit in one of logans arms falls loosely around carrie the other more loosely around stumps yes its a nice fit carrie couldnt be better if cut out by a tailor carrie swinging her feet and looking in his face very happy exclaims oh john logan dont hold me too tight you might hurt me stumps laughs he dont hold me tight enough to hurt me a bit then looking up in his face says i want a bear story i do well i will tell you a story out of the bible once upon a time there was a great good man a very good and a very earnest man well this very good old man who was very bald headed took a walk one evening and the very good old man passed by a lot of very bad boys and these very bad boys saw the very bald head of the very good man and they said go up old bald head go up old bald head and it made this good man very mad and he turned and he called a shebear out of the woods and she ate up about forty oh cries stumps aghast oh adds carrie and he wasnt a very good man he might have been a very baldheaded man but he wasnt a very good man to have her eat all the children mr john logan stumps nursing his squirrel with his head on one side says well i dont believe it no how i dont what was his name the old baldhead his name was elijah sir elijah the baldheaded elijah oh i do believe it then for i know when fortynine and the curlyheaded grocerykeeper were playing poker at ten cents ante and pass the buck when fortynine went down to get his ager medicine sister fortynine he went a blind and the curlyheaded grocerykeeper he straddled it and then fortynine seed him he did and so help me he raked in the pot on a jack full and then the curlyheaded grocerykeeper jumped up and struck his fist on the table and he said by the baldheaded elijah carrie nestles closer and in a half whisper mutters i believe im getting a little chilly stumps hears this and says why carrie im just a sweatin and shoo what noise was that there is some one stealing through the bush john logan as he spoke rose up softly and cautiously and half bent forward as he put the two children aside and reached his gun he looked at the cap ran an eye along the barrel and then twisted his belt about so that a pistol was just visible beneath his coat the man had had an intimation of trouble indeed his gun had been at hand all this time but he did not care to frighten the two happy waifs of the woods with any thought of what might happen to him and even to them these children had but one thing to dread there was but one terrible word to them in the language it was not hunger not starvation no not even death it was the reservation that one word meant to them as it means to all who are liable to be carried there captivity slavery degradation and finally death in its most dreadful form and why should it be so dreaded make the case your own if you are a lover of liberty and you can understand statistics show that more than threefourths of all indians removed to reservations of late years die before becoming accustomed to the new order of things yet indians do not really fear death but they do dread captivity they are so fond of their roving life their vast liberty room an indian is too brave to commit suicide save in the most rare and desperate cases but his heart breaks from homesickness and he dies there in despair and then to see his helpless little children die one by one with the burning fever which always overtakes the poor captives how many of us died i do not know we counted them at first but when there were dead women and children in every house and not men enough to bury them i did not count any more said one of the survivors when questioned in earlier times some of these reservations were well chosen the one on the ummatilla oregon for example but of late years it would seem as if the most deadly locations had been selected perhaps this is thought best by those in authority as the land is soon wanted by the whites if it is at all fit for their use and the indians in such cases are sooner or later made to move on this particular reservation in california however never has been and never will be required or used by any man except for a grave why in the name of humanity such things are left to the choice and discretion of strangers new men men who know nothing about indians and care nothing for them except so far as they can coin their blood is incomprehensible it is a crime way out yonder in the heart of a burning plain by the side of an alkali lake that fairly reeked with malaria where even reptiles died where wild fowl never were found a place that even beasts knew better than to frequent without wood or water save stunted sage and juniper and slimy alkali in the very valley of death this reservation had been established ah just the place a place where we can use our cavalry when they attempt to escape said the young sprig of an officer when some men with a spark of humanity dared to protest and that was the reason for removing it so far from the sweet pure air and water of the sierras and setting these poor captives down in the valley of death when they try to escape did it never occur to the united states to make a reservation pleasant and healthy enough for an indian to be content in my word for it if you will give him a place fit to live in he will be willing to make his home there i know nothing in history so dark and dreadful as the story of the indians in this dreaded and deadly reservation of the valley the indians surrendered on condition that they should be taken to good homes and taught the ways of the white man once in the white mans power the chains began to tighten tighten at every step once there they were divided into lots families torn apart and put to work under guard men stood over them with loaded muskets the land was full of malaria these men of the mountains began to sicken to die to die by degrees to die as the hot weather came on by hundreds at last a few of the strongest the few still able to stand broke away and found their way back to the mountains they were like living skeletons skin and bone only holloweyed and horrible to look upon toward the last these poor indians had crawled on their hands and knees to get back they were followed by the soldiers and taken wherever they could be found taken back to certain death one a young man still possessed of a little strength fought with sticks and stones with all his might as he lay in the trail where he had fallen in his flight he lifted his two bony hands between the foe and his dying old father the two were taken and chained together that night the young man with an old pair of scissors which he had borrowed on pretense of wanting to trim his hair killed the old man by pushing one of the points into his heart you could see by the marks of blood on the young mans hand next morning that he had felt more than once to see if the old man was quite dead then he drove the point of the scissors in his own heart and crawled upon the old mans body embraced it and died there and yet all this had been done so quietly that the two guards who marched back and forth only a few feet distant did not know till next morning that anything of the kind had been sometimes these wretches would beg and even steal on their way back from the dreadful reservation they were frightful terrible at such times they sometimes stood far off outside the gate and begged with outstretched hands their appearances were so against them hungry dying and then this traditional hatred of four hundred years but this is too much digression john logan knew all the wrongs of his people only too well he sympathized with them and this meant his own ruin a few indians had made their way back of late and john logan had harbored them while the authorities were in pursuit this was enough an order had been sent to bring in john logan he knew of this and that was why he now stood all alert and on fire as these two men came stealing through the bush and straight for him should he fire to shoot to shoot at to even point a gun at a white man is death to the indian a slave of the south had been tenfold more safe in striking his master in the old days of slavery than is an indian on the border in defending his person against a white man the two children like frightened pheasants when the old one gives signs of danger darted down behind him quick as thought still as death their desperate and destitute existence in that savage land had made them savages in their cunning and caution they said no word made no sign their eyes were fixed on his every step and motion he signaled them back they darted like squirrels behind trees and up and on through the thicket toward the steep and inaccessible bluffs above the two men saw the retreating children they wanted carrie they darted forward one of them jerked out and held up a paper in the face of john logan we want you at the reservation come phin emens stood full before logan he shook the paper in his face the man did not move carrie was fast climbing up the mountain she was about to escape gar dosson was furious he attempted to pass to climb the mountain and to get at the girl still logan kept himself between as he slowly retreated stand aside and let me get that girl i must take her too shouted dosson still logan kept the man back and now the children had escaped wild with rage dosson caught logan by the shoulder and shouted come with a blow that might have felled an ox the indian brought the man to the ground then grasping his rifle in his right hand he darted through the thicket after the retreating children up the mountain while phin emens stooped over his fallen friend chapter iii manhunters he caused the dry land to appear bible the mountains from that fearful first named day were gods own house behold twas here dread sinais thunders burst and showed his face twas here of old his prophets dwelt lo it was here the christ did come when death drew near give me gods wondrous upper world that makes familiar with the moon these stony altars they have hurled oppression back have kept the boon of liberty behold how free the mountains stand and eternally success makes us selfish the history of the world chronicles no prosperity like that of ours and so thinking of only ourselves and our success we forget others it is easy indeed to forget the misery of others and we hate to be told of it too on a high mountain side overlooking the valley hung a little camp like a birds nest it was hidden there in the densest wood yet it looked out over the whole land no bird indeed no mother of her young ever chose a deeper or wilder retreat or a place more utterly apart from the paths and approaches of mankind certainly the little party had stood in imminent peril of capture and had prized freedom dearly indeed to climb these crags and confront the very snowpeaks in their effort to make certain their safety and a little party too it must have been for you could have passed within ten feet of the camp and not discovered it by day and by night well certainly by night no man would peril his life by an uncertain footing on the high cliffs here only partly concealed by the thick growth of chaparral topt by tall fir and pine and cedar and tamarack and so a little fire was allowed to burn at night for it was near the snow and always cold and it was this fire perhaps that first betrayed the presence of the fugitives to the manhunters very poor and wretched were they too if they had had more blankets they might not have so needed the fire so poor were they in fact that you might have stood in the very heart of the little camp and not discovered any property at all without looking twice a little heap of ashes in the center sending up a halfsmothered smoke two or three loose california lionskins thrown here and there over the rocks a pair of moccasins or two a tomahawk and that was almost all no cooking utensils had they for what had they to cook no eating utensils for what had they to eat great gnarled and knotty trees clung to the mountain side beyond and a little to the left a long thin cataract which from the valley far below looked like a snowy plume came pitching down through the tree tops it had just been let loose from the hand of god this sheen of shining water back and beyond all this a peak of snow a great pyramid and shining shaft of snow with a crown of clouds pierced heaven stealthily and on tiptoe two armed men both deeply disguised in great black beards and in good clothes stepped into this empty little camp bending low looking right looking left guns in hand and hand on trigger they stopped in the centre of the little camp and looked cautiously up down and all around seeing no one hearing nothing they looked in each others eyes straightened up and standing their guns against a tree breathed more freely in the gray twilight wicked beastlylooking men were they as they stood there loosening their collars taking in their breath as if they had just had a hard climb and looking about cautiously hard cruel and cunning they seemed as if they partook something of the ferocity of the wild beasts that prowled there at night these two large animallooking men were armed with pistols also but at the belt of each hung and clanked and rattled something more terrible than any implement of death these were manacles irons chains for human hands did it never occur to you as a little remarkable that man only forges chains and manacles for his fellowman a cage will do for a wild beast cattle are put in pens bears in a pit but man must be chained men carry these manacles with them only when they set out to take their fellowman these two men were manhunters standing there manacles in hand half beast and half devil they were in the employment of the united states they were sent to take john logan carrie and johnny to the reservation the place most hated dreaded abhorred of all earthly places the reservation back of these two men lay a deeper a more damning motive for the capture of the girl than the united states was really responsible for for the girl as we have seen was very beautiful this rare wild flower had now almost matured in the hot summer sun just past but remember it was all being done in the name of and under the direction of and in fact by the united states government to say nothing of the desire of agents and their deputies to capture and possess beautiful girls it is very important to any indian agent that each victim even though he be half or threequarters or even entirely white be kept on the reservation for every captive is so much money in the hands of the indian agent he must have indians as said before to report to the government in order to draw blankets provisions clothes and farming utensils for them true the indians do not get a tithe of these things but he must be on the reservation rollcall in order that the agent may draw them in his name this agency had become remarkably thin of indians the mountain indians accustomed to pure water and fresh air could not live long in the hot feverstricken valley they died by hundreds and then as if utterly regardless of the profits of the agents of the reservation they hung themselves in their prisonpens with their own chains two father and son killed themselves with the same knife one night while chained together there was just a little bit of the old roman in these libertyloving natures it seemed to me see the father giving himself the deathwound and then handing the knife to his son the two chained apart but still able to grasp each others hands grasping hands and dying so very antique that it seems to me in its savage valor love of liberty and lofty contempt of death but then it was only indians and happened so recently it is true gar dosson wanted revenge and the girl and the two men wanted the little farm yet do not forget that back of all this lay that granite and immovable mountain of fact that other propelling principle to compel them on to the hunt the order the sanction the gold of the government let it be told with bowed head with eyes to the ground and cheeks crimson with shame think of one of these hunted human beings a beautiful young girl just at that sweet and tender almost holy period of life the verge of womanhood when every man of the land should start up with a noble impulse to throw the arm of protection about her shoo they must be close about began the shorter of the two ruffians reaching back for his gun as if he had heard something no didnt you see that squirrel shucking a hazel nut on that rock there just afore we came in said the other a bushytailed gray yes seed him scamper up a saplin wal dont you know that if they had a bin hereabouts a squirrel wouldnt a sot down there to shuck a nut right youve been among injins so long that you know more about them than they do themselves wal what i dont know about an injin no one dont know theyve gone for grub and will come back at sundown come back here at sundown dont you see the skins there whar kin they sleep theyll come afore dark for even an injin cant climb these rocks after dark and when the gals in camp and that feller fixed eh eh and he tapped and rattled the manacles eh eh old toppy and the two men poked each other in the ribs and looked the very villains that they were but lets see what theyve got here two tigerskins an old moccasin and a tomahawk he looked at the handle and read the name john logan guess ill hide that said the agent as he kicked the skins about and then stuck the tomahawk up under his belt guess thats about all guess thats about all sneered the other thats about all you know about injuns allers got your nose to the ground too look here and the man who had been walking about and looking up in the trees here drew down a bundle from the boughs of a fir well ill swar ef you cant find things where a coon dog couldnt find things exclaimed the other as he prepared to examine the contents of the bundle all youve got to do is to look into a firtree in an injuns camp you see bugs and things wont climb a fir gum nothing but a redbellied squirrel will go up a fir gum for fear of sticking in the wax and even a squirrel wont if there is a string tied around for fear of a trap wal there is the string so you see an injuns cache is as safe up a firtree as under lock and key ah theyre awful short of grub look thar been gnawing that bone and theyve put that away for their suppers i swar wal the grub is short eh theyll be rather thin im thinking the other did not notice this remark but throwing the bundle aside he rose up and went back to the tree by the beardy moses look thar and the man looked about as if half frightened and then held up a bottle whisky asked the other springing eagerly forward no answered the man contemptuously after smelling the bottle water eh queried the other with disgust wine and look here do you know what that means it means a white man yes it does no injin ever left a cork in a bottle now you look sharp there will be a white man to tackle wal i guess he wont be much of a white man or hed have whisky shoo i heard a bird fly down the canyon somebodys a comin up thar we better git eh said the other getting his gun lay for em lay low and watch our chance maybe well come in on em friendly like if theres white men were cattle men you know men hunting cattle says the other getting his gun and leading off behind the crags in the rear leave me to do the talking ill tell a thing and youll swear to it wait lets see and he approaches the edge of the rocks and leaning over looked below see em shoo look down there the gal shes a fawn shes as pretty as a tigerlily ah my beauty the other man stood up shook his head thoughtfully and seemed to hesitate the watcher still kept peering down then he turned and said the white man is old fortynine he comes a bobbin and a limpin along with a keg on his back and a climbin up the mountain sidewise like a crab whoop i have it its wine and theyll get drunk fortynine will get drunk dont you see and then youre a wise un shake and they grasped hands you bet now this is the little game the gal and logan and the boy will get here long first well now maybe we will go for the gal and the boy but if we dont we just lay low till all get sot down and at that keg the old mans got and then we just come in cattlemen back in the mountains eh thats the game but here they come shoo and with his finger to his lip the leader stole behind the rocks both looking back over their shoulders as carrie entered the camp her pretty face was flushed from exertion and brown as a berry where not protected by the shock of black hair she swung a broad straw hat in her hand and tossed her head as if she had never worn and never would wear any other covering for it than that so bountifully supplied by nature she danced gaily and swung her hat as she flew about the little camp and called at her chubby cherub of a brother over her shoulder at last puffing and blowing and wiping his forehead he entered camp and threw himself on one of the rocks why you aint tired are you johnny oh oh oh no i i i aint tired a bit and he wiped his brow and puffed and blowed in spite of all his efforts to restrain himself why you like to climb the mountains johnny dont you know you said you liked to climb the mountains better than to eat oh yes yes i i like to climb a mountain that is i like to climb one mountain at a time but when there are two or three mountains all piled up on top of one another oh oh oh oh johnny you to go to bragging about climbing mountains you cant climb mountains and again the girl with shoes that would hardly hold together a dress in ribbons and a face not unfamiliar with the dirt of the earth danced back and forth before him and sung snatches of a mountain song oh im so happy up here johnny i always sing like a bird up here then looking in his face she saw that he was very thoughtful and stepping back and then forward she said why what makes you so serious they wont never come up here will they johnny not even if somebody at the reservation wanted me awful bad and somebody gave somebody lots of money to take me back they couldnt never come up here could they johnny and the girl looked eagerly about oh no carrie you are safe here why you are as safe here as in a fort this mountain is gods fort john logan says johnny it is for the eagles to live in and the free people to fly to for my people to climb up out of danger and talk to the great spirit that inhabits it the girl clasped her hands and looked up reverently as she said this but come now johnny dont be serious and i will sing you the nicest song i know till fortynine comes up the mountain and i will dance for you johnny and i will do all that a little girl can do to make you glad and happy as i am johnny here john logan came up the hill and the girl stopped and said very seriously and you are right sure john logan nobody will get after us again nobody follow us away up here jam up nearly against heaven here the two men looked out no carrie nobody will ever climb this high for you nobody except somebody that loves you very much and loves you very truly injins might but white men wont i guess too stiff in the jints and again the girl whirled and danced about as if she had not heard one word he said yet she had heard every word and heeded too for her eyes sparkled and she danced even lighter than before for her heart was light and the wretched little outcast was for a rare thing in her miserable life very very happy i aint stiff in the jints am i johnny and she tapped her ankles carrie sing me that other song of yours and that will make my heart lighter said johnny why johnny we havent even got the clouds to overshadow us here were above the clouds and everything else but ill sing for you if i can only make you glad as you was before they got after us and throwing back her hair and twisting herself about looking back over her shoulder and laughing looking down at her ragged feet and making faces she began like the song of a bird her voice rang out on the coming night for it was now full twilight and the leaves quivered overhead and far up and down the mountains the melody floated in a strange sweet strain and with a touch of tenderness that moved her companions to tears logan stood aside looking down for fortynine a moment then went to bring wood for the fire as her song ended carrie turned to the boy but in doing so her eyes rested on the empty bottle left by the side of a stone spread with a tiger skin by the two men the boy had his head down as if still listening and did not observe her she stopped suddenly started back looked to see if observed by her brother and seeing that he was still absorbed she advanced took up the bottle and held it up glancing back and up the tree somebodys been here somebodys been here and its been white men the bottles empty she hastily hid the bottle and stepping back and looking up where her little store had been hidden she only put her finger to her lip shook her head on seeing what had happened and then went and stood by her little brother very thoughtful and full of care was she now all her merriment had gone she stood there as one suddenly grown old oh thank you carrie its a pretty song but what can keep fortynine so long the boy rose as he said this and turning aside looked down the mountain into the gathering darkness the girl stood close beside him as if afraid he is coming far down i hear fortynines boots on the bowlders oh im so glad and im so glad hes got pistols said the girl eagerly the two men who had stepped out looked at each other as she said this and made signs why carrie are you afraid here you are all of a tremble said the boy as she clung close to him when they turned back johnny said the girl eagerly almost wildly as she looked around if men were to come to take us to that reservation what would you do what would i do i would kill em kill em dead carrie i would hold you to my heart so with this arm and with this i would draw my pistol so and kill em dead the two heads of the manhunters disappeared behind the rocks the boy pushed back the girls black tumbled stream of hair from her brow and kissing her very tenderly he went aside and sat down for he was very very weary a twilight squirrel stole out from the thicket into the clearing and then darted back as if it saw something only partly concealed beyond the two children saw this and looked at each other half alarmed then the girl as if to calm the boy who had grown almost a man in the past few weeks began to talk and chatter as if she had seen nothing suspected nothing when the winter comes johnny we cant stay here we would starve carrie do the birds starve do the squirrels starve what did god make us for if we are to starve all this time the two men had been stealing out from their hidingplace as if resolved to pounce upon and seize the girl before fortynine arrived the leader had signaled and made signs to his companion back there in the gloaming for they dared not speak lest they should be heard and now they advanced stealthily guns in hand and now they fell back to wait a better chance and just as they were about to spring upon the two from behind the snowy white head of old fortynine blossomed above the rocks and his red face like a great opening flower beamed in upon the little party while the goodnatured old man puffed and blowed as he fanned himself with his hat and sat down his keg of provisions and still he puffed and blowed as if he would never again be able to get his breath the two men stole back and fortynine likes to climb the mountains too dont he good for his health see what a color hes got and see how fat he is good for your health aint it papa fortynine but the good old miner was too hot and puffy to answer as the merry little girl danced with delight around him why it makes you blow dont it strange how a little hill like that could make a man blow said johnny winking at carrie but old fortynine only drew a long thin wild flower through his hand and looked up now and then to the girl he beckoned her to approach and she came dancing across to where he sat its a sad looking flower and its a small one but my girl the smallest flower is a miracle and carrie sometimes the sweetest flowers grows closest to the ground the man handed her the flower and was again silent his face had for a moment been almost beautiful here logan came up with a little wood oh john logan what a pretty flower for your buttonhole and the fond girl bounded across and eagerly placed it in the young mans breast the old man on the keg saw this and his face grew dark his hands twisted nervously and he could hardly keep his seat on his keg then he hitched up his pants right and left sat down more resolutely on the keg than before but said nothing for a long time at last the old man hitched about on his keg and said sharply over his shoulder i saw a track a boottrack coming up on the watch there the others looked about as if alarmed it was now dark suddenly the two men appeared looking right and left and smiling villainously they came as if they had followed fortynine and not from behind the rocks where they had been secreted good evenin sir good evenin sir going to rain eh heard it thunder and thought best to get shelter cattlemen were cattlemen pard and i seed your campfire and as it was thunderin we came right in all right boss all right eh all right and the man cap in hand bowed from one to the other as not knowing who was the leader or whom he should address all right answered logan youre very welcome stand your guns there youre as welcome under these trees as the birds eh fortynine but fortynine was now silent and thoughtful he was still breathless and he only puffed and blowed his answer and sat down on his keg again with all his might you must be hungry said the girl kindly approaching the men heaps of provisions puffed fortynine and again he half arose and then sat down on his keg tighter and harder if possible than before thank you gents thank you its hungry we are eh pard well have a spread right off answered the good hearted logan now spreading a rock which served for a table with the food when he observed the two men look at the girl and make signs he looked straight and hard at the manhunters for a moment and seeing them exchange glances and nod their illlooking heads at each other he suddenly dropped his handful of things and started forward he caught the leader by the shoulder and whirling him about as he stood there with his companion leering at the girl he cried out hunting cattle are you whats your brand whats the brand of your cattle i say i know every brand in shasta now what is your brand johnny had strode up angrily toward the two men and followed them up as they retreated old fortynine who now was on the alert and had his sleeves rolled up almost to his elbows from the first had not been indifferent but was reaching his tremendous fist towards the retreating nose of dosson yet it was too dark to distinguish friend from foe why we are not rich men stranger we are poor men and have but few cattle and so so we have no brand eh pardner eh no we got no brand poor men poor men we are poor men with a few cattle that have gone astray we are hungry tired poor men that have lost their way in the night poor men thats hungry and now you want to drive us out into the storm oh fortynine john logan theyre poor hungry men interposed carrie there theres my hand cried impulsive honest old fortynine thats enough youre hungry sit down there and quick carrie pour us the california wine heres a gourd theres a yeast powder can and theres a tin cup thank you heres to you ah that sets a fellow all right it warms the heart and i beg your pardon its mean to be suspicious here fill us up again ah thats gone just to the spot eh fellows to the right spot keep him a drinkin and the others too whispered dosson to emens thats the game and the two villains winked at each other and slapped fortynine on the back and laughed and pretended to be the best friend he had in the world the two men now sat at the table and carrie and johnny bustled about and helped them as they ate and drank meantime logan went for more wood to make a light and heres the bread and heres the meat and and thats about all there is said the girl at last then she stood by and with alarm saw the men swallow the last mouthful and feel about over the table and look up to her for more in the dark all there is all gone yes and tomorrow johnny tomorrow carrie called out fortynine who was now almost drunk weve had a good supper let tomorrow take care of itself eh let tomorrow take care of itself thats my motto hic divide the troubles of the year up into three hundred and sixtyfive parts and take the pieces one at a time live one day at a time thats my philosophy and the poor old man fortynine held his hat high in the air and began to hiccough and hold his neck unsteadily the girl saw this with alarm as if by accident she placed herself between the men and their guns meantime the two men were trying in vain to get at the pistols of fortynine they would almost succeed and then just as they were about to get hold of them the drunken man would roll over to the other side or change position all the time carrie kept wishing so devoutly that logan would come take a drink said one of the men to the girl reaching out his cup after glancing at his companion but the girl only shook her head and stepped further back thought you said she was civilized she she is civilized but isnt quite civilized enough to get drunk yet hiccoughed fortynine as he battered his tincup on the table and again foiled the hand just reached for his pistol the boy saw this and stole back through the dark behind his sister to remove the cap and touch his tongue to the tubes of the guns was the work only of a second and again he was back by the side of the men eagerly all the time the girl kept looking over her shoulders into the dark deep woods for logan the thunder rolled and it began to grow very dark she went up to fortynine on pretense of helping him to more wine and whispered sharply in his ear the old man only stared at her in helpless wonder his head rolled from one side to the other like that of an idiot his wits were utterly under water and now as the darkness thickened and the mens actions could hardly be observed one of them pushed the drunken man over clutched his pistols and the two sprang up together ive got em gar cried emens and the two started back for their guns the girl stood in the way and dosson threw his massive body upon her and bore her to the earth while the other awkwardly holding the two pistols in one hand groped in the dark for their guns the storm began to beat terribly the mountains fairly trembled from the rolling thunder as the man was about to clutch the guns he felt rather than saw that a tall figure stood between that instant a flash of lightning showed john logan standing there the boy by his side and two ugly pistols thrust forward the manhunters were unmasked in the fiery light of heaven and logan knew them for the first time i will not kill you he said this with look and action that was grand and terrible take your guns and go out into the storm if god can spare you i can spare you go and by the lightnings light the two men with two ugly pistolnozzles in their faces took their guns and groped and backed down the mountain into the darkness where they belonged chapter iv the old goldhunter for the right as god has given man to see the maiden right for the right through thickest night till the manbrute wrong be driven from high places till the right shall lift like some grand beacon light for the right love right and duty lift the world up though you fall heaped with dead before the wall god can find a soul of beauty where it falls as gems of worth are found by miners dark in earth old fortynine had not cast his life and lot with john logan at all yet this singular and contradictory old man stood ready to lay down his seemingly worthless life at a moments notice for this boy whom he had almost brought up from childhood but he was not living with him in the mountains he had done all he could to protect him to shelter and feed him all the time but now the pursuit was so hot and desperate that the old man in his sober moments rare enough i admit began to doubt if it would be possible to save this young man much longer from the clutches of the agents indeed it was only by the sweet persuasion of carrie that he had this time been induced to go with her and johnny up on the spur of the mountain and there meet john logan with some provisions from there he was persuaded to go with him to his hidingplace high up the mountain where we left him in the last chapter but the poor old mans head was soon under water again as we have seen that keg of california wine and the few bits of bread and meat which so suddenly disappeared in the hands of dosson and emens were all he happened to have in the cabin when the two children came in at dusk but these he had snatched up at once and ran with them to logan but the next morning when his head was once more above water and he had been told all that had happened he pulled his long white beard to the right and to left and at last rose up and took the two children and led them back down the steep and stupendous mountain to his cabin he knew that john logan was now a doomed man had he been alone had there been no one but himself and this hunted man he would have stayed by his side as it was it made the old man a year older to decide and it was like tearing his heart out by the roots when he rose up choking with agony grasped logans hand bade him farewell and led the children hurriedly away once twice the old man stopped and turned suddenly about and looked sharply and almost savagely up the mountains as if to return and then each time he sighed shook his head and hurried on down the hill he held tightly on to the little brown hands of the children as if he feared that they too like himself might let their better natures master them and so turn back and join the desolate and hunted man that evening after the old man had returned from his tunnel and while he prepared a meager meal from a few potatoes and a heel of bacon found back in the corner of a shelf and so hard that even the woodrats had refused to eat it a passing fellowminer put his heavy head and shoulders in at the half open cabin and shouted out that a barn had been burned in the valley a house fired into and the tomahawk of john logan found hard by the children glanced at each other by the low firelight but old fortynine only went on with his work as the head withdrew and passed on but he said never a word he was very thoughtful all the evening he was now perfectly certain that his course had been the wise one the only prudent one in fact logan he knew was now beyond help he must use all his art and address to keep the children from further peril he made them promise to remain in his cabin to never attempt to reach logan he told them that their presence with him would only greatly embarrass him in his flight that they might be followed if they attempted to reach him and that he and they would then be taken and sent to the reservation together but he told them further and their black eyes flashed like fire as he spoke in a voice tremulous with emotion and earnestness that if ever logan came to that cabin hungry or for help of any kind they should help him with every means in their power and so the old man went back to work in his tunnel and as the autumn wore away and winter drew on the children kept close about the little old cabin waiting waiting waiting looking up toward the now white cold mountain yet obeying fortynine to the letter meantime the manhunt went on although the children knew nothing for a long time of the deadly energy with which it was conducted what a strange place for two bright budding children was this old old cabin with its old old man and its dark and miserable interior how people shunned the lonely old place and how it sank down into the earth and among the weeds and willows and long strong yellow tangled grass as if it wanted to be shunned on a dirty old shelf near the fireplace lay a torn and tattered book it was thumbed and thrumbed all to pieces from long and patient use when the wind blew through the chinks of the cabin this old book seemed to have life it fluttered there like a wounded bird its leaves literally whispered this old book was a bible more houses had been burned in the little valley and the crime laid to john logan he had now been proclaimed an outlaw in effect by every settler those two men had made him so odious that many settlers had vowed to shoot him on sight dosson at last went before a magistrate and swore that john logan had shot at him while in the performance of his duty as a subagent of the reservation by this means he procured a warrant for his arrest by the civil authorities to be placed in the hands of the newly elected sheriff of the newly organized and sparsely settled country things looked desperate indeed to add to the agony of the crisis a sharp and bitter winter now wrapped the whole world in snow and ice it was no longer possible for any one to subsist in the mountains or survive at all without fire and firearms these the hunted man did not dare use they were witnesses that would betray his presence and must not be thought of all this time the old man and the children could do nothing the children hovered over the fire in the wretched old cabin and what a cold cheerless place it was but if the interior of this old cabin was gloomy that of the old tunnel was simply terrible yet in this dark and dreadful place the old man had spent nearly a quarter of a century i wonder if the glad gay world knows where it gets its gold does that fair woman or wellclad wellfed man know anything about the life of the goldhunter when the gold is brought to the light and given to the commerce of the world we see it shining in the sun it is now a part of the wealth of the nation but do not forget that every piece of gold you touch or see or stand credited with at your bank cost some brave man blood life this old fortynine years before when the camp was young had found a piece of goldbearing quartz in a ledge on the top of a high sharp ridge that pointed down into the canyon this was before quartz mining had been thought of but the shrewd thoughtful man saw that from this source came all the gold in the placer he could see that it was from this vein that all the fine gold in the camp had been fed he resolved to strike at the fountain head it was by accident he had made his discovery the high sharp and narrow ridge was densely timbered and now that the miners had settled in the canyon below the annual fires would not be allowed to sweep over the country and the woods would soon be almost impenetrable so argued fortynine for all his mind was bent on keeping his secret till he could pierce the mountains from the canyonlevel below and strike the ledge in the heart of the great highbacked ridge where he felt certain the gold must lay in great heaps and flakes and wedges and so it was with a full heart and a strong arm that he had begun his low dark tunnel all alone at the bottom of the ridge he had begun his tunnel in a secluded place under a tuft of dense wood on the steep hillside he made the mouth of the tunnel very low and narrow at first he wheeled out the dirt in his wheelbarrow only when the water in the canyon was high enough to carry off the earth which he excavated he worked very hard and kept very sober for a long time day after day he expected to strike the ledge but day after day week after week month after month stole away between his fingers and still no sign of the ledge a year went by then he struck a hard wall of granite this required drills fusepowder and all the appliance of the quarry he had to stop work now and then and wash in the fast failing placers to get money enough to continue his tunnel besides he now could make only a few inches headway each week sometimes he would be a whole month making the length of his pickhandle all this was discouraging the man began to grow heartsick who was there at home waiting and waiting all this time no one in the camp could say in fact no one in the camp knew any thing at all about this silent man who seemed so superior to them all and as the camp knew nothing at all of the man either his past or his present as is usually the case it made a history of its own for him and you may be certain it was not at all complimentary to this exclusive and silent man of the tunnel two three four five years passed the camp had declined miners had either gone back to the states gone to new mines or gone up on the little hill out of the canyon to rest together and yet this man held on to his tunnel he was a little bit bent now from long stooping waiting toiling and there were ugly crowsfeet about his eyes eyes that had grown dim and bloodshot from the five years glare of the single candle in that tunnel and the man was not so exclusive now the tunnel was now no secret it was spoken of now with derision only to be laughed at six seven eight nine ten years the man has grown old he is bent and gray but his faith which the few remaining miners call a madness is still unbroken yet it is not in human nature to endure all this agony of suspense all this hope deferred from day to day week to week month to month year to year and still be human the man has in some sense become a brute he now is seen to reel and totter to his cabin late at night oftentimes he has at last fallen into the habit of the camp he can drink gamble carouse as late as the latest now and then it is true he has his sober spells and all the good of his great nature is to the surface now he takes up a map and diagram which is hidden under the broad stone of the hearth and examines it measures and makes calculations by the hour at night when all the camp is or ought to be asleep maybe it is the placing and displacing of this great stone that has given rise to the story in the camp that the old man is not so poor as he pretends maybe some of the rough men who hang about the camp have watched him through the chinkholes in the wretched cabin some night and decided that it is gold which he keeps concealed under the great hearthstone eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen years the mans hair is long and hangs in strings it is growing gray almost white some men have been trying to get into the bent old mans cabin at night to find the buried treasure the old mans doublebarreled shotgun has barked in their faces and there has been a thinly attended funeral the camp is low miserable the tide is out wrecks of rockers toms sluices flumes derricks battered pans tomirons cradles old cabin strew the sandy strand this last act has left the old man utterly alone yet he is seen even more frequently than before at the deadfall is he trying to forget that man had died at his hand now and then you see him leading a tawny boy about and talking in a low tender way of better things than his life and appearance would indicate the man is still on the down grade and yet how long he has been on this decline one would say he should be at the bottom by this time when we reflect how very far a man can fall we can estimate something of the height in which he stands when fresh from his makers hand sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone years the irongray hair is white as the snow on the mountaintops that environ him the tall man is bent as a tree is bent when the winter snow lies heavily on its branches the tawny boy is grown a man now this is john logan the fugitive the two homeless children have long since taken his place and still the pick clangs on in that dark damp tunnel that is always dripping dripping dripping where it looks out at the glaring day as if in eternal tears for the wasted life within yet now there is hope new life has been infused into this old camp of late years the tide is flowing in the placer mines have perished and passed into history but there is a new industry discovered it is quartz mining the very thing that this old man has given his life to establish and it is this that has kept the old man up alive for the past few years he is now certain that he will strike it yet is there some one waiting still far away we do not know he does not know now years and years ago utterly discouraged yet mechanically keeping on he ceased to write but now these two new lives here have ran into his if he could only strike it now if he could only strike it for them it is midwinter the three are almost starving old fortynine has been prudent cautious careful of the two helpless waifs thrown into his hands could he old broken destitute friendless stand up boldly between the manhunters and these children impossible and so it is that dosson and emens are not strangers at the old mans cabin now hateful as is their presence there to all they are allowed to come and go and dosson pays court to carrie they ply the old man with drink the poor broken brave old miner still dreams and hopes that he will strike it yet and then sometimes he starts up in his sleep and strikes out with his bony hands as if to expel them from his cabin and keep carrie safe sacred pure then he sinks back with a groan and carrie bends over him and her great eyes fill with tears chapter v the capture o the mockery of pity weep with fragrant handkerchief in pompous luxury of grief selfish hollowhearted city o these moneygetting times

fortynines cabin by a flickering logfire carrie sits alone the wind howls horribly the door creaks and the fire snaps wickedly the wind roars now the roar of a faroff sea and now it smites the cabin in shocks and sifts and shakes the snow through the shingle the girl draws her tattered blanket tighter about her and sits a little closer to the fire now there is a sudden savage gust of wind wilder fiercer than before and a sheet of snow sifts in through a crack in the door and dances over the floor what a storm exclaims the girl as she rises up looks about and then takes the blanket from her shoulders and stuffs it in the crack by the door she listens looks about again and then going up to the little glass tacked beside the fireplace carefully arranges her splendid hair that droops down over her shoulders in the careless perfect fashion of evangeline heaven help any one who is out in this storm tonight then she takes another stick from the corner and places it on the fire fortynine will be here soon and johnny johnny with news about him about poor john logan she shakes her head and clasps her hands it is nearly half a year since that night they cant take him they dare not take him they are hunting him hunting him in this storm hunting him as if he were a wild beast he hides with the cattle in the sheds with the very hogs in their pens they come upon him there he starts from his sleep and dashes away while they follow and track him by the blood of his feet in the snow oh how terrible it is i must not think of it i will go mad she turns to the door and listens she draws back the ragged curtains from the window and tries to look out into the storm she can hear and see nothing and she walks back again to the fire i must set them their supper as she says this she goes to a little cupboard and takes a piece of bread puts it on a plate and sets it on the table then she places two plates and two cups of water they will be here soon and they must have their suppers oh that grocery she shudders as she says this and johnny will bring me news of him of john logan whats that she springs to the door lifts the latch and stumps steals in brushing the snow from his neck and shoulders he has a club in his hand and looks back and about him as he shuts the door oh sister its awful i tell you its too awful brother brother what has happened what is awful what is it johnny and he john logan hes been there the boy shivers and points in a halffrightened manner toward the little hill yes he has hes been up on the hill by his mothers grave and hes been to squire fields

help me she was a good woman she was she didnt sick bose on me she didnt as the boy says this he stands his club in the corner and looks with his sister for a moment sadly into the fire and then suddenly says im hungry sister aint you got something to eat fortynine hes down to the grocery and phin emens hes down to the grocery too and he swears awfully about john logan and he says its the injun thats in him that makes him so bad do you think its the injun thats in him sister as the boy says this the girl turns silently to the little table and pushes it toward him there johnny thats all there is you must leave some for fortynine poor poor john logan he eats greedily for a moment then stops suddenly and looks into the fire carrie also looking into the fire murmurs and sylvia fields let them tie a dog there to keep him away i would have killed that dog first if john logan should come here i would open that door i would open that door to him there is a dark and terrified face at the window and i would give him bread to eat and let him sit by this fire and get warm and i would too so help me i would the boy pushes back his bread and rises and goes up to his sister yes i would i dont care what phin emens or anybody says for his mother didnt sick bose at me she didnt the pale and pitiful face at the window begins to brighten there is snow in the long matted black locks that fall to his shoulders for nearly half a year this man has fled from his fellowman a hunted grizzly a hunted tiger of the jungle what wonder that his step is stealthy as he lifts the latch and enters what wonder that his eyes have an uncommon glare as he looks around looks back over his shoulder as he shuts the door noiselessly behind him what wonder that his clothes hang in shreds about him and his feet and legs are bound in thongs that his arms are almost bare that his bloodless face is half hidden in black and shaggy beard carrie i have come to you yours is the only door that will open to me now john logan she starts the boy too utters a low stifled cry then they draw near the miserable man for they are bred of the woods and have nerves of iron and they know the need and the power of silence too you here john logan carrie whispers with a shudder ay i am here starving dying the boy takes up the bread he had dropped and places it on the table before logan the hunted outcast sits down wearily and begins to eat with the greediness of a starved beast the girl timidly brushes the snow from his hair and takes a pin from her breast and begins to pin up a great rent in his shirt that shows his naked shoulder the boy is glad and full of heart and of indescribable delight that he has given his bread to the starving man he stands up brightly with his back to the fire for a moment and then goes back and brushes off the snow from the mans matted hair then back to the fire im awful glad to see you eat mr john logan says stumps i wish there was more i do and he rocks on his foot and wags his head from shoulder to shoulder gleefully it aint much it aint much mr john logan but it is all there is all there is and they were eating it the man says this aside to himself and he hides his face for a moment as if he would conceal a tear then after a time he seems to recover himself and he lays the bread down on the table tenderly silently carefully indeed as if it were the most delicate and precious thing on earth then lifting his face looks at them with an effort to be cheerful and says i i forgot i i am not hungry i have had my dinner i i oh yes i have been eating a great deal oh no no no im not hungry not hungry as the man says this he rises and stands between the others at the fire he puts his hands over their heads and looks alternately in their uplifted faces there is a long silence carrie they have tied a dog to that door over yonder there is no dog tied to this door john logan low and tender with love yet very firm and earnest is her voice and her eyes are lifted to his he looks down into her soul and there is an understanding between them there is a conversation of the eyes too refined for words too subtle too sweet too swift for words they stand together but a moment there soul flowing into soul and tiding forth and to and fro but it was as if they had talked together for hours he leans his head kisses her lifted and unresisting lips and says god bless you and that is all it is her first kiss the imprint the mintmark on this virgin gold this maiden of a moment since is a woman now do you know that they are after you the girl says this in a sort of wild whisper as she looks toward the door do i know that they are after me father in heaven who should know it better than i the man throws up his arms and totters back and falls into a seat from very weakness do i know that they are after me for more than half a year i have fled night and day and day and night i have fled hidden away starting up at midnight from down among the cattle where i had crept to keep warm and then on on and on out into the snow the storm over the frozen ground to the deep canyon and dark woods where naked and bleeding i disputed with the bear for his bed in the hollow tree the boy springs to the door is it the storm that is tugging and rattling at the latch but the girl seems to see to heed to hear only john logan she clutches his hand in both her own and covers it with kisses and with tears john logan i pity you i i she had almost said i love you thank heaven thank heaven for one true heart and one true hand when all the world is against me carrie i could die now content the bitterness of my heart passes away and the wild mad nature that made me an ishmaelite with every mans hand against me and my hand against all is gone i am another being i could die now content and he bows his head but you must not you shall not die you must go go far away why hover about this place i do not know but yonder lies the only being who ever befriended me and somehow i get lonesome when i get far away from her grave and i go round and round like the sun around the world and come back to where i started from but you must go go far away go now do you know what you are saying i was never outside of this all would be strange i would be lost lost there and then do you not imagine they are waiting for me there everywhere look at my face this tinge of indian blood that all men abhor and fear and call treacherous and bloody across my brow at my birth was drawn a brand that marks me forever a brand a brand as if it were the brand of cain the man bows his head and turns away slowly and timidly carrie approaches him and she lays her hand on his arm and looks in his face the boy still watches by the door but you will fly from here his arm drops over her hair down to her shoulder and he draws her to his breast as she looks up tenderly in his face and pleads you will go now at once for you will die here ah i will die here he says this with a calm and dogged determination carrie i have one wish one request only one i know you are weak and helpless yourself and cant do much and i ought not to ask you to do anything stumps has left the door as he hears the man mention that there is something to be done and stands by their side whatever it is you ask john logan we will do it we will do it the girl says this with a firmness that convinces him that it will be done we will do it we will do it so help me we will do it blubbers stumps what is it john logan we can do i will not fly from here he looks down tenderly into their faces then he lifts his face it is dark and terrible and his lips are set with resolution i will die here it may be tonight it may be tomorrow it may be as i turn to go out at that door they will send their bullets through my heart it may be while i kneel in the snow at my mothers grave but sooner or later it will come it will come but please john logan what is it we can do her voice is tremulous and her eyes stream with tears carrie i am a man a strong man and ought not to ask anything of a helpless girl but i have no other friend i have had no friends all the days of my life have been dark and lonely and now i am about to die carrie i want you to see that i am buried by my mother yonder i am so weary and i could rest there and then she poor brokenhearted mother she might not be so lonesome then do you promise i do promise and the boy echoes this scarcely audible but determined answer thank you thank you and now good night i must be going lest i draw suspicion on you good night good night god bless you carrie he presses her to his heart hastily embraces her and tearing himself away stoops and kisses the boy as he passes to the door drawing his tattered shirt closer about his shoulders and turning his face as if to conceal his emotion he lays his hand upon the latch to suddenly dart forth two dark figures pass the window and in a moment more the latchstring is clutched by a rough unsteady hand from without here here cries the girl as she springs back to the dingy curtain that divides off a portion of the cabin into a bedroom here in here quick quick as she draws the curtain aside and lets it fall over the retreating fugitive fortynine and gar dosson enter the former is drunk and therefore dignified and silent his companion is drunk and therefore garrulous and familiar wine floats a mans real nature nearly to the surface fortynine lifts his hat bows politely and respectfully to the children brushes his hat with his elbow as he meanders across the floor to the peg in the wall but cannot quite trust himself to speak hullo carats cries gar dosson as he chucks her under the chin knowed i was coming didnt you got yourself fixed up pretty aint she and he winks a bloodshot eye toward stumps and when is it going to be my carats pretty soon now eh and he walks or rather totters aside umph i have got em again carrie fly around and get us something to eat fly around carrie fly around oh ive got the shakes again groans fortynine poor old boy and she brushes the snow from his beard and his tattered coat why fortynine youre shaking like a leaf hes drunk thats whats the matter with him gar dosson growls this out between his teeth as he sets his gun in the corner hes not drunk its the ager retorts stumps fiercely gar dosson glaring at the boy steadies himself on his right leg and diving deep in his left hand pocket draws forth a large bill or poster with both hands he manages to spread this out and swaggering up to the wall near the window he hangs it on two pegs that are there to receive coats or hats look at that and he crookedly points with his crooked fingers at the large letters and reads one thousand dollars hic dollars reward for the capture of john logan what do you say to that carats thats a fine fellow to have for a lover now aint it a waluable lover now aint it worth a thousand dollars oh dont i wish he was ahanging around here now wouldnt i sell him and get a thousand dollars eh yes i would i just want that thousand dollars and im the man thats going to get it too eh old blossomnose fortynine jerks back his dignified head as the bully gesticulates violently you will will you well maybe you will hic but if you get a cent of that money hic for catching that man you dont enter that door again no you dont lift that latchstring again as long as old fortynine has a fist to lift and he thrusts his doubled hand hard into the boasters face good for you cries carrie dear good brave old fortynine i like you i love you and the girl embraces him while the boy flourishes his club at the back of the bully no dont you hit a man when hes down sah continues fortynine thats the true doctrine of a gentleman the true doctrine of a gentleman sah he flourishes his hand totters forward totters back and hesitates the true doctrine of a gentleman sah the little horse in the horserace sah the bottom dog in the dogfight sah the and the poor old man totters back and falls helplessly in the great homemade chair near the corner where stands the gun his head is under water the true doctrines of a gentleman snaps dosson and he throws out a big hand toward the drooping head old blossomnose then turning to carrie the sheriffs a coming he gave me that ere bill yes he did hes down to the grocery now hes going around to all the cabins and aswearing em in a book that they dont know nothing about john logan the sheriff hes a comin here carats right off there is a rift in the curtain and the pitiful face of the fugitive peers forth the sheriff coming here he turns feels the wall and tries the logs with his hands not a door not a window solid as the solid earth coming here but what is he coming here for demands carrie coming here to find out what you know about john logan oh hes close after him close after me gasps logan the man feels for something to lay hand upon by which to defend himself i will not be taken alive i will die here he clutches at last above the bed a gun saved saved he holds it tenderly as if a child or something dearly loved he takes it to the light and looks at the lock he blows in the barrel he mournfully shakes his head it is not loaded well no matter i can but die and he clubs the gun and prepares for mortal battle oh come carats cries gar dosson lets have a little frolic before the sheriff comes a kiss eh come my beauty the rough man has all this time been stealing up as nearly as he could to the girl and now throws his arm about her neck shall i brain him be a murderer indeed all the indian is again aroused and john logan seems more terrible and more determined to save her than to defend his own life stand back shouts the girl to dosson she attempts to throw him off but his powerful arm is about her neck fortynine help but the old man is unconscious john logan is about to start from his corner take that you brute and that and stumps whirls his club and thunders against the ribs of the ruffian you devil you brat what do you mean mad with disappointment and pain he throws the girl from him and turns upon the boy he clutches him by the back of the neck as he starts to escape and bears him to the ground look ere do you know what im going to do with you im going to break your back across my knee yes i am and he glares about terribly carrie shrinks back to the side of fortynine oh help he will murder him he will kill him no i wont murder you you brat but ill chuck you out in that snow and let you cool off while i have your sister all to myself come here give me your ear and the great strong ruffian seizes his ear and fairly carries him along by it toward the door give me your ear oh sister sister he will kill me howls stumps fortynine save us we will be murdered come i say give me your ear thunders the brute as he fairly draws the boy still toward the door stop that or die the frenzied girl failing to arouse fortynine has caught up the gun from the corner and brought the muzzle to the ruffians breast he totters back and throws up his arms go back there and sit down or i will kill you give me your ear come roars stumps it is now his turn give me your ear he reaches up and takes that red organ in his hand and nearly wrenches it from the brutes head as he leads him back with many twists and gyrations slowly to a low seat at the other side of the cabin still holding the gun in level and in dangerous proximity to the mans breast carrie cries now if you attempt to move you are a dead man give me your ear and stumps wrenches it again as he sits the man firmly on his low stool with his red face making mad distortions from the pain john logan come calls the girl no dont you start gar dosson dont you lift a finger if you do you die the curtains are parted and john logan starts forth go go theres not a moment to lose the sheriff will be here they are coming quick go at once i hear i hear them coming the man springs to the door the latch is lifted a moment more and he will be free safe at least for the night out into the friendly darkness where man and beast where pursuer and pursued are equal and equally helpless there is a crushing of snow a stamping of feet and one two three four five five forms hurriedly pass the window the latch is lifted and as john logan again darts back under cover the party brushing the snow from their coats and grizzled beards hastily enter the cabin fly around carrie fly around fix yourself up the fresh gust of wind and storm from the door just opened fans the glimmering spark of consciousness into sudden flame and fortynine springs up perfectly erect perfectly dignified fly around carrie fly around fix yourself up the sheriff is coming fly around the girl drops the gun in the corner where she had found it and stands before fortynine smoothing down her apron and letting her eyes fall on the floor timidly and in a childlike way as if these little hands of hers had never known a harder task than their present employment of smoothing down her apron dosson springs up before the sheriff he rubs his eyes and he looks about as if he had just been startled from some bad ugly dream he wonders indeed if he has seen john logan at all again he rubs his eyes and then looking at his knuckle says in a deep guttural fashion to himself jimjams by gol i thought id seed john logan ah fortynine says the sheriff sorry to disturb you and your miss and good evening to you sir and good evening to you and the honest sheriff bows to each and brushes the snow from his fur cap as he speaks gar dosson advances to his partner phin emens who has just entered with that stealthy old tigerstep so familiar to them both and laying his hand on his shoulder they move aside then its not the jimjams mutters he ive not got em then he stops pinches himself looks at his hands and mutters to himself then he lifts his hand to his ear look at it again phin emens looks at the ear its red aint it oh it feels red it feels like fire then ive not got em and he is here hist come here we want that thousand dollars all to ourselves he plucks his companion further to one side they talk and gesticulate together while now and then a big red rough hand is thrust out savagely toward the curtain sorry indeed to disturb you miss observes the sheriff but you see ive been searching and swearing of em all and its only fair to serve all alike he is not here upon the honor of a gentleman he is not here says fortynine emphatically he is here howls dosson and the tremendous man with the tremendous voice and tremendous manner bolts up before the sheriff he is here and i as an honest man am going to earn a thousand dollars for the sake of justice i have found him found him all by myself and these fellers cant have no hand in my find and he holds up john logans cap which had been knocked from his head in his hasty retreat to cover and he rolls his red eyes toward the bed takes a step in that direction reaches a hand lays hold of the curtain and is about to dash it aside john logan is there shouts dosson and again the curtain is clutched does he dream of what is beyond if he could only see the panting breathless wretch that leans there eagerly with lifted gun ready to brain him waiting waiting for him to come even wishing that he only would come he would start back with terror to the other side he is here i have found him come carrie springing forward from her posture of anxiety and terror grasps a powder horn from over the mantel piece jerks out the stopple with her teeth and holding it over the fire cries with desperation do it if you dare this horn is full of powder and if any man here dares to move that curtain ill blow you all into burning hell the man loosens his hold on the curtain and totters back he is sober enough to know how terrible is the situation and he knows her well enough to believe she will do precisely what she says she will do yes i will we will all go to the next world together and now let us see who is best ready to die bravo shouts fortynine the sheriff and his men have been moving back slowly from the inspired girl standing there by the door of death gar dosson at last steals around by the sheriff but he is here mr sheriff he says i tell you he is here in this house there for here is his cap i found it i found him and i want him and i want that thousand dollars search and i tell you he is not here cries the girl and you shall not search less and the horn is lifted menacingly over the fire wont you take my word you shall take my word shouts dosson i will take your single word miss against a thousand such men and the sheriff puts on his cap turns and is about to go but he is here the thousand dollars mr sheriff cries dosson miss officers sometimes have duties that are more unpleasant to them than to the parties most concerned you say he is not here he is not here mr sheriff he is not here cries carrie the sheriff twists his cap on his head and you will be sworn as the others were says the sheriff so much the better and that will be quite satisfactory ah here is the bible at hand and he takes from the little shelf the tattered book the girl stands still as stone with the engine of death in her hand the officer bows smiles reaches the book with his left hand lays his cap on the table and lifts his right hand in the air her little fingers reach out firmly fearlessly and rest on the book her eyes are looking straight into his it may be my duty miss to search the house after what that un has said and miss i expect it is my duty but miss i is not the man to expose you before a man as might like to see you exposed and then that poor devil that come back here miss on bleeding feet crawling back here on his hands and knees to die by his mothers grave the voice is tremulous the hand that is raised in the air comes down then lifting it again he says resolutely swear miss all are looking leaning with the profoundest interest there is a dark strange face peering through a rift in the halfopened curtain god bless her god bless her she can and she will mutters fortynine she cant cries dosson she believes the book and by gol she cant the man says this over his shoulder and in a husky whisper as the girl seems to pause hold your hand on the book and swear as i shall tell you says the sheriff she only holds more firmly to the book her eyes are fixed more steadily on his say it as i say it i do solemnly swear i do solemnly swear that john logan that john logan is not here is is here the curtain is thrown back and the fugitive dashes into their midst the book falls from the sheriffs hand and there is a murmur of amazement god bless you my girl and there is the stillness of a sabbath morning over all god bless you and god will reward you for this for i cannot you have made me another being carrie i have lost my life but you have saved my soul and turning cheerfully to the sheriff he reaches his hands now sir i am ready chapter vi the escape o tranquil moon o pitying moon put forth thy cool protecting palms and cool their eyes with cooling alms against the burning tears of noon o saintly noiselessfooted nun o sadbrowed patient mother keep thy homeless children while they sleep and kiss them weeping every one at first there was a loud demonstration against logan by the mob that always gathers about where a man is captured by his fellows the wolves that come up when the wounded buffalo falls there was talk of a vigilance committee and of lynching but when the stout resolute sheriff led the man in chains down the trail through the deep snow and turned him over to the officer in charge of a little squad of soldiers at the other side of the valley no man interfered further indeed dosson and emens were too anxious about the promised reward to make any demonstration against this mans life now he was worth to them a thousand dollars a lawyer reading this will smile here at the loose way in which the law was administered there in the outer edge of the world at that time here is a sheriff with a warrant in his pocket made returnable to a magistrate the sheriff arrests the man on this warrant and takes him directly to the military authorities which have been so long seeking him utterly unconscious that he is doing aught but the proper thing and yet after all it was the shortest and best course to take i shall not forget the face of the prisoner as we stood beside the trail in the snow while he was led past down the mouth of the canyon toward the other side of the valley it was grand some strangers standing in the street spoke of the majesty of the mans bearing they openly dared to admire his lifted face and to speak with derision of his captors as the party passed on this made the low element out of which mobs are always created a little bit timid possibly it was this that saved the prisoner but most likely it was the resolute face of the honest sheriff for say what you will there is nothing so cowardly as a mob throw what romance you please over the actions of the vigilantes of california they were murderers coarse cowardly and brutal murderers legally and morally every one of them it is to be admitted that they did good work at first but their example followed even down to this day has been fruitful of the darkest crimes when fortynine awoke next morning from his long drunken slumber the children were not there dosson called arrayed in his best but carrie was not to be seen fortynine could give no account of her this day of triumph for dosson did not yield him so much as he had all the night before fancied he was furious fortynine as usual after a spree meekly took up his pick after a breakfast on a piece of bread and the drawings of coffee grounds that had been thrice boiled over and stumbled away towards his tunnel and was soon lost in the deeps of the earth you may be certain that this desperate character just taken after so much trouble and cost was securely ironed at the little military camp across the valley an old log cabin was made a temporary prison and soldiers strode up and down on the four sides of it day and night and yet there was hardly need of such heavy irons true the soldiers outside as they walked up and down at night and shifted their muskets from side to side and slapped their shoulders with their arms and hands to keep from freezing heard the chains grate and toss and rattle often and often as if some one was trying to tear and loosen them but it was only the man tossing his arms in delirium as he lay on the fir boughs in the corner dosson after much inquiry and many days watching about fortynines cabin called and was admitted to see the prisoner who by this time though weak and worn to a skeleton was convalescing the coarse and insolent intruder started back with dismay there sat the girl he so hoped and longed to possess talking to him tenderly soothing him giving her life for his long and brutal would be the story of the agents endeavors to tear this girl away from the bedside of the sufferer if such a place could be called a bedside the girl would not leave john logan and the timid boy who sat shivering back in the corner of the cabin would not leave the girl the three were bound together by a chain stronger than that which bound the wrists of the prisoner aye ten thousand times stronger for man had fashioned the one god the other sudden and swift arrives summer in california the trail was opened to the reservation down the mountain and the officer collected his few indians together in a long single line all chained to a long heavy cable and prepared to march about the middle of the chain stood john logan now strong enough to walk at the front were placed a few miserable spiritless indians who had been found loafing about the minerss cabins the drunkards thieves vagabonds of their tribe such as all tribes have such as we have citizenreader while the rear was brought up by a boy and girl carrie and johnny a pitiful sight do not be surprised when you have learned to know the absolute the utterly unlimited power and authority of an indian agent or subagent you have only to ask the capability for villainy he may possess in order to find the limit of his actions could you have seen the lofty disdain of this girl for her suitor at that first and every subsequent meeting as she kept at the bedside of john logan you could have guessed what might follow the mans love was turned to rage he resolved to send her back to the reservation also it is true the soldiers had learned to respect and to pity her it is true the little lieutenant said with a soldierly oath as she was being chained that she was whiter than the man who was having it done yet the soldiers and their officer as well had their orders and a soldiers duties as you know are all bound up in one word as for the wretched boy he might have escaped he was a negative sort of a being at best and no one save logan and the girl either hated him or loved him greatly tender and true as he was they both implored him to slip between the fingers of the soldiers and not go to the reservation but he would not think of being separated from his sister poor stunted starved little thing there were wrinkles about his face his hands were black short and hard from digging roots from the frosty ground it is not probable the lad had ever had enough to eat since he could remember and so he was a dwarf a dwarf in body and in soul and instead of showing some spirit and standing up now and helping the girl as he should he leaned on her utterly and left her to be the man of the two the little spark of fire that had twice or thrice flashed up in the last few years seemed now to die out entirely and he stood there chained looking back now and then over his shoulder at the soldiers looking forward trying to catch a glance from his sister now and then but never once making any murmur or complaint it was a hot sultry day such as suddenly enters and takes possession of canyons in the sierras when the little party of prisoners were marched through the little camp at the end of the canyon on their way to the reservation and the camp all came out to see but the camp was silent it was not a pleasant sight a soldier with a bayonet on his loaded musket walking by the side of a woman with her hands in chains is not an inspiring spectacle with all respect for your superior judgments mr president commanderinchief and captains of the army i say there is a nobler use for the army than this let us hasten on from this subject and this scene but do not imagine that the miner the settler or even the most hardened about the camp felt ennobled at this sight i tell you there was a murmur of indignation and disgust heard all up and down the canyon the newer and better element of the camp was furious one man even went so far as to write a letter to a country paper on the subject but when the editor responded in a heavy leader and assured the camp of its deadly peril from these prowling savages and proclaimed that the indians were being taken where they would have good medicine care food and clothing and be educated and taught the arts of agriculture the case really did not look so bad and in less than a week the whole affair had been forgotten by all the camp aye all save old fortynine by the express order of subagent dosson the old man who had been declared a dangerous character by him was not permitted to see the girl from the first day he discovered that she still clung to logan but the old man had worked on and waited he had kept constantly sober he would see and would save this girl at all hazards and now as the sorrowful remnant of a once great tribe was being taken like israel into captivity he rushed forward to meet her to hold her hands to press her to his heart and bid her be strong and hopeful the agent saw the old man and shouted to the officer the officer called to the soldiers the line moved forward the bayonets crossed the old mans breast as the prisoners passed on down the mountain and he saw the sad pitiful face no more keep the picture before you chained together in long lines marched always on foot in single file under the stars and stripes officers in uniforms clanking swords the uniform of the union riding bravely along the lines the two men who had done so much to get this desperate indian out of the way remained behind to keep possession of his house and land they had not even the decency to build a new cabin they only broke down the door put up a new one with stouter hinges and latch and the longcoveted land was theirs as for old fortynine all the light had left the mountain and the valley now carrie whom he had cared for from the first almost little stumps whom he had found with her hardly big enough to toddle about both were gone all three gone john logan whom he had taught to read and taught a thousand things at his own cabinfire in the long snowy winters all these gone together it was as if the sun had gone down for fortynine forever there was no sun or moon or stars or any thing that shines in the mountains any more for him his had been a desolate life all the long years he had delved away into the mountain at his tunnel no man had taken his hand in friendship for many and many a year the man now nailed up his cabin door an idle task perhaps for men instinctively avoided it and the trail of late took a cut across the spur of the hill rather than pass by his door but somehow the old man felt that he might not be back soon and as men had kept away from that cabin while he was there he did not feel that they should enter it in his absence one evening in the hot sultry summer old fortynine rode down from the mountain into the great valley following the trail taken by the lines of chained captives and set his face for the reservation at a risk of repetition let us look at this reservation the government had ordered a united states officer of the rank of lieutenant to set apart a reservation for the indians on land not acquired and not likely to be desired by the white settlers and to gather the indians together there and keep them there by force if force should be required this young man established a reservation on the border of a tule lake shut in by a crescent of low sagebrush hills the indian camp was laid out on the very edge of this alkali lake the crescent of sagebrush hills of a mile in circuit reaching back and almost around the reservation was mounted at three points by cannon ready to sweep the camp below on this circuit of hills healthy and pleasant enough the officers and soldiers had their quarters down in the damp deadly valley on the edge of the alkali lake the newly appointed indian agent with a tremendous appropriation to be expended in building houses and establishing the indians in their new homes built the village it was made up of two rows of low onestory oneroom huts two big lamps hung in the one street and from lamp to lamp before the doors of the little huts with earthen floors and turfcovered roofs paced soldiers night and day these houses were damp and dismal from the first soon they began to be mouldy fungi and toadstools and the like began to grow up in the corners and out of the logs little shiny reptiles in the long hot rainy days that followed and worms and all sorts of hideous vermin began to creep and crawl through these dreadful dens of death over the sick and dying indians long slimy unnamed and unknown worms crawled up out of the earth as if they could not wait for the victims to die the indians were dying off by hundreds they went to the officers and complained the officers ordered a double guard to be set and that was all you marvel that these young lieutenants could be so imperious and cruel it does seem past belief but pardon just one paragraph of digression while we recall the conduct of a younger class only last year on the hudson to me the real question before the courts in the whitaker case is not whether this quiet stranger with a tinge of black mans blood in his veins mutilated himself or no but the real question is did they or did they not by their determined and persistent persecutions and insults drive him in a fit of desperation to do this in the hope of pulling down ruin on the heads of all this seems probable to me and to me is far more monstrous than if they had in sudden anger cut his ears or even cut his throat and if these young bloods could so treat a stranger there standing at such a manifest disadvantage what would they not be capable of when they are for the first time clothed with a little brief authority away out on the savage edge of the world the water here as the hot season came on was something dreadful it was slimy with alkali little black worms knotted and twisted themselves together at the bottom of the cup like bunches of witchwoven horsehair the indians were dying of malaria they were burning up with the fever and this was the only water these people who had been used to the fresh sweet snowwater of the sierras could have what could they do they appealed to the officers they were answered with insult you must get used to it you must get civilized these dying indians began to fight and quarrel among themselves ah they were very wicked they were quarrelsome as dogs almost as quarrelsome as christians this was a small paris in siege it was jerusalem surrounded by titus down there dying as they were a savage simon and a degenerate john as in jerusalem of old led their followers against each other even across their dead that lay unburied in the mouldy deathpens and about their dark and narrow doors and slew each other as did gods chosen people when besieged by the son of vespasian then the men in brass and blue turned the cannon loose on the howling savages and shot them into silence and submission john logan carrie and little stumps about this time had been brought with others from the mountains to the reservation logan insisted on keeping the two children at his side and under his protection he was laughed at by agents and subagents he was kept chained he was assigned to a strong hut with gratings across the window or rather the little loophole which let in the light the guards were kept constantly at his door he was entered on the books as a very desperate character a barnburner and possible murderer and so night and day he was kept under the constant watch of the soldiers with fixed bayonets true he was soon too weak to lift his manacled hands in strife but nevertheless he was kept chained and doubly guarded in the little hut with gratings at the loophole would he attempt to escape there were many broken fragments of many broken tribes here tribes that had fought each other to the death fought as germans and french have fought and why not pray has not a heathen as good a right to fight a heathen as has a christian to fight a christian the only difference is we preach and profess peace they war logan was alone in this damp hut and deadly pen he could hear the tramp of the soldiers he could see the long thin silver beams of the moon reach through the gratings reach on and on around and over and across the damp mouldy floor as if reaching out like gods white fingers to touch his face to cool his fever and comfort him but he could see hear nothing more he was so utterly alone they would send an unfriendly indian in with his breakfast foul and unfit for even a well man and a tin cup of water in the morning soon after the doctor would call around also then he would see no face again till evening when more food and water would be brought at last the food was brought only in the morning this did not at all affect logan for from the first the old pan containing his food had been taken away untouched the man was certainly dying the guard and garrison on the hill were waiting for this desperate character whose capture had cost so much time and money to attempt to escape from the first even in the face of the blunt refusal john logan had begged for the boy to be brought him he was certain the little fellow was dying dying of desolation and a broken heart about the sixth day the man chanced to hear from an indian that the boy had quite broken down and refusing all food lay moaning in his corner all the time and all the time crying for john logan or carrie the man now entreated more persistently than ever before he promised the doctor to eat to get well if only the boy could be brought to him and be permitted to spend his time there for he knew from what the doctor said that he must soon die if things kept on as they were the weather was growing hotter and hotter the water and the food if possible more repulsive than ever logan could no longer walk across the pen in which he was confined he was so weak that he could not raise his heavily manacled hands to his face after the usual diplomacy and delay the doctor reported his condition and also his earnest desire for the boy to the indian agent there was a consultation would this crafty and desperate indian attempt to escape was not all this a ruse on his part would not the united states imperil its peace and security if this boy and this man were to be allowed together this mighty question oppressed the mind of the agent in charge for a whole day then after the doctor again urged the prisoners request for man and boy both seemed to be dying this man reluctantly consented would logan now escape after all could he ever get through these iron bars and past the four soldiers pacing up and down outside would he escape from the reservation at last and now at the close of the hottest and most dreadful day they had endured an old indian woman bent almost double came shuffling in by permission of the guard and laid something on a pile of rushes and willows in a corner of the pen across from where john logan lay the man heard a noise as of some one breathing heavily and attempted to rise he could hardly move his head but in trying to support himself to a sitting posture he moved his hands and so rattled his manacles this frightened the superstitious old woman and she ran away she had laid a little skeleton on the rushes in the corner logan with great effort managed to sit up and look across into the corner that was now being slowly illuminated by a beam of bright white moonlight that stole down the wall toward the little heap lying there like some holy whitehooded and noiselessfooted nun at last he saw the face it was that of little stumps the man sank back where he lay the sight was so pitiful so dreadful to see that he forgot his own misery and was all in tears for the little fellow who lay dying before him he forgot his own fearful condition at the sight and again attempted to rise and reach the little heap that lay moaning in the corner it was impossible he could not rise and how fared carrie all this time little better than the others she was no longer beautiful and so she was left along with a score or more of other dying and desperate creatures in another part of the reservation she was not permitted to see the boy least of all was she permitted to see or even hear from john logan day by day she drooped and sank slowly but surely down toward the grave but she did not fear death she had faced it in all forms before and even now death walked the place night and day and she was not afraid she lay down at night with death she knew no fear at all she constantly asked for and wanted to see the helpless little boy in the hope that she might help or cheer him but no one listened to anything she had to say once after a very hot and horrible day two of her companions in captivity were found to be dead the guard who paced up and down between the huts was told of it but he said it was too late to have them carted away that night and so this girl lay there all night by the side of the dead and was not afraid nay she even wished that she too when the cart came in the morning might be found silent and at peace and then she thought of those whom she loved and reproached herself for being so selfish as to want to die when she still might be of use to them let us escape from these dreadful scenes as soon as possible they are like a nightmare to me and yet the mind turns back constantly to john logan lying there the little heap of bones in the corner the pure white moonlight creeping softly down the wall as if to look into the little fellows eyes yet as if half afraid of wakening him could logan escape chains double guards death all these at his door holding him back waiting to take him if he ever passed out at that door mould on the floor mould on the walls mould on the very blankets the man was burning to death with the fever the boy too lying over there the boy moaned now and then once logan heard him cry for water that warm slimy wormy water o for one just one draught of cool sweet water from the mountains their dearly loved native mountains and die the moon rose higher still round and white and large and at last wheeling over the camp of death seemed to pause in pity and look full in upon those two dying captives it seemed to soothe them both the little boy saw the moonbeam on the wall and was pacified it looked like the face of an old friend it brought back the old time the life the woods the water above all the cool sweet waters of the mountains he seemed to know where he was he lay still a long time and then felt stronger he called to john logan no answer then the feeble piping little voice lifted up and called as loud as it could no answer still the boy crawled from off the little pallet and tried to rise he sank down on the damp floor and then tried to crawl to john logan he tried to call again as he began to slowly crawl towards the other corner but the poor little voice was no louder than a whisper very weak and very wild and almost quite delirious the boy kept on as best he could he at last touched the blankets the breast and he drew himself up just as the moon looked down on the pale upturned face then with a moan a wild pitiful cry the little fellow fell back on the damp mouldy floor john logan was dead despite the chains the bars at the window the double guard at the door the man had escaped at last the pitying moon did not hasten to go it lingered there reached down along the damp mouldy floor to a little form of skin and bone and then as if this moonbeam were the saviors mantle spreading out to cover the white and stainless soul it covered the pinched and pitiful little face for the boy too lay dead here was the end of two lives that had known only the long dark shadows only the deep solitude and solemnity of the forest like tall weeds that sometimes shoot up in dark and unfrequented places and that put forth strange sweet flowers these two lives had sprung up there put forth after their fashion the best that is in man and then perished in darkness unnamed unknown who were they john logan it is now whispered was the son of an officer made famous in the war annals of the world the officer had been stationed here in early manhood gave his heart as she believed to a daughter of a brave and powerful chief whose lands lay near where he was stationed for a summer and then the old old tale of betrayal and desertion the woman was disgraced before her people and so when they retreated before the encroachments of the whites she being despised and cast off by her people remained behind waiting the promised return of her lover he he did not even acknowledge his child this general who had taken the lives of a thousand men had not the moral courage to reach out a hand to this one little waif which he had called into existence do you know there never was a dog drowned in the pound so base and low that he would not fight yet this brutevalor is largely admired even to this day by christian people this man could kill men could risk his own life but he could not give this innocent child his name and so it was the boy after he had learned to read by the help of fortynine and an occasional missionary who sometimes preached to the miners and spent the pleasant summer months in the mountains this boy i say who at last had heard all the story of his fathers weakness and wickedness from fortynines lips disdained to use his name but chose one famous in the annals of the indians and this brief sketch is about all there is to tell of the young man who lay dead in chains in the prisonpen of the reservation civilization kills the indian said the doctor that morning in his daily round after he had examined the dead bodies he does not look so desperate after all said an officer as he held his nose with his thumb and finger and leaned forward to look at the dead indian while his other hand held his sword gracefully at his side and then this officer after making certain that this desperate character was quite dead drew forth his cigarcase struck a light and climbing upon his horse galloped back to his quarters on the hill the doctor now left alone stooped and put back the long silken hair from the thin babyface of the boy as the body was brought out and being carried to the cart made to receive the dead and remarked that it was not at all like that of the other indians another young officer came by as the doctor did this and his attention was called to the fact the officer tapped his swordhilt a little looked curiously at the pitiful pinched little face and then ordering the soldiers to move on with their burden he turned to the doctor and remarked as the two went back together to their quarters on the hill that no doubt it was the effect of the few days of civilization on the reservation that had made the boy so white pity he had died so soon a year on the reservation and he would have been quite white unlike other parts of the union here the races are much mixed creoles kanakas mexicans malays whites and blacks have intermixed with the natives till the color line is not clearly drawn and in one case at least some orphan children of white parentage were sent to the reservation by parties who wanted their property though i do not know that the fact of white children being found on a reservation makes the sufferings of the savages less or their wrongs more outrageous i only mention it as a frozen fact carrie did not know of the desolation which death had made in her life till old fortynine who arrived too late to attend the burial of his dead told her she did not weep she did not even answer she only turned her face to the wall as she lay in her wretched bed burning up with the fever but made no sign there was nothing more for her to bear she had felt all that human nature can feel she was dull dazed indifferent now to all that might occur to turn back for the space of a paragraph i am bound to admit that these dying indians often behaved very foolishly and in their superstitions brought much of the fatality upon themselves for example they had a horror of the white mans remedies and refused to take the medicines administered to them brought down from the cool fresh mountains where they lived under the trees in the purest air and in the most beautiful places they at once fell ready victims to malarial fevers the white man by a liberal use of quinine and whisky as well as by careful diet lived very well at the reservation and suffered but little yet had he been forced to live in a pen crowded together like pigs in a sty with the bad air on the damp mouldy ground he had died too as fast perhaps as the indian died the old man could do but little for the dying girl he was in bad odor with the officers they treated him with as little consideration almost as if he too had been a savage but he was constant at her side he brought a lemon which he had begged on his knees as it were and tried to make her a cool drink of the slimy wormy water but the girl could not drink it she turned her face once more to the wall and this time it seemed to die one morning before the sun rose she recovered her wandering mind and called old fortynine to her side she was surely dying but her mind was clear and she understood perfectly all she said or did her dark eyes were sunken deep in their places and her long sunbrowned hands were only skin and bone they fell down across her heaving little breast as if they were the hands of a skeleton little wonder that her persecutors had turned away with horror perhaps with fear from those deep hollow eyes and the pitiful emaciated frame that could no longer lift itself where it lay the old man fell down on his knees beside her and reached his face across to hers with great effort she lifted her two naked long arms and wound them about the old mans neck he seemed to know that death was near as he reached his face over hers over his cheeks and down his long white beard the tears ran like rain and fell on her face and breast fortynine father let me call you father may i i never had any father but you said the girl feebly as the tears fell fast on her face yes yes call me father call me father carrie my carrie my poor dear dear little carrie do call me father for of all the world i have only you to love and live for sobbed the old man as if his heart would break well then father when i die take me back take me back to the mountains i want to hear the water the cool sweet clear water where i lie and the wind in the trees the cool pure wind in the trees father and you know the three trees just above the old cabin on the hill by the waterfall bury me bury me there yes there where i can hear the cool water all the time and the wind in the trees and and wont you please cut my name on the tree by the water my name carrie just carrie thats all i have no other name just carrie will you will you do this for me as there is a god as i live i will and the old man lifted his face as he bared his head and looked toward heaven the girls mind wandered now she spoke incoherently for a few moments and then was silent her form was convulsed her breast heaved just a little her helpless hands reached about the old mans neck as if they would hold him from passing from her presence they fell away and then all was still it was now gray dawn this mans heart was bursting with rage and a savage sorrow he was now stung with a sense of awful injustice his heart was swelling with indignation he took up the form before him up in his arms as if it had been that of an infant he threw his handkerchief across the face as he passed out stooping low through the dark and narrow doorway and strode in great long and hurried steps down the street and over toward the hills beyond where his horse was tethered in the long brown grass as the old man passed the post on the hill where the officers slept under the protection of loaded cannon the guard stopped him with his bayonet halt where are you going and what have you there come where are you going the old man threw back the handkerchief as the guard approached and the new sunlight fell on the girls face i am going to bury my dead the guard started back he almost dropped his gun as he saw that face then recovering himself he bared his head bowed his face reverently and motioned the old man on fortynine reached his horse in the brown grass laid his burden down threw on the saddle drew the girth with sudden strength and energy as if for a long and desperate ride then resuming his load tenderly as if it were a sleeping infant he vaulted into the saddle and dashed away for the sierras that lay before him and lifted like a city of snowy temples reared to the worship of the eternal it was a desperate ride for life the girls long soft black hair was in the wind the air was purer sweeter here there was a sense of liberty of life in this ride right in the face of the rising sun as it streamed down over the snowy summits of the sierras every plunge of the strong swift mustang brought them nearer to home to hope to life the horse seemed to know that now was his day of mighty enterprise perhaps he was glad to get away and up and out of that awful valley of death for he forged ahead as horse never plunged before with his strange double burthen that had frightened many a better trained mustang than he at last they began to climb the chapparal hills then they touched the hills of pine and the breath of balsam had a sense of health and healing in it that only the invalid who is dying for his mountain home can appreciate the horse was in a foam the day was hot the old man was fainting in the saddle water water at last down a steep mossy crag hung with brier and blossom came tumbling with loud laughter like merry girls at play a little mountain stream cool as the snow sweet as the blossom it fell foaming in its pebbly bed at the base of the crag under the deep cool shadows of the pines the old man threw himself from his horse and beast and man drank together as he held the girl in his arms where the spray dashed down like a holy baptismal from the very hand of god upon her hair and face the hands clutched the breast heaved a little the lips moved as if to drink in the cool sweet water her eyes feebly opened and then the old man bore her back under the pines and laid her on the soft bed of dry sweetsmelling pinequills then clasping his hands above her as he bent his face to hers he uttered his first prayer the first for many and many a weary year it was a prayer of thanksgiving of gratitude the girl would live and he would now have something to live for to love it had been a strange weird sight that old man his long hair in the wind his strong horse plunging madly ahead all white with foam climbing the sierras as the sun climbed up the girl lay in his arms before him her long dark hair all down over the horses neck tangled in the horses mane catching in the brush and the wild vines and leaves that hung over the trail as they flew past and oftentime back over his shoulder the old man threw his long white beard and looked back he felt he knew that he was pursued he fancied he could all the time hear the sound of horses feet perhaps if his eyes had been gifted with the vision of the prophets of old he would indeed have seen the pursuer that pursuer was also an old man and not much unlike himself an old man with a scythe death death following fast from the hot valley of pestilence where he death kept if possible closer watch than the agents that no indian ever returned to his native mountains but death gave up the pursuit and turned back from the moment the baptismal fountain touched the girls fevered forehead at last the old man who held her in his arms rose up rode on and down to his cabin in the twilight all secure from pursuit of agents death or any one the girl quite conscious opened her eyes and looked around on the tall nodding pine trees that stood in long dusky lines as if drawn up to welcome her return to the heart of the sierras transcribers note every
