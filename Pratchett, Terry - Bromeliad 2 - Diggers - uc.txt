in the beginning arnold bros created the store at least that was the belief of thousands of nomes who for many generations had lived under the floorboards of arnold bros an old and respected department store in the middle of the city the store had become their world a world with a roof and walls wind and rain were ancient legends so were day and night now there were sprinkler systems and air conditioners and the nomes small crowded lives ticked to the clock of opening time and closing time the seasons of their year were january sales spring into spring fashions sum mer bargains and christmas fayre led by the ab bot and priesthood of the stationer they wor shippedin a polite easygoing sort of way so as nome generations that is nomes live ten times faster than humans to them ten years is a long lifetime terry pratchett not to upset himarnold bros who they believed had created everything ie the store and all the contents therein some families of nomes had grown rich and powerful and took the namesmore or lessof the store departments they lived under the del icatessen the ironmongri the haberdasheri and into the store on the back of a truck came the last nomes to live outside they knew what wind and rain were all right thats why they tried to leave them behind among them was masklin rat hunter and granny morkie and grimma although they were women and didnt really count and of course the thing no one quite understood the thing masklins people had handed it down for centuries it was very important that was all they knew when it came near the electricity in the store it was able to talk it said it was a thinking machine from a ship which thousands of years before had brought the nomes from a far store or possibly star it also said it could hear electricity talk and one of the things the electricity was saying was that the store would be demolished in three weeks it was masklin who suggested that the nomes leave the store on a truck he found oddly enough that actually working out how you could drive a giant truck was the easiest part the hardest part was getting people to believe that they could do it diggers he wasnt the leader hed have liked to be a leader a leader could stick his chin out and do brave things what masklin had to do was argue and persuade and sometimes lie very slightly he found it was often easier to get people to do things if you let them think it was their idea ideas that was the tricky bit all right and there were lots of ideas that they needed they needed to learn to work together they needed to learn to read they needed to think that female nomes were well nearly as intelligent as males al though everyone knew that really this was ridicu lous and that if females were encouraged to think too much their brains would overheat anyway it all worked the truck did leave just before the store mysteriously burned down and hardly damaging anything very much it was driven out into the country the nomes found an abandoned quarry tucked into a hillside and moved into the ruined build ings and then they knew everything was going to be all right there was going to be theyd heard a bright new dawn whatever that was most nomes had never seen a dawn bright or otherwise and if they had they would have known that the trouble with bright new dawns is that theyre usually followed by cloudy days with scat tered showers six months passed terry pratchett this is the story of the winter this is the story of the great battle this is the story of the awakening of the cat the dragon in the hill with eyes like great eyes and a voice like a great voice and teeth like great teeth but the story didnt end there it didnt start there either the sky blew a gale the sky blew a fury the wind became a wall sweeping across the country a giant stamping on the land small trees bent big trees broke the last leaves of autumn whirred through the air like lost bullets the garbage dump by the gravel pits was de serted the seagulls that patrolled it had found shelter somewhere but it was still full of move ment the wind tore into the heaps as though it had something particular against old detergent boxes and leftover shoes tin cans rolled into the ruts and clanked miserably while lighter bits of rubbish flew up and joined the riot in the sky still the wind burrowed papers rustled for a while then got caught and blasted away finally one piece that had been flapping for hours tears free and flies up into the booming air it looks like a large white bird with oblong wings watch it tumble it gets caught on a fence but very briefly half of diggers it tears off and now that much lighter it pinwheels across the furrows of the field beyond it is just gathering speed when a hedge looms up and snaps it out of the air like a fly i and in that time were strange happenings the air moved harshly the warmth of the sky grew less on some mornings the tops of puddles grew hard and cold ii and the nomes said unto one another what is this thing from the book of nome quarries i v iii winter said masklin firmly its called winter abbott gurder frowned at him you never said it would be like this he said its so cold call this cold said granny morkie cold this aint cold you think this is cold you wait till it gets really cold she was enjoying this masklin noticed granny morkie always enjoyed doom itll be really cold then when it gets cold you get real frosts and water comes down out of the sky in frozen bits she leaned back triumphantly what dyou think of that then eh diggers you dont have to use baby talk to us sighed gurder we can read you know we know what snow is yes said dorcas there used to be cards with pictures on them back in the store every time christmas fayre came around we know about snow its glittery you get robins agreed gurder theres er actually theres a bit more to it than that masklin began dorcas waved him into silence i dont think we need to worry he said were well dug in the food stores are looking good and we know where to go to get more if we need it unless anyones got anything else to raise why dont we close the meet ing everything was going well or at least not very badly that sort of thing always worried masklin oh there was still plenty of squabbling and feuds between the various families but that was nomish nature for you thats why theyd set up the council which seemed to be working nomes liked arguing at least the council of drivers meant they could argue without hitting one another hardly ever funny thing though back in the store the great departmental families had run things but now all the families were mixed up and anyway there were no departments in a quarry but by instinct almost nomes liked hierarchies the world had al terry pratchett ways been neatly divided between those who told people what to do and those who did it so in a strange way a new set of leaders was emerging the drivers it depended on where you had been during the long drive if you were one of the ones who had been in the truck cab then you were a driver ev eryone else was just a passenger no one talked about it much it wasnt official or anything it was just that the bulk of nomekind felt that anyone who could get the truck all the way here was the sort of person who knew what they were doing being a driver wasnt necessarily much fun last year before theyd found the store masklin had to hunt all day now he only hunted when he felt like it the younger store nomes liked hunting and apparently it wasnt right for a driver to do it and they mined potatoes and thered been a big harvest of corn from a nearby field even after the machines had been around masklin would have preferred the nomes to grow their own food but they didnt seem to have the knack of making seeds grow in the rockhard ground of the quarry but they were getting fed that was the main thing around him he could feel thousands of nomes living their lives raising families settling down he wandered back to his own burrow down un der one of the derelict quarry sheds after a while he reached a decision and pulled the thing out of its own hole in the wall none of its lights was on they wouldnt do that diggers until the thing was close to electrical wires then it would light up and be able to talk there were some wires in the quarry and dorcas had got them working masklin hadnt taken the thing to them though the solid black box had a way of talking that always made him feel unsettled he was pretty certain it could hear though old torrit died last week he said after a while we were a bit sad but after all he was very old and he just died i mean nothing ate him first or ran him over or anything masklins little tribe had lived in a highway em bankment beside rolling countryside which was full of things that were hungry for fresh nome the idea that you could die simply of not being alive anymore was a new one to them so we buried him up on the edge of the potato field too deep for the plow the store nomes havent got the hang of burial yet i think they think hes going to sprout or something i think theyre mixing it up with what you do with seeds of course they dont know about growing things because of living in the store you see its all new to them theyre always complaining about eating food that comes out of the ground they think its not natural and they think the rain is a sprinkler system i think they think the whole world is just a bigger store urn he stared at the unresponsive cube for a while scraping his mind for other things to say anyway that means granny morkie is the old l terry pratchett est nome he said eventually and that means shes entitled to a place on the council even though shes a woman abbot gurder objected to that but we said all right you tell her and he wouldnt so she is um he looked at his fingernails the thing had a way of listening that was quite offputting everyones worried about the winter um but weve got masses of potatoes stored up and its quite warm down here the store nomes have some funny ideas though they said that when it was christmas fayre time in the store there was this thing that came called santer claws i just hope it hasnt followed us thats all um he scratched an ear all in all everythings going right um he leaned closer you know what that means if you think every things going right somethings going wrong that you havent heard about yet thats what i say um the black cube managed to look sympathetic everyone says i worry too much i dont think its possible to worry too much um he thought some more um i think thats about all the news for now he lifted the thing up and put it back in its hole hed wondered whether to tell it about his argu ment with grimma but that was well personal it was all that reading books that was what it was he shouldnt have let her learn to read filling diggers her head with stuff she didnt need to know gurder was right womens brains did overheat grimmas seemed to be boiling hot the whole time these days hed gone and said look now everything was settled down more it was time they got married like the store nomes did with the abbot muttering words and everything and shed said she wasnt sure so hed said it doesnt work like that you get told you get married thats how its done and shed said not anymore hed complained to granny morkie youd have expected some support there he thought she was a great one for tradition was granny hed said granny grimma isnt doing what i tell her and she d said good luck to her wish id thought of not doin what i was told when i was a gel then hed complained to gurder who said yes it was very wrong girls should do what they were instructed and masklin had said right then you tell her and gurder had said well er shes got a real temper on her perhaps it would be better to leave it a bit and these were after all changing times changing times well that was true enough masklin had done most of the changing hed had to make people think in different ways to leave the store changing was necessary change was right he was all in favor of change terry pratchett what he was dead against was things not staying the same his spear was leaning in the corner what a pa thetic thing it was now just a bit of flint held onto the shaft with a twist of binder twine theyd brought saws and things from the store they could use metal these days he stared at the spear for some time then he picked it up and went out for a long serious think about things and his position in them or as other people would have put it a good sulk the old quarry was about halfway up the hill side there was a steep turf slope above it which in turn became a riot of bramble and hawthorn thicket there were fields beyond below the quarry a dirt road wound down through scrubby hedges and joined the main high way beyond that there was the railroad another name for two long lines of metal on big wooden blocks things like very long trucks went along it sometimes all joined together the nomes had not got the railroad fully worked out yet but it was obviously dangerous because they could see a road that crossed it and whenever the railroad moving thing was coming two gates came down over the road the nomes knew what gates were for you saw them on fields to stop things from getting out it stood to reason therefore that the gates were to diggers stop the trains from escaping from their rails and rushing around the place then there were more fields some gravel pits good for fishing for the nomes who wanted fish and then there was the airport masklin had spent hours in the summer watch ing the planes they drove along the ground he noticed and then went up sharply like a bird and got smaller and smaller and disappeared that was the big worry masklin sat on his favor ite stone in the rain that was starting to fall and started to worry about it so many things were worrying him these days he had to stack them up but below all of them was this big one they should be going where the planes went that was what the thing had told him when it was still speaking to him the nomes had come from the sky up above the sky in fact which was a bit hard to understand because surely the only thing there was above the sky was more sky and they should go back it was their something beginning with d density their density worlds of their own they once had and somehow theyd got stuck here butthis was the worrying part the ship thing the airplane that flew through the really high sky between the stars was still up there somewhere the first nomes had left it be hind when they came down here in a smaller ship and the small ship had crashed and they hadnt been able to get back and he was the only one that knew terry pratchett the old abbotthe one before gurderhe had known grimma and dorcas and gurder all knew some of it but they had busy minds and they were practical people and there was so much to organize these days it was just that everyone was settling down were going to turn this into our little world just like in the store they thought the roof was the sky and we think the sky is the roof well just stay and there was a truck coming up the quarry road it was such an unusual sight that masklin realized he had been watching it for a while without really seeing it at all there was no one on watch why wasnt there anyone on watch i said there should always be someone on watch half a dozen nomes scurried through the dying bracken toward the quarry gate it was saccos turn muttered angalo no it wasnt hissed sacco you remember yesterday you asked me to swap because i dont care whose turn it was shouted mas klin there was no one there and there should have been right sorry masklin yeah sorry masklin they scrambled up a bank and flattened them selves behind a tuft of dried grass it was a small truck as far as trucks went a diggers human had already climbed out of it and was doing something to the gates leading into the quarry its a landrover said angalo smugly hed spent a long time in the store reading everything he could about vehicles before the long drive he liked them its not really a truck its more to carry humans over that human is sticking something on the gate said masklin on our gate said sacco disapprovingly bit odd said angalo the man sleepwalked in the slow ponderous way that humans did back to the vehicle eventually it backed around and roared off all the way up here just to stick a bit of paper on the gate said angalo as the nomes stood up thats humans for you masklin frowned humans were big and stupid that was true enough but there was something un stoppable about them and they seemed to be con trolled by bits of paper back in the store a piece of paper had said the store was going to be demol ished and sure enough it had been demolished you couldnt trust humans with bits of paper he pointed to the rusty wire netting an easy climb for an agile nome sacco he said youd better fetch it down miles away another piece of paper fluttered on the hedge spots of rain pattered across its sun terry pratchett bleached words soaking the paper until it was heavy and soggy and it tore it flopped onto the grass free a breeze made it rustle tw iii but there came a sign and people said what is it that this means iv and it was not good from the book of nome signs i v iiiiv gurder shuffled on hands and knees across the pa per from the gate of course i can read it he said i know what every word means well then said masklin gurder looked embarrassed its what every sentence means thats giving me trouble he said it says here where was it yes it says here the quarry is going to be reopened what does that mean its open already any fool knows that you can see for miles the other nomes crowded around you certainly could see for miles that was the terrible part on three sides the quarry had decently high cliff walls but on the fourth side well you got into the habit of not looking in that direction there was terry pratchett too much of nothing which made you feel even smaller and more vulnerable than you were al ready even if the meaning of the paper wasnt clear it certainly looked unpleasant the quarrys a hole in the ground said dor cas you cant open a hole unless its been filled in stands to reason a quarrys a place you get stone from said grimma humans do it they dig a hole and they use the stone for making well roads and things i expect you read that did you said gurder sourly he suspected grimma of lack of respect for authority it was also incredibly annoying that against all the obvious deficiencies of her sex she was better at reading than he was i did actually said grimma tossing her head but you see said masklin patiently there arent any more stones here grimma thats why theres a hole good point said gurder sternly then hell make the hole bigger snapped grimma look at those cliffs up therethey obediently lookedtheyre made of stone look hereev ery head swivelled down to where her foot was tap ping impatiently at the paperit says its for a highway extension hes going to make the quarry bigger our quarry thats what it says hes going to do there was a long silence then dorcas said who is diggers order hes put his name on it said grimma shes right you know said masklin look it says to be reopened by order the nomes shuffled their feet order it didnt sound a promising name anyone called order would probably be capable of anything gurder stood up and brushed the dust off his robe its only a piece of paper when alls said and done he said sullenly but the human came up here said masklin theyve never come up here before dunno about that said dorcas i mean all the quarry buildings the old workshops the doorways and so on i mean theyre for humans always worried me that has where humans have been before they tend to go again theyre rascals for that there was another crowded silence the kind that gets made by lots of people thinking unhappy thoughts do you mean said a nome slowly that weve come all this way weve worked so hard to make a place to live in and now its going to be taken away i dont think we should get too disturbed right at this gurder began weve got families here said another nome masklin realized that it was angalo hed been married in the spring to a young lady from the del terry pratchett icatessen family and theyd already got a fine pair of youngsters two months old and talking already and we were going to have another go at plant ing seeds said another nome weve spent ages clearing that ground behind the big sheds you know that gurder raised his hand imploringly we dont know anything he said we mustnt start getting upset until weve found out whats go ing on and then can we get upset said another nome sourly masklin recognised nisodemus one of the stationeri and gurders own assistant hed never liked the young nome and the young nome had never liked anyone as far as masklin could see ive never um been happy with the feel of this place um i knew there was going to be trouble now now nisodemus said gurder theres no cause to go talking like that well have another meeting of the council he added thats what well do the crumpled newspaper lay beside the road occasionally a breeze would blow it randomly along the verge while a few inches away the traffic thundered past a stronger gust hit at the same time as a particu larly large truck roared by dragging a tail of whirling air the paper shot up over the road spread out like a sail and rose on the wind diggers the quarry council was in session in the space under the floor of the old quarry office other nomes had crowded in and the rest of the tribe milled around outside look said angalo theres a big old barn up on the hill the other side of the potato field it wouldnt hurt to take some stores up there make it ready you know just in case then if anything does happen weve got somewhere to go the quarry buildings dont have spaces under the floors except in the canteen and the office said dorcas gloomily its not like the store there arent many places to hide we need the sheds if humans come here well have to leave so the barn will be a good idea wont it re peated angalo theres a human on a tractor who goes up there sometimes said masklin we could keep out of its way anyway said angalo looking around at the rows of faces maybe the humans will go away again praps theyll just take their stone and go and we can come back we could send someone to spy on them every day it seems to me youve been thinking about this barn for some time said dorcas me and masklin talked about it one day when we were hunting up there said angalo didnt we masklin hmm said masklin who was staring into space terry pratchett you remember we went up there and i said thatd be a useful place if ever we needed it and you said yes hmm said masklin yes but theres this winter thing coming said one of the nomes you know cold glitter on ev erythin robins another nome put in yeah said the first nome uncertainly them too not a good time to go movin around with robins zoomin about nothing wrong with robins said granny morkie who had nodded off for a moment my dad used to say theres good eatin on a robin if you catched one she beamed at them proudly this comment had the same effect on everyones train of thought as a brick wall built across the line eventually gurder said i still say we shouldnt get too excited right at this moment we should wait and trust in arnold bros s guid ance there was more silence then angalo said very quietly fat lot of good thatll do us there was silence again but this time it was a thick heavy silence and it got thicker and heavier and more menacing like a storm cloud building up over a mountain until the first flash of lightning would come as a relief it came what did you say said gurder slowly only what everyones been thinking said diggers angalo many of the nomes started to stare at their feet and what do you mean by that said gurder where is arnold bros then said angalo how did he help us get out of the store exactly i mean he didnt did he angalo shook a bit as if even he was terrified to hear himself talking like this we did it by learning things we did it all ourselves we learned to read books your books and we found things out and we did things for ourselves gurder jumped to his feet white with fury be side him nisodemus put his hand over his mouth and looked too shocked to speak arnold bros goes wherever nomes go he shouted angalo swayed backward but his father had been one of the toughest nomes in the store and he didnt give in easily you just made that up he snorted im not saying that there wasnt well something in the store but that was the store and this is here and all weve got is us the trouble is you stationer were so powerful in the store and just cant bear to give it up now masklin stood up just a moment you two he began so thats all it is is it growled gurder ignor ing him thats the haberdasheri for you you al ways were too proud too arrogant for your own good drive a truck a little way and we think we terry pratchett know it all do we perhaps were getting what we deserve eh this isnt the time or place for this sort of thing masklin went on thats just a silly threat why cant you accept it you old fool arnold bros doesnt exist use the brains arnold bros gave you why dont you if you dont both shut up ill bang your heads to gether that seemed to work right said masklin in a more normal voice now i think it would be a very good idea if ev eryone went and got on withwith whatever it is they were getting on with because this is no way to make complicated decisions we all need to think for a while the nomes filed out relieved that it was over masklin could hear them arguing outside not you two he warned now look said gurder no you look the pair of you said masklin here we are maybe a big problem looming up and you start arguing you both ought to know bet ter cant you see youre upsetting people well its important muttered angalo what we should do now said masklin sharply is have another look at this barn cant say im happy with the idea but it might be useful to have a bolthole anyway itll keep people occupied and thatll stop them from worrying how about it diggers i suppose so said gurder with bad grace but no more buts said masklin youre acting like idiots people look up to the pair of you so youll set an example do you hear they glowered at each other but they both nod ded right then said masklin now well all go out and peoplell see youve made up and thatll stop their fretting then we can start planning but arnold bros is important said gurder i daresay said masklin as they came out into the daylight of the quarry the wind was dropping again leaving the sky a deep cold blue theres no daresay about it said gurder listen said masklin i dont know whether arnold bros exists or was in the store or just lives in our heads or whatever what i do know is that he isnt just going to drop out of the sky all three of them glanced up when he said this the store nomes shuddered just a bit it still took a certain courage to look up at the endless sky when youve been used to nice friendly floorboards but it was traditional when you referred to arnold bros to look up up was where management and accounts had been back in the store funny you should say that theres something up there said angalo something white and vaguely rectangular was terry pratchett drifting gently through the air and growing big ger its just a bit of paper said gurder some thing the winds blown off the dump it definitely got a lot bigger and turned gently in the air as it tumbled into the quarry i think said masklin slowly as its shadow raced toward him across the ground that wed better stand back a bit it dropped on him it was of course only paper but nomes are small and it had fallen quite some way so the force was enough to knock him over what was more surprising were the words he saw as he fell backward they were arnold bros i and they sought for a better sign from arnold bros and there was a sign ii and some spake up saying well all right but it is really nothing but a coincidence iii but others said even a coincidence can be a sign from the book of nome signs ii v iiii masklin had always kept an open mind on the sub ject of arnold bros after all the store had been pretty impressive what with the escala tors and so on and if arnold bros hadnt created it who had after all that only left humans not that he considered humans were as stupid as most nomes thought they might be big and slow but there was a sort of mindless unstop pability about them they could certainly be taught to do simple tasks on the other hand the world was miles across and full of complicated things it seemed to be ask terry pratchett ing a lot of arnold bros to create the whole thing so masklin had decided not to decide anything about arnold bros in the hope that if there was an arnold bros and he found out about masklin he wouldnt mind much the trouble with having an open mind of course is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it the faded newspaper from the sky had been carefully spread out on the floor of one of the old sheds it was covered in words most of them even mas klin could understand but even grimma had to admit she couldnt guess at what they were sup posed to mean when you read them all in one go school slams shock probe for example was a mys tery so was fury over taxes rebel so wbs play super bingo in your soaraway blackbury evening post gazette but they were mysteries that would have to wait what all eyes were staring at was the quite small area of words about nomesized under the word people that means people said grimma really said masklin and the lettering underneath it says funlov ing globetrotting millionaire playboy richard ar nold will be jetting to the florida sunshine next week to witness the launch of arnsat the first communishe hesitatedcations sat ellite diggers built by the arnco inter national group this leap into the future comes only a few months after the dest ruction by fire of the nomes whod been silently reading along with her shivered arnold bros the store here in blackbury which was the first of the arnold chain and the basis of the multimillionpound trad ing group it was founded in by alderman frank w arnold and his brother arthur grand son richard who will her voice faded to a whisper grandson richard repeated gurder his face bright with triumph what dyou think of that eh what does globetrotting mean said masklin well globe means ball and trotting is a sort of slow running said grimma so he runs slowly on a ball globetrotting this is a message from arnold bros said gurder ponderously its been sent to us a mes sage a message meant um for us said nisodemus who was standing just behind gurder he held up his hands yea all the way from yes yes nisodemus said gurder do be quiet theres a good chap he gave masklin an embarrassed look doesnt sound very likely running slowly i mean youd fall off if it was a ball is what im ying said masklin terry pratchett they stared at the picture again it was made up of tiny dots they showed a smiling face it had teeth and a beard it stands to reason said gurder more confi dently arnold bros has sent grandson richard to to and these two names who founded the store said masklin i dont understand that i thought arnold bros created the store then these two founded it said gurder that makes sense it was a big store itd be easy to find even if you werent looking for it he looked slightly uneasy losted and founded he said half to himself that makes sense yes kay said dorcas so lets just see where weve got to the message is is it is that grandson richard is in florida wherever that is going to be in florida said grimma its a type of colored juice volunteered a nome i know cause one day when we went over to the garbage dump there was this old carton and it said florida orange juice i read it he added proudly going to be in this orangecolored juice so im given to understand said dorcas doubtfully running slowly on a ball and jetting whatever that is and liking it apparently the nomes fell silent while they thought about this holy utterances are often difficult to under stand said gurder gravely diggers this must be a powerful holy one said dorcas think its just a coincidence said angalo loft ily this is just a story about a human being like in some of the books we read and how many humans could even stand on a ball let alone run slowly on it demanded gurder all right said angalo but what are we going to do then gurders mouth opened and shut a few times why its obvious he said uncertainly tell us then said angalo sourly well er its er obvious we must go to er the place where the orange juice is yes said angalo and er and find grandson richard which should be easy you see because weve got this pic ture gurder scratched his chin i mean how many humans can there be in the world he said not more than a few hundred and when weve found him yes said angalo gurder have him a haughty look remember the commandment that arnold bros put up in the store he said did it not say if you do not see what you require please ask the nomes nodded many of them had seen it and the other commandments everything must go and by the escalators dogs and strollers must be carried they were the words of arnold firos you couldnt really argue with terry pratchett them but on the other hand well that had been the store and this was here and said angalo gurder began to sweat well er and then we ask him to let us be left alone in the quarry there was an awkward silence then angalo said that sounds about the most halfbaked what does jetting mean said grimma is it anything to do with jet a jet is a kind of aircraft said angalo the transport expert so jetting means to go like an aircraft or in an aircraft said grimma everyone turned to masklin whose fascination with the airport was well known to one and all he wasnt there masklin pulled the thing from its niche in the wall and padded back out into the open the thing didnt have to be attached to any wires it was enough to put it near them there was electricity in the old managers office he ran across the empty alley between the tumble down buildings and squeezed his way in through a crack in the sagging door then he placed the box in the middle of the floor and waited it always took some while for the thing to wake up its lights flickered at random and it made odd beeping noises masklin supposed it was the ma diggers chines equivalent of a nome getting up in the morning eventually it said who is there its me said masklin masklin look i need to know what the words communications satellite mean ive heard you use the word satellite before you said the moon is one didnt you yes but communications satellites are artificial moons they are used for communications communica tions means the transferring of information in this case by radio and television whats television said masklin a means of sending pictures through the air does this happen a lot all the time masklin made a mental note to look out for any pictures in the air i see he lied so these satelliteswhere are they exactly in the sky i dont think ive ever seen one said masklin doubtfully there was an idea forming in his mind he wasnt quite sure yet bits and pieces of things hed read and heard were coming together the im portant thing was to let them take their own time and not frighten them away they are in orbit many miles up there are a great many above this planet said the thing how do you know that can detect them oh terry pratchett masklin stared at the flickering lights if they are artificial does that mean theyre not real he said they are machines they are usually built on the planet and then launched into space the idea was nearly there it was rising like a bubble space is where our ship is you said that is correct masklin felt the idea explode quietly like a dandelion if we knew where one of these things was going to be flown into space he said speaking quickly before the words had time to escape and we could sort of hang on to the sides or whatever or maybe drive it like the truck and we took you with us then we could jump off when we got up there and go and find this ship of ours couldnt we the lights on top of the thing moved oddly into patterns masklin had never seen before this went on for quite a while before it spoke again when it did it sounded almost sad do you know how big space is it said no said masklin politely its pretty big is it yes however it may be possible for me to detect and summon the ship if i were taken above the atmosphere but do you know what the words oxygen supply mean no space suit no diggers it is very cold in space well couldnt we sort of jump around a bit to keep warm said masklin desperately think you do not appreciate what it is that space contains whats that then nothing it contains nothing and everything but there is very little everything and more nothing than you could imagine its still worth a try though isnt it what you are proposing is an extremely unwise en deavor said the thing yes but you see said masklin firmly if i dont try then its always going to be like this were always going to escape and find somewhere new and just when were getting the hang of it all well have to go again sooner or later we must find somewhere that we can know really belongs to us dorcas is right humans get everywhere anyway you were the one who told me that our home was up there somewhere this is not the right time you are illprepared masklin clenched his fists ill never be well pre pared i was born in a hole thing a muddy hole in the ground how can i ever be well prepared for anything thats what being alive is thing its being badly prepared for everything because you only get one chance thing you only get one chance and then you die and they dont let you go around again after youve got the hang of it do you understand thing so well try it now i order terry pratchett you to help youre a machine and you must do what youre told the lights formed a spiral you re learning fast said the thing iii and in a voice like thunder the great masklin said unto the thing now is the time to go back to our home in the sky iv or we will forever be running from place to place v but none must know what i intend or they will say ridiculous why go to the sky when we have problems right here vi because that is how people are from the book of nome quarries ii v iiivi gurder and angalo were having a blazing row when masklin got back he didnt try to interrupt he just put the thing down on the floor and sat down next to it and watched them funny how people needed to argue the whole secret was not to listen to what the other person was saying masklin had noticed gurder and angalo had really got the hang of that the trouble was that neither of them was en terry pratchett tirely certain he was right and the funny thing was a that people who werent entirely certain they were right always argued much louder than other peo ple as if the main person they were trying to con vince was themselves gurder was not certain not entirely certain that arnold bros reallyj existed and angalo wasnt entirely certain that he didnt j eventually angalo noticed masklin you tell him masklin he said he wants to go and find grandson richard do you where do you think we should look masklin asked gurder the airport said gurder you know that jet ting in a jet thats what hell do but we know the airport said angalo ive been right up to the fence several times humans go in and out of it all day grandson richard looks just like them he could have gone already he could be in the juice by now you cant believe words that just drop out of the sky he turned to masklin again masklins a steady lad he said hell tell you you tell him masklin he said you listen to him gurder he thinks about things masklin does at a time like this lets go to the airport said masklin there said angalo i told you masklin isnt the kind of nomewhat lets go to the airport and watch angalos mouth opened and shut silently but but he managed diggers it must be worth a try said masklin but its all just a coincidence said angalo masklin shrugged then well come back im not suggesting we all go just a few of us but supposing something happens while were gone itll happen anyway then theres thousands of us getting people to the old barn wont be diffi cult if we need to do it its not like the long drive angalo hesitated then go he said just to prove to you how how superstitious youre being good said masklin provided gurder comes of course angalo added what said gurder well you are the abbot said angalo sarcasti cally if were going to talk to grandson richard then itd better be you i mean he probably wont want to listen to anyone else aha shouted gurder you think i wont come itd be worth it just to see your face thats settled then said masklin calmly and now i think wed better see about keeping a special watch on the road and some teams had better go to the old barn and it would be a good idea to see what people can carry just in case you know terry pratchett grimma was waiting for him outside she didnt look happy i know you she said i know the kind of ex pression you have when youre getting people to do things they dont want to do what are you plan ning they strolled into the shadow of a rusting sheet of corrugated iron masklin occasionally squinted upward this morning hed thought the sky was just a blue thing with clouds now it was some thing that was full of words and invisible pictures and machines whizzing around why was it that the more you found out the less you really knew eventually he said i cant tell you im not quite sure myself its to do with the thing isnt it yes look if im away for er a little bit longer than she stuck her hands on her hips im not stupid you know she said orangecolored juice in deed ive read nearly every book we brought out of the store florida is a a place just like the quarry probably even bigger and its a long way away you have to go across a lot of water to get there i think it might even be further away than we came on the long drive said masklin quietly i know because one day when we went to look at the airport i saw water on the other side by the road it looked as though it went on forever diggers i told you said grimma smugly it was prob ably an ocean there was a sign by it said masklin cant remember everything on it im not as good at the reading as you one of the words was reser voir i think there you are then but it must be worth a try masklin scowled theres only one place where we can ever be safe and thats where we belong he said otherwise well always have to keep running away well i dont like it said grimma but you said you didnt like running away said masklin there isnt an alternative is there let me just try something if it doesnt work then well come back but supposing something goes wrong suppos ing you dont come back ill grimma hesi tated yes said masklin hopefully ill have a terrible job explaining things to peo ple she said firmly its a silly idea i dont want to have anything to do with it oh masklin looked disappointed but defiant well im going to try anyway sorry v and he said what are these frogs of which you speak vi and she said you wouldnt understand vii and he said you are right from the book of nome strange frogs i v vvii there was a busy night it would be a journey of several hours to the barn parties went on to mark the path and gener ally prepare the way besides watching out for foxes not that they were often seen these days a fox might be quite happy to attack a solitary nome but thirty wellarmed enthusiastic hunters were a different proposition and it would be a very stupid fox indeed that even showed an interest the few that did live near the quarry tended to wander off hurriedly in the opposite direction whenever they saw a nome theyd learned that nomes meant trouble it had been a hard lesson for some of them not long after the nomes moved into the quarry a fox diggers was surprised and delighted to come across a cou ple of unwary berry gatherers which it ate it was even more surprised that night when two hundred grimfaced nomes tracked it to its den lit a fire in the entrance and speared it to death when it ran out eyes streaming there were a lot of animals that would like to dine off nome masklin had said theyd better learn its us or them and theyd better learn right now that its going to be them no animal is going to get a taste for nome not anymore of course it might all be nothing to worry about said angalo nervously around dawn we might never have to move just when we were beginning to get settled down too said dorcas still i reckon that if we keep a proper lookout we can have everyone on the move in five minutes and well start moving some food stores up there this morning no harm in that then theyll be there if we need them nomes sometimes went as far as the airport there was a garbage dump on the way which was a prime source of bits of cloth and wire and the flooded gravel pits further on were handy if anyone had the patience to fish it was a pleasant enough days journey largely along badger tracks there was a main road to be crossed or rather to be bur rowed under for some reason pipes had been care fully put underneath it just where the track needed to cross it presumably the badgers had done it they certainly used it a lot terry pratchett masklin found grimma in her schoolhole under one of the old sheds supervising a class in writing she glared at him told the children to get on with itand would nicco haberdasheri like to share the joke with the rest of the class no then he could jolly well get on with thingsand came out into the passage ive just called to say were off said masklin twiddling his hat in his hands theres a load of nomes going over to the dump so well have com pany the rest of the way er electricity said grimma vaguely what theres no electricity at the old barn said grimma you remember what that meant on moonless nights there was nothing to do but stay in the burrow i dont want to go back to that well maybe we were better nomes for it mumbled masklin we didnt have all the things weve got today but we were cold frightened ignorant and hungry snapped grimma you know that you try telling granny morkie about the good old days and see what she says we had each other said masklin grimma examined her hands we were just the same age and living in the same hole she said vaguely she looked up but its all different now there well there are the frogs for one thing diggers masklin looked blank and for once grimma looked unsure i read about them in a book she said theres this place you see called south america and there are these hills where its hot and rains all the time and in the rain forests there are these very tall trees and right in the top branches of the trees there are these like great big flowers called brome liads and water gets into the flowers and makes lit tle pools and theres a type of frog that lays eggs in the pools and tadpoles hatch and grow into new frogs and these little frogs live their whole lives in the flowers right at the top of the trees and dont even know about the ground and the world is full of things like that and now i know about them and im never ever going to be able to see them and then you she gulped for breath want me to come and live with you in a hole and wash your socks masklin ran this sentence through his head again in case it made any sense when he listened to it a second time but i dont wear socks he pointed out this was apparently not the right thing to say grimma prodded him in the stomach masklin she said youre a good nome and bright enough in your way but there arent any answers up in the sky you need to have your feet on the ground not your head in the air she swept away and shut the door behind her masklin felt his ears growing hot terry pratchett i can do both masklin shouted after her at the same time he thought about it and added so can every one he stamped off along the tunnel bright enough in his way gurder was right universal education was not a good idea hed never understand women he thought even if he lived to be ten gurder had turned over the leadership of the stationer to nisodemus masklin felt less than happy about this it wasnt that nisodemus was stupid quite the reverse he was clever in a bub bling sideways way that masklin distrusted he al ways seemed to be bottling up excitement about something and when he spoke the words always rushed out with nisodemus putting urns in the flow of words so that he could catch his breath without anyone having the chance to interrupt him he made masklin uneasy he mentioned this to gurder nisodemus might be a bit overenthusiastic said gurder but his hearts in the right place what about his head listen said gurder we know each other well enough dont we we understand one another wouldnt you say yes why then ill let you make the decisions that affect all nomes bodies said gurder his voice just one step away from being threatening and youll let diggers me make the decisions that affect all nomes souls fair enough and so they set off the goodbyes the lastminute messages the or ganization and because they were nomes the hun dred little arguments are not important they set off life at the quarry began to get back to something like normal no more trucks came up to the gate dorcas sent a couple of his more agile young assis tant engineers up the wire netting just in case to stuff the rusty padlock full of mud he also ordered a team of nomes to twist wire around and around the gates as well not that itd hold them very long he said not if they were determined the council or what was left of it now nodded wisely although frankly none of them understood or cared much about mechanical things the truck came back the same afternoon the two nomes watching the truck hurried back into the quarry to report the driver had fiddled with the padlock for a while pulled at the wire and then driven off and it said something said sacco yes it said something sacco heard it said his partner nooty kiddiesklothes she was a plump young nome who wore trousers and was good at gineering and had actually volunteered to be a terry pratchett diggers guard instead of staying at home learning how to cook things were really changing in the quarry i heard it say something said sacco helpfully in case the point hadnt sunk in thats right said nooty we both heard it didnt we sacco and what was it said dorcas encouragingly i dont really deserve this sort of thing he thought not at my time of life id rather be in my work shop trying to get this radio business sorted out it said sacco took a deep breath his eyes bulged and he attempted the foghorn mooing that was human sound bbbllllooooooooddddyyy kkiiiddddddssss dorcas looked at the others anyone got any ideas he said it almost s seems to mean something doesnt it i tell you if only we could understand them this must have been one of the stupid ones said nooty it was trying to get in j then itll come back said dorcas gloomily he shook his head i all right you two he said well done get back on watch thank you he watched them go off hand in hand and then he wandered away across the quarry heading for j the old managers office ive seen christmas fayre come around six times he thought thats six whatdyoucallems years and almost one more i think although its hard to j be sure out here no one puts up any signs to say whats happening the heating just gets turned down seven years old just about the time when a nome ought to be taking it easy and im out here where there arent any proper walls to the world and the water goes cold and hard as glass some mornings and the ventilation and heating systems are quite shockingly out of control of coursehe pulled himself together a bitas a scientist i find all these phenomena extremely interesting it would just be nicer to find them extremely interest ing from somewhere nice and snug inside ah inside that was the place to be most of the older nomes suffered from the fear of the outside but no one liked to talk about it much it wasnt too bad in the quarry with its great walls of rock if you didnt look up too much or look toward the fourth side with its terribly huge views across the countryside you could almost believe you were back in the store even so most of the older nomes preferred to stay in the sheds or in the cozy gloom under the floorboards that way you avoided this horrible exposed feeling the dreadful sensation that the sky was watching you the children seemed to quite like the outside though they werent really used to anything else they could just about remember the store but it didnt mean much to them they belonged out side they were used to it and the young men o went out hunting and gathering well young men liked to show how brave they were terry pratchett didnt they especially in front of other young men and young women i of course dorcas thought as a scientist and ra tionalthinking nome i know we werent really in tended to live under floorboards the whole time i its just that as a nome who is probably seven years old and feeling a bit creaky ive got to admit id find it sort of comforting to have a few of the good old signs around the place amazing reductions perhaps or just a little sign saying mammoth sales start tomorrow it wouldnt hurt and im sure id feel happier which is of course totally ri diculous when you look at it rationally itd just be like arnold bros he thought sadly im pretty sure he doesnt exist in the way i was taught he does when i was young but when you saw things like if you do not see what you require please ask on the walls you felt that everything was somehow all right he thought these are very wrong thoughts for a rational thinking nome there was a crack in the woodwork by the door of the managers office dorcas slipped into the fa miliar gloom under the floor and padded along un til he found the switch he was rather proud of this idea there was a big red bell on the outside wall of the office pre sumably so that humans could hear the telephone ring when the quarry was noisy dorcas had changed the wiring so that he could make it ringj whenever he liked diggers he pressed the switch nomes came running from all corners of the quarry dorcas waited as the underfloor space filled up and then dragged up an empty matchbox to stand on the human has been back he announced it didnt get in but itll keep trying what about your wire said one of the nomes im afraid there are such things as wire cut ters so much for your theory about um humans being intelligent a intelligent human would know enough not to go um where it wasnt wanted said nisodemus sourly dorcas liked to see eagerness in a young nome but nisodemus vibrated with a peculiarly hungry kind of eagerness that was unpleasant to see he gave him as sharp a look as he dared humans out here might be different from the ones in the store he snapped anyway order must have sent it said nisodemus its a judgment um on us none of that its just a human said dorcas nisodemus glared at him as he went on now we really should be sending some of the women and children to the there was the sound of running feet outside and the gate guards piled in through the crack its back its back panted sacco the hu mans back terry pratchett diggers all right all right said dorcas dont worry about it it cant no no no yelled sacco jumping up and down its got a pair of cutter things its cut the wire and the chain that holds the gates shut and it they didnt hear the rest of it they didnt need to the sound of an engine coming closer said it all it grew so loud that the shed shook and then it stopped suddenly leaving a nasty kind of silence that was worse than the noise there was the crump of a metal door slamming then the rattle and squeak of the shed door then footsteps the boards overhead buckled and dropped little clouds of dust as the great thumping steps wandered around the office the nomes stood in absolute silence they moved nothing except their eyes but they moved in perfect time to the footsteps marking the position flicking backward and forward as the human crossed the room above a baby started to whim per there was some clicking and then the muffled sound of a human voice making its usual incompre hensible noises this went on for some time then the footsteps left the office again the nomes could hear them crunching around outside and then more noises nasty clinking metal noises a small nome said mom i want to go mom shh i really mean it mom will you be quiet all the nomes stood stockstill as the noises went on around them well nearly all one small nome hopped from one foot to the other going very red in the face eventually the noise stopped there was the thunk of a truck door closing the growl of its en gine and the motor noise died away dorcas said very quietly i think perhaps we can relax now hundreds of nomes breathed a sigh of relief mow yes all right off you go and after the sigh of relief the outbreak of bab ble one voice rose above the rest it was never like this in the store said nisodemus climbing onto half a brick i ask you fellow nomes is this what we were led um to ex pect there was a mumbled chorus of nos and yes ses as nisodemus went on a year ago we were safe in the store do you remember what it was like at christmas fayre do you remember what it was like in the food hall anyone remember um roast beef and turkey there were one or two embarrassed cheers nisodemus looked triumphant and here we are at the same time of yearwell they tell us its the me time of year he said sarcastically and what re expected to eat are knobbly things actually mi terry pratchett grown in dirt um and the meat isnt proper meat at all its just dead animals cut up actual dead animals actually cut up is this what you want your um children to get used to digging up their food and now they tell us we might even have to go to some barn that hasnt got proper floorboards for us to live under as arnold bros in tended where next we ask ourselves out in a field somewhere um and do you know what is the worst thing about all of this ill tell you he pointed a finger at dorcas the people who seem to be giving us all the orders now are the very peo ple who um got us into this trouble in the first place now just you hold on dorcas began you all know im right shouted nisodemus think about it nomes why in the name of ar nold bros did we have to leave the store there were a few more vague cheers and several arguments broke out among the audience dont be stupid said dorcas the store was going to be demolished we dont know that shouted nisodemus of course we do roared dorcas masklin and gurder saw and where are they now eh theyve gone to well theyve gone to dorcas began he wasnt much good at this he knew why did it have to be him he pre diggers ferred messing around with wires and bolts and things bolts didnt keep shouting at you yes theyve gone nisodemus lowered his voice to a sort of angry hiss think about it you nomes use your um brains in the store we knew where we were things worked everything was ex actly as arnold bros decreed and sud denly were out here remember how you used to despise outsiders well the outsiders are us um and now its all panic again and it always will be until we mend our ways and arnold bros est graciously allows us back into the store as better wiser nomes lets just get this clear said a nome are you saying that the abbot lied to us im not saying anything like that said nisodemus sniffing im just presenting you with the facts um thats all im doing but but but the abbot has gone to get help said a lady nome uncertainly and and after all im sure the store was demol ished i mean we wouldnt have gone to all this trouble otherwise would we er she looked des perate i know this though said the nome beside her say what you like but i dont fancy this old barn everyones talking about theres not even any electric there yes and its in the middle ofanother nome egan and then lowered his voiceyou know things you know what im talking about terry pratchett yeah said an elderly nome things ive seen em my lad took me blackberryin a month or two back up above the quarry and i seen em i dont mind seeing them a long way off said the worried lady nome its the thought of being in the middle of them that makes me come over all shaky they dont even like to say the words open fields thought dorcas i know how they feel its snug enough here ill grant you said the first nome but all this stuff you get outside what dyou call it begins with an n nature said dorcas weakly nisodemus was smiling madly his eyes sparkling thats right said the nome well its not nat ural and theres a sight too much of it s not like a proper world at all youve only got to look at it the floors all rough n it should be flat theres hardly any walls all them little starry lights that come out at night well theyre not much help are they and now these humans go where they please theres no proper regulations like there was in the store thats why arnold bros established the store in said nisodemus a proper place for urn nomes to live dorcas gently grabbed saccos ear and pulled the young nome toward him do you know where grimma is he whis pered isnt she here diggers im quite sure she isnt said dorcas shed have had something very sharp to say by now if she was she may have stayed in the schoolhole with the children when the bell went off its just as well nisodemus has something on his mind he thought im not certain what it is but it smells bad and it got worse as the day wore on especially since it began to rain a nasty freezing sort of rain sleet according to granny morkie it was soggy not really water but not quite ice rain with bones somehow it seemed to find its way into places where ordinary rain hadnt managed to get dorcas organized younger nomes to dig drainage trenches and rigged up a few of the big lightbulbs for heat the older nomes sat hunched around them sneez ing and grumbling granny morkie did her best to cheer them up dorcas began to really wish the old woman wouldnt do that this aint nothing she said i remember the great flood made our hole cave right in we was cold and drenched for days she cackled and rocked backward and forward liked drownded rats we was not a dry stitch on you know and no fire for a week talk about laugh the store nomes stared at her and shivered and you dont want to go worrying about grossing them open fields she went on conversa terry pratchett tionally nine times out o ten you dont get et by anything oh dear said a lady nome faintly yes ive been out in fields hundreds o times its a doddle if you stay close to the hedge and keep your eyes open you hardly ever have to run very much said granny no ones temper was improved when they learned that the landrover had parked right on the patch of ground they were going to plant things in the nomes had spent ages during the summer hacking the hard ground into something resembling soil theyd even planted seeds which hadnt grown now there were two great ruts in it and a new padlock and chain on the gate the sleet was already filling the ruts oil had leaked in and formed a rainbow sheen on the sur face and all the time nisodemus was reminding peo ple how much better it had been in the store they didnt really need much persuading after all it had been better much better i mean thought dorcas we can keep warm and theres plenty of food although there is a limit to the number of ways you can cook rabbit and pota toes the trouble is masklin thought that once we got outside the store wed all be digging and build ing and hunting and facing the future with strong chins and bright smiles some of the youngsters are doing well enough ill grant you but us old uns are too set in our ways its all right for me i lin diggers tinkering with things i can be useful but the rest of them well all theyve really got to occupy themselves is grumbling and theyve become really good at that i wonder what nisodemuss game is hes too keen if you ask me i wish masklin would come back even young gurder wasnt too bad its been three days now at a time like this he knew hed feel better if he went and looked at the cat i for in the hill was a beast from the days when the world was made ii but it was old and broken and dying iii and the mark of its name was on it iv and the mark was the mark of the cat from the book of nome cat i v iiv the cat the cat was his his little secret his big secret really no one else knew about the cat not even dorcass assistants hed been pottering around in the big old half ruined sheds on the other side of the quarry one day back in the summer he hadnt really got any aim in mind except perhaps the possibility of find ing a useful bit of wire or something so hed rummaged around in the shadows straightened up glanced above him and there the cat was with its mouth open diggers it had been a terrible few seconds until dorcass eyes adjusted to the distance after that hed spent a lot of time with the cat poking around finding out about him or it the cat was too big to be a him or a her it had to be an it a terrible it perhaps and old and wounded like a dragon that had come here for one last final sleep or perhaps it was like one of those big animals grimma had showed him in a book once diner soars dorcas had never seen a cat before but hed heard from masklin that they were dangerous and dorcas wasnt about to argue but this cat was kind of peaceful to have around it didnt grumble and it didnt keep on asking dor cas why he hadnt got around to inventing radio yet dorcas had spent many a peaceful hour getting to know the cat it was someone to talk to it was the best kind of person to talk to in fact because you didnt have to listen back at it dorcas shook his head there was no time for that sort of thing now everything was going wrong instead he went to find grimma she seemed to have her head screwed on right even if she was a girl the schoolhole was under the floor of the old shed with canteen on the door it was grimmas personal world shed invented schools for chil dren on the idea that since reading and writing terry pratchett were quite difficult it was best to get them over with early i the library was also kept there in those last hectic hours the nomes had man aged to rescue about thirty books from the store some were very usefulgardening all the year round was well thumbed and dorcas knew essen tial theory for the amateur engineer almost by heart but some were well difficult and not opened much grimma was standing in front of one of these when he wandered in she was biting her thumb which she always did when she was concentrating he had to admire the way she read not only was grimma the best reader among the nomes she also had an amazing ability to understand what she was reading nisodemus is causing trouble he said sitting down on a bench i know said grimma vaguely ive heard she grabbed the edge of the page in both hands and turned it over with a grunt of effort i dont know what hes got to gain said dor cas power said grimma weve got a power vac uum you see i dont think we have said dorcas uncertainly ive never seen one here there were plenty in the store ninetynine ninetyfive with range of at tachments for aroundthehouse cleanliness he added remembering with a sigh the familiar signs diggers no its not a thing like that said grimma its what you get when no ones in charge ive been reading about them im in charge arent i said dorcas plaintively no said grimma because no one really lis tens to you oh thank you very much its not your fault people like masklin and an galo and gurder can make people listen to them but you dont seem to keep their attention oh but you can make nuts and bolts listen to you not everyone can do that dorcas thought about this he would never have put it like that himself was it a compliment he decided it probably was when people are faced with lots of troubles and they dont know what to do theres always some one ready to say anything just to get some power said grimma never mind when the others get back im sure theyll sort it all out said dorcas more cheerfully than he felt yes theyll grimma began and then stopped after a while dorcas realized that her shoulders were shaking is there anything the matter he said its been more than three whole days sobbed grimma no ones ever been away that long be fore something must have happened to them er said dorcas well they were going to look terry pratchett for grandson richard and we cant be sure that and i was so nasty to him before he went i told him about the frogs and all he could think of was socks dorcas couldnt quite see how frogs had got in volved when he sat and talked to the cat frogs were never dragged into the conversation er he said grimma in between sobs told him about the frogs and im sure he didnt even begin to under stand what i meant she mumbled and you wont either oh i dont know said dorcas you mean that the world was once so simple and suddenly its full of amazingly interesting things that youll never ever get to the end of as long as you live like biol ogy or climatology i mean before all you outsid ers came i was just tinkering with things and i really didnt know anything about the world he stared at his feet im still very ignorant he said but at least im ignorant about really impor tant things like what the sun is and why it rains thats what youre talking about she sniffed and smiled a bit but not too much because if there is one thing worse than someone who doesnt understand you its someone who un derstands perfectly before youve had a chance to have a good pout about not being understood the thing is she said that he still thinks im diggers the person he used to know when we all lived in the old hole in the bank you know running around cooking things bandaging up people when theyd been hurhurhur now then now then said dorcas he was al ways at a loss when people acted like this when machines went funny you just oiled them or prod ded them or if nothing else worked hit them with a hammer nomes didnt respond well to this treat ment supposing he never comes back she said dab bing at her eyes of course hell come back said dorcas reassur ingly what could have happened to him after all he could have been eaten or run over or trod den on or blown away or fallen down a hole or trapped said grimma er yes said dorcas apart from that i meant but i shall pull myself together said grimma sticking out her chin when he does come back he wont be able to say oh i see everythings gone to pieces while ive been away jolly good said dorcas thats the spirit keep yourself occupied thats what i always say whats the book called its a treasury of proverbs and quotations said grimma oh anything useful in it that said grimma distantly depends terry pratchett oh whats proverbs mean not sure some of them dont make much sense do you know humans think the world was made by a sort of big human no are you sure it took a week i expect it had some help then said dorcas you know with the heavy stuff dorcas thought of the cat you could do a lot in a week with the cat helping no all by itself apparently hmm dorcas considered this certainly bits of the world were rough and things like grass seemed simple enough but from what hed heard it all broke down every year and had to be started up again in the spring and i dont know he said only humans could believe something like that i think youd need more than one week theres a good few months work if im any judge grimma turned the page masklin used to be lievei mean masklin believesthat humans are much brighter than we think she looked thought ful i really wish we could study them properly she said im sure we could learn a for the second time the alarm bell rang out across the quarry this time the hand on the switch belonged to nisodemus ii and nisodemus said you are betrayed people of the store iii falsely you were led into this outside of rain and cold and humans and order and yet it will become worse iv for there will be sleet and snow and hunger in the land v and there will come robins vi urn vii yet those that brought you here where are they now viii they said we go to seek grandson richard but tribulation abounds on every side and no help comes you are betrayed into the hands of winter ix it is time to put aside things of the outside from the book of nome complaints v iiix yes well thats hard to do isnt it said a nome uneasily i mean we are outside but i have a plan said nisodemus tekby pratchett ah said the nomes in unison plans were the thing plans were what was needed you knew where you were with a plan grimma and dorcas almost the last to arrive sidled their way into the crowd the old engineer was going to push his way to the front but grimma restrained him look at the others up there she whispered there were quite a few nomes behind nisodemus many of them dorcas recognized as stationeri but there were a few others from some of the great departmental families they werent looking at nisodemus as he spoke but at the crowd their eyes flickered back and forth as though they were searching for something i dont like the look of this said grimma qui etly the big families never used to get on too well with the stationeri so why are they up there now grubby pieces of work some of them said dorcas some of the stationeri had been particularly up set about common everyday nomes learning to read they said it gave people ideas dorcas gath ered which were not a good thing unless they were j the right kind of ideas and some of the great fami lies hadnt been too happy about nomes being able j to go where they pleased without having to ask permission i theyre all up there he thoughtthe nomes j diggers who havent done so well since the drive they all lost a little power nisodemus was explaining his plan as he listened dorcass mouth slowly dropped open it was magnificent in its way that plan it was like a machine where every single part was per fectly made but had been put together by a one handed nome in the dark it was crammed full of good ideas which you couldnt sensibly argue with but they had been turned upside down the trou ble was they were still ones you couldnt sensibly argue with because the basically good idea was still in there somewhere nisodemus wanted to rebuild the store the nomes stood in horrified admiration as the stationeri explained that yes abbot gurder bad been right when they left the store they had taken arnold bros with them inside their heads and if they could show him that they really cared about the store he would come out again and put a stop to all these problems and reestablish the store here in this green unpleasant land that was how it all arrived in dorcass head anyway hed long ago decided that if you spent all your time listening to what people actually said youd never have time to work out what they meant but it wouldnt mean building the whole store id nisodemus his eyes shining like two bright black marbles they could change the quarry in terry pratchett other ways go back to living in proper depart ments instead of any old how all over the place put up some signs get back to the good old ways make arnold bros feel at home build the store inside their heads nomes didnt often go mad dorcas vaguely re called an elderly nome who had once decided that he was a teapot but hed changed his mind after a few days nisodemus though had definitely been getting too much fresh air it was obvious that one or two other nomes thought so too i dont quite see said one of them how ar nold bros is going to stop these humans no offense meant did humans interfere with us when we were in the store demanded nisodemus well no because then trust in arnold bros but that didnt keep the store from being de molished did it said a voice when it came to it you all trusted masklin and gurder and the truck and yourselves nisodemus is always telling you how clever you are try and be clever then dorcas realised it was grimma hed never seen anyone so angry she pushed her way through the apprehensive nomes until she was face to face or at least since he was standing on something and she wasnt face to diggers chest nisodemus was one of those people who liked standing on things what will actually happen then she shouted when youve built the store what will happen humans came into the store you know nisodemuss mouth opened and shut for a while then he said but they obeyed the regulations yes um thats what they did and things were better then she glared at him you dont really think people are going to ac cept that do you she said there was silence youve got to admit said an elderly nome very slowly things were better then the nomes shuffled their feet that was all you could hear just people shuffling their feet they just accepted it said grimma just like that no ones bothered about the council anymore they just do what he tells them even granny morkies no help she just sits around with all the old people talking i told her she should help me and all she said was that shes too old to worry about young fools like nisodemus she says in ten years time wholl care now she was in dorcass workspace under a bench in the old quarry garage my little sanctu y he always called it my little nook bits of wire terry pratchett and tin were scattered everywhere the wall was covered with scrawls done with a bit of pencil lead dorcas sat and twirled a bit of wire aimlessly youre being hard on people he said quietly you shouldnt yell at them like that theyve been through a lot they get all confused if you shout at them the council was all right for when times were good he shrugged and without mas klin and gurder and angalo well it hardly seems worthwhile but after all thats happened she waved her arms to act so stupidly just because hes offered them a bit of comfort said dorcas he shook his head you couldnt explain things like this to peo ple like grimma nice girl bright head on her but she kept thinking that everyone else was as passion ate about things as she was all people really wanted dorcas considered was to be left alone the world was quite difficult enough as it was without people going around trying to make it bet ter all the time masklin had understood that he knew the way to make people do what you wanted was to make them think it was their idea if there was one thing that got right up a nomes nose it was people say ing to them here is a really sensible ideawhat are you too stupid to understand it wasnt that people were stupid it was just that people were people diggers come on he said wearily lets go and see how the signs are getting on the whole of the floor of one of the big sheds had been turned over to the making of the signs or rather the signs another thing nisodemus was good at was giving words capital letters you could hear him doing it dorcas had to admit that the signs were a pretty good idea though he felt guilty about thinking this hed thought that when nisodemus had sum moned him and asked if there was any paint in the quarry only now the quarry was being called the new store urn dorcas had said there are some old paint cans white and red mainly under one of the benches we might be able to lever the tops off then do it it is very important um we must make signs said the stationer signs right said dorcas cheer the place up a bit you mean no sorry sorry i just thought signs for the gate dorcas scratched his chin the gate he said humans obey signs said nisodemus calming down we know that did they not obey the signs in the store most of em agreed dorcas dogs and stroll ers must be carried had always puzzled him lots of humans didnt carry either terry pratchett signs make humans do things said nisodemus or stop doing things so get to work good dorcas signs um signs that say no dorcas had given this a lot of thought as teams of nomes sweated to pry open the lids of the paint streaked cans they still had the high way code from the truck and there were plenty of signs in there and he could remember some of the signs from the store then there was a stroke of luck normally the nomes stayed at floor level but dorcas had taken to sending his young assistants onto the big desk in the quarry managers office occasionally where there were useful scraps of paper now he needed to work out what the signs should say sacco and nooty came back with the news theyd found more signs old ones a great big grubby notice pinned to the wall covered with signs masses of them sacco said coming back out of breath and you know what sir you know what i read what it said on the notice and it said health and safety at work it said obey these signs it said and it said they are there for your protec tion thats what it said said dorcas for your protection sacco repeated can you get it down theres a coathook next to it said nooty en thusiastically i bet we could sling a hook up and then pull it over toward the window and then diggers yes yes youre good at that sort of thing said dorcas nooty could climb like a squirrel i ex pect nisodemus will be very pleased he added nisodemus was especially with the piece that said for your protection it showed he said that urn arnold bros was on their side every bit of board and rusty sheet of metal had to be pressed into service the nomes went at it cheerfully enough though happy to be doing something next morning the sun rose to see a va riety of signs hanging not always squarely on the battered quarry gate they had been very thorough the signs said no etnry exit this way dagnerhard hat area blastign in progres all trucks report to wieghin station slipery when wet this regestir closed elevotar out fo order beware of flaling rocks road floooded and one that dorcas had found in a book and was rather proud of unexploded bom just to be on the safe side though and without telling nisodemus he found some more chain and in one of the greasy old toolboxes in the cats shed a padlock nearly as big as he was it took four nomes to carry it the chain was massive some of the nomes found dorcas painstakingly levering it along across the quarry floor one link at a time he didnt seem to want to tell them where hed found it terry pratchett the truck turned up around noon the nomes waiting in the hedge by the side of the truck saw the driver get out look at the signs and no that wasnt right humans couldnt do that sort of thing it couldnt be true but twenty nomes peering out from the undergrowth saw it happen the human disobeyed the signs not only that it pulled some of them off the gate and threw them away they watched in astonishment even unex ploded bom was whirled into the bushes nearly knocking young sacco from his perch the new chain though caused the human a few problems it rattled the chain once or twice peered in through the wire mesh of the gate stamped around for a bit and then drove off the nomes in the bushes cheered but not too happily if humans werent going to do what was ex pected of them nothing was right in the world i reckon thats it said dorcas when they got back i dont like the idea any more than anyone else but weve got to move i know humans that chain wont stop them if they really want to get in i absolutely forbid anyone to leave said nisodemus but you see metal can be cut through dor cas began in a reasonable tone of voice diggers silence shouted nisodemus its your fault you old fool um you put the chain on the gate well you see it was to stop thepardon said dorcas if you hadn t put the chain on the gate the signs would have stopped the human said nisodemus but you cant expect arnold bros to help us if we show we dont trust him um said dorcas what he was thinking was mad a mad nome a dangerously mad nome were not talking about teapots here he backed out of nisodemuss presence and was glad to get out into the bitingly cold air everythings going wrong he thought i was left in charge and now its all going wrong we havent got any proper plans masklin hasnt come back and its all going wrong if humans come into the quarry theyll find us something cold landed on his head he brushed at it irritably ill have a word with some of the younger nomes he thought maybe going to the barn wasnt such a bad idea we could keep our eyes shut on the way or something something else cold and soft settled on his neck oh why are people so complicated he looked up and realized that he couldnt see ae other side of the quarry the air was full of white specks and more appeared as he watched he watched it in horror it was snowing vii and grimma said we have two choices viii we can run or we can hide ix and they said which shall we do x she said we shall fight from the book of nome quarries iii v viix it wasnt much of a snowfall just one of those m nippy little sprinklings that come early in the win ter to make it absolutely clear that it is well the winter thats what granny morkie said shed never been very interested in the council anyway she liked to spend her time with the otherj old people exchanging grumbles and as she put it cheerin them up and takin them out o them selves she strutted around in the snow as if it belonged to her the oldstore nomes watched her in horrified sii lence course this is nothing to some of em she said i mind weve had snow so deep we couldnt diggers walk around in it we had to dig tunnels talk about laugh er madam said a very old nome gravely does it always drop out of the sky like this course sometimes it gets blown along by the wind you get great big piles we thought ityou see on the cardsthat is in the storewell we thought it just sort of appeared on things said the old nome in a rather jolly and festive way he added looking embarrassed they watched it pile up over the quarry the clouds hung like overstuffed mattresses at least it means we wont have to go to that horrid barn place said a nome thats right said granny morkie you could catch your death going out in this she looked cheerful the old nomes grumbled among themselves and scanned the sky anxiously for the first signs of rob ins or reindeer the snow closed the quarry in you couldnt see out across the fields dorcas sat in his workshop and stared at the snow piling up against the dirty window giving the shed a dull gray light well he said quietly we wanted to be shut away and now we are we cant run away and we gan t hide we ought to have gone when masklin left he heard footsteps behind him it was grimma terry pratchett she spent a long time near the gate these days but the snow had driven her indoors at last he wouldnt be able to come she said not in the snow yeah right said dorcas uncertainly its been eight days now yes quite a long time what were you saying when i came in she said i was just talking to myself does this snow stuff stay for a long time granny says it does sometimes weeks and weeks she says oh when the humans come back theyll be here for good said grimma yes said dorcas sadly yes i think youre right how many of us would be able to you know go on living here a couple of dozen perhaps if they dont eat much and lie low during the day theres no food hall you see he sighed and there wont be much hunting not with humans around the quarry the whole time all the game up in the thickets will run away but theres thousands of us dorcas shrugged its hard enough for me to walk through this snow he said theres hundreds of older nomes wholl never do it and young ones come to that diggers so weve got to stay just as nisodemus wants said grimma yes stay and hope perhaps the snow will be we could make a run for the thickets or something he said vaguely we could stay and fight said grimma dorcas growled oh thats easy we fight all the time bicker bicker bicker thats nomish nature for you i mean fight the humans fight for the quarry there was a long pause then dorcas said what us fight humans yes but theyre bumansv yes but theyre so much bigger than we are said dorcas desperately then theyll make better targets said grimma her eyes alight and were faster than them and smarter than them and we know they exist and we have she added the element of sur prise the what said dorcas totally lost the element of surprise they dont know were here she explained he gave her a sidelong glance youve been reading strange books again he said well its better than sitting around wringing ur hands and saying oh dear oh dear the hu lans are coming and we shall all be squashed terry pratchett thats all very well said dorcas but what are you suggesting bashing them over the head would be really tricky take it from me not their heads said grimma dorcas stared at her fight humans it was such a novel idea it was hard to get your mind around it but well there was that book wasnt there the one masklin had found in the store the one that had given him the idea for driving the truck what was it gullivers travels and thered been this picture of a human lying down with what looked like nomes tying it up with hundreds of ropes not even the oldest nomes could remember it ever happening it must have been a long time ago a snag struck him hang on a minute he said if we start fight ing humans his voice trailed off yes said grimma impatiently theyll start fighting us wont they i know theyre not very bright but itll dawn on them that somethings happening and theyll fight back re taliation thats called thats right said grimma and thats why its vitally important we retaliate right at the start dorcas thought about this it seemed a logical idea but only in selfdefense he said only in sel j defense even with humans i dont want there to be any unnecessary suffering i suppose so she said diggers you really think we could fight humans oh yes so how grimma bit her lip hmm she said young sacco and his friends can you trust them theyre keen lads and lasses one or two of them he smiled always ready for something new right then we shall need some nails youve really been thinking hard havent you said dorcas he was almost in awe grimma was often bad tempered he thought perhaps it was be cause her mind worked very fast sometimes and she was impatient with people who werent keep ing up but now she was furious you could begin to feel sorry for any humans who got in her way ive been doing a lot of reading she said er yes yes i can see said dorcas but er i wonder if it wouldnt be more sensible to were not going to run away again she said flatly we shall fight them on the tracks we shall fight them at the gates we shall fight them in the quarry and we shall never surrender what does surrender mean said dorcas des perately we dont know the meaning of surrender said grimma well dont said dorcas grimma leaned against the wall do you want to hear something strange she terry pratchett dorcas thought about it i dont mind he said theres books about us like gulliver you mean no that was about a human about us i mean ordinarysize people like us but wearing all green suits and with little knobbly stalks on their heads sometimes humans put out bowls of milk for us and we do all the housework for them and we have wings like bees thats what gets put in books about us they call us pixies its in a book called fairy tales for little folk i dont think the wings would work said dor cas doubtfully i dont think you could get the lift ing power and they think we live in mushrooms grimma finished hmm doesnt sound very practical to me said dorcas and they think we repair shoes thats a bit more like it said dorcas good solid work and the book said we paint the flowers to make them pretty colors said grimma i dorcas thought about this nah he said eventually ive looked at the colors on flowers theyre definitely builtin were real said grimma we do real things so why do you think that sort of thing goes in books search me said dorcas i only read manuals diggers its not a proper book ive always said unless its got lists and line drawings in it if ever humans do catch us thats what well become said grimma sweet little people paint ing flowers they wont let us be anything else theyll turn us into little people she sighed do you ever get the feeling youll never know any thing you ought to know oh yes all the time grimma frowned know one thing she said when masklin comes back hes going to have somewhere to come back to oh said dorcas oh he repeated oh i see it was bitterly cold in the cats lair other nomes never came in because it was drafty and stank that suited dorcas fine he padded across the floor and went under the huge tarpaulin where the cat lived it took quite a long time to climb up to his preferred perch on the monster even using the bits of wood and string hed painstakingly tied to him it he sat down and waited until he got his breath back i only want to help people he said quietly like giving them things like electricity and mak g their lives better but they never say thank you yu know they wanted me to paint signs so i painted signs now grimma wants to fight hu terry pratchett mans shes got lots of ideas out of books i know shes doing it to help forget about masklin but no good will come of it you mark my words but if i dont help things will only get worse i dont want anybody to get hurt people like us cant be repaired as easily as people like you he drummed his heels on the catswhat would it bethe cats neck probably its all right for you he said sleeping quietly here all the time having a nice rest he stared at the cat for a long while then very quietly he said i wonder five long minutes went past dorcas appeared and reappeared among the complicated shadows muttering to himself saying things like thats dead thats no good we need a new battery and seems okay nothing that a good clean couldnt put right and hmm not much in your tank finally he walked out from under the dusty tarp and rubbed his hands together everyone has a purpose in life he thought its what keeps them going nisodemus wants things to be as they were grimma wants masklin back and masklin no one knows exactly what it is that masklin wants except that its very big but they all have this purpose if you have a pur pose in life you can feel six inches tall and now ive found one wow diggers the human came back later and it did not come alone there was the landrover and a much larger truck with the words blackbury stone and gravel inc painted on the side its tires turned the thin coating of snow into glistening mud it iolted up the dirt road slowed down as it came out into the open area in front of the quarry gates and stopped it wasnt a very good stop the back of the vehi cle swung around and nearly hit the hedge the engine coughed into silence there was the sound of hissing and very slowly the truck sank two humans got out they walked around the truck looking at each tire in turn theyre only flat at the bottom whispered grimma in their hiding place in the bushes dont worry about it hissed dorcas the thing about tires is the flat bit always sinks to the bottom amazing what you can do with a few nails isnt it the smaller truck stopped behind the first one two humans got out of that too and joined the others one of them was holding the longest pair of pliers dorcas had ever seen while the rest of the humans bent down by one of the flat tires it strolled up to the gate fiddled the teeth of the pli s onto the padlock and squeezed it was an effort even for a human but there was a snap loud enough to be heard even in the bushes terry pratchett and then a long drawnout clinking noise as the chain fell away dorcas groaned hed had great hopes for that chain it was the cats at least it was in a big yel low box bolted to part of the cat so presumably it had belonged to the cat but it had been the pad lock that had broken not the chain dorcas felt oddly proud about that i dont understand it grimma muttered they can see theyre not wanted so why are they so stupid its not as if there arent masses of stone around agreed sacco the human pulled at the gate and swung it enough to allow itself inside its going to the managers office said sacco its going to make noises in the telephone no its not dorcas prophesied but it will be ringing up order said sacco itll be saying in human i mean itll be saying some of our wheels have gone flat no said dorcas itll be saying why doesnt the telephone work why doesnt the telephone work said nooty because i know which wires to cut said dor cas look its coming back out they watched it walk around the sheds the snow had covered the nomes sad attempts at culti vation there were plenty of nome tracks though like little bird trails in the snow the human didnt diggers notice them humans hardly ever noticed any thing trip wires said grimma what said dorcas trip wires we should put trip wires down the bigger they are said grimma the harder they fall not on us i hope said dorcas no we could put more nails down said grimma good grief the humans clustered around the stricken truck then they appeared to reach a decision and walked back to the landrover they got in it couldnt go forward but reversed slowly down the dirt road turned around in a field gateway and headed back to the main road the big truck was left alone dorcas breathed out i was afraid one of them would stay he said theyll come back said grimma youve al ways said it humansll come back and mend the wheels or whatever it is they do then wed better get on with it said dorcas come on everybody he stood up and trotted toward the road to sac cos surprise dorcas was whistling under his breath now the important thing is to make sure they gant move it he said as they ran to keep up if aey cant move it it means it stays blocking the terry pratchett dirt road and if it stays blocking the dirt road they cant get any more machines in good thinking said grimma in a slightly puz zled voice we must immobilize it said dorcas well take out the battery first no electricity no go right said sacco its a big square thing said sacco itll need eight of you at least dont drop it whatever you do why not said grimma we want to smash it dont we er er er said dorcas urgently like a motor trying to get started no because because it could be dangerous yes dangerous yes because be cause because of the acid and whatnot you must take it out very carefully and ill find somewhere safe to put it yes very safe off you go now two men to a wrench they trotted off what else can we do said grimma wed better drain the gas out said dorcas firmly as they walked under the shadow of the truck it was much smaller than the one that had brought them out of the store but still quite big enough he wandered around until he was under the enormous swelling bulk of the gas tank four of the young nomes had dragged an empty can out of the bushes dorcas called them over and pointed to the tank above them there must be a nut on there somewhere he diggers said itll be to let the stuff out get a wrench around it make sure the cans underneath it first they nodded enthusiastically and got to work nomes are good climbers and remarkably strong for their size and try not to spill any please dorcas shouted up after them i dont see why that matters said grimma be hind him all we want to do is get it out of the truck where it goes doesnt matter does it she gave him another thoughtful look dorcas blinked back at her his mind racing ah he said ah ah because becausebe causebecause ah because its dangerous stuff we dont want it polluting things do we best to put it carefully in a can and keep it safe said grimma suspiciously right right said dorcas who was starting to sweat good idea now lets just go over here he led grimma away there was sudden rush of air and a thump from right behind them the trucks battery landed where they had been standing sorry dorcas sacco called down it was a lot heavier than we thought it got away from us you idiots grimma shouted yes you idiots shouted dorcas you might have damaged it just you come down here right now and get it into the hedge quickly he might have damaged us said grimma yes yes yes thats what i meant of course terry pratchett said dorcas vaguely you wouldnt mind organiz ing them a bit would you theyre good boys but always a little too enthusiastic if you know what i mean he wandered off into the shadow his head tilted backward well said grimma she looked around at sacco and his friends who were sheepishly climb ing down again dont just stand there she said get it into the hedge hasnt dorcas told you about using levers very important things its amazing what you can do with levers we used them a lot on the long drive her voice trailed off she turned and looked at the distant figure of dorcas and her eyes narrowed the cunning old devil is up to something shej thought oh just get on with it she said and ran after dorcas he was standing under the trucks engine star ing up intently into the masses of rusting pipework as she came up she distinctly heard him say now what else do we need what do you mean need said grimma qui etly oh to help the ca dorcas stopped and turned around slowly i mean what else do we need to do to make the thing totally immobile he said stonily that was what i meant diggers youre not planning to drive this truck are you said grimma dont be silly whered we go itd never get across the fields to the barn well all right then i just want to have a look around it time spent collecting knowledge is never wasted said dorcas primly he stepped out into the light on the other side of the truck and looked up well well he said what is it they left the door open i suppose they thought it was all right because theyd be coming back grimma followed his gaze the trucks door was slightly ajar dorcas looked around at the hedge behind them help me find a big enough stick he said i reckon we could climb up there and have a look around a look around what do you expect to find you never know till youve looked said dorcas philosophically he peered back underneath the truck how are you all doing under there we need a hand here sacco staggered up we managed to get the bat tery thing behind the hedge he said and the cans nearly full smells horrible theres still lots coming out can you get the screw back in nooty tried and she got all covered in yuk terry pratchett let it go on the road then said dorcas hang on you said that would be dangerous said grimma its dangerous until youve filled the can up is it and then not dangerous at all look you wanted me to stop the truck and ive stopped the truck said dorcas so just shut up will you grimma looked at him in horror what did you say she said dorcas swallowed oh well if you were going to get shouted at you might as well get your mon eys worth i said just shut up he said quietly i dont want to be rude but you do go on at people im sorry but thats how it is im helping you im not asking you to help me but at least you can let me get on with things instead of badgering me the whole time and you never say please or thank you either people are a little like machines he added solemnly while her face went redder and words like please and thank you are just like grease they make them work better is that all right he turned to the boys who were looking embarrassed find a stick long enough to reach up to the cab he said please they fell over themselves to obey hi the younger nomes spoke saying would that we were the nomes our fathers were to ride upon the truck and what was it like iv and dorcas said it was scary v that was what it was like from the book of nome strange frogs ii v iiiv it was pretty much like the cab of the truck that had brought them from the store it brought back old memories wow said sacco and we all drove one of these seven hundred of us said dorcas proudly your dad was one of them you were in the back with your mothers all you lads were im not a lad said nooty sorry said dorcas slip of the tongue in my day girls stayed at home most of the time not that ive got anything at all against them getting out bnd about a bit now he added hurriedly not terry pratchett wanting another grimma on his hands im not against that at all i wish id been older on the drive said nooty it must have been amazing it terrified the life out of me said dorcas the others wandered around the cab like tourists in a cathedral gawking nooty tried to press a pedal amazing she said under her breath sacco you get up there and take those keys out said dorcas the rest of you no lollygag ging those humans could be back anytime nooty stop making those brrrmbrrrm noises im sure nice girls shouldnt make those kind of noises he added lamely sacco swarmed up the steering wheel post and wrestled the keys out of the ignition while the rest of the boys poked around in the cab grimma wasnt with them she hadnt wanted to come up into the cab shed gone very quiet in fact shed stayed down in the dirt road with a sul len look on her face but it had needed saying dorcas told himself he looked around the cab lets see he thought weve got the battery weve got the fuel was there anything else the cat needs come on everyone he called lets be getting out of here nooty stop trying to move things all the time itd take all of you to shift the gear lever come on before the humans come back diggers he made his way to the door and heard a click behind him i said come on what do you think you re doing the young nomes stared at him wideeyed were seeing if we can move the gear lever dor cas said nooty if you press this knob you n can dont press the knob dont press the knob the first inkling grimma had that something was going wrong was a nasty little crunching sound and a change in the light the truck was moving not very fast because the two front tires were flat but the dirt road was steep it was moving all right and just because it had started off slowly didnt mean there wasnt something huge and unstoppable about it she stared at it in horror the dirt road ran between high banks all the way down to the big highwayand the railroad said dont press it did i say press it i said dont press it the terrified nomes stared it him their open mouths a row of os its not the gear lever its the hand brake you idiots now they could all hear the crunching noise and feel the slight vibration er said sacco his voice shaking whats a nd brake dorcas terry pratchett it keeps it stopped on hills and things dont just stand there help me push it back up the cab was very gently beginning to sway from side to side the truck was definitely moving the hand brake wasnt dorcas heaved on it until blue and purple spots flashed in front of his eyes i just gave the knob on the end a push nooty babbled i only wanted to see what it did yes yes all right dorcas stared around what he needed was a lever what he needed was about fifty nomes what he needed most of all was not to be here he staggered across the bouncing floor to the doorway and cautiously peered out the hedge was moving past quite gently as if it wasnt in a partic ular hurry to get anywhere but the surface of the road already had a blurred look we could probably jump he thought and if were lucky we wont break anything if were even luckier well avoid the wheels how lucky do i feel right at this minute not very sacco joined him perhaps if we took a good running jump he began there was a thump as the truck hit the bank heeled over and then bounced back onto the road the nomes struggled to their feet on the other hand perhaps not a good idea said sacco what shall we do now dorcas just hang on said dorcas i think the banks diggers will keep it on the road and i suppose itll just roll to a halt eventually he sat down suddenly as the truck bounced off the bank again you wanted to know what a truck ride was like well now you know there was another thump the branch of a tree caught the door swung it open and then with a terrible metallic noise ripped it off was it like this shouted nooty above the noise to dorcass amazement now that the imme diate danger was over she seemed to be quite en joying it were bringing up new nomes he thought theyre not so scared of things as we were they know about a bigger world he coughed well apart from its being in the dark and we could see where we were going yes he said i think we all ought to hang on to something just in case it gets bumpy the truck rolled down the dirt road and onto the highway a car skidded into the hedge to avoid it another truck managed to stop at the end of four long streaks of scorched rubber none of the nomes in the cab noticed this at the time all they felt was another thump as the truck bounced gently over the far side of the highway snd down the dirt road that ran toward the rail road where with red lights flashing the barriers ere coming down terry pratchett sacco peered out of the stricken doorway weve just crossed over a paved road he said ah said dorcas i just saw a car run into the back of another car and a truck ended up going sideways sacco went on ah lucky we got over then said dorcas theres some dangerous drivers around the gritty sound of the flat tires rolling over gravel gradually slowed down there was the snap of something breaking behind the truck a couple of bumps and then another thump that brought them to a halt and a low booming noise nomes hear things differently from humans and the shrill clanging of the crossing warning alarms sounded to them like the doleful tolling of an an cient bell weve stopped said dorcas he thought we could have pressed the brake pedal we could have looked for something to press it with and pressed it i must be getting too old oh well come on no hanging around we can jump out you young sters can anyway why what are you going to do said sacco im going to wait until youve all jumped out and then im going to tell you to catch me said dorcas pleasantly im not as young as i was now off you go they got down awkwardly hanging on to the diggers edge of the running board and dropping onto the road dorcas lowered himself gingerly onto the run ning board and sat with his legs dangling over the drop it looked a long way down below him nooty prodded sacco respectfully on the arm er sacco she said nervously what is it look at that metal rail thing over there well what about it theres another one over there said nooty pointing yes i can see said sacco testily what about them theyre not doing anything were right in between them said nooty i just thought i should you know point it out and theres that bell thing ringing yes i can hear it said sacco irritably i wish it would stop i just wondered why it was sacco shrugged who knows why anything hap pens he said come on dorcas please we havent got all day im just composing myself said dorcas qui etly nooty wandered miserably away from the group and looked down at one of the rails it was bright d shiny and it seemed to be singing terry pratchett she bent closer yes it was definitely making a faint humming sound which was odd bits of metal didnt normally make any noise at all not by themselves anyway as she stared at the truck stuck between the flashing lights and the shiny rails the world seem to change slightly and a horrible idea formed in her head sacco she quavered sacco were right on the railroad line sacco something a long way off made a deep mournful noise whoooooo from the gateway of the quarry grimma had a good view of the land all the way to the airport she saw the train and the truck the train had seen the truck too it suddenly started to make the long drawnout screaming noise of metal in distress by the time it actually hit the thing it seemed to be going quite slowly it even managed to stay on the rails pieces of truck spun away in every direction like fireworks i nisodemus said unto them do you doubt that i can stop the power of order ii and they said um from the book of nome chases i v iii other nomes came running across the quarry floor with nisodemus in the lead and piled up in a crowd around the gate what happened what happened i saw everything said a middleaged nome i was on watch and i saw dorcas and some of the boys go into the truck and then it rolled away down the hill and then it went over the highway and then it stopped right on the railroad tracks and then and then i forbade all meddling with these infernal ma chines said nisodemus and i said we were to op um putting people on watch didnt i the watch arnold bros maintains should be enough for humble nomes yes well dorcas said he thought it terry pratchett wouldnt do any harm if we gave him a hand sort of thing said the nome nervously and he said i gave orders screamed nisodemus you will all obey me did i not stop the truck by the power of arnold bros no said grimma quietly no you didnt dorcas did he put nails down in the road there was a huge horrified silence in the mid dle of it nisodemus went slowly white with rage liar he shouted no said grimma meekly he really did he really did all sorts of things to help us and we never said please or thank you and now hes dead there were sirens along the road below and a lot of excitement around the stationary train red and blue lights flashed the nomes shifted uneasily one of them said hes not really dead though is he not really i expect he jumped out at the last minute a clever person like him grimma looked helplessly at the crowd she saw nootys parents in the crowd they were a quiet patient couple shed hardly ever spoken to them now their faces were gray and lined with worry she gave in yes she said perhaps they got out must have muttered another nome trying to look cheerful dorcas isnt the type to go around dying all the time not when we need him diggers grimma nodded and now she went on i think even humans will be wondering whats happening here theyll soon work out where the truck came from and theyll be coming up here and i think they might be very angry but nisodemus licked his lips and said we wont be afraid we will confront them and defy them um we will treat them with scorn we dont need dorcas we need nothing except faith in ar nold bros nails indeed if you start out now said grimma you should all be able to get to the barn even through whats left of the snow i dont think the quarry will be a safe place soon there was something about the way she said it that made people nervous normally grimma shouted or argued but this time she spoke quite calmly it wasnt like her at all go on she said youll have to start now youll have to take as much food and stuff as possi ble go on no shouted nisodemus no one is to move do you think arnold bros will let you down um i will protect you from the humans down below a car with flashing lights on top of pulled away from the excitement around the train crossed the main highway and headed slowly up the dirt road i will call upon the power of arnold bros est to smite the humans shouted nisodemus terry pratchett the nomes looked unhappy arnold bros est had never smitten anyone in the store hed just founded it and seen to it that nomes lived com fortable and not very strenuous lives in it and apart from putting the signs on the walls hadnt really interfered very much now suddenly he was going around being angry and upset all the time and smiting people it was very bewildering i will stand here and defy the dreadful minions of order nisodemus yelled i will teach them a lesson they wont forget the rest of the nomes said nothing if nisodemus wanted to stand in front of the truck then that was all right by them we will all defy them he added er what said a nome brothers let us stand here resolute and show order that we are united in opposition um if you truly believe in arnold bros no harm will come to you the flashing light was well up the road nowj soon it would be crossing the wide patch in front of the gates where the great chain hung uselesslyrj from the broken padlock grimma opened her mouth to say dont be stuj pid you idiots arnold bros doesnt want you to stand in front of cars ive seen what happens to nomes who stand in front of cars yourj relatives have to bury you in an envelope i she was about to say all that and decided not to diggers for months and months people had been telling nomes what to do perhaps it was time to stop she saw a number of worried faces in the crowd turn toward her and someone said what shall we do grimma yeah said another nome shes a driver they always know what to do she smiled at them it wasnt a very happy smile do whatever you think best she said there was a chorus of indrawn breaths well yeah said a nome but well nisodemus says we can stop this thing just by believing we can is that true or what i dont know said grimma you might be able to i know i cant she turned and walked off quickly toward the sheds stand firm commanded nisodemus he hadnt been listening to the worried discussions be hind him do whatever you think best muttered a nome what sort of help is that they stood in their hundreds watching the car wind closer nisodemus stood slightly ahead of the crowd holding his hands in the air the only sound was the crunch of tires on gravel if a bird looked down on the quarry in the next w seconds it would have been amazed ell probably it wouldnt birds are somewhat terry pratchett stupid creatures and have a hard enough job even coming to terms with the ordinary let alone the extraordinary but if it had been an unusually in telligent birdan escaped myna bird perhaps or a parrot that had been blown several thousand miles off course by very strong windsit would have thought oh there is a wide hole in the hill with little old rusty sheds in it and a fence in front of it and there is a car with lights on the top of it just going through a gate in the fence and there are little black dots on the ground ahead of it one dot standing very still right in the path of the thing and the others the others breaking away and running running for their lives they never did find nisodemus again even though a party of strongstomached nomes went back much later and searched through the ruts and the mud so a rumor grew up that perhaps at the last min ute he had jumped up and caught hold of part of the car and had clambered onto it somehow and then hed waited there too ashamed to face other nomes until the car went back to wherever it came from and had got off and was living out the rest of his life quietly and without any fuss he had been a good nome in his way they said whatever else you might say about him he believed in things and he did what he thought was proper so it was only diggers right that hed been spared and was still out there in the world somewhere this was what they told one another and what they wrote down in the book of nome what nomes might have thought in those private moments before they went to sleep well that was private humans clomped slowly around the train and what remained of the truck lots of other vehicles had turned up at what was for humans great speed many of them had lights on top the nomes had learned to be worried by things with flashing lights on top the landrover belonging to the quarrymen was there as well one of the quarrymen was point ing to the wrecked truck and shouting at the oth ers it had opened the smashed engine compart ment and was pointing to where the battery wasnt beside the railroad the breeze rustled the long grass and some of the long grass rustled without any wind at all dorcas had been right where humans went once they went again the quarry belonged to them three trucks were parked outside the sheds snd humans were everywhere some were repair ng the fence some were taking boxes and drums ff trucks one was even in the managers office leaning up terry pratchett the nomes crouched where they could listening fearfully to the sounds above them there werent many hiding places for two thousand nomes small though they were it was a very long day in the shadows under some of the sheds in the darkness behind crates in some cases even on the dusty rafters under the tin roofs the nomes passed it as best they could there were escapes so narrow a postcard couldnt have got through them old munby con fectioner and most of his family were left blinking in the light when a human moved the beatup old box they were cowering behind only a quick dash to the shelter of a stack of cans saved them and of course the fact that humans never really looked hard at what they were doing that wasnt the worst part though the worst part was much worse the nomes sat in the noisy darkness not daring even to speak and felt their world vanishing not because the humans hated nomes because they didn t notice them there was dorcass electricity for example hed spent a long time twisting bits of wire to gether and finding a safe way to steal electricity from the fusebox a human pulled the wire bits out without thinking fiddled inside with a screw driver and then put up a new box with a lock on it the store nomes needed electricity they couldnt remember a time when they had been diggers without it it was a natural thing like air and now theirs was a world of endless darkness and still the terror went on the rough floor boards shook overhead raining dust and splinters metal drums boomed like thunder there was the continual sound of hammering the humans were back and they meant to stay they did go eventually though when the day light drained from the winter sky like steel grow ing cold some of the humans got into their vehicles and drove off down the dirt road they did one puzzling thing before they left nomes had to scramble over one another to get out of the way when one of the floorboards in the man agers office was pulled up a huge hand reached down and put a little tray on the packed earth un der the floor then the darkness came back as the board was replaced the nomes sat in the gloom and wondered why on earth the humans after a day like this were giving them food the tray was piled with flour it wasnt much compared to store food but to nomes who had spent all day hungry and miserable it smelled good a couple of younger ones crawled closer it had the most tantalizing smell one of them took a handful of the stuff dont eat it grimma pushed her way through the packed bodies ut it smells so one of the nomes warbled tebby pratchett a have you ever smelled anything like it before she said well no so you dont know its good to eat do you lis ten i know about stuff like this where wewhere i used to live in the hole there was a place along the highway where humans came to eat and sometimes wed find stuff like this among the trash at the back it kills you if you eat it the nomes looked at the innocent little tray food that killed you that didnt make sense i remember there was some canned meat we had once in the store said an elderly nome gave us all a nasty upset i remember he gave grimma a hopeful look she shook her head this isnt like that she said we used to find dead rats near it they didnt die in a very nice way she added shuddering at the memory oh the nomes stared at the tray again and there was a thump from overhead there was still a human in the quarry it was sitting in the old swivel chair in the man agers office reading a paper from a knothole near the floor the nomes watched carefully there were huge boots great sweeps of trouser a mountain range of jacket and far above the distant gleam of electric light on a bald head diggers after a long while the human put the paper down and reached over to the desk by its side the watching nomes gazed at a pack of sandwiches big ger than they were and a thermos flask that steamed when it was opened and filled the shed with the smell of soup they climbed back down and reported to grimma she was sitting by the food tray and had ordered six of the older and more sensible nomes to stand guard around it to keep children away its not doing anything she was told its just sitting there we saw it look out of the window once or twice then itll be here all night said grimma i expect the humans are wondering whos causing all this trouble what shall we dor grimma sat with her chin on her hands theres those big old tumbledown sheds across the quarry she said at last we could go there dorcas saiddorcas used to say it was very dangerous in the old sheds said a nome cau tiously because of all the old metal and stuff very dangerous he said more dangerous than here said grimma with just a trace of her old sarcasm youve got a point please maam it was one of the younger female nomes they eld grimma in awe because of the way she touted at the men and read better than anyone terry pratchett this one held a baby in her arms and kept curtsy ing every time she finished a sentence what it is sorrit said grimma please maam some of the children are very hungry maam there isnt anything wholesome to eat down here you see she gave grimma a plead ing look grimma nodded the stores were under the other sheds what was left of them the main po tato store had been found by some of the humans which was perhaps why the poison had been put down anyway they couldnt light a fire and there was no meat no one had been doing any proper hunting for days because arnold bros would provide according to nisodemus as soon as it gets light i think all the hunters we can spare should go out said grimma they considered this the dawn was a long way away to a nome a night was as long as three whole days theres plenty of snow said a nome that means weve got water we might be able to manage without food but the children wont said grimma and the old people too said a nome its go ing to freeze again tonight we havent got the elec tric and we cant light a fire outside they sat staring glumly at the dirt what grimma was thinking was theyre not bickering theyre not grumbling things are so diggers serious theyre actually not arguing and blaming each other all right she said and what do you all think we should do i we will come out of the woodwork ii we will come out of the floor iii they will wish they had never seen us from the book of nome humans i v iiii the human lowered its newspaper and listened there was a rustling in the walls there was a scratching under the floor its eyes swivelled to the table beside it a group of small creatures were dragging its packet of sandwiches across the tabletop it blinked then it roared and tried to stand up and it wasnt until it was nearly upright that it found that its feet were tied very firmly to the legs of its chair it crashed forward a crowd of tiny creatures moving so fast that it could hardly see them charged out from under the table and wrapped a length of old electrical wire around its outflung arms within seconds it was trussed awkwardly but very firmly between the furniture diggers they saw its great eyes roll it opened its mouth and mooed at them teeth like yellow plates clashed at them the wire held the sandwiches turned out to be cheese and pickle and the thermos once they got the top off was full of coffee store food said one nome to another good store food like we used to know they poured into the room from every crack and mousehole there was an electric fire by the table and they sat in solemn rows in front of its glowing red bar or wandered around the crowded office we done it they said just like that gullible travels the bigger they come the harder they fall there was a school of thought that said they should kill the human whose mad eyes followed them around the floor this was when they found the box it was on one of the shelves it was yellow it had a picture of a very unhappylooking rat on the front it had the word scramoff in big red lettering too on the back grimmas forehead wrinkled as she tried to read the smaller words on the back it says they take a bite but they dont come back for more she said and apparently contains polydichloromethylinlon whatever aat is clears outhouses of troublesome she paused terry pratchett troublesome what said the listening nomes troublesome what grimma lowered her voice it says clears outhouses of troublesome ver min in a trice she said its poison its the stuff they put under the floor the silence that followed this was black with rage the nomes had raised quite a lot of children in the quarry they had very firm views about poi son we should make the human eat it said one of them fill up its mouth with polypuththeketlon or whatever it is troublesome vermin i think they think were rats said grimma and that would be all right would it said a nome with withering sarcasm rats are okay weve never had any trouble with rats no call to go around giving them poisoned food in fact the nomes got on rather well with the local rats probably because their leader was bobo who had been a pet of angalos when they lived in the store the two species treated each other with the distant friendliness of creatures who could at a pinch eat one another but had decided not to yeah the ratsd thank us for getting rid of a human he went on no said grimma no i dont think we should do that dorcas always said that theyreg nearly as intelligent as we are you cant go aroundj poisoning intelligent creatures they tried diggers theyre not nomes they dont know how to behave said grimma anyway be sensible more humans will come along in the morning if they find a dead human therell be a lot of trou ble that was a point but they had shown them selves to a human no nome could remember its ever being done before theyd had to do it or starve and freeze but there was no knowing where it would end how it would end was a bit more certain it would probably end badly go and put it somewhere where the rats cant get it said grimma i reckon we should just give it a taste said the nome no just take the stuff away well stay here the rest of the night and then move out before its light well all right if you say so i just hope were not sorry about it later thats all the nomes car ried the dreadful box away grimma wandered over to where the human lay it was well trussed up by now and couldnt move a finger it looked just like the picture of gullible or whoever he was except the nomes had got hold of what the nomes in those days had never heard of which was lots of electrical wire it was a lot tougher than rope and they were a lot angrier gullible hadnt been driving a great big truck ound the place and putting down rat poison hcyd gone through its pockets and piled up the terry pratchett contents in a heap thered been a big square of white cloth among them which a group of nomes had managed to tie around the humans mouth af ter its mooing got on everyones nerves now they stood around eating pieces of bread and cheese and pickle and watching the humans eyes humans cant understand nomes their voices are too fast and too high like a bat squeak it was probably just as well say we should find something sharp and stick it into it said a nome in all the soft parts theres things we could do with matches said granny morkie to grimmas surprise and nails said a middleaged nome the human growled behind its gag and strained at the wires we could pull all its hair out said granny morkie and then we could do it then said grimma coming up behind them they turned what do it if you want to said grimma there it is right in front of you do what you like what we granny morkie nome drew back i didnt not me i didnt mean me i meant well us nomekind there you are then said grimma and nomekind is only nomes besides its wrong to hurt prisoners i read it in a book its called the diggers geneva convention when youve got people at your mercy you shouldnt hurt them seems like the ideal time to me said a nome hit them when they cant hit back thats what i sav anyway its not as if humans are the same as real people but he shuffled backward anyway funny though when you see their faces close up said granny morkie putting her head to one side they look a lot like us only bigger one of the nomes peered into the humans frightened eyes hasnt it got a hairy nose he said and ears too like a cow said granny you could almost feel sorry for them with great big noses like that grimma peered into the humans eyes i wonder she thought theyre bigger than us so there must be room for brains and theyve got great big eyes surely they must have seen us once masklin said weve been here for thousands of years in all that time humans must have seen us they must have known we were real people but in their minds they turned us into pixies perhaps they didnt want to have to share the world the human was definitely looking at her could we share she thought they live in a big lng slow world and we live in a small short fast e and we cant understand each other they cant even see us unless we stand still as im stand terry pratchett ing now we move too quickly for them they dont think we exist she stared up into the big frightened eyes weve never tried towhat was the wordcom municate with them before not properly not as though they were real people thinking real thoughts how can we tell them were really real and really here but perhaps when youre lying down on the floor and tied up by little people you can hardly see and dont believe in thats not the best time to start communicating perhaps we should try it another time not signs not shouting just trying to get them to understand us wouldnt it be amazing if we could they could do the big slow jobs for us and we could dooh little fast things fiddly things that those great fin gers cant do but not paint flowers or mend their shoes grimma you ought to see this grimma said a voice behind her the nomes were clustered around a white heap on the floor oh yes the human had been looking at one of those big sheets of paper the nomes had spread it out flat on the floor it looked a lot like the first one theyd seen except this one was called read it first in your soaraway blackbury evening post and gazette it had more of the great blocky writing some of the letters nearly as big as a nomes head diggers griinma shook her own head as she tried to make sense of it she could understand the books quite well she considered but the papers seemed to use a different language it was full of probes and shocks and fuzzy pictures of smiling humans shaking hands with other humans elks raise ј for hos pital appeal it wasnt difficult to work out what each word meant but when they were put together they either didnt mean anything at all or some thing quite unbelievable no this is the bit said one of the nomes this page here look some of the words theyre the same as last time look its about grandson richard grimma ran the length of a story about some body slamming somebodys plan for something there was indeed a fuzzy picture of grandson richard under the words tvinthesky hitch she knelt down and stared at the smaller words below it read it aloud they said richard arnold the blackburybased chair man of the arnco international group said in florida today she read that scientists are still trying to rrregain control of arnsat the multi roillionpound corn communications sat tellite the nomes looked at one another multimillion pound they said thats really heavy hopes were high after yesterdays sssuccess terry pratchett ful llunch in florida grimma read uncertainly that arnsat would begin test trtrtransmis sions today instead it is ssending a stream of strange sig signals its like some sort of ccode said arnold there was an appreciative murmur from the lis teners its as if it had a mind of its own grimma read there was more stuff about teething troubles whatever that meant but grimma didnt bother to read it she remembered the way masklin had talked about the stars and why they stayed up and there was the thing hed taken it with him the thing could talk to electricity couldnt it it could listen to the electricity in wires and the stuff in the air that dorcas called radio if anything could send strange signals the thing could may go even fur ther than the long drive hed said theyre alive she said to no one in particular masklin and gurder and angalo they got to the florida place and theyre alive she remembered him trying to tell her some times about the sky and the thing and where nomes first came from and shed never really un derstood any more than hed understood about the little frogs theyre alive she repeated i know they are i dont know exactly how or where but theyve got some sort of plan and theyre alive i diggers the nomes exchanged meaningful glances and the kind of meaning they were full of was shes fooling herself but itd take a braver nome than me to tell her granny morkie patted her gently on the shoul der yes yes she said soothingly and thank good ness they had a successful lunch i bet they needed to get some food inside of them and if i was you my girl id get some sleep grimma dreamed it was a confused dream dreams nearly always are they dont come neatly packaged she dreamed of loud noises and flashing lights and eyes little yellow eyes and masklin standing on a branch climbing through leaves peering down at little yellow eyes fm seeing what hes doing now she thought hes alive i always knew he was of course but outer space has got more leaves than i thought or perhaps none of it is real and pm just dreaming then someone woke her up its never wise to speculate about the meaning of dreams so she didnt it snowed again in the night on an icy wind some of the nomes scouted around the sheds and came back with a few vegetables that had been missed but it was a pitifully small amount the tebby pratchett tiedup human went to sleep after a while and snored like someone sawing a thick log with a thin saw the others will come looking for it in the morn ing grimma warned we mustnt be here then perhaps we should she stopped they all listened something was moving around under the floor boards is anyone still down there grimma whis pered the nomes near her shook their heads no one wanted to be in the chilly space under the floor when there was the warmth and light of the office for the having and it cant be rats she said then someone called out in that halfloud half soft way of someone who wants to make himself heard while at the same time remaining as quiet as possible it turned out to be sacco they dragged aside the floorboards the humans had loosened and helped him up he was covered in mud and swaying with exhaustion i couldnt find anyone he gasped i looked everywhere and i couldnt find anyone and we saw the trucks come here and i saw the lights on and i thought the humans were still here and i came in and i heard your voices and youve got to coine because its dorcas hes alive said grimma diggers if he isnt he can swear pretty well for a dead person said sacco sagging to the floor we thought you were all de grimma began were all fine except for dorcas he hurt him self jumping out of the truck come on pleasev you dont look in any state to go anywhere said grimma she stood up you just tell us where he is we got him halfway up the road and we got so tired and i left them and came on ahead sacco blurted out theyre under the hedge and his eyes fell on the snoring bulk of the human he stared at grimma youve captured a humanf he said he stumbled sideways need a bit of a rest so tired so tired he repeated vaguely then he fell forward grimma caught him and laid him down as gently as she could someone put him somewhere warm and see if theres any food left she said to the nomes in gen eral and i want some of you to help me look for the others come on this isnt a night for being outside the expression on the faces of some of the nomes said that they definitely agreed with this point of view and that among the people who shouldnt be out on a night like this was themselves its snowing quite a lot said one of them un certainly well never find them in all the dark and snow grimma glared at him terry pratchett we might she said we might find them in all the dark and snow we wont find them by staying in the light and warm i know that much several nomes pushed their way forward grimma recognized nootys people and the par ents of some of the lads then there was a bit of a commotion from under the table where the oldest nomes were clustering together to keep warm and have a good moan im comin too said granny morkie do me good to have a drop of fresh air what you all lookin at me like that for i think you ought to stay inside granny said grimma gently dont you come the beintactfultooldpeople to me my gel said granny prodding her with her stick i bin out in deep snow before you was even thought of she turned to the rest of the nomes nothin to it if you acts sensible and keeps yellin out sos everyone knows where everyone is i went out to help look for my uncle joe before i was a year old she said proudly dreadful snow that was it come down sudden like when the men were out huntin we found nearly all of him too yes yes all right granny said grimma quickly she looked at the others well were go ing she said in the end fifteen of them went many out of sheer embarrassment in the yellow light from the shed windows the diggers snowflakes looked beautiful by the time they reached the ground they were pretty unpleasant the store nomes really hated the outside snow there had been snow in the store too sprayed on merchandise around christmas fayre time but it wasnt cold and snowflakes were huge beautiful things that were hung from the ceilings on bits of thread proper snowflakes not ghastly things which looked all right in the air but turned into freezing wet stuff which was allowed to just lie around on the floor it already was deep as their knees what you do is said granny morkie you lift your feet up really high and plonk them down nothin to it the light from the shed shone out across the quarry but the dirt road was a dark tunnel leading into the night and spread out said grimma but keep to gether spread out and keep together they muttered a senior nome put his hand up you dont get robins at night do you he asked cautiously no of course not said grimma no you dont get robins at night silly said granny morkie they looked relieved no you get foxes granny added in a self tisfied way great big foxes they get good and hungry in the cold weather and maybe you get terry pratchett owls she scratched her chin cunnin devils owls you never hear em till theyre almost on top o you she banged on the wall with her stick look sharp you lot best foot forward unless youre like my uncle joea fox got is best foot e ad to have a wooden leg e was livid there was something about granny morkies cheering people up that always got them moving anything was better than being cheered up some more the snowflakes were caking up on the dried grasses and ferns on either bank every now and again some of it fell off sometimes onto the dirt road often onto the nomes stumbling along it they prodded the snowy tussocks and peered doubtfully into the gloomy holes under the hedge while the flakes continued to fall in a soft crackly silence robins owls and other terrors of the out side lurked in every shadow eventually the light was left behind and they walked by the glow of the snow itself sometimes one of them would call out softly and then theyd all listen it was very cold i granny morkie stopped suddenly fox she announced i can smell it cant mis take a fox rank they huddled together and stared apprehen sively into the darkness might not still be around mind said granny hangs about for a long time that smell diggers they relaxed a bit really granny muttered grimma i was just tryin to be a help sniffed granny morkie you dont want my help youve only got to say were doing this wrong said grimma its dorcas were looking for he wouldnt just be sit ting out in the open would he he knows about foxes hed get the boys to find somewhere shel tered and as safe as possible nootys father stepped forward if you look the way the snow falls he said hesi tantly you can see the air conditioning is blowing it this way he pointed so it piles up more on this side of things than that side so theyd want to be as much away from the air conditioning as pos sible wouldnt they its called the wind when its outside said grimma gently but youre right that means she peered at the hedgestheyd be on the other side of the hedge in the field up against the bank come on they scrambled up through the masses of dead leaves and dripping twigs and into the field be yond it was desolate a few tufts of dead grass stuck above the endless wilderness of snow several of the nomes groaned its the size grimma thought they dont mind ae quarry or the thickets above it or even the ad because a lot of it is closed in and you can pretend there are sort of walls around you its too big for them here stick close to the hedge she said more cheer fully than she felt theres not so much snow there oh arnold bros she thought dorcas doesnt believe in you and i certainly dont believe in you but if you could just see your way clear to existing just long enough for us to find them wed all appreciate it very much and perhaps if you could stop the snow and see us all safely back to the quarry as well that would be a big help thats crazy she thought masklin always said that if there was an arnold bros he was sort of inside our heads helping us think she realized that she was staring at the snow why is there a hole in it she thought iv there is nowhere to go and we must go from the book of nome exits iii v iv rabbits i thought she said dorcas patted her hand well done he said weakly we were on the road after sacco left said nooty and it was getting really cold and dorcas said to take him to the other side of the hedge and well it was me who said you can see rabbits in this field sometimes and be said find a rabbit hole so we did we thought wed be here all night ow moaned dorcas dont make a fuss i didnt hurt a bit said granny morkie cheerfully as she examined his leg nothin broken but its a nasty sprain the store nomes looked around the burrow with interest and a certain amount of approval it was nicely closed in your ancestors probably lived in holes like terry pratchett this said grimma with shelves and things of course very nice said a nome homey almost like being under the floor stinks a bit said another thatll be the rabbits said dorcas nodding to ward the deeper darkness weve heard them rus tling about but theyre staying out of our way nooty said he thought there was a fox snuffling around a while ago wed better get you back as soon as possible said grimma i dont think any fox would bother the pack of us after all the local ones know who we are eat a nome and you die thats what theyve learned the nomes shuffled their feet it was true of course the trouble was they thought that the per son whod really regret it the most would be the one nome who was eaten knowing that the fox might be given a bad time afterward wouldnt be much consolation besides they were cold and wet and the burrow while it wouldnt have sounded like a very com fortable proposition back at the quarry was sud denly much better than the horrible night outside theyd staggered past a dozen burrows calling down into the gloom before theyd heard nootys voice answering them i really dont think we need worry said grimma foxes learn very quickly isnt that so granny diggers eh said granny morkie i was telling everyone how foxes learn quickly said grimma desperately oh yes right enough said granny hell go a long way out of his way for something he likes to eat will your average fox especially when its cold weather i didnt mean that why do you have to make everything sound so body im sure i dont mean to said granny morkie and sniffed we must get back said dorcas firmly this snow isnt just going to go away is it i can get along okay if ive got someone to lean on we can make you a stretcher said grimma though goodness knows there isnt much to get back to we saw the humans go up the road said nooty but we had to go all the way along to the badger tunnel and there were no real paths then we tried to cut across the fields at the bottom and that was a mistake they were all plowed up we havent had anything to eat he added dont expect much then said grimma the humans took most of our supplies they think were rats well thats not so bad said dorcas we used to encourage them to think we were back in the store they used to put traps down we used to hunt rats in the basement and put them in the aps when i was a lad terry pratchett now theyre using poisoned food said grimma thats not good come on lets get you back the snow was still falling outside but raggedy fashion as if the last flakes in stock were being sold off cheaply there was a line of red light in the east not the dawn but the promise of the dawn it didnt look cheerful when the sun did rise it would find itself locked behind bars of cloud they broke off some pieces of dead cowparsley stalks to make a rough sort of chair for dorcas which four nomes could carry hed been right about the shelter of the hedge the snow wasnt very deep there but it made up for it by being littered with old leaves twigs and debris it was slow going it must be great to be a human grimma thought as thorns the length of her hand tore at her dress masklin was right this really is their world its the right size for them they go where they want and do whatever they like we think we do things for ourselves and all we do is live in odd corners of their worldunder their floors stealing things the other nomes trudged along in weary silence the only sound apart from the crunch of feet on snow and leaves was that of granny morkie eat ing shed found some hawthorn berries on a bush and was chewing her way through one with every sign of enjoyment shed offered them around but the other nomes found them bitter and unpleasant diggers probly an acquired taste she muttered glar ing at grimma its one we all are going to have to acquire thought grimma ignoring grannys hurt stare the only hope weve got is to split up and leave the quarry in little groups once we get back move out into the country go back to living in old rabbit holes and eating whatever we can find some groups may survive the winter once the old people have died off and itll be goodbye electricity goodbye read ing goodbye bananas but ill wait at the quarry until masklin comes back cheer up my girl said granny morkie trying to be friendly dont look so gloomy it may never happen thats what i always say even granny was shocked when grimma looked at her with a face from which all the color had drained away the girls mouth opened and shut a few times then she folded up very gently and collapsed to her knees and started to sob it was the most shocking sound theyd heard grimma yelled complained bullied and com manded hearing her cry was wrong as though the whole world had turned upside down all i did was try to cheer her up mumbled granny morkie the embarrassed nomes stood around in a circle no one dared go near grimma anything might happen if you tried to pat her on the shoulder and terry pratchett say there there anything might happen she might bite your hand off or anything dorcas looked at the nomes on either side of him sighed and eased himself up off his makeshift stretcher he limped over to grimma catching hold of a thorn twig to steady himself youve found us were going back to the quarry everythings all right he said soothingly it isnt well have to move on she sobbed youd have been better off staying in the hole its all gone bad well i would have said dorcas began weve got no food and we cant stop the humans and were trapped in the quarry and ive tried to keep everyone together and now its all gone bad we ought to have gone up to that barn right at the start said nooty you still could said grimma all the younger people could just get as far away from here as pos sible but children couldnt walk it and old people certainly couldnt manage the snow said dorcas you know that youre just despairing weve tried everything its just got worse we thought it would be a lovely life in the outside and now its all falling to pieces dorcas gave her a long blank look we might as well give up right now she said we might as well give up and die right here there was a horrified silence it was broken by dorcas diggers er he said er are you sure are you really sure the tone of his voice made grimma look up all the nomes were staring there was a fox looking down at them it was one of those moments when time itself freezes solid grimma could see the yellowgreen glow in the foxs eyes and the cloud of its breath its tongue lolled out it looked surprised it was new to these parts and had never seen nomes before its notverycomplicated mind was trying to come to terms with the fact that the shape of the nomestwo arms two legs a head at the top was a shape it associated with humans and had learned to avoid but the size was the size it had always thought of as a mouthful the nomes stood rooted in terror there was no sense in trying to run away a fox had twice as many legs to run after you youd end up dead any way but at least you wouldnt end up dead and out of breath as well there was a growl to the nomes astonishment it had come from grimma she snatched granny morkies walking stick strode forward and whacked the fox across the nose before it could move it yelped and blinked stupidly shove off she shouted how dare you come here she hit it again it jerked its head away terry pratchett grimma took another step forward and caught it a backward thump across the muzzle the fox made up its mind there were definitely rabbits further down the hedge rabbits didnt hit back it knew where it was with rabbits it whined backed away with its eyes fixed on grimma and then darted off into the darkness the nomes breathed out well said dorcas im sorry but i just cant stand foxes said grimma and masklin said we should let them know whos boss im not arguing said dorcas grimma looked vaguely at the stick what was i saying before that she said you were saying we might as well give up and die right here said granny morkie helpfully grimma glared at her no i wasnt she said i was just feeling a bit tired thats all come on well catch our death standing here or the other way around said sacco staring into the foxhaunted darkness thats not funny snapped grimma striding off i didnt mean it to be said sacco shivering overhead quite unnoticed by the nomes a rather strangely bright star zigzagged across the sky it was small or perhaps it was really very big but a long way off if you looked at it long enough it might just appear discshaped it was causing a diggers lot of messages to be sent through the air all around the world it seemed to be looking for something there were flickering lights in the quarry by the time they got back another group of nomes was about to set out to look for them not with much enthusiasm admittedly but they were going to try the cheer that went up when it was realized that everyone was back safely almost made grimma for get that they were safely back to a very unsafe place shed read something in the book of prov erbs that summed it up perfectly as far as she could remember it was something about jumping out of the thing you cook in and into the thing you cooked on or something grimma led the rescue party into the office and listened while sacco with many interruptions re counted the adventure from the time dorcas out of sudden terror had jumped out of the truck and had been carried off the rails just before the train ar rived it sounded brave and exciting and point less grimma thought but she kept that to herself it wasnt as bad as it looked sacco said i mean the truck was smashed but the train didnt even come off the rails we saw it all he finished im starving he gave them a bright smile which faded like a sunset theres no food he said terry pratchett even less than that said a nome if youve got some bread we could have a snow sandwich sacco thought about this theres the rabbits he said there were rab bits in the field and in the dark said dorcas who appeared to have something on his mind well yes admitted sacco and with that fox hanging about said nooty another proverb floated up in grimmas mind needs must she said when the devil drives they looked at her in the flickering light of the matches whos he said nooty some sort of horrible person that lives under the ground in a hot place i think said grimma like the boiler room in the store i suppose so and what sort of vehicle does he drive said sacco looking interested it just means that sometimes youre forced to do things said grimma testily i dont think he ac tually drives anything well no there wouldnt be the room down there for one thing dorcas coughed he seemed to be upset about something well everyone was upset but he was even more upset all right he said quietly something about the way he said it made thein pay attention diggers youd all better come with me he went on believe me id rather you didnt have to where to said grimma the old sheds the ones by the cliff said dor cas but theyre all tumbled down and you said they were very dangerous oh they are they are theres piles of junk and stuff in cans the children shouldnt touch and stuff like that he twiddled his beard nervously but he said theres something else some thing ive been sort of working on sort of he looked her in the eye something of mine he said the most marvellous thing ive ever seen even better than frogs in a flower then he coughed anyway theres plenty of room in there he said the floors are just earth er but the sheds are big and there are lots of places er to hide a snore from the human shook the office besides i dont like being so close to that thing he added there was a general murmur of agreement about this had you thought about what youre going to do with it said dorcas some people wanted to kill it but i dont think thats a good idea said grimma i think the other humans would get really upset about it besides it doesnt seem right said dorcas tekby pbatchett i know what you mean so what shall we do with it grimma glared at the huge face every pore ev ery hair was huge it was strange to think that if there were creatures smaller than nomes little peo ple perhaps the size of ants her own face might look like that if you looked at it philosophically the whole thing about big and small was just a mat ter of size well leave it she said but is there any paper here loads of it on the desk said nooty go and fetch some please dorcas youve al ways got something to write with havent you dorcas fumbled in his pockets until he found a stub of pencil lead dont waste it he said dont know if ill ever get any more eventually nooty came back towing a yellowing sheet of paper at the top of it in heavy black let tering were the words blackbury sand and gravel inc below that was the word invoice grimma thought for a while and then licked the stub and in big letters started to write what are you doing said dorcas trying to communicate said grimma she carefully traced another word pressing quite hard ive always thought it might be worth trying said dorcas but is this the right time yes said grimma she finished the last word diggers what do you think she said handing dorcas the pencil lead the writing was a bit jagged where she had pressed hard and her grasp of grammar and writ ing wasnt as good as her skill at reading but it was clear enough i would have done it differently said dorcas reading it perhaps you would but this is the way ive done it yes dorcas put his head on one side well its definitely a communication you cant get much more communicating than that yes grimma tried to sound cheerful and now she said lets see this shed of yours two minutes later the office shed was empty of nomes the human snored on the floor one hand outstretched there was a piece of paper in it now it said blackbury sand and gravel inc it said invoice it said we could of kiled you leav us alone now it was quite light outside and the snow had stopped theyll see our tracks said sacco even hu mans will notice this many tracks it doesnt matter said dorcas just get every one into the old sheds terry pratchett are you sure dorcas said grimma are you really sure this is a good idea no they joined the stream of nomes hurrying through a crack in the crumbling corrugated metal and entered the vast echoing chamber of the shed grimma looked around her rust and time had eaten large holes in the walls and ceiling old cans and coils of wire were stacked willynilly in the corners along with oddshaped bits of metal and jam jars with nails in them everything stank of oil whats the part we ought to know about she said dorcas pointed to the shadows at the far end of the shed where she could just make out something big and indistinct it just looks like some sort of big cloth she said its um underneath it is everyone in dorcas cupped his hands around his mouth is everyone in he shouted he turned to nooty i need to know where everyone is he said i dont want anyone to be frightened but i dont want unnecessary people getting in the way unnecessary for what said grimma but he ignored her sacco you take some of the lads and get those things we put in the hedge said dorcas well definitely need the battery and im really not cer tain how much fuel there is dorcas what is it said grimma tapping her foot diggers dorcas got like this sometimes she knew when he was thinking about machines or things he could do with his hands he started to ignore people his voice changed too he gave her a long slow look as if he were seeing her for the first time then he looked down at his feet youd better er come and see he said i shall need you to explain things to everyone youre so much better at that sort of thing grimma followed him across the chilly floor as more nomes filed into the shed and huddled appre hensively along the walls he led her under the shadow of the tarp which formed a sort of big dusty cave a tire like a trucks loomed up a little way away in the gloom but it was far more knobby than any she had seen oh its just a truck she said uncertainly youve got a truck in here have you no said dorcas its a cat grimmas response was impressive she spun around in an effort to see in every direction at once where where she screamed you idiot you brought us where theres a caty dorcas said nothing he just pointed upward grimma looked up and then looked up some more into the mouth of the cat iv dorcas said this is the cat great beast with teeth v needs must if we are driven let us drive from the book of nome cat ii v ivv sometimes words need music too sometimes the descriptions are not enough books should be writ ten with soundtracks like films something deep on an organ perhaps grimma stared soundtrack on deedledahdeedledahdadum it cant really be alive she thought desperately its not really about to bite me dorcas wouldnt have brought me in here if he knew there was a monster about to bite me im not going to be frightened im not frightened at all i am a think ing nome and im not frightened i think the knobby wheels are just to make it grip the ground better said dorcas his voice sounding a long way off now ive had a good diggers look around it and you know theres nothing re ally wrong with it its just very old grimmas gaze travelled along the huge yellow neck deedledahdeedledahd um then i thought im sure it could be started up these diesel engines are quite easy really and of course there were pictures in one of the books al though im not sure about these pipes hydraulics i think its called but there was this book on one of the benches workshop manual and ive put grease on things and cleaned it up dorcas gabbled dahdahdahdum i suppose the humans or whatever knew they would be coming back and ive been up and looked at the controls and you know its probably easier than the truck was only of course theres these ex tra levers for the hydraulics but that shouldnt be a problem if theres enough gas which he stopped aware of her silence is there something the matter he said what is it said grimma i was just telling you said dorcas its fasci nating you see these pipes pump some sort of stuff which made those parts up there move and those pistons are forced out which makes the arm thing over there i didnt ask you what it does i asked you what lt is said grimma impatiently because i know one thing its not a cat dorcas terry pratchett youre wrong about that said dorcas see whats painted on it just up there look she looked where he pointed grimmas brow wrinkled c a t she said cat but but dorcas that cant be right not really right look a cats got well whiskers and hair and its a whole lot smaller dunno said dorcas and he shrugged its written right there im not about to argue with things that are written right there maybe its a big cat maybe all the whiskers dropped out a long time ago you know like some old nomes lose their hair wwell said grimma uncertainly but even the shape isnt right and what do i know about this said dorcas im not an expert in natural history anyway come over to this side she followed him dreamily and once more stared into the darkness under the tarp there he said theres no mistaking what they are i hope oh my said grimma and raised her hand to her mouth yes said dorcas thats what i thought when i first found this i thought oh its a sort of truck well well and then i walked up here and i found that it was a truck with teeth said grimma softly great big metal teeth a mouth at both ends diggers thats right said dorcas proudly the cat a sort of truck a truck with two heads a truck with teeth dahdum does itdoes it work said grimma it should it should ive tested what i can basic principle is like a truck but theres a lot of extra levers and things why didnt you tell me about this before grimma demanded dunno because i didnt have to i suppose said dorcas but its huge you cant keep something like this to yourself everyone has to have something they can keep to themselves said dorcas vaguely anyway the size isnt important its just so well so perfect dorcas patted a knobby tire you know you said humans think someone made the world in a week when i saw the cat for the first time i thought okay this is what he used he stared up into the shadows first thing weve got to do is get the tarp off he said itll be very heavy so well need lots of people youd better warn them the cat can be a bit scary when you see it for the first time didnt frighten me a bit said grimma i know said dorcas i was watching your face terry pratchett the nomes looked expectantly at grimma the thing to remember she said is that its just a machine just a sort of truck but when you first see it it can be rather frightening so hold on to small childrens hands and run smartly back ward when the tarp comes down there was a chorus of nods all right grab hold six hundred nomes spat on their hands and grasped the edge of the heavy cloth when i say pull i want you to pull the nomes took the strain the creases in the tarp flattened out and disap peared pull it began to move then as it slid over the cats angular shape its own weight started to tug at it run it came down like an oily green avalanche piling up into a mountain of folds but no one bothered about it because the sun shone through the dusty cobwebbed windows and made the cat glow several nomes screamed mothers picked up their children there was a movement toward the doors the light twinkled on the tips of the teeth it does look like a head grimma thought on a long neck and hes got another one at the other end what am i saying it has got another one at the other end diggers i said its all right she shouted over the rising din look its not even moving hey shouted another voice she looked up nooty and sacco had climbed out along the cats neck and were sitting there waving cheerfully that did it the tide of nomes reached the wall and stopped you always feel foolish running away from something that isnt chasing you they hesi tated and then slowly inched their way back well well said granny morkie hobbling for ward so thats what they look like i always won dered grimma stared at her what what look like she said oh the big diggers said granny theyd all gone when i was born but our dad saw em great big yellow things with teeth that et dirt he said i always thought he was having me on the cat was still not eating people some of the more adventurous nomes started to climb on it it was when the big highway was built granny went on leaning on her stick they were all over the place dad said big yellow things with teeth and knobby tires grimma stared at her with the kind of expres sion reserved for people who turn out against all expectation to have interesting and secret histo ries and there was others too the old woman went on things that shoved dirt in piles and every terry pratchett thing this would have been oh fifteen years ago now never thought id see one you mean the highways were made said grimma the cat was covered with young nomes now she could see dorcas in the back of the cab explaining what various levers did thats what he said said granny you didnt think they was natchral did you oh no no of course not said grimma dont be silly and she thought i wonder if dorcas is right perhaps everything was made everything in the whole world some parts early some parts later you start with hills and clouds and things and then you add highways and stores perhaps the job of humans is to make the world and theyre still do ing it thats why the machines have to suit them gurder would have understood this sort of thing i wish he were back and then masklin would be back too she tried to think about something else knobby tires that was a good start the cats back wheels were nearly as high as a human it doesnt need highways of course it doesnt it makes highways so it has to be able to go where highways arent she pushed her way through the crowds to the back of the cab where another group of nomes were already nomehandling a plank into position and scrambled up to where dorcas was trying to diggers make himself heard in the middle of an excited crowd youre going to drive this out of here she de manded he looked up oh yes he said happily i think so i hope so i imagine weve got at least an hour before any more humans come and its not a lot different from a truck we know how to do it shouted one of the younger nomes my dad told me all about the strings and stuff grimma looked around the cab it seemed to be full of levers itd been more than half a year since the long drive and shed never taken much notice of me chanical things but she couldnt help thinking the old truck cab had been a lot less crowded there had been some pedals and a lever and the steering wheel and that had been about it she turned back to dorcas are you sure she asked no he said you know im never sure but a lot of the controls are for its moufor the bucket the thing with the teeth in it at the end of its neck i mean the control arms we neednt bother with them theyre amazingly ingenious though and all you have to do wheres everyone going to sit there isnt much room dorcas shrugged i suppose the older people terry pratchett can travel in the cab the youngsters will have to hang on where they can we can wrap wires and things around the place for handholds i mean look dont worry well be driving in the light and we dont have to go fast and then well get to the barn wont we dor cas said nooty where itll be warm and theres lots of food i hope so said dorcas now lets get on with things we havent got much time wheres sacco with the battery grimma thought will there be lots of food at the barn where did we get that idea angalo said that turnips or something were stored up there and there may be some potatoes thats not exactly a feast her stomach thinking thoughts of its own rum bled in disagreement it had been a very long night to pass on a tiny piece of cheese sandwich anyway we cant stay here now anywhere will be better than here dorcas she said is there anything i can help with he looked up you could read the instruction book he said see if it says how to drive it dont you know er not in so many words not exactly i mean i know how to do it its just that i dont know what to do it was under the bench on one side of the shed grimma propped it up and tried to concentrate de diggers spite the noise i bet he does know she thought but this is his moment and he doesnt want me getting in the way the nomes moved like people with a purpose things were far too bad to spend time grumbling funny thing she thought as she turned the dirty pages that people only seem to stop complaining when things get really bad thats when they start using words like pulling together shoulders to the wheel and noses to the grindstone shed found nose to the grindstone in a book apparently it meant to keep on with things she didnt see why people were supposed to work hard if you ground their noses it seemed more likely that theyd work hard if you promised to grind their noses if they didnt it had been the same with road works ahead on the long drive the road ahead works how could it mean anything else but the road had been full of holes where was the sense in that words ought to mean what they meant she turned the page there was a big brown ring on this one where a human had put down a cup and the words caterpillar tractor company she gave them a blank look this is just what i mean she thought a caterpil lar is a baby butterfly a tractor is a sort of truck humans use in fields company is what you have when youre not alone the words all mean some terry pratchett thing and then they get put together and who knows what they mean then across the floor a group of nomes swarmed around the slowly moving bulk of the battery they were rolling it on rusty ball bearings the can of fuel wobbled after it grimma turned another page and stared at the pictures of levers with numbers on them suddenly people were keen on the barn she thought sud denly when things were not just averagely awful but promising to be really dreadful they seemed almost happy masklin had known about that its amazing what people would do he said if you found the right place to push she went on reading back hoe now what was that supposed to mean maybe you had to shout instructions to the cat like maybe back hoe and forward hey or maybe not she stared at the pages and tried to get inter ested in levers the clouds running before the sun were spread ing across the pink of the sky red sky in the morn ing grimma had read once it meant sailors were unhappy she didnt know what sailors were though or why they made the sky red when they were unhappy in the dark office the human awoke mooed for a while and tried to jerk free of the cobweb of wires diggers that held it down after a lot of effort it wriggled most of one arm free what the human did next would have surprised most nomes it caught hold of a chair and with a great deal of grunting managed to tip it over it pulled it across the floor manipulated the leg un der a couple of strands of wire and heaved a minute later it was sitting upright pulling more wires free its huge eyes fell on the scrap of paper on the floor it stared at it for a moment rubbing its arms and then it picked up the telephone dorcas prodded vaguely at a wire are you sure the battery is connected the right way sir said sacco i can tell the difference between red wires and black wires you know said dorcas mildly prod ding another wire then perhaps the battery doesnt have enough electricity said grimma helpfully trying to see over their shoulders perhaps its all run to the bottom or gone dry dorcas and sacco exchanged glances electricity doesnt sink said dorcas patiently or dry up as far as i know its either there or it isnt excuse me he peered up into the mass of wires again and gave one a poke there was a pop and a fat blue spark terry pratchett its there all right he added its just that it isnt where it should be grimma walked back across the greasy floor of the cab groups of nomes were standing around waiting hundreds of them were clutching the wires attached to the big steering wheel above them other teams stood by with bits of wood pressing like battering rams on the pedals just a bit of a delay she said all the electrici tys got lost there were nomes everywhere on the long drive there had been a whole truck for them but the cats cab was smaller and people had to pack themselves in where they could what a ragged bunch grimma thought and it was true even in the sudden rush from the store the nomes had been able to bring a lot of stuff and they had been plump and well dressed now they were thinner and leaner and much dirtier and all they were taking with them were the torn and grubby clothes they stood up in even the books had been left behind a hundred books took up the space of three hundred nomes and while grimma privately thought that some of the books were more useful than many of the nomes shed accepted dorcass promise that they would come back one day and try to retrieve them from their hiding place under the floor well thought grimma we tried we really made an effort we came to the quarry to dig in look after ourselves live proper lives and we failed we diggers thought all we had to do was bring the right things from the store but we brought a lot of wrong things too next time well need to go as far away from humans as possible and i dont actually think anywhere is far enough she climbed up onto the rickety driving plat form which had been made by tying a plank across the cab there were even nomes on this they watched her expectantly at least driving the cat should be easier the leaders of the teams on the controls could see her so she wouldnt have to mess around with sema phore and pieces of thread as theyd done when they left the store and a lot of the nomes had done this before too she heard dorcas shout try it this time there was a click there was a whirr then the cat roared the sound bounced around the cave of the shed it was so loud and so deep it wasnt really sound at all just something that turned the air hard and then hit you with it nomes flung themselves flat on the trembling deck of the cab grimma clutching at her ears saw dorcas run ning across the floor waving his hands the team on the accelerator pedal gave him a who us look and stopped pushing the sound died down to a deep rumbling purr a mummummummum that still had a feelitinthe bone quality dorcas hurried back and climbed with a lot of stopping for breath up to the plank terry pratchett when he got there he sat down and rubbed his brow im getting too old for this sort of thing he said when a nome gets to a certain age its time to stop stealing giant vehicles wellknown fact anyway its ticking over nicely you might as well take us out what all by myself said grimma i yes why not its just that well i thought sacco or someone would be up here i thought a male nome would be driving she thought theyd like to said dorcas theyd love to and wed be zipping all over the place i dont doubt it with them crying yippee and whatnot no i want a nice peaceful drive across the fields thank you very much the gentle touch he leaned down everyone ready down there he yelled there was a chorus of nervous yesses and one or two cheerful ones i wonder if putting sacco in charge of the go faster pedal is really a good idea mused dorcas he straightened up er youre not worried are you he said grimma snorted what me no of course not it does not she added present a problem kay he said lets go there was silence except for the deep thrum ming of the engine diggers grimma paused if masklin were here she thought hed do this better than me no one mentions him anymore or angalo or gurder they dont like thinking about them that must be something nomes learned hun dreds of years ago in this world full of foxes and rushing things and a hundred nasty ways to die if someone is missing you must stop thinking about them you must put them out of your mind but i think about him all the time i just went on about the frogs in the flowers and i never thought about his dreams dorcas gently put his arm around her she was shaking everyone was shaking to the deep chugging of the motor but she was shaking worse we should have sent some people to the airport to see what happened to him she muttered it would have showed that we cared and we didnt have the time and we didnt have the people said dorcas softly when he comes back we can explain about that hes bound to under stand yes she whispered and now said dorcas standing back lets go grimma took a deep breath first gear she bellowed and go forward verr rry slowly the teams pushed and pulled their way over the deck there was a slight shudder and the engine terry pratchett noise dropped the cat lurched forward and jolted to a stop the motor coughed and died dorcas looked thoughtfully at his fingernails hand brake hand brake hand brake he hummed softly grimma glared at him and cupped her hands around her mouth take the hand brake off she shouted right now get into first gear and go for ward very slowly there was a click and silence startthemotor startthemotor startthemotor murmured dorcas rocking back and forth on his heels grimma sagged put everything back where it was and start the motor she screamed nooty in charge of the hand brake team called up do you want the hand brake on or off miss what you havent told us what to do with the hand brake miss said sacco the nomes with him started to grin grimma shook a finger at him listen mister she snapped if i have to come down there and tell you what to do with the hand brake youll all be extremely sorry all right now stop giggling like that and get this thing moving quickly there was a click the cat howled again and started to move a cheer went up from the nomes right said grimma thats more like it the doors the doors the doors we didnt open the doors hummed dorcas diggers of course we didnt open the doors said grimma as the digger began to go faster we never open the doors what do we need to open the doors for this is the cat v there is nothing that can be in our way for this is the cat that laughs at barriers and purrs brrmbrrm from the book of nome cat iii v v it was an old shed it was a very rusty shed it was a shed that wobbled in high winds the only thing even vaguely new about it was the padlock on the door which the cat hit at about six miles an hour the rickety building rang like a gong leapt off its foundations and was dragged halfway across the quarry before it fell apart in a shower of rust and smoke the cat emerged like a very angry chick from a very old egg and then rolled to a stop grimma picked herself up from the plank and nervously started to pick bits of rust off herself weve stopped she said vaguely her ears still ringing why have we stopped dorcas he didnt bother to try to get up the thump of the cat hitting the door had knocked all the breath out of him diggers i think he said that everyone might have been flung about a little why did you want it to go so fast sorry sacco called up bit of a misunder standing there i think grimma pulled herself together well she said i got us out anyway ive got the hang of it now well just well just well dorcas heard her voice fade into silence he looked up there was a truck parked in front of the quarry and three humans were running toward the cat in big floating bounds oh dear he said didnt it read my note asked grimma im afraid it did said dorcas now we shouldnt panic weve got a choice we can ei ther go forward snapped grimma right now no no said dorcas weakly i wasnt going to suggest that first gear grimma commanded and lots of fast no you dont want to do that dorcas mur mured watch me said grimma i warned them they can read we know they can read if theyre really intelligent theyre intelligent enough to know bet ter the cat gathered speed terry pratchett you mustnt do this said dorcas weve al ways kept away from humans they dont keep away from us shouted grimma but they demolished the store they tried to stop us from escaping now theyre taking our quarry and they dont even know what we are said grimma re member the gardening department in the store those horrible garden ornament statues well im going to show them real nomes you cant beat humans shouted dorcas above the roar of the engine theyre too big youre too small they may be big said grimma and i may be small but im the one with the great big truck with teeth she leaned over the plank everyone hang on down there she shouted this may be rough it had dawned on the great slow creatures out side that something was wrong they stopped their lumbering charge and very slowly tried to dodge out of the way two of them managed to leap into the empty office as the cat bowled past i see said grimma they must think were stupid take a big left turn more more now stop okay she rubbed her hands together what are you going to do whispered dorcas terrified grimma leaned over the plank sacco she said you see those other levers diggers the pale round blobs of the humans faces ap peared at the dusty windows of the shed the cat was twenty feet away vibrating gently in the early morning mist then the engine roared the big front shovel came up catching the sun light the cat sprang forward bouncing across the quarry floor and taking out one wall of the shed like ripping the lid off a can the other walls and the roof folded up gently as if it were a house of cards with the ace of spades flipped away the digger careened around in a big circle so that when the two humans crawled out of the wreckage it was the first thing they saw throb bing with the big metal mouth poised to bite they ran they ran almost as fast as nomes ive always wanted to do that said grimma in a satisfied voice now where did the other human go back to the truck i think said dorcas weakly fine said grimma nowlots of right sacco stop now forward slowly can we sort of stop this and just go now please pleaded dorcas the humans truck is in the way said grimma reasonably enough theyve stopped right in the entrance then were trapped said dorcas tekry pratchett grimma laughed it wasnt a very amusing sound dorcas suddenly felt almost as sorry for the humans as he was feeling for himself the humans must have been having similar thoughts if humans had thoughts he could see their pale faces watching the cat lurch toward them theyre wondering why they cant see a human inside he thought they cant work it out heres this machine moving all by itself its a puzzler for humans they reached some sort of conclusion though he saw both truck doors fly open and the humans jump out just as the cat there was a crunch and the truck jerked as the cat hit it the knobby wheels spun for a moment and then the truck rolled backward clouds of steam poured out thats for nisodemus said grimma i thought you didnt like him said dorcas yes but he was a nome dorcas nodded they were all when you got right down to it nomes it was just as well to re member whose side you were on may i suggest you change gear he said qui etly why whats wrong with the one weve got youll be able to push better if you go down a gear trust me diggers humans were watching they were watching because a machine rolling around by itself is some thing that you do watch even if youve just had to climb a tree or hide behind a hedge they saw the cat roll backward change gear with a roar and attack the truck again the win dows shattered dorcas was really unhappy about this youre killing a truck he said dont be silly said grimma its a machine just bits of metal back hoe yes but someone made it said dorcas they must be very hard to make i hate destroying things that are hard to make they ran over nisodemus said grimma and when we used to live in a hole nomes were always being squashed by cars forward hey yes but nomes arent hard to make said dor cas hanging on grimly as they smashed into the truck again you just need other nomes back hoe youre weird forward hey the cat struck again one of the trucks head lights exploded dorcas winced then the truck was pushed clear smoke was bil lowing out from it now where fuel had spilled over the hot engine the cat backed off and rum bled around it the nomes were really getting the hang of him now right said grimma straight ahead she terry pratchett nudged dorcas well go and find this barn now shall we just go down the road and i think theres a gateway into the fields dorcas mumbled it had an actual gate in it he added i suppose it would be too much to ask you to let us open it first behind them the truck burst into flames not spectacularly but in a workmanlike way as if it were going to go on burning all day dorcas saw a human take off its coat and flap uselessly at the fire he felt quite sorry for it the cat rolled unopposed down the dirt road some of the nomes started to sing as they sweated over the ropes now then said grimma wheres this gate way through the gate and across the fields you said and its just before you get to the car with the flash ing lights on top said dorcas slowly the one thats just coming up the road they stared at it cars with lights on the top are bad news said grimma youre right there said dorcas theyre often full of humans who very seriously want to know whats going on there were lots of them down at the railroad grimma looked along the hedge this is the gateway coming up is it she said yes grimma leaned down diggers slow down and turn sharp right she said the teams swung into action sacco even changed gear without being asked nomes hung like spiders from the steering wheel hauling it around there was a gate in the gateway but it was old and held to the post with bits of string in proper agricultural fashion it wouldnt have stopped any thing very determined and it had no chance with the cat dorcas winced again the field on the other side was brown soil cor rugated earth the nomes called it after the corru gated cardboard you sometimes got in the packing department in the store there was snow between the furrows the big wheels churned it into mud dorcas was half expecting the car to follow them it stopped instead and two humans in dark blue suits got out and started to lumber across the field theres no stopping humans he thought glumly theyre like the weather the field ran gently uphill around the quarry the cats engine thudded there was a fence ahead with a grassy field be yond it the wire parted with a twang dorcas watched it roll back and wondered whether grimma would let him stop and collect a bit of it you always knew where you were with wire the humans were still following out of the cor ner of his eye because up here there was altogether terry pratchett too much outside to look at dorcas saw flashing lights on the highway far away he pointed them out to grimma i know she said ive seen them but what else could we have done she added desperately gone off and lived in the flowers like good little pixies i dont know said dorcas wearily im not sure about anything anymore another wire fence twanged there was shorter grass up here and the ground curved and then there was nothing but sky and the cat speeding up as the wheels bounced over the field at the top of the hill dorcas had never seen so much sky there was nothing around them just a bit of scrub in the dis tance and it was silent well not silent at all be cause of the cats roar but it looked like the kind of place that would be silent if diggers full of des perate nomes werent thundering across it some sheep ran out of the way theres the barn up ahead that stone building on the horiz grimma began then she said are you all right dorcas if i keep my eyes shut he whispered you look dreadful ifeel worse but youve been outside before grimma were the highest thing there is theres nothing higher than us for miles or what diggers ever you call those things if i open my eyes ill fall into the sky grimma leaned down to the perspiring drivers right just a bit she shouted thats it now all the fast you can hold on to the cat she shouted as the engine noise grew you know he cant fly the machine bumped up on a stony track that led in the general direction of the distant barn dorcas risked opening one eye hed never been to the barn was anyone certain there was food there or was it just a guess perhaps at least itd be warm but there was a flashing light near it coming toward them why wont they leave us alone shouted grimma stop the cat rolled to a halt the engine ticked over in the chilly air this must lead down to another highway said dorcas we cant go back said grimma no or forward no grimma drummed her fingers on the cats metal have you got any other ideas we could try going across the fields said dor cas where would that take us said grimma terry pratchett away from here for a start but we wouldnt know where we were going said grimma dorcas shrugged its either that or paint flow ers grimma tried to smile and those little wings wouldnt suit me she said whats going on up there sacco yelled up we ought to tell people grimma whispered everyone thinks were going to the barn she looked around the car was closer bumping heavily over the rough track the two humans were still coming the other way dont humans ever give up she said to herself she leaned over the edge of the plank some left sacco she said and then just go steadily the cat bounced off the track and rolled over the cold grass there was another wire fence in the far distance and a few more sheep we dont know where were going she thought the only important thing is to go masklin knew it this isnt our world perhaps we should have talked to humans she said aloud no you were right said dorcas in this world everything belongs to humans and we would belong to them too there wouldnt be any room for us to be us the fence came closer there was a road on the diggers other side not a dirt road but a proper road with black gravel on it right or left said grimma what do you think it doesnt matter said dorcas as the digger twanged through the fence well try going left then she said slow down sacco left a bit more more steady at that oh no there was another car in the distance it had flashing lights on the top dorcas risked a look behind them there was another flashing light there no he said what said grimma just a little while ago you asked if humans ever gave up he said they dont stop said grimma the teams trotted obediently across the cats floor the digger rolled gently to a halt again en gine ticking over this is it said dorcas are we at the barn yet a nome called up no said grimma not yet nearly dorcas made a face we might as well accept it now he said youll end up waving a stick with a star on it i just hope they dont force me to mend their shoes grimma looked thoughtful if we drove as hard as we could at that car coming toward us she began terry pratchett no said dorcas firmly it really wouldnt solve anything itd make me feel a lot better said grimma she looked around at the fields whys it gone all dark she said we cant have been running all day it was early morning when we started out doesnt time fly when youre enjoying your self said dorcas gloomily and i dont like milk much i dont mind doing their housework if i don have to drink milk but just look will you darkness was spreading across the fields it might be an ellipse said dorcas i read about them it all goes dark when the sun covers the moon and possibly vice versa he added doubtfully the car ahead of them squealed to a halt crashed backward across the road into a stone wall and came to an abrupt stop in the field by the road the sheep were running away it wasnt the ordinary panic of sheep ordi narily disturbed they had their heads down and were pounding across the ground with one aim in mind they were sheep who had decided that this was no time to waste energy panicking when it could be used for galloping away as fast as possible a loud and unpleasant humming noise filled the air my word dorcas said weakly theyre pretty darn terrifying these ellipses down below the diggers nomes were panicking they werent sheep they could all think for themselves and when you started to think hard about sudden darkness and mysterious humming noises panicking seemed a logical idea little lines of crawling blue fire crackled over the cats battered paintwork dorcas felt his hair standing on end grimma stared upward the sky was totally black its all right she said slowly do you know i think its all right dorcas looked at his hands sparks crackled off his fingertips it is is it was all he could think of that isnt night its a shadow theres some thing huge floating above us and thats better than night is it said dorcas i think so come on lets get off she shinned down the rope to the cats deck she was smiling madly that was almost as terrifying as everything else put together they werent used to grimma smiling give me a hand she said weve got to get down so he can be sure its us they looked at her in astonishment as she wres tled with the gangplank come ow she repeated help me cant you he who he said dorcas what he what do you mean terry pratchett him said grimma i know its him you peo plehelp me they helped sometimes when youre totally confused youll listen to anyone who seems to have any sort of aim in mind they grabbed the plank and shoved it out of the back of the cab until it tilted and swung down toward the road at least there wasnt so much sky now the blue was a thin line around the edge of the solid dark ness overhead not entirely solid when dorcass eyes grew used to it he could make out squares and rectangles and circles nomes scurried down the plank and milled around on the road below uncertain whether to run or stay above them one of the dark squares in the shadow moved aside there was a clank and then a rectangle of darkness whirred down very gently like an elevator without wires and landed softly on the road it was quite big there was something on it something in a pot something red and yellow and green the nomes craned forward to see what it was thus ended the journey of the cat and the nomes fled looking not behind from the book of nome stranger frogs i v i i dorcas clambered down awkwardly onto the cats oily deck it was empty now except for the bits of string and wood that the nomes had used theyve dropped things just any old way he thought listening to the distant chattering of the nomes its not right leaving litter poor old cat deserves more than this there was some sort of excitement going on out side but he didnt pay it much attention he bumbled around for a bit trying to coil up the string and push the wood into neat piles he pulled down the wires that had let the cat taste the electricity he got down on his hands and knees and tried to rub out the muddy footprints the cat made noises even with the engine stopped little pops and sizzles and the occasional ping terry pratchett it was going to sleep again sleeping was some thing cats did a lot of hed heard dorcas sat down and leaned against the yellow metal he didnt know what was going on it was so far outside anything hed ever seen before that his mind wasnt letting him worry about it perhaps that thing up there is just another ma chine he thought wearily a machine for making night come down suddenly he reached out and stroked the cat well done he said sacco and nooty found him sitting with his head against the cab wall staring vacantly at his feet everyones been looking for you sacco said its like an airplane without wings its just float ing there in the air so you must come and tell us what makes it go i say are you all right hmm are you all right said nooty you look rather odd dorcas nodded slowly just a bit worn out he said yes but you see we need you said sacco in sistently dorcas groaned and allowed himself to be helped to his feet he took a last look around the cab he really went didnt he he said he really went very well all things considered for his age he tried to give sacco a cheerful look what are you talking about said sacco all that time in that shed since the world was diggers made perhaps and i just greased him and fuelled him up and away he went said dorcas the machine oh yes well done said sacco but nooty pointed upward dorcas shrugged oh im not bothered about that he said its probably masklins doing perfectly simple expla nation grimma is right its probably that flying thing he went off to get but something has come out of it said nooty not masklin you mean its some kind of plant dorcas sighed always one thing after another he patted the cat again well i care he said he straightened up and turned to the others all right he said show me it was in a metal pot in the middle of the floating platform the nomes craned and tried to climb on one anothers shoulders to look at it and none of them knew what it was except for grimma who was staring at it with a strange quiet smile on her face it was a branch from a tree on the branch was a flower the size of a bucket if you climbed high enough you could see that held within its glistening petals was a pool of wa ter and from the depths of the pool little yellow frogs stared up at the nomes have you any idea what it is said sacco terry pratchett dorcas smiled masklins found out that its a good idea to send a girl flowers he said and i think everythings all right he glanced at grimma yes but what is it i seem to remember its called a bromeliad said dorcas it grows on the top of very tall trees in wet forests a long way away and little frogs spend their whole lives in it your whole life in one flower imagine that grimma once said she thought it was the most astonishing thing in the world sacco bit his lip thoughtfully well theres electricity he said electricity is quite astonishing or hydraulics said nooty taking his hand you told me hydraulics was fascinating masklin must have got it for her said dorcas ignoring them very literalminded lad that lad very active imagination he stared from the flower to the cat looking small and old under the humming shadow of the ship and felt suddenly quite cheerful he was still tired enough to go to sleep standing up but he felt his mind fizzing with ideas of course there were a lot of questions but right now the answers didnt matter it was enough just to enjoy the questions and know that the world was full of astonishing things and that he wasnt a frog or at least he was the kind of frog who was inter diggers ested in how flowers grew and whether you could get to other flowers if you jumped hard enough and just when youd got out of the flower and were feeling really proud of yourself youd look at the new big wide endless world around you and eventually youd notice that it had petals around the horizon dorcas grinned id very much like to know he said what masklin has been
