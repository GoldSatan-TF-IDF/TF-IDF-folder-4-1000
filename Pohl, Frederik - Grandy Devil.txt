grandy devil mahlon begat timothy and timothy begat nathan and nathan begat roger and the days of their years were long on the earth but then roger begat orville and orville was a heller he begat augustus wayne walter benjamin and carl who was my father and i guess that was going too far because that was when gideon upshur stepped in to take a hand i was kissing lucille in the parlor when the doorbell rang and she didnt take kindly to the interruption he was a big old man with a burnedbrown face he stamped the snow off his feet and stared at me out of crackling blue eyes and demanded orvie i said my name is george wipe the lipstick off your face george he said and walked right in lucille sat up in a hurry and began tucking the ends of her hair in place he looked at her once and calmly took off his coat and hung it over the back of a chair by the fire and sat down my name is upshur he said gideon upshur wheres orville dexter i had been thinking about throwing him out up until then but that made me stop thinking about it it was the first time anybody had come around looking for orville dexter in almost a year and we had just begun breathing easily again i said thats my grandfather mr upshur whats he done now he looked at me youre his grandson and you ask me what hes done he shook his head where is he i told him the truth we havent seen grandy orville in five years and you dont know where he is no i dont mr upshur he never tells anybody where hes going sometimes he doesnt even tell us after he comes back the old man pursed his lips he leaned forward across lucille and poured himself a drink from the scotch on the side table i swear he said in a high shrill old voice these dexters are a caution go home he was talking to lucille she looked at him sulkily and opened her mouth but i cut in this is my fiancee i said hah he said no doubt well theres nothing to do but have it out with orvie is the bed made up in the guest room i protested mr upshur it isnt that we arent glad to see any friend of grandys but lord knows when hell be home it might be tomorrow it might be six months from now or years ill wait he said over his shoulder climbing the stairs having him there wasnt so bad after the first couple of weeks i phoned uncle wayne about it and he sounded quite excited tall heavyset old man he asked very dark complexion thats the one i said he seemed to know his way around the house pretty well too well why wouldnt he uncle wayne didnt say anything for a second tell you what george you get your brothers together and i cant uncle wayne i said harolds in the army i dont know where williams got to he didnt say anything for another second well dont worry ill give you a call as soon as i get back are you going somewhere uncle wayne i wanted to know i certainly am george he said and hung up so there i was alone in the house with mr upshur thats the trouble with being the youngest lucille wouldnt come to the house any more either i went out to her place a couple of times but it was too cold to drive the jaguar and william had taken the big sedan with him when he left and lucille refused to go anywhere with me in the jeep so all we could do was sit in her parlor and her mother sat right there with us knitting and making little remarks about grandy orvie and that girl in eatontown so all in all i was pretty glad when the kitchen door opened and grandy orvie walked in grandy i cried im glad to see you theres a man hush george he said where is he upstairs he usually takes a nap after i bring him his dinner on a tray you take his dinner up whats the matter with the servants i coughed well grandy after that trouble in eatontown they never mind he said hastily go ahead with what youre doing i finished scraping the dishes into the garbagedisposer and stacked them in the washer while he sat there in his overcoat watching me george he said at last im an old man a very old man yes grandy i answered my grandfathers older than i am and his grandfather is older than that well sure i said reasonably i never met them did i grandy no george at least i dont believe theyve been home much these last few years grandy timothy was here in but i dont believe you were born yet come to think of it even your dad wasnt born by then dads sixty i told him im twentyone certainly you are george and your dad thinks a lot of you he mentioned you just a couple of months ago he said that you were getting to an age where you ought to be told about us dexters told what grandy orville i asked confound it george thats what im coming to cant you see that im trying to tell you something its hard to put into words thats all can i help said gideon upshur from the door grandy orville stood up straight and frosty ill thank you gideon upshur to stay the bedickens out of a family discussion its my family too young man said gideon upshur and thats why im here i warned cousin mahlon but he wouldnt listen i warned timothy but he ran off to americaand look what he started a mans got a right to pass on his name grandy orville said pridefully once yes i never said a man couldnt have a sonthough you know ive never had one orvie where would the world be if all of us had children three and four at a time the way you dexters have been doing four nowsixteen when the kids grow upsixtyfour when their kids grow up why in four or five hundred years thered be trillions of us orvie the whole world would be covered six layers deep with immortals squirming and fidgeting and i hush man howled grandy orville not in front of the boy gideon upshur stood up and yelled right back at him its time he found out im warning you orville dexter either you mend your ways or ill mend them for you i didnt come here to talk im prepared to take sterner measures if i have to why you reeking pustoon grandy orville started but then he caught sight of me out of here george go up to your room till i call you and as for you you old idiot im as prepared as you are if it comes to that i went it looked like trouble and i hated to leave grandy orville alone but orders were orders dad had taught me that the noises from the kitchen were terrible for a while but by and by they died down it was quiet for a long long time after a couple of hours i began to get worried and i went back downstairs quietly and pushed the kitchen door open a crack grandy orville was sitting at the kitchen table staring into space i didnt see mr upshur at all grandy orville looked up and said in a tired voice come in george i was just catching my breath where did mr upshur go i asked it was selfdefense he said quickly hed outlived his usefulness anyway i stared at him did something happen to mr upshur i asked he sighed george sometimes i think the old blood is running thin now dont bother me with any more questions right now till i rest up a bit orders were orders as i say i noticed that the garbagedisposal unit was whirring and i walked over to shut it off funny i said i forgot i left it running grandy orville said nervously dont give it a thought say george they havent installed sewer lines while i was away have they no they havent grandy i told him same old dry well and septic tank thats too bad he grumbled well i dont suppose it matters i wasnt listening too closely i had noticed that the floor was slick and shiny grandy i said you didnt have to mop the floor for me i can manage even if all the servants did quit when oh shut up about the servants he snapped testily george ive been thinking theres a lot that needs to be explained to you but this isnt the best time for it and maybe your dad ought to do the explaining he knows you better than i do frankly george i just dont know how to put things so youll understand didnt you ever notice that there was anything different about us dexters well were pretty rich i dont mean that for instance that time you were run over by the truck when you were a kid didnt that make you suspect anythinghow soon you mended i mean why i dont think so grandy i said thinking back dad told me that all the dexters always healed fast i bent down and looked under the table grandy orville was sitting at why that looks like old clothes down there isnt that the same kind of suit mr upshur was wearing grandy orville shrugged tiredly he left it for you he explained now dont ask me any more questions because ive got to go away for a while and im late now if your uncle wayne comes back tell him thanks for letting me know mr upshur was here ill give your regards to your dad if we happen to meet well that was last winter i wish grandy would come back so i could stop worrying about the problem he left me lucille never did get over her peeve so i married alice along about the middle of february id have liked having some of the family there at the wedding but none of them was in town just thenor since for that matterand it wasnt really necessary because i was of legal age i was happy with alice right from the start but even more important it explained what grandy and mr upshur had been trying to tell me about what us dexters are that is alice is a very attractive girl and a good housekeeper which is a good thingwe havent been able to get any of the servants back but thats good too in a way because it keeps her inside the house a lot its getting on toward nice weather though and im having a tough time keeping her away from the third terrace where the dry well and septic tank are and if she goes down there shes bound to hear the noises i dont know maybe the best thing i could do would be to roll the stone off the top of the septic tank and let whats struggling around in there come out but im afraid hes pretty mad
