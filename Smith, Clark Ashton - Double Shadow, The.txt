the double shadow clark ashton smith my name is pharpetron among those who have known me in poseidonis but even i the last and most forward pupil of the wise avyctes know not the name of that which i am fated to become ere tomorrow there fore by the ebbing silver lamps in my masters marble house above the loud everravening sea i write this tale with a hasty hand scrawling an ink of wizard virtue on the grey priceless antique parchment of dragons and having written i shall enclose the pages in a sealed cylinder of orichalchum and shall cast the cylinder from a high window into the sea lest that which i am doomed to become should haply destroy the writing and it may be that mariners from lephara passing to umb and pneor in their tall triremes will find the cylinder or fishers will draw it from the wave in their seines of byssus and having read my story men will learn the truth and take warning and no mans feet henceforward will approach the pale and demon haunted house of avyctes for six years i have dwelt apart with the aged master forgetting youth and its wonted desires in the study of arcanic things together we have delved more deeply than all others before us in an interdicted lore we have solved the keyless hieroglyphs that guard antehuman formulae we have talked with the prehis toric dead we have called up the dwellers in sealed crypts in fearful abysses beyond space few are the sons of mankind who have cared to seek us out among the desolate windworn crags and many but nameless are the visitants who have come to us from further bourns of place and time stern and white as a tomb older than the memory of the dead and built by men or devils beyond the recording of myth is the mansion in which we dwell far below on black naked reefs the northern sea climbs and roars indomitably or ebbs with a ceaseless murmur as of armies of baffled demons and the house is filled evermore like a hollowsounding sepulcher with the drear echo of its tumultuous voices and the winds wail in dismal wrath around the high towers but shake them not on the seaward side the man sion rises sheerly from the straightfalling cliff but on the other sides there are narrow terraces grown with dwarfish crooked cedars that bow always beneath the gale giant marble monsters guard the landward por tals and huge marble women ward the strait porticoes above the sea and mighty statues and mummies stand everywhere in the chambers and along the halls but saving these and the spirits we have summoned there is none to companion us and liches and shadows have been the servitors of our daily needs all men have heard the fame of avyctes the sole surviving pupil of that malygris who tyrannized in his necromancy over susran from a tower of sable stone malygris who lay dead for years while men believed him living who lying thus still uttered potent spells and dire oracles with decaying lips but avyctes lusted not for temporal power in the manner of maly gris and having learned all that the elder sorcerer could teach him withdrew from the cities of poseidonis to seek another and vaster dominion and i the youth pharpetron in the latter years of avyctes was per mitted to join him in this solitude and since then i have shared his austerities and vigils and evocations and now likewise i must share the weird doom that has come in answer to his summoning not without terror did i the neophyte behold at first the abhorrent and tre mendous faces of them that obeyed avyctes the genii of the sea and earth of the stars and the heavens who passed to and fro in his marmorean halls i shud dered at the black writhing of submundane things from the manyvolumed smoke of the braziers i cried in horror at the grey foulnesses colossal without form that crowded malignly about the drawn circle of seven colors threatening unspeakable trespass on us that stood at the center not without revulsion did i drink wine that was poured by cadavers and eat bread that was purveyed by phantoms but use and custom dulled the strangeness destroyed the fear and in time i believed implicitly that avyctes was the lord of all incantations and exorcisms with infallible power to dismiss the beings he evoked well had it had been for avyctes and for me if the master had contented himself with the lore pre served from atlantis and thule or brought over from mu and mayapan surely this should have been enough for in the ivorysheeted books of thule there were bloodwrit runes that would call the demons of the fifth and seventh planets if spoken aloud at the hour of their ascent and the sorcerers of mu had left record of a process whereby the doors of farfuture time could be unlocked and our fathers the atlanteans had known the road between the atoms and the path into far stars and had held speech with the spirits of the sun but avyctes thirsted for a darker knowledge a deeper empery and into his hands in the third year of my novitiate there came the mirrorbright tablet of the lost serpentpeople strange and apparently fortuitous was our finding of the tablet at certain hours when the tide had fallen from the steep rocks we were wont to descend by cavernhidden stairs to a cliffwalled crescent beach be hind the promontory on which stood the house of avyctes there on the dun wet sands beyond the foamy tongues of the surf would lie the worn and curious driftage of alien shores and trove that hur ricanes had cast up from unsounded deeps and there we had found the purple and sanguine volutes of great shells and rude lumps of ambergris and white flowers of perpetually blooming coral and once the barbaric idol of green brass that had been the figurehead of a galley from far hyperboreal isles there had been a great storm such as must have riven the sea to its nethermost profound but the tem pest had gone by with morning and the heavens were cloudless on that fatal day when we found the tablet and the demon winds were hushed among the high crags and chasms and the sea lisped with a low whisper like the rustle of gowns of samite trailed by fleeing maidens on the sand and just beyond the ebbing wave in a tangle of russet seaweed we beheld a thing that glittered with blinding sunlike brilliance and running forward i plucked it from the wrack before the waves return and bore it to avyctes the tablet was wrought of some nameless metal like neverrusting iron but heavier it had the form of a triangle and was broader at the widest than a mans heart on one side it was wholly blank and avyctes and i in turn beheld our features mirrored strangely like the drawn pallid features of the dead in its burnished surface on the other side many rows of small crooked ciphers were incised deeply in the metal as if by the action of some mordant acid and these ciphers were not the pictorial symbols or alpha betic characters of any language known to the master or to me of the tablets age and origin likewise we could form no conjecture and our erudition was altogether baffled for many days thereafter we studied the writing and held argument that came to no issue and night by night in a high chamber closed against the perennial winds we pondered over the dazzling triangle by the tall straight flames of silver lamps for avyctes deemed that knowledge of rare value was holden by the clueless crooked ciphers then since all our scholarship was in vain the master sought another divination and had recourse to wizardy and necromancy but at first among the devils and phantoms that answered our in terrogation none could tell us aught concerning the tablet and any other than avyctes would have despaired in the end and well would it have been if he had despaired and had sought no longer to decipher the writing the months and years went by with a slow thunder ing of seas on the dark rocks and a headlong clamor of winds around the white towers still we continued our delvings and evocations and further always fur ther we went into lampless realms of space and spirit learning perchance to unlock the hithermost of the manifold infinities and at whiles avyctes would resume his pondering of the seafound tablet or would question some visitant from other spheres of time and place regarding its interpretation at last by the use of a chance formula in idle experiment he summoned up the dim tenuous ghost of a sorcerer from prehistoric years and the ghost in a thin whisper of uncouth forgotten speech informed us that the letters on the tablet were those of a lan guage of the serpentmen whose primordial continent had sunk aeons before the lifting of hyperborea from the ooze but the ghost could tell us naught of their significance for even in his time the serpentpeople had become a dubious legend and their deep ante human lore and sorcery were things irretrievable by man now in all the books of conjuration owned by avyctes there was no spell whereby we could call the lost serpentmen from their fabulous epoch but there was an old lemurian formula recondite and uncertain by which the shadow of a dead man could be sent into years posterior to those of his own lifetime and could be recalled after an interim by the wizard and the shade being wholly insubstantial would suffer no harm from the temporal transition and would remem ber for the information of the wizard that which he had been instructed to learn during the journey so having catled again the ghost of the prehistoric sorcerer wnose name was ybith avyctes made a singular use of several very ardent gums and com bustible fragments of fossil wood and he and i reciting the responses to the formula sent the thin spirit of ybith into the far ages of the serpentmen and after a time which the master deemed sufficient we performed the curious rites of incantation that would recall ybith from his alienage and the rites were successful and ybith stood before us again like a blown vapor that is nigh to vanishing and in words that were faint as the last echo of perishing memories the specter told us the key to the meaning of the letters which he had learned in the primeval past and after this we questioned ybith no more but suffered him to return unto slumber and oblivion then knowing the import of the tiny twisted ciph ers we read the writing on the tablet and made thereof a transliteration though not without labor and difficulty since the very phonetics of the serpent tongue and the symbols and ideas expressed in the writing were somewhat alien to those of mankind and when we had mastered the inscription we found that it con tained the formula for a certain evocation which no doubt had been used by the serpent sorcerers but the object of the evocation was not named nor was there any clue to the nature or identity of that which would come in answer to the rites and moreover there was no corresponding rite of exorcism nor spell of dismissal great was the jubilation of avyctes deeming that we had learned a lore beyond the memory or pre vision of man and though i sought to dissuade him he resolved to employ the evocation arguing that our discovery was no chance thing but was fatefully pre destined from the beginning and he seemed to think lightly of the menace that might be brought upon us by the conjuration of things whose nativity and at tributes were wholly obscure for said avyctes i have called up in all the years of my sorcery no god or devil no demon or lich or shadow which i could not control and dismiss at will and i am loath to believe that any power or spirit beyond the subversion of my spells could have been summoned by a race of serpents whatever their skill in demonism and necro mancy so seeing that he was obstinate and aeknowledging him for my master in all ways i consented to aid avyctes in the experiment though not without dire misgivings and then we gathered together in the chamber of conjuration at the specified hour and configura tion of the stars the equivalents of sundry rare materials that the tablet had instructed us to use in the ritual of much that we did and of certain agents that we employed it were better not to tell nor shall i record the shrill sibilant words difficult for beings not born of serpents to articulate whose intonation formed a signal part of the ceremony toward the last we drew a triangle on the marble floor with the fresh blood of birds and avyctes stood at one angle and i at another and the gaunt umber mummy of an atlantean warrior whose name had been oigos was stationed at the third angle and standing thus avyctes and i held tapers of corpsetallow in our hands till the tapers had burned down between our fingers as into a socket and in the outstretched palms of the mummy of oigos as if in shallow thuribles talc and asbestos burned ignited by a strange fire whereof we knew the secret at one side we had traced on the floor an in frangible ellipse made by an endless linked repetition of the twelve unspeakable signs of oumor to which we could retire if the visitant should prove inimical or rebellious we waited while the polecircling stars went over as had been prescribed then when the tapers had gone out between our seared fingers and the talc and asbestos were wholly consumed in the mummys eaten palms avyctes uttered a single word whose sense was obscure to us and oigos being animated by sorcery and subject to our will repeated the word after a given interval in tones that were hollow as a tombborn echo and i in my turn also repeated it now in the chamber of evocation before beginning the ritual we had opened a small window giving upon the sea and had likewise left open a high door on the hall to landward lest that which came in answer to us should require a spatial mode of entrance and during the ceremony the sea became still and there was no wind and it seemed that all things were hushed in awful expectation of the nameless visitor but after all was done and the last word had been repeated by oigos and me we stood and waited vainly for a visible sign or other manifestation the lamps burned stilly in the midnight room and no shadows fell other than were cast by ourselves and oigos and by the great marble women along the walls and in the magic mirrors we had placed cunningly to reflect those that were otherwise unseen we beheld no breath or trace of any image at this after a reasonable interim avyctes was sorely disappointed deeming that the evocation had failed of its purpose and i having the same thought was secretly relieved and we questioned the mummy of oigos to learn if he had perceived in the room with such senses as are peculiar to the dead the sure token or doubtful proof of a presence undescried by us the living and the mummy gave a necromantic answer saying that there was nothing verily said avyctes it were useless to wait longer for surely in some way we have misunderstood the purport of the writing or have failed to duplicate the matters used in the evocation or the correct in tonement of the words or it may be that in the lapse of so many aeons the thing that was formerly wont to respond has long ceased to exist or has altered in its attributes so that the spell is now void and valueless to this i assented readily hoping that the matter was at an end so after erasing the bloodmarked triangle and the sacred ellipse of the linked signs of oumor and after dismissing oigos to his wonted place among other mummies we retired to sleep and in the days that followed we resumed our habitual studies but made no mention to each other of the strange triangular tablet or the vain formula even as before our days went on and the sea climbed and roared in white fury on the cliffs and the winds wailed by in their unseen sullen wrath bowing the dark cedars as witches are bowed by the breath of taaran god of evil almost in the marvel of new tests and cantraips i forgot the ineffectual conjuration and i deemed that avyctes had also forgotten it all things were as of yore to our sorcerous perception and there was naught to trouble us in our wisdom and power and serenity which we deemed secure above the sovereignty of kings reading the horoscopic stars we found no future ill in their as pect nor was any shadow of bale foreshown to us through geomancy or other modes of divination such as we employed and our familiars though grisly and dreadful to mortal gaze were wholly obedient to us the masters then on a clear summer afternoon we walked as was often our custom on the marble terrace behind the house in robes of oceanpurple we paced among the windy trees with their blown crooked shadows and there following us as we went to and fro i saw the blue shadow of avyctes and my own shadow on the marble and between them an adumbration that was not wrought by any of the cedars and i was greatly startled but spoke not of the matter to avyctes and observed the unknown shadow with covert care i saw that it followed closely the shadow of avyctes keeping ever the same distance and it fluttered not in the wind but moved with a flowing as of some heavy thick putrescent liquid and its color was not blue nor purple nor black nor any other hue to which mans eyes are habituated but a hue as of some unearthly purulence and its form was altogether monstrous hav ing a squat head and a long undulant body without similitude to beast or devil avyctes heeded not the shadow and still i feared to speak though i thought it an ill thing for the master to be companioned thus and i moved closer to him in order to detect by touch or other perception the invisible presence that had cast the adumbration but the air was void to sunward of the shadow and i found nothing opposite the sun nor in any oblique di rection though i searched closely knowing that certain beings cast their shadows thus after a while at the customary hour we returned by the coiling stairs and monsterflanked portals into the high house and i saw that the strange adumbration moved ever behind the shadow of avyctes falling horrible and unbroken on the steps and passing clearly separate and distinct amid the long umbrages of the towering monsters and in the dim halls beyond the sun where shadows should not have been i beheld with terror the distorted loathly blot having a pestilent unnamable hue that followed avyctes as if in lieu of his own extinguished shadow and all that day every where that we went at the table served by specters or in the mummywarded room of volumes and books the thing pursued avyctes clinging to him even as leprosy to the leper and still the master had perceived it not and still i forbore to warn him hoping that the visitant would withdraw in its own time going obscurely as it had come but at midnight when we sat together by the silver lamps pondering the bloodwrit runes of hyperborea i saw that the shadow had drawn closer to the shadow of avyctes towering behind his chair on the wall between the huge sculptured women and the mummies and the thing was a streaming ooze of charnel pollution a foulness beyond the black leprosies of hell and i could bear it no more and i cried out in my fear and loathing and informed the master of its presence beholding now the shadow avyctes considered it closesly and in silence and there was neither fear nor awe nor abhorrence in the deep graven wrinkles of his visage and he said to me at last this thing is a mystery beyond my lore but never in all the practice of my art has any shadow come to me unbidden and since all others of our evocations have found answer ere this i must deem that the shadow is a veritable entity or the sign of an entity that has come in belated response to the formula of thesorcerers which we thought powerless and void and i think it well that we should now repair to the chamber of conjuration and interrogate the shadow in such manner as we may to inquire its nativity and purpose we went forthwith into the chamber of conjuration and made such preparations as were both necessary and possible and when we were prepared to question it the unknown shadow had drawn closer still to the shadow of avyctes so that the clear space between the two was no wider than the thickness of a necromancers rod now in all ways that were feasible we interrogated the shadow speaking through our own lips and the lips of mummies and statues but there was no determin able answer and calling certain of the devils and phan toms that were our familiars we made question through the mouths of these but without result and all the while our magic mirrors were void of any reflection of a presence that might have cast the shadow and they that had been our spokesmen could detect nothing in the room and there was no spell it seemed that had power upon the visitant so avyctes became troubled and drawing on the floor with blood and ashes the ellipse of oumor wherein no demon nor spirit may intrude he retired to its center but still within the ellipse like a flowing taint of liquid corruption the shadow followed his shadow and the space between the two was no wider than the thickness of a wizards pen now on the face of avyctes horror had graven new wrinkles and his brow was beaded with a deathly sweat for he knew even as i that this was a thing beyond all laws and foreboding naught but disaster and evil and he cried to me in a shaken voice and said i have no knowledge of this thing nor its intention toward me and no power to stay its progress go forth and leave me now for i would not that any man should witness the defeat of my sorcery and the doom that may follow thereupon also it were well to de part while there is time lest you too should become the quarry of the shadow and be compelled to share its menace though terror had fastened upon my inmost soul i was loath to leave avyctes but i had sworn to obey his will at all times and in every respect and more over i knew myself doubly powerless against the adum bration since avyctes himself was impotent so bidding him farewell i went forth with trem bling limbs from the haunted chamber and peering back from the threshold i saw that the alien umbrage creeping like a noisome blotch on the floor had touched the shadow of avyctes and at that moment the master shrieked aloud like one in nightmare and his face was no longer the face of avyctes but was contorted and convulsed like that of some helpless madman who wrestles with an unseen incubus and i looked no more but fled along the dim outer hall and through the high portals giving upon the terrace a red moon ominous and gibbous had declined above the terrace and the crags and the shadows of the cedars were elongated in the moon and they wavered in the gale like the blown cloaks of enchanters and stooping against the gale i fled across the terrace toward the outer stairs that led to a steep path in the riven waste of rocks and chasms behind avyctes house i neared the terrace edge running with the speed of fear but i could not reach the topmost outer stair for at every step the marble flowed beneath me fleeing like a pale horizon before the seeker and though i raced and panted without pause i could draw no nearer to the terrace edge at length i desisted seeing that an unknown spell had altered the very space about the house of avyctes so that none could escape therefrom to landward so resigning myself in despair to whatever might befall i returned toward the house and climbing the white stairs in the low level beams of the cragcaught moon i saw a figure that awaited me in the portals and i knew by the trailing robe of seapurple but by no other token that the figure was avyctes for the face was no longer in its entirety the face of man but was become a loathly fluid amalgam of human features with a thing not to be identified on earth the transfiguration was ghastlier than death or the changes of decay and the face was already hued with the nameless corrupt and purulent color of the strange shadow and had taken on in respect to its outlines a partial likeness to the squat profile of the shadow the hands of the figure were not those of any terrene being and the shape beneath the robe had lengthened with a nauseous undulant pliancy and the face and fingers seemed to drip in the moon light with a deliquescent corruption and the pursuing umbrage like a thickly flowing blight had corroded and distorted the very shadow of avyctes which was now double in a manner not to be narrated here fain would i have cried or spoken aloud but horror had dried up the fount of speech and the thing that had been avyctes beckoned me in silence uttering no word from its living and putrescent lips and with eyes that were no longer eyes but had become an oozing abomination it peered steadily upon me and it clutched my shoulder closely with the soft leprosy of its fingers and led me halfswooning with revulsion along the hall and into that room where the mummy of oigos who had assisted us in the threefold incantation of the serpentmen was stationed with several of his fellows by the lamps which illumed the chamber burning with pale still perpetual flames i saw that the mummies stood erect along the wall in their exanimate repose each in his wonted place with his tall shadow beside him but the great gaunt shadow of oigos on the marble wall was companioned by an adumbration similar in all respects to the evil thing that had fol lowed the master and was now incorporate with him i remembered that oigos had performed his share of the ritual and had repeated an unknown stated word in turn after avyctes and so i knew that the horror had come to oigos in turn and would wreak itself upon the dead even as on the living for the foul anonymous thing that we had called in our presumption could manifest itself to mortal ken in no other way than this we had drawn it from unfathomable depths of tim and space using ignorantly a dire formula and the thing had come at its own chosen hour to stamp itself in abomination uttermost on the evocators since then the night has ebbed away and a second day has gone by like a sluggish ooze of horror i have seen the complete identification of the shadow with the flesh and the shadow of avyctes and also i have seen the slow encroachment of that other um brage mingling itself with the lank shadow and the sere bituminous body of oigos and turning them to a similitude of the thing which avyctes has become and i have heard the mummy cry out like a living man in great pain and fear as with the throes of a second dissolution at the impingement of the shadow and long since it has grown silent like the other horror and i know not its thoughts or its intent and verily i know not if the thing that has come to us be one or several nor if its avatar will rest complete with the three that summoned it forth into time or be extended to others but these things and much else i shall soon know for now in turn there is a shadow that follows mine drawing ever closer the air congeals and curdles with an unseen fear and they that were our familiars have fled from the mansion and the great marble women seem to tremble where they stand along the walls but the horror that was avyctes and the second horror that was oigos have left me not and neither do they tremble and with eyes that are not eyes they seem to brood and watch waiting till i too shall become as they and their stillness is more terrible than if they had rended me limb from limb and there are strange voices in the wind and alien roarings upon the sea and the walls quiver like a thin veil in the black breath of remote abysses knowing that the time is brief i have shut myself in the room of volumes and books and have written this account and i have taken the bright tri angular tablet whose solution was our undoing and have cast it from the window into the sea hoping that none will find it after us and now i must make an end and enclose this writing in the sealed cylinder of orichalchum and fling it forth to drift upon the wave for the space between my shadow and the shadow of the horror is straitened momently and the space is no wider than the thickness of a wizards pen
