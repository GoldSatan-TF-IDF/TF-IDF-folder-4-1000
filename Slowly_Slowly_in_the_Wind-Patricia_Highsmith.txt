at that moment skip realized how much he hated frosby his blood boiled with anger edward skip skipperton spent most of his life feeling angry it was his nature when he was a boy he had a bad temper now as a man he was impatient with people who were slow or stupid he often met such people in his work which was to give advice on managing companies he was good at his job he could see when people were doing something the wrong way and he told them in a loud clear voice how to do it better the company directors always followed his advice now skipperton was fiftytwo his wife had left him two years ago because she couldnt live with his bad temper she had met a quiet university teacher in boston ended her marriage with skip and married the teacher skip wanted very much to keep their daughter maggie who was then fifteen with the help of clever lawyers he succeeded a few months after he separated from his wife skip had a heart attack he was better again in six months but his doctor gave him some strong advice stop smoking and drinking now or youre a dead man skip and i think you should leave the world of business too youve got enough money why dont you buy a small farm and live quietly in the country so skip looked around and bought a small farm in maine with a comfortable farmhouse a little river the coldstream ran along the bottom of the garden and the house was called coldstream heights he found a local man andy humbert to live on the farm and work for him maggie was moved from her private school in new york to one in switzerland she would come home for the holidays skip did stop smoking and drinking when he decided to do something he always did it immediately there was work for him on the farm he helped andy to plant corn in the field behind the house he bought two sheep to keep the grass short and a pig which soon gave birth to twelve more there was only one thing that annoyed him his neighbour peter frosby owned the land next to his including the banks of the coldstream and the right to catch fish in it skip wanted to be able to fish a little he also wanted to feel that the part of the river which he could see from the house belonged to him but when he offered to buy the fishing rights he was told that frosby refused to sell skip did not give up easily the next week he telephoned frosby inviting him to his house for a drink frosby arrived in a new cadillac driven by a young man he introduced the young man as his son also called peter frosby was a rather small thin man with cold grey eyes the frosbys dont sell their land he said weve had the same land for nearly years and the rivers always been ours i cant understand why you want it id just like to do a little fishing in the summer said skip and i think youll agree that the price i offer isnt bad twenty thousand dollars for about metres of fishing rights you wont get such a good offer again in your lifetime im not interested in my lifetime frosby said with a little smile ive got a son here the son was a goodlooking boy with dark hair and strong shoulders taller than his father he sat there with his arms across his chest and appeared to share his fathers negative attitude still he smiled as they were leaving and said youve made this house look very nice mr skipperton skip was pleased he had tried hard to choose the most suitable furniture for the sitting room i see you like oldfashioned things said frosby that scarecrow in your field we havent seen one of those around here for many years im trying to grow corn out there skip said i think you need a scarecrow in a cornfield young peter was looking at a photograph of maggie which stood on the hall table pretty girl he said skip said nothing the meeting had failed skip wasnt used to failing he looked into frosbys cold grey eyes and said ive one more idea i could rent the land by the river for the rest of my life and then it goes to you or your son ill give you five thousand dollars a year i dont think so mr skipperton thank you for the drink and goodbye stupid man said skip to andy as the cadillac moved off but he smiled life was a game after all you won sometimes you lost sometimes it was early may the corn which they had planted was beginning to come up through the earth skip and andy had made a scarecrow from sticks joined together one stick for the body and head another for the arms and two more for the legs they had dressed it in an old coat and trousers that andy had found and had put an old hat of skips on its head the weeks passed and the corn grew high skip tried to think of ways to annoy frosby to force him to rent part of the river to him but he forgot about frosby when maggie came home for the summer holidays skip met her at the airport in new york and they drove up to maine skip thought she looked taller she was certainly more beautiful ive got a surprise for you at home skip said oh a horse perhaps skip had forgotten she was learning to ride no not a horse the surprise was a red toyota he had remembered at least that maggies school had taught her to drive she was very excited and threw her arms round skips neck oh father youre so sweet and youre looking very well skip and maggie went for a drive in the new car the next morning in the afternoon maggie asked her father if she could go fishing in the stream he had to tell her that she couldnt and he explained the reason well never mind there are a lot of other things to do maggie enjoyed going for walks reading and doing little jobs in the house skip was surprised one evening when maggie arrived home in her toyota carrying three fish he was afraid she had been fishing in the stream against his instructions where did you get those i met the boy who lives there we were both buying petrol and he introduced himself he said hed seen my photograph in your house then we had coffee together the frosby boy yes hes very nice perhaps its only the father whos not nice well pete said come and fish with me this afternoon so i did it was fun i dont please maggie i dont want you to mix with the frosbys maggie was surprised but said nothing the next day maggie said she wanted to go to the village to buy some shoes she was away for nearly three hours with a great effort skip didnt question her then on saturday morning maggie said there was a dance in the nearest town and she was going i can guess who youre going with skip said angrily im going alone i promise you girls dont need a boy to take them to dances now skip realized that he couldnt order her not to go to a dance but he knew the frosby boy would be there and he knew what was going to happen his daughter was falling in love with pete frosby maggie got home very late that night after skip had gone to bed at breakfast she looked fresh and happy i expect the frosby boy was at the dance said skip i dont know what youve got against him father i dont want you to fall in love with an uneducated country boy i sent you to a good school pete had three years at harvard university maggie stood up im almost eighteen father i dont want to be told who i can and cant see skip shouted at her theyre not our kind of people maggie left the room during the next week skip was in a terrible state in his business life he had always been able to force people to do what he wanted but he couldnt think of a way to do that with his daughter the following saturday evening maggie said she was going to a party it was at the house of a boy called wilmers who she had met at the dance by sunday morning maggie hadnt come home skip telephoned the wilmers house a boys voice said that maggie had left the party early was she alone no she was with pete frosby she left her car here skip felt the blood rush to his face his hand was shaking as he picked up the telephone to call the frosby house old frosby answered he said maggie was not there and his son was out at the moment what do you mean do you mean he was there earlier and he went out mr skipperton my son has his own ways his own room his own key his own life im not going to skip put the telephone down maggie was not home by sunday evening or monday morning skip didnt want to inform the police on tuesday there was a letter from maggie written from boston it said that she and pete had run away to be married you may think this is sudden but we do love each other and we know what were doing i didnt really want to go back to school please dont try to find me youll hear from me next week i was sorry to leave my nice new car love always maggie for two days skip didnt go out of the house and he ate almost nothing he felt threequarters dead andy was very worried about him when he needed to go to the village to buy some food he asked skip to go with him while andy did the shopping skip sat in the car looking at nothing but then a figure coming down the street caught his eye old frosby he hoped frosby wouldnt see him in the car but frosby did he didnt pause but he smiled his unpleasant little smile as he went past at that moment skip realized how much he hated frosby his blood boiled with anger and he felt much better he was himself again frosby must be punished he began to make a plan that evening skip suggested to andy that he should go away for the weekend and enjoy himself youve earned a holiday he said and gave him three hundred dollars andy left on saturday evening in the car skip then telephoned old frosby and said it was time they became friends he asked frosby to come to coldsteam heights again frosby was surprised but he agreed to come on sunday morning at about eleven for a talk he arrived in the cadillac alone skip acted quickly he had his heavy gun ready and as soon as frosby was inside the door he hit him on the head several times with the end of the gun until frosby was dead he then took off his clothes and tied an old cloth round the body he burned frosbys clothes in the fireplace and hid his watch and rings in a drawer then skip put one arm around frosbys body and pulled him out of the house and up the field to the scarecrow the corn had already been cut he pulled down the old scarecrow and took the clothes off the sticks he dressed frosby in the old coat and trousers tied a small cloth round his face and pushed the hat onto his head when he stood the scarecrow up again it looked almost the same as before as skip went back to the house he turned round many times to admire his work he had solved the problem of what to do with the body next he buried frosbys watch and rings under a big plant in the garden it was now half past twelve and he had to do something with the cadillac he drove it to some woods a few kilometres away and left it there after cleaning off all his fingerprints he hadnt seen anybody soon after he got home a woman telephoned from frosbys house his housekeeper skip guessed to ask if frosby was with him he told her that frosby and left his house at about twelve and he hadnt said where he was going he said the same thing to the policeman who came to see him in the evening and to maggie when she telephoned from boston he found it easy to lie about frosby andy arrived back the next morning monday he had already heard the story in the village and also knew that the police had found frosbys car not far away in the woods he didnt ask any questions in the next week skip spent a lot of time watching the scarecrow from his upstairs bedroom window he thought with pleasure of old frosbys body there drying slowly slowly in the wind after ten days the policeman came back with a detective they looked over skips house and land and they looked at his two guns they didnt find anything that evening maggie came to see him she and pete were at the frosby house it was hard for skip to believe she was married it had all happened so fast petes very worried and upset she said was mr frosby unhappy when he visited you skip laughed no very cheerful and pleased with the marriage are you going to live at the frosby house yes ill take some things back with me she seemed cold and sad which made skip unhappy i know whats in that scarecrow said andy one day do you what are you going to do about it skip asked nothing nothing andy answered with a smile perhaps you would like some money andy a little present for keeping quiet no sir andy said quietly im not that kind of man skip didnt understand he was used to men who liked money more and more of it andy was different he was a good man the leaves were falling from the trees and winter was coming the children in the area were getting ready to celebrate the evening of st october when people wore special clothes and had special things to eat and lit great fires outside and danced around them singing songs no one came to skips house that evening there was a party at the frosbys house he could hear the music in the distance he thought of his daughter dancing having a good time skip was lonely for the first time in his lite lonely he very much wanted a drink but he decided to keep his promise to himself at that moment he saw a spot of light moving outside the window he looked out there was a line of figures crossing his field carrying lights anger and fear rushed through him they were on his land they had no right and they were children he realized the figures were small he ran downstairs and out into the field what do you think youre doing he shouted get off my property the children didnt hear him they were singing a song were going to burn the scarecrow get off my land skip fell and hurt his knee now the children had heard him he was sure but they werent stopping they were going to reach the scarecrow before him he heard a cry they had got there there were more cries of terror mixed with pleasure perhaps their hands had touched the body skip made his way back to his house it was worse than the police every child was going to tell his parents what he had found skip knew he had reached the end he had seen a lot of men in business reach the end he had known men who had jumped out of windows skip went straight to his gun he put the end in his mouth and fired when the children came running back across the field to the road skip was dead andy heard the shot from his room over the garage he had also seen the children crossing the field and heard skip shouting he understood what had happened he began walking towards the house he would have to call the police andy decided to say that he didnt know anything about the body in the scarecrows clothes he had been away that weekend after all the end
