mike resnick working stiff im the best bus driver on the downtown line and damned proud of it i take the wide turn around east elm street trickiest comer on my whole route feeling the tires slide across a patch of earlymorning slush and then skid to a stop right in front of the station twelve midnight right on schedule ive always been a good schedule driver and no ones got quicker reflexes theres still one passenger aboard i open the door and the bitter cold air whisks down the aisle winter in upstate new york comes in hard and fast off lake ontario sometimes it hits as early as september and sticks around till may not exactly the kind of weather i grew up with back on the island but i always hated tropical heat i turn around and this guy is still sitting on his duff end of the line mister i announce the guy walks up slowly from the rear then sits in that first seat opposite me hes a short chunky guy glasses neatly trimmed beard shirt and tie under a fancy overcoat nice boots not the kind of guy youd normally see on my line so ive got a pretty good idea as to whats coming next by now i can sense when one of these jokers has come looking for a story mind if we have a chat he says sweet as pie im from new york silver screen magazine i shrug why not i crawl out of the drivers seat and the two of us walk through the gathering snow into the bus terminal wait here i tell him he sits on a bench in front of the tall plexiglas windows facing south avenue and i go to the supervisors station to clock off my shift halfexpecting him not to be there when i get back some of them dont wait some of them the brighter ones can tell right off theyre not going to get the story they came hunting for not this guy though hes still waiting he gives me a fake smile and says hows about i buy you some breakfast thanks but no thanks i answer i got some errands to run youre welcome to tag along i turn my back on him and head for the street he follows you know youre not exactly what i expected he says thoughtfully i sigh you mean im not as big as you expected he nods right thats the first thing that strikes most of them im pretty big but they always expect bigger much bigger we step outdoors into the cold black morning i start walking i walk everywhere or take the bus im too large to fit comfortably in a car i tried a sleek little mazda rx once three years old miles drove like a dream but it always felt like i was about to swallow my knees i figure the windchill has dropped the temperature to three or four degrees below zero maybe i can shake this guy yet after all he doesnt have a fur coat me i live in mine why only one film he says i grimace these journalists are so predictable theyll ask one question maybe two about me and then inevitably theyll ask about her dont you miss her what did she mean to you what do you remember most about her do you still talk to her so i state the obvious theres not a lot of opportunity for a guy like me in hollywood im not exactly your typical leading man you know we walk into this tavern on alexander street brush off the snow and sleet and take a couple of stools at the bar vinnie the bartender comes right over what can i do for you boys i pull a wad of bills out of my jacket pocket and start peeling off twenties whats the line on the bengals and the jets vinnie looks at my friend hes okay i tell him whats his name i dont know whats your name the guy looks ill at ease i cant say as i blame him parker granwell he says extending his hand to vinnie its a pleasure to meet you sir vinnie snickers hes got this kind of wheezing emphysema laugh he was shot in the ribs a few years back the bullet left him with an air leak and a limp as if hes got a permanent stitch in his side whered you find this nerd he found me i answer whats the line minus two says vinnie underover i ask thirtyeight what about the dolphins and the bills miami plus sixandahalf fortytwo ill take the dolphs and over for a hundred and the bengals and under for forty no make it sixty vinnie takes my money what about the nerd care to place a wager ill pass says parker fidgeting on his bar stool vinnie chuckles pleasure to meet you mr parker granwell sir he makes it sound like a title and limps into the back room i nod toward the door lets go we enter the storm again granwell seems like a decent enough guy and i figure i might as well give him what he wants so as we walk i talk about the good old days the days of mary pickford and doug fairbanks and scott fitzgerald the days of gable harlow and cagney the glory days of universal paramount warner brothers mgm and of course rko the days before the screen actors guild destroyed something so pure and simple as the studio contract i even throw in some trite quotable stuff about willis obriens brilliant animation and max steiners underappreciated musical score and merian coopers genius what the hell it was all true i just never cared anyway granwell nods and takes some notes and throws in a yeahuhhuh okay every now and again and when its all over he tucks his notebook in his coat pocket and frowns the snow gathering in his neat beard i do believe that is the longest line of bullshit i have ever heard he says ive had a lot of practice i reply without missing a beat i want the truth hes right of course about the bullshit but hes wrong about the truth he doesnt really want it none of them ever do we stop at the cork screw a liquor store about the size of a meat freezer over on chestnut street max closes at midnight but hes always in the back room till around two or three counting receipts punching figures into his adding machine and drinking away his profits i like max weve spent many an evening together talking football and getting drunk hes one of the few people in the world who has never seen the movie and has no desire to i rap on the back door max opens up and asks me in sorry maxy i greet him i cant stay tonight i got company i cant get rid of max peeks out the door and shows the barrelend of his remington twelvegauge ill bet i can get rid of your company for you i see granwell go a little pale this is more than he bargained for he was probably looking for an easy piece of backpage fluff not a tour of the inner city in subzero weather complete with gangsters and sawedoff shotguns thats all right maxy hes okay you got any overstock tonight i peel off another twenty and as usual max wont take it he hands me a bottle of canadian club not my favorite but well worth the price and granwell and i make our way down chestnut through the windy spray of sleet and snow to the trucking warehouse where i rent my living space i push through the heavy doors click on the overhead light bulb and invite him in what the hell im always hoping that one of these guys one of these days will print the truth the truth your king lives in a warehouse surrounded by banana crates and sleeps on two kingsize mattresses thrown on top of a concrete floor your king is a busdriver who gambles and drinks away his paycheck your king never wanted his goddamned crown and if he regrets one thing in his life its that he took the role that made him king that he died onscreen for the love of a flatchested wigwearing blonde and that the world cant forget about it and neither can he suddenly the canadian club doesnt appeal to me i need a beer i open my fridge crack open a bud and offer one to granwell much to my surprise he accepts you know he says minor has it that your movie saved rko they were ready to file for bankruptcy when yeah its true but lets get one thing straight its not my movie without you there is no movie he sits on a banana crate and sips his bud in the american film institute honored it as one of the favorite american films of all time there was even a reception at the white house you got guts parker granwell i say guzzling my beer and crushing the can you want honesty i like being a bus driver i like to gamble and i like to drink i like my friends and my life why not let it go at that i dont get it why did you leave the island if you didnt want to be king i cant help but laugh at that one how could i have known back in what i was getting myself into i was just a big kid so i tell him the truth just like i tell all the others i hated that damned island the heat the gigantic insects the carnivorous spiders snakes a mile long vultures the size of airplanes the tyrannosaurus always hunting me i had to fight the pterodactyls and pteranodons for every scrap of food i was allergic to more plantlife on that goddamned island than you can find on this whole fucking continent and the natives were the worst of the lot theyd sacrifice virgins to me one minute and chuck spears at me the next how long do you think i could have survived in that environment i take a deep breath and continue i needed a change and quick but the problem was getting off the island i couldnt swim still cant anyway i hear through the grapevine that this guy merian cooper is vacationing on the island and hes putting together this film in the states and it just so happens he needs an ape so i go looking for him once he calms down he gives me this mock screen test and he likes what he sees the rest is history how did you get so small i mean you were huge forty fifty feet tall at least i shrug go to the fridge crack open another bud that ones a mystery to me i admit but i have a theory i think the universe has to be in a kind of balance over the years as the myth grew bigger i got smaller its as if theres not enough room for both of us in this world it can accommodate either me or the myth and the myth is a hell of a lot stronger than i am granwell looks like hes mulling it over then apparently decides to let it go id like to read you something he says its an open letter from let me guess i interrupt because while i have never read his writing i can read granwell himself like a book its from the one true love of my life its from the introduction to her autobiography he answers missing my finely wrought sarcasm it reads something like this i wonder whether you know how strong a force you have been to me for more than half a century you have been the most dominant figure in my public life to speak of me is to think of you you have accumulated so much affection over all the years that no one wants to kill you what the whole world wants is to save you i pick up the remote click on the television set and flip to espn speed week damn i was hoping for a college football game dont her words mean anything to you asks granwell dont you ever think of her dont you have anything you want to say to her so at last parker granwell comes clean i mute the tv and shoot him my most fetal expression curling my lips and showing my fangs but to be perfectly honest there isnt much in me to be afraid of anymore i set down my beer do you think youre the only brighteyed reporter who has ever bothered to track me down granwell i say hell its been sixty years since i made that flick you all come looking for the same thing you want to find this gigantic forlorn ape pining after the woman of his dreams the woman whose heart he could never capture because hes nothing but a savage beast and none of you can bear the fact that it just isnt so i pause long enough to stifle a growl deep in my chest the truth is im not a savage beast and never was i never loved that screeching bitch i never even liked her in fact i could barely tolerate her i was acting plain and simple she used to give me migraine headaches on the set like you wouldnt believe cooper hired her for her piercing scream which as far as i can tell was her only talent and she made up for her inadequacies by burrowing into the hollywood social scene like some pathetic maggot who was cary grant dating and was hepburn as good an actress as everybody said and was fitzgerald going to be at this party or at that one christ she made me want to puke instead i belch which suits me and my mood just fine granwell just sort of shakes his head i can see it in his eyes this wont do at all hes thinking hes already put his notebook away he says paul johnson wrote an appreciation of you in the new statesman back in the sixties it was brilliant he called you a creature of intelligible rage nobility pathos he called you a prehistoric lear and he was right you know youre americas only king they all come to this realization sooner or later elvis wont cut it because of the drugs and some of the ugly things he did and stood for which just wont go away and theyve learned too much about kennedy and the world is too hard and cold and jaded now to come up with anything better america may be a land of riches and excess and even selfmade royalty but it is not a land of monarchs no theres only one king me the ape im sorry i dont live up to your expectations granwell sighs so if we just leave you alone if we let you pass your time quietly here on earth we can take comfort in knowing that your myth will survive i nod dont sweat it parker most people have already forgotten about me im out of the loop man all the golden anniversary celebrations for that stupid movie i didnt get a single engraved invitation not one de laurentis never called to consult with me about the remake i didnt even get an invite to that white house thing back in but she was there kissing up to jimmy and rosalyn carter this time i cant hold back the growl she wouldnt have missed it for the world dont you think youre being a little tough on her she was one of the most popular actresses of her day worked with every major male lead in the business and then to be frank you ruined her after your film the monstermovie offers came pouring in and nobody would give her the serious roles she deserved granwells no different than the rest of them by the time they finish talking to me they wish they never found me and so do i look man im just a gorilla i dont share your sense of tragedy granwell sets his beer down slides off the banana crate and walks to the door thanks for the chat i call after him if you want to make an old ape happy before he dies print the truth you will never die he says and walks out touche suddenly i could use some canadian club i pour myself a tall one drop down on my mattresses and start flipping through the channels i pull the covers up to my chin and listen to the fierce wind howling through the empty lot behind the warehouse ive got a chill i cant get rid of regardless of the temperature some nights are colder than others fiftyseven channels and theres nothing on yet on any given night if i can keep my eyes propped open long enough to catch the late shows if i dont pass out from the booze or the beer or the boredom chances are sooner or later ill come across my favorite film
