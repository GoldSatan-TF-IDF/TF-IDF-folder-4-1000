chapter one a horse called silver blaze i must go down there watson i must said sherlock holmes at the breakfast table on thursday morning go go where i asked to dartmoor to kings pyland ah so thats it i said well everybody in the country is talking about the case at kings pyland i always know when holmes is interested in a case he reads all the newspapers he walks up and down up and down the room and does not speak for hours he did all those things yesterday he did not answer any of my questions but i knew that it was the mystery at kings pyland the morning newspapers were on the breakfast table what is happening at kings pyland where is silver blaze they asked who killed john straker what are the police doing can they find the horse before the big race next week silver blaze was a famous racehorse and john straker was his trainer one of the biggest horse races of the year the wessex cup was next week and silver blaze was the favourite to win but on monday night at kings pyland two things happened someone killed john straker and silver blaze disappeared i was interested in this case too do you need my help holmes i asked i would very much like to come with you my dear watson said holmes of course you must come with me we can catch the twelve oclock from paddington and talk about the case on the train two hours later we were on the train to tavistock we read all the midday newspapers but there was nothing new in them so watson what do you think about this case well the newspapers say ah yes the newspapers understand nothing one day they say one thing the next day they say another but we must look at the case more carefully what did happen on monday night at kings pyland and what did not happen thats an important question too do the police have any answers i asked no said holmes on wednesday morning i had two letters one was from mr ross the owner of the horse and the other was from the dartmoor police an inspector gregory they ask for my help wednesday morning i cried but this is thursday morning why didnt you go down yesterday because it was an easy case you cant hide a famous horse for long i thought where can you hide a horse on dartmoor there are no buildings no trees but i was wrong watson the case is now two days old and nobody can find the horse or strakers killer so here we are on the train to tavistock and what do you think about it all i said well watson lets look at the case first we have a racehorse silver blaze only five years old but already a winner in many big races his owner mr ross is a happy man and rich the racegoers are happy too silver blaze nearly always wins his races and so people put big bets on him to win and when the favourite wins the race a lot of people make money on their bets but what happens when the favourite doesnt win watson what then a lot of people lose their money of course i said and people with big bets on a different horse can make much more money when that other horse wins right watson so perhaps some people are very interested in silver blaze not running in the wessex cup of course mr ross and his trainer john straker know that and they watch the horse very carefully now lets look at the people and the place the trainer john straker a good man and wonderful with horses worked for mr ross for twelve years there are four horses in the training stables and three boys working for straker one of them sits up all night with the horses and the other two sleep in a room over the stables we know nothing bad about any of the boys straker has a wife no children and lives i mean lived in a house about two hundred metres from the stables the town of tavistock is two kilometres to the west and about two kilometres to the east there is capleton another training stables the owner there is lord backwater and the trainer is silas brown there are no other houses just the hills of dartmoor i listened carefully i wanted to remember it all because holmes does not like to say anything twice now he said what happened on monday night these papers came with inspector gregorys letter the best thing is for you to read them watson then tell me what you think i took the papers from him and began to read chapter two monday night at kinds pyland notes by inspector gregory after talking to edith baxter ned hunter mrs john straker and mr fitzroy simpson on monday evening straker locked the stables at nine oclock the usual time two of the boys then walked up to the trainers house for their dinner but the third boy ned hunter stayed in the stables to watch the horses at five past nine the strakers servant a girl called edith baxter carried ned hunters dinner down to the stables the dinner that night was a hot meat curry edith was nearly at the stables when a man called out to her he came up to her and she saw a tall man in a grey suit and a hat and a red and black scarf he carried a big walking stick and edith felt afraid of him where am i the man asked what is this place this is kings pyland training stables she said good said the man now a stable boy sleeps here every night is that right and i think youre taking his dinner to him now he took an envelope out of his pocket please give the boy this and you can have some money for a beautiful new dress edith did not take the envelope she ran past the man to the stables and up to a small open window she always put the boys dinner through this window and ned hunter was there ready to take it oh ned edith cried but before she could say any more the stranger came up behind her good evening he said through the window to the boy i want to talk to you who are you what do you want ned hunter said i want to make you rich boy the stranger said you help me and i help you you have two horses in for the wessex cup silver blaze and bayard i hear that bayard is the better horse and that you stable boys are putting your bets on him to win am i right im not saying anything cried ned hunter we dont talk about our horses at kings pyland so get out im getting the dog now ned ran across the stables to get the dog and edith began to run back to the house but she looked back after about thirty metres and saw the man at the little window with his head and one arm inside the room edith ran on and a minute later ned came out of the building and locked the door behind him he ran all round the stables with the dog but the man was gone ned hunter told the trainer and the other boys about the stranger but no one saw him again the next thing happened at one oclock in the morning when john straker got out of bed whats the matter said his wife where are you going to the stables straker said i cant stop thinking about that stranger i just want to have a look around but its raining wait until the rain stops she said no no straker said i want to go now he left the house and mrs straker went back to sleep at seven in the morning she woke up but her husband was not there she quickly got up called the servant edith and they ran down to the stables they found the stables unlocked straker was not there and inside on a chair ned hunter slept like a dead man silver blaze was gone and his stable door was open they called the other two boys from the room over the stables they were good sleepers and heard nothing in the night nobody could wake ned hunter so the two women and the boys ran out to look for the trainer and the horse five hundred metres from the stables they saw strakers coat on a small tree down the hill just past the tree they found the trainer he was dead there was a long cut in his leg and his head was broken in three places in his right hand he had a small knife with blood all over it and in his left hand he had a red and black scarf edith baxter knew the scarf at once and later so did ned hunter its the strangers scarf he told us when i went to get the dog that stranger was still at the stable window he put something in my meat curry to make me sleep know he did edith saw him with his arm through the window ned hunter was right about his meat curry there was some of his dinner left and we found a lot of opium in it thats why ned slept like a dead man what about the horse we found his tracks in the mud next to strakers dead body but what happened then someone hit straker on the head and killed him did that person take the horse away did the horse run away everybody on dartmoor is looking for silver blaze but there is no news of him when i began work on the case on tuesday we looked for the stranger he was in tavistock and we found him easily his name is fitzroy simpson he lives mostly in london and makes his money at the races taking bets we looked in his bettingbook and found a number of big bets five thousand pounds against the favourite for the wessex cup these were his answers to my questions why did you come down to dartmoor im a betting man inspector i need to know about the horses for the wessex cup silver blaze bayard and desborough the horse at silas browns stables hes the second favourite for the race you see did you go to the kings pyland stables late on monday evening yes i did i just wanted to ask the stable boys some questions they know the horses better than anyone and is this your scarf yes yes it is and how did it get into the dead mans hand mr simpson can you tell us that i dont know inspector i dont know i never saw the man i lost my scarf in the dark it wasnt me inspector it wasnt me we asked many more questions but fitzroy simpson did not change his story he was out at kings pyland that night his suit was still wet from the rain and his big walking stick could break a mans head open but there were no cuts on his body so where did the blood on strakers knife come from and where is the horse chapter three john strollers pockets mmm very interesting i said i gave the papers back to holmes and he put them away so watson what can you tell me he asked i thought for a minute this cut on strakers leg perhaps he did it with his own knife when something hits you very hard on the head and you have a knife in your hand it can happen you know very good watson and thats bad news for fitzroy simpson so did simpson do it do you think i said perhaps said holmes lets look at it simpson puts opium in the boys dinner he goes away and comes back later in the night he gets into the stables takes the horse out and leaves but the trainer arrives at that moment sees him and follows him the two men fight and simpson breaks strakers head open with his stick then simpson takes the horse but where or did the horse run away is it still out on the moor and how did simpson get into the locked stables i dont know watson i dont know we must wait and see when we arrived at tavistock station two men came to meet us inspector gregory was a tall slowmoving man with blue eyes and mr ross was small and quick he was the first to speak very pleased to see you mr holmes the inspector here is working hard but we need help we must find poor strakers killer and i want to find my horse is there any news asked holmes lets talk on the way the inspector said id like you to see everything in the daylight we were soon out of the little town and up on the brown hills of the moor inspector gregory thought that the killer was fitzroy simpson simpson was out in the rain that night his suit was still wet on the tuesday he said he had a big stick and his scarf was in the dead mans hand that looks bad mr holmes very bad holmes smiled you need more than that inspector the servant edith spoke of an envelope did simpson say anything about that yes he said it had money in it a tenpound note for the stable boy what about this other training stables at capleton asked holmes does simpson have friends there no we dont think so we went to capleton of course their horse desborough is the second favourite for the wessex cup and silas brown the trainer was not friendly with straker but we found nothing when we arrived at kings pyland inspector gregory took us into the trainers house strakers body is upstairs he said but we have here the things from his pockets and from the ground next to his body would you like to see them mr holmes very much said holmes we went into the front room and the inspector opened a box and put things on a table there was a box of matches a small piece of candle some money a watch some papers and a small thin knife this is a strange knife holmes said he looked at it carefully and then gave it to me what is it watson its an eye knife i said doctors use these when they cut into an eye you dont usually see them outside a hospital mm said holmes so why did straker take this knife its no good for fighting his wife says it was in the bedroom for some days said inspector gregory perhaps he just took it because it was there on the table perhaps said holmes what about these papers one is a letter from mr ross the others are bills the inspector said three of them are bills for the horses food and this one is a bill from a dressmaker in london for a mr william darbyshire he was a friend of strakers his wife tells us his letters sometimes came here and straker sent them on mrs william darbyshire is an expensive lady said holmes looking at the bill twentyfive pounds is a lot of money for just one dress and one hat he put the bill down and moved to the window inspector can we go out on the moor now before the light begins to go we left the room and at the front door we saw a woman she came up to inspector gregory and put her hand on his arm is there any news she said no mrs straker but here is mr holmes the famous detective from london we have him to help us now i think i met you a month or two ago mrs straker said holmes let me see yes it was in plymouth at a gardenparty do you remember no sir that wasnt me but i remember so well you had a blue dress and a dark blue hat with white flowers on it i dont have a hat with flowers on it sir mrs straker said well well i am wrong then i am so sorry and with that holmes followed the inspector outside the four of us then walked past the stables and up onto the moor after ten minutes inspector gregory stopped here we are he said strakers body was just down there his coat was here on this small tree on the tree not on the ground holmes asked oh no it was on the tree carefully away from the mud on the ground mmm interesting said holmes now i must look at the mud down there ah said inspector gregory and to help you i have here in this bag one of strakers shoes one of fitzroy simpsons shoes and one of silver blazes horseshoes my dear inspector well done holmes was very pleased you think of everything for some minutes holmes looked carefully at the ground his eyes only centimetres away from the mud hello he said suddenly whats this from out of the mud he took a match or a small piece of one now why didnt i find that said the inspector i knew it was there you see said holmes you knew but how could you know that holmes smiled but did not answer he then took the shoes got down on the ground and began to look at all the tracks in the mud we stood and watched him but after five minutes mr ross looked at his watch er this is very interesting mr holmes he said but is it going to take a long time no said holmes he got to his feet i dont need to do any more here watson and i are going to take a little walk across the moor now with the horseshoe mr ross looked at the inspector can we go back to the house and talk i must take silver blazes name out of the wessex cup race and do it today i think dont do that cried holmes no no you must leave the horses name in for the race but mr ross began then he laughed a little angrily well thank you mr holmes thank you for your help see you later then at the house and he and the inspector walked away chapter four looking for a horse holmes and i walked slowly across the moor in the evening sunlight the autumn colours on the hills were beautiful reds and browns and yellows but holmes saw nothing of that so watson he said lets forget john straker for a minute and think about the horse horses are friendly animals lets say that silver blaze runs away after the killing here he is out on the cold wet moor what does he do next he looks for a nice warm stable i said with food and water right watson he didnt go back to kings pyland we know that but there is another stable not far away at capleton perhaps he went there and the way to capleton watson is down this hill lets go we walked quickly down the hill and at the bottom we found a small river and some very wet ground wonderful said holmes i wanted mud and here it is you follow the left side of the river watson were looking for the tracks of horseshoes we found them after only fifty metres holmes took the horseshoe out of his pocket and put it next to the tracks yes thats silver blaze no question about it we followed the tracks easily then lost them for a time but found them again about two hundred metres from the capleton stables here they are i cried and look theres another track here of a mans shoe holmes got down to look youre right watson and the man is walking next to the horse we followed the two tracks to capleton stables and were still twenty metres away when a man came out and called to us he had a red angry face go away we dont want visitors here go away mr silas brown holmes said to him what do you want said the man i dont talk to newspaper people so just go away we are not from a newspaper said holmes smiling but you have a horse called silver blaze in your stable thats not true mr brown said angrily shall we go in and talk about it said holmes he did not wait for an answer but took the mans arm and moved quickly to the gate he looked back at me and said quietly wait for me here watson twenty minutes later they came out again holmes looked pleased and mr silas brown was a different man he looked smaller and older and his face was afraid remember said holmes you must be there on the day on time and everything must be ready yes yes silas brown said quickly you can be sure of it oh yes you can be sure of it good said holmes well goodbye for now holmes and i then began to walk back to kings pyland along the road does he have the horse then i asked holmes laughed yes he said no at first of course but hes afraid of the police he doesnt want them to know about this and i can help him with that but why didnt the police find the horse i asked inspector gregory said they went to capleton oh its easy to change the colour of a horses coat holmes laughed again gregory is a good policeman but i dont think he knows much about horses and why did brown tell you i said when i walked through the stables with him said holmes the ground was muddy and i saw the tracks of his shoes in the mud you remember those tracks on the moor well these were the same shoes after that it was easy and he told me everything he found silver blaze on the moor early in the morning and brought him into the stables the horse is very well just a different colour at the moment brown put a very big bet on desborough to win the wessex cup you see and with silver blaze out of the race but why did you leave the horse there is it safe with him i did not understand holmess plan my dear watson holmes said the horse is very safe silas brown is afraid of me afraid of the police afraid of losing everything silver blaze must be ready to race next week or browns life as a racehorse trainer is finished and brown knows that mr ross isnt going to like it i said mr ross said holmes doesnt understand detective work he wants answers today now at once so he must learn a lesson he must learn to wait say nothing about silver blaze for the moment watson back at kings pyland we found mr ross and inspector gregory in the trainers house an interesting visit said holmes but my friend and i must go back to london by the midnight train the inspector and mr ross stared at him and i saw that holmes was right about mr ross so our famous london detective cant find poor strakers killer mr ross said or my horse its a difficult case thats true said holmes quietly but your horse is going to run in the wessex cup next tuesday you have my promise on that hm a promise is a wonderful thing said mr ross but i would like the horse better than a promise holmes smiled then turned to inspector gregory inspector can you give me a photograph of straker yes of course said the inspector he took one from an envelope in his pocket and gave it to holmes it was now time to go back to tavistock and we went outside one of the stable boys was there and holmes suddenly spoke to him i see you have some sheep here next to the stables he said are they all well theyre all right sir said the boy but two or three of them are a little lame they went lame last week holmes was very pleased about this he got into the carriage and said to the inspector remember the lame sheep gregory remember the lame sheep mr ross was not interested in the sheep but the inspector stared at holmes you think the sheep are important oh yes said holmes very important the inspector still stared at him very interested now and what other things are important mr holmes the strange incident of the dog in the nighttime the dog did nothing in the nighttime that was the strange incident chapter five a day at the races on tuesday holmes and i took the train to winchester and mr ross met us at the station he drove us to the races but he was not a happy man well mr holmes he said coldly do you have news of my horse holmes smiled hes safe and well im sure how is the betting for the wessex cup very strange said mr ross yesterday silver blaze was fifteen to one but today hes the favourite at three to one why i dont know ah said holmes somebody knows something we arrived only minutes before the beginning of the wessex cup race this was holmess plan i think mr ross had no time to ask questions there were six horses running in the race and silver blazes name was there at number the horses began to come out for the race and mr ross got very excited where is he i cant see him he cried there are two more horses to come out i said and look theres number now in racing colours of red and blue those are your colours mr ross and there was silver blaze a big brown horse with a white nose he came past us looking strong and well and ready for anything holmes cried mr ross i was wrong about you im sorry but why how shh said holmes watch yes theyre off it was a good race fast and exciting after the first minute a horse with yellow racing colours came to the front and stayed there thats desborough from the capleton stables said holmes a good horse but silver blaze is better but silver blaze was three horses behind desborough come on come on cried mr ross move up now we all watched the red and blue colours yes i said look hes moving up now watch him go slowly but surely silver blaze moved up into fourth place then into third place then into second place now only desborough was in front of him thats my boy said mr ross go on go on desboroughs getting tired holmes said watch eighty metres fifty metres hes away cried mr ross his nose is in front yes yes hes going to do it and he did silver blaze kept his nose in front finished first and won the wessex cup wonderful said mr ross wonderful what a race what a horse mr holmes how can i thank you you must thank the horse not me said holmes smiling lets go down and have a look at him silver blaze was still excited by his big race mr ross looked him up and down he looks well very well i dont understand any of it mr holmes how did you do it where did you find him and perhaps you now have john strakers killer too do you yes said holmes quietly yes i have him too mr ross and i stared at him you have him mr ross said where is he he is here here where here with me now at this moment mr rosss face began to go red what are you saying mr holmes he said angrily are you saying sherlock holmes laughed no no mr ross not you the killer is standing behind us he turned and put his hand on silver blazes back the horse cried mr ross the horse i said yes the horse said holmes but dont be angry with him you can hear all about the mystery but later please i have a little bet on a horse in the next race and i would like to see it win chapter six holmes has the answers on the train back to london holmes told us the story behind the mystery and the time went very quickly before we went down to kings pyland my friend began i thought it was fitzroy simpson but when we arrived at the stables i suddenly remembered the hot meat curry why didnt i think of it before that you see was the beginning the meat curry said mr ross thinking about it er how did the meat curry help you do you know the taste of opium holmes said no well its not a very strong taste but its there you can taste it in most food but not in curry curry has a very strong taste stronger than opium so the killer says i need a night when the dinner is a meat curry then ned hunter can eat his dinner happily without the taste of opium and go to sleep but did fitzroy simpson know that curry was the dinner on monday night of course not how could he he didnt make the dinner he was a stranger at kings pyland he knew nobody in the trainers house so we forget simpson and think again who knew about the curry before dinner on that monday night john straker and his wife i said and the servant right watson and so on to the next question about the dog we know there was a dog in the stables that night because ned hunter took the dog out when simpson was there then in the middle of the night someone went into the stables and took out a horse the two boys sleeping upstairs in the stables heard nothing because there was nothing to hear the dog did not bark why not aha said mr ross it didnt bark because it knew the visitor dogs only bark at strangers right again so the midnight visitor was john straker but why did he take the horse out what did he want it was something dishonest or why did he put opium in his stable boys dinner we all know about dishonest trainers they can make a lot of money they put big bets against their own horse and then stop their horse winning but how what was strakers plan here perhaps the answer was in his pockets i thought and so it was you remember the strange knife dr watson here told us about it an eye knife used by doctors in hospitals with a knife like this you can make a cut a very very small cut in the tendon of a horses back leg nobody can see the cut and the horse only feels it a little hes not lame but he doesnt run his best so he cannot win the race and straker wanted to do this to my horse cried mr ross how could he i thought he was a good man no said holmes he wasnt a good man or a careful one no horse stands quietly when a knife goes into its back leg straker didnt want anyone to hear the noise so he took the horse out onto the moor the candle and the match i said of course thats right holmes said and i learnt more from strakers pockets too you are a man of the world mr ross do men carry other mens bills around in their pockets no they do not so who was mr darbyshire another name for john straker and there was a lady in the case too a very expensive lady i talked to mrs straker about the dress and the hat on the bill but she knew nothing about them and on monday night out on the moor said mr ross what happened do you think how about this said holmes straker takes the horse down the hill he sees simpsons scarf on the ground and takes it with him why i dont know he puts his coat on a tree gets out the candle and the matches and the knife and begins his work but silver blaze doesnt like it perhaps hes afraid perhaps he feels something is wrong hes a big strong horse and he gets angry he kicks out with his back legs and the horseshoes hit straker on the head straker goes down into the mud and the knife in his hand goes into his own leg the horse disappears into the night wonderful mr ross said you tell it very well mr holmes i see it all now and the sheep i asked what about the sheep you told inspector gregory that they were important ah yes watson the sheep holmes smiled and they were important its not easy to make a very small cut in an animals tendon and straker did not want to get it wrong he needed to practise first but what on there were his own sheep right in front of him and where did you go in london the day after we got back i asked was it to that dressmaker on the bill for mr darbyshire very good watson holmes laughed yes i had a photograph of straker and the dressmaker knew him at once oh yes she said thats mr darbyshire i do a lot of work for him mrs darbyshire is a very beautiful lady and she likes expensive dresses holmes laughed again its an old old story straker is not the first man with two women in his life he needed more money for the expensive mrs darbyshire so he thought of this plan with silver blaze and there you have it mr ross yes i understand it all now said mr ross and thank you very much mr holmes theres just one thing where was the horse ah yes the horse was safe and well and with a friend said sherlock holmes i cant tell you who or where because i made a promise but here we are nearly in london you have the answer to the mystery mr ross you are the winner of the wessex cup and the owner of the fastest racehorse in the south of england what more do you need the end
