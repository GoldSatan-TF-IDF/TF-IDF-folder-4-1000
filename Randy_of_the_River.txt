xxxii brought to terms conclusion randy of the river chapter i something about randy i am going fishing randy do you want to go along with pleasure jack answered randy thompson a bright manly youth of fourteen are you going on foot or in your boat i think we might as well take the boat returned jack bartlett a boy who was but a few months older than randy have you your lines handy no but i can get them in less than ten minutes all right meet me at the dock in quarter of an hour i was thinking of going up the river to landys hole thats a good spot isnt it i think so last season i was up there and caught fourteen goodsized fish they tell me you are one of the best fishermen in riverport randy went on jack bartlett admiringly what is the secret of your success i dont know unless it is patience answered randy with a broad smile to catch fish you must be patient now when i caught my mess of fourteen two other boys were up to the hole but just because the fish did not bite right away they moved away further up the river but by doing that they got only about half as many as myself well i am willing to be patient if i know i am going to catch something at this randy laughed outright you cant be sure of anything in fishing but i always reckon its a good thing to hold on and give a thing a fair trial i reckon youre right randy and ill give the fishing a fair trial today answered jack bartlett remember the dock in quarter of an hour he added as he moved away ill be on hand unless mother wants me to do something for her before i go away returned randy randy or rather randolph thompson to use his right name was the only son of louis thompson a carpenter of riverport a thriving town in one of our eastern states randy had no brothers or sisters and lived with his father and mother in a modest cottage on one of the side roads leading to the hills back of the town randy was a scholar in the local school standing close to the head of his class it was now summer time and the institution of learning was closed so the boy had most of his time to himself he had wanted to go to work to help his father who had some heavy doctors bills to pay but his parents had told him to take at least two weeks vacation before looking for employment he needs it mrs thompson had said to her husband he has applied himself very closely to his studies ever since last fall well let him take the vacation and welcome answered louis thompson i know when i was a boy i loved a vacation he was a kindhearted man and thought a good deal of his offspring and also of his wife who was devoted to him the cottage stood back in the center of a wellkept garden where mrs thompson had spent much time over her flowers of which she was passionately fond it was a twostory affair containing but five rooms yet it was large enough for the family and randy who had never known anything better considered it a very good home there was a small white fence in front with a gate and the path to the front stoop was lined with geraniums over the porch was trained a honeysuckle which filled the air with its delicate fragrance mother im going fishing with jack bartlett cried randy running around to the kitchen where his mother was busy finishing up the weeks ironing very well randy she answered setting down her flatiron and giving him a smile i suppose you wont be back until supper time its not likely can i do anything for you before i go you might get a bucket of water and another armful of wood ill do that answered randy and caught up the water bucket anything else no take care of yourself while you are on the river dont worry about me mother remember i can swim like a fish yes i know but you must be careful anyway answered mrs thompson fondly the water and wood were quickly brought into the cottage randy whistling merrily while he performed these chores then the youth ran for his fishing outfit after which he took the spade went down to the end of the garden and turned up some worms which he placed in a pasteboard box now i am off mother he called out goodby randy she said and waved him a pleasant adieu from the open kitchen window shes the best mother a boy ever had thought randy as he walked away to join jack at the dock what a good boy murmured mrs thompson oh i hope he grows up to be a good man when randy arrived at the dock he found himself alone he brought out the boat and cleaned it up and got the oars he was all ready for the start when a boy somewhat older than himself slouched up the newcomer was loudly dressed in a checked suit and wore a heavy watchchain a big seal ring and a diamond shirt stud he might have been goodlooking had it not been for the supercilious scowl of independence upon his face hullo there randy thompson he called out what are you doing in jack bartletts boat his manner was decidedly offensive and did not suit randy at all i dont know as that is any of your business bob bangs he answered coldly humph jack wont thank you for getting out his boat went on bob bangs if you want a boat why dont you hire one i dont have to hire one answered randy you wouldnt dare to touch my boat continued bob who was known as the town bully his father was rich and for that reason he thought he could ride over all the other boys i shouldnt care to touch it said randy dont you know you havent any right to touch jacks boat without his permission went on the big youth bob bangs this is none of your business humph ill make it my business if you do you may get into trouble ill risk that if you dont get out of that boat ill tell jack i am not going to get out of the boat maybe ill make you get out and bob bangs came a step closer and put his hand on the gunwale of the rowboat you leave me and the boat alone said randy sharply you get out of that boat not for you bob bangs looked ugly he was on the point of catching randy by the collar when an interruption came from behind so you got here ahead of me eh came in jacks voice as he approached on a swift walk i had to do an errand for father and that kept me as jack came up bob bangs fell back in disgust humph why didnt you say you were waiting for jack he said to randy with a sour look on his face you didnt ask me thats why returned randy whats the trouble questioned jack quickly bob wanted me to leave the boat alone i thought he was trying to sneak it on the sly explained the big boy i didnt know you cared to go out with him he added to jack with a toss of his head why shouldnt i go out with randy asked jack quickly oh i shouldnt care to go out with the son of a poor carpenter see here bob bangs i consider myself as good as you said randy quickly humph randy is all right even if his father is a carpenter said jack its mean of you bob to talk that way choose your own company and ill choose mine answered bob bangs loftily and stalked away his nose tilted high in the air angry words arose to randys lips but he repressed them and said nothing in a moment more some goods on the dock hid the big boy from view dont you care for what he says said jack quickly he thinks a few dollars are everything in this world i didnt mind him much jack wanted you to get out of my boat didnt he yes he didnt know i was waiting for you that was a good joke on him i cant understand why he is so disagreeable it was born in him said jack as he leaped into the rowboat and stowed away his fishing outfit his father is the same way and so is his mother they think that just because they have money everybody else especially a poor person is dirt under their feet why jack i guess your father is as rich as mr bangs maybe he is and you dont put on such airs and i dont intend to money is a good thing to have but it isnt everything that is what my father and mother say bob wouldnt want me out in his boat with him maybe you wouldnt like to go out with him either you are right there i am getting so i hate to speak to him well i am getting that way too every time we meet he tries to impress it upon me that he is a superior person and i dont see it your father and his father have some business dealings havent they yes they are interested in the same iron company and from what father says i think they are going to have trouble before long i hope your father comes out ahead it is this way father has a controlling interest and mr bangs is doing his best to get it away from him if mr bangs can get control he will so father says join the company of a larger concern and then father will be about wiped out and he wont get more than half of what is really coming to him but wouldnt that be fraud yes morally but not legally so father says answered jack and heaved a sigh i hope it all comes out right and so do i for your sake as well as for your folks added randy heartily chapter ii at the fishing hole the fishing hole for which the two boys were bound was on the river about a mile and a half above the town at this point the stream was thirty to forty feet wide and ten to fifteen feet deep it was lined on one side with sharp rocks and on the other by thick trees and bushes at the foot of some of the rocks where the river made a bend there was a deep hole and this some of the lads including randy and jack considered an ideal place for fishing the boys did not row directly for the hole being afraid they might scare the fish away instead they landed below the spot tied fast to a tree root between the stones and then crawled over the big rocks until they reached a point from which they could cast into the hole with ease they soon baited up randy was ready first but he gave his companion the chance to make the initial cast scarcely had jacks hook touched the water when there came a jerk and the line was almost pulled from the boys hands youve got him cried randy excitedly good for you if i dont lose him before i get him on the rocks answered jack but his fears were groundless for a few seconds later the catch lay at his feet a fish weighing at least a pound and a half thats the way to do it said randy you might have had him if you had cast in first answered his companion modestly ill try my luck now and randy cast in without delay then jack also tried it again and both boys began to fish in earnest soon randy got a bite and brought in a fish weighing as much as the first catch now we are even said jack in an hour randy had four goodsized fish to his credit and jack had an equal number then jacks luck fell away and randy got three more while his companion got nothing there is no use of talking you are a better fisherman than i said jack i think you drop down too deep answered randy try it this way and he showed his friend what he meant after that jacks success was a trifle better but still randy kept ahead of him when the boys had caught twenty fish between them they decided to give up the sport randy knew where they could find some blackberries and leaving their fish in a hole among the rocks where there was a small pool of water they tramped away from the river to where the blackberry bushes were located these are fine said jack eating a handful with a relish randy we ought to come berrying here some day i am willing these berries would make the nicest kind of pies yes indeed and if there is anything i love it is a good juicy blackberry pie if we had a kettle we might take some home with us now i am afraid it is too late what time is it jack carried a neat silver watch which he consulted why its halfpast five already i thought it might be four yes well have to get back let us go down to the boat first and then row up and get the fish this suited the two boys and soon they were making their way back over the rocks to where jacks craft had been left as they came out from among the trees and bushes they saw another boat on the river headed for riverport there is bob bangs again exclaimed randy hullo yelled jack have you been fishing too yes answered the big boy and continued to row down the river have any luck went on jack fine was the short answer and then bob bangs craft drew out of hearing he was in a tremendous hurry mused jack perhaps he didnt want us to see what he had caught answered randy thats likely it randy i dont believe he knows as much about fishing as i do and that is little enough having secured the rowboat randy and jack rowed up to the fishing hole and randy scrambled up the rocks to secure their two strings of fish he soon reached the shallow pool among the rocks in which they had been placed and drew up the two strings well i declare he ejaculated as he looked the fish over then he counted them carefully what can this mean his string had held twelve fish and jacks eight fish now three of the largest fish from each string were gone he looked around with care but could see nothing of the missing fish hullo whats keeping you shouted jack from the boat come up here called back randy anything wrong yes landy i hope the fish arent gone burst out jack as he scrambled up the rocks and ran to where randy was continuing the search the situation was soon explained and both boys hunted around in the neighborhood of the pool thinking the fish might have gotten away in some manner then of a sudden jack uttered a cry look at this randy what is it a key ring with two keys on it where did you find it here right beside the pool then somebody has been here and taken our fish exactly what i believe jack began to examine the key ring and then he uttered another exclamation here are some initials on the ring what are they i cant make out very well they are so worn i think the first is r let me see jack passed the find over and randy examined it i can make it out said randy r a b robert a bangs shouted jack bob bangs murmured randy could he have been mean enough to come here and take some of our fish it certainly looks that way let us go after him and find out all right anyway we can make him explain how his key ring got here taking what was left of the fish the two boys hurried back to the rowboat and soon each was seated at an oar and pulling a good stroke in the direction of the town he must have been watching us fish observed jack and he must have seen us place our catch in the pool and took our best fish because he couldnt catch any of his own concluded randy well if he has my fish he has got to give them up he added with determination rowing at a good rate of speed it did not take the boys long to reach the town as they moved past one dock after another they looked for bob bangs but the big youth was nowhere in sight i reckon he was afraid of being followed said jack there is his boat answered randy and pointed to the craft which was tied up near an old boathouse and not at the regular bangs dock while the two boys rested on their oars an old man who was lame and who rented out boats for a living came from the old boathouse hullo isaac called out jack have you seen bob bangs around here why yes he just went ashore answered isaac martin did he have any fish yes a nice string some pretty big ones too how many seven or eight which way did he go up samson street thats the back way to his house cried randy come on what shall we do with our fish and the boat let isaac take care of them want me to take care of things eh said the lame boatman very well ill do it the two boys were soon on the way on a run they knew about the route bob bangs would take to get home and came in sight of the big boy just as he was entering his fathers garden by a rear gate stop bob called out randy the big boy looked around hastily and was much chagrined to see the others so close at hand he held his string of fish behind him what do you want he demanded as they came closer you know well enough what we want returned jack we want our fish your fish who has got your fish blustered bob youve got them retorted randy and made a snatch at the string the big boy held fast and a regular tug of war ensued let go i wont you shall see here bob interposed jack it wont do you any good to hang on those are our fish and we want them bah how do you know they are your fish because you took them from the pool in which we placed them i did not you did you cant prove it yes we can how by this said jack triumphantly and exhibited the key ring and keys chapter iii exposing bob bangs when bob bangs saw the key ring his face changed color where did you get that he demanded got it where you dropped it at the pool where we left our fish how do you know it is mine by the initials on it humph if you dont want the key ring well keep it put in randy quickly no you wont keep it give it to me then give us our fish said randy quietly but firmly they are not all your fish i caught two of them the two smallest i suppose no the two largest we lost six big fish and these belong to us said randy and took the best fish from the string bob bangs it was a contemptible thing to do he added with spirit i wouldnt do such a dirty thing for a thousand dollars bah dont talk to me unless you want to get hurt growled the large youth savagely i am not afraid of you even if you are bigger than i am said randy undaunted by the fighting attitude the bully had assumed it certainly was a mean piece of business came from jack if you wanted some fish why didnt you ask us for them humph i can buy my fish if i want to then why did you take ours demanded randy i er i didnt know they belonged to you i just saw the strings in the pool and took a few answered the boy lamely give me my key ring the ring with the keys was passed over and randy and jack restrung their fish in the meantime bob bangs entered his fathers garden slamming the gate after him you just wait ill get square with you he shouted back and shook his fist at randy you be careful or youll get into trouble shouted back randy and then he and jack walked away with their fish whats the matter master robert asked the manofallwork around the bangs place as he approached bob from the barn oh some fellows are getting fresh grumbled the big youth but ill fix them for it i see they took some of your fish we had a dispute about the fish rather than take them from such a poor chap as randy thompson i let him keep them said bob glibly but i am going to get square with him for his impudence he added after a long hard row and fishing for over an hour bob bangs had caught only two small fish and he was thoroughly disgusted with everything and everybody he walked into the kitchen and threw the fish on the sink board there mamie you can clean those and fry them for my supper he said to the servant girl oh land sakes master bob they are very small cried the girl they wont go around nohow i said you could fry them for my supper answered bob coldly they are hardly worth bothering with murmured the servant girl but the boy did not hear her for he had passed to the next room he went upstairs and washed up and then walked into the sitting room where his mother reclined on a sofa reading the latest novel of society life where is father he asked abruptly i do not know robert answered mrs bangs without looking up from her book will he be home to supper to this there was no reply i say will he be home to supper and the boy shoved the book aside robert dont be rude cried mrs bangs in irritation i presume he will be home and she resumed her novel reading i want some money to this there was no reply mrs bangs was on the last chapter of the novel and wanted to finish it before supper was served she did little in life but read novels dress and attend parties and she took but small interest in bob and his doings i say i want some money repeated the boy in a louder key robert will you be still every time i try to read you come and interrupt me and you never want to listen to me you read all the time no i do not i really read very little i have so many things to attend to what did you say you wanted i want some money i havent had a cent this week then you must ask your father i havent anything to give you and again mrs bangs turned to her book cant you give me a dollar again there was no answer i say cant you give me a dollar i cannot now go away and be quiet until supper time then give me fifty cents i havent a penny ask your father oh youre a mean thing growled the wayward son and stalked out of the sitting room slamming the door after him what a boy sighed the lady of the house he never considers my comfort and after all i have done for him and then she turned once more to her precious novel it wanted half an hour to supper time and bob not caring to do anything else took himself back to his room like his mother he too loved to read stowed away in a trunk he had a score or more of cheap papercovered novels of daring adventures among the indians and of alluring detective tales books on which he had squandered many a dime one was called bowery bob the boy detective of the docks or winning a cool million and he wanted to finish this to see how bob got the million dollars the absurdity of the stories was never noticed by him and he thought them the finest tales ever penned he was deep in a chapter where the hero in rags was holding three men with pistols at bay when he heard a noise below and saw his father leaping from the family carriage mr bangs face wore a look of great satisfaction showing plainly that his days business had agreed with him how do you do dad he said running down to greet his parent firstrate bob said mr bangs with a smile how have things gone with you today not very well whats the matter you forgot to give me my spending money this week i thought i gave it to you saturday that was for last week i think you are mistaken bob however it doesnt matter much went on mr bangs as he entered the house phew hes in a fine humor tonight thought bob ill have to strike him for more than a dollar wheres your mother went on the gentleman in the sitting room reading but i say dad what about that money oh do you want it right away id like to have it after supper very well can i have three dollars i want to buy something extra this week some things i really need ahem three dollars is quite a sum i dont know of any other boy in riverport who gets as much as three dollars in one week to spend well but they havent as rich a father as i have ah quite true nodded mr bangs with satisfaction i think i can safely lay claim to being the richest man in this district then i can have the three dollars went on bob anxiously yes here you are and his parent brought forth a wellfilled wallet and handed over three new onedollar bills bob was stowing the money away in his pocket and congratulating himself on his luck when a door opened and mrs bangs appeared so you are back amos she said sweetly it has been such a long lonesome day without you and a busy day for me answered amos bangs as he passed into the sitting room and dropped into an easy chair did you go to springfield i did and met tuller and the rest weve got that thing in our grip now yes she said vaguely in reality she took no interest whatever in her husbands affairs so long as she got what money she desired yes sir weve got the thing just where we want it continued amos bangs you mean his wife hesitated i mean that iron works affair of course viola cant you understand at all oh er yes of course let me see you were trying to get control so you said exactly and ive got it was not that the works in which mr bartlett is interested the same did not he have the control yes but i have it now and i am going to keep it answered amos bangs with evident satisfaction do you mean jack bartletts father dad questioned bob eagerly i do have you got the best of him well i have ahem carried my point and the iron works will be absorbed by the concern in springfield and jack bartletts father wont like that no in fact i am afraid he will fight it but he can do nothing absolutely nothing went on amos bangs i hold the whip hand and i shall continue to hold it i hate the bartletts and i hope you do get the best of them this will make mrs bartlett take a back seat said mrs bangs maliciously maybe you mean that seat in church said bob slyly not that particularly although it is time they went to the rear they have had a front seat so long amos we must take a front seat now as you please viola and i must have some new dresses you shall have them my dear you dear good man cried the fashionable wife and then the whole family went in to supper bob felt particularly elated he had gotten three dollars for spending money and he felt sure that the bartletts including jack would have to suffer i wish dad could do something to injure the thompsons he said to himself but mr thompson is only a carpenter i must watch my chance and get square with randy on my own account chapter iv randy at home all unmindful of the trouble that had already come to the bartletts and of the trouble bob bangs was hatching out for him randy divided the mess of fish with jack and hurried home see what a fine mess ive got mother he cried as he entered the kitchen where his mother had just started to prepare the evening meal arent they real beauties they are randy answered mrs thompson and smiled brightly did jack do as well almost as well as i did and we divided evenly because you see he furnished the boat and mother ive found out where we can get a fine lot of blackberries if you want me to ill go for them tomorrow i wish you would randy your father loves blackberry pie and blackberry pudding and so do i ive got time to fry some of these fish for supper went on mrs thompson and we can have some more tomorrow too but i dont think we can use them all i was thinking we might give mrs gilligan a couple that will be very nice if you will take them over at once mrs gilligan was a poor irishwoman who took in washing and ironing for a living she was alone in the world and often had a struggle to make both ends meet just to look at that now she cried as randy held up the fish sure an ye air a great fisher by randy so ye air i got so many i thought id bring you a couple said our hero now thats rale kind of ye answered mrs gilligan as she dried her hands and took the fish just loike my pat used to catch afore he was kilt on the railroad i caught them this afternoon so you can be sure they are fresh im much obliged to ye i am indade said mrs gilligan she drew a long breath sure an the lord is good to us after all i was just afther thinkin i had nothin but throuble whin in comes these iligant fish is something wrong asked randy curiously its not a great dale yet its enough fer a poor woman loike me its mrs bangs wash so it is nothin suits that lady an she always wants to pay less than she agreed you mean bob bangs mother th same randy oh they are a hardhearted family so they are i believe you and yet mr bangs is rich its little enough i see of his money sighed mrs gilligan although i do me besht wid the washin an ironin so i do its a wonder mrs bangs dont make the servant do the washing and ironing she did make the other wan do that same but the new one cant iron an wont try so i have the work an the girrul gits less wages answered the irishwoman when randy returned home he found supper almost ready the appetizing odor of frying fish filled the air a few minutes later mr thompson came in louis thompson was a man a little past middle age tall and thin and not unlike randy in the general appearance of his face he was not a strong man and the winter before had been laid up with a severe attack of rheumatism that smells good he said with a smile as he kissed his wife i like fish randy just caught them good enough you look tired louis went on mrs thompson was the work extra hard not much harder than usual lucy but i was working on a cellar partition and it was very damp it brought back a bit of the rheumatism that is too bad cant the boss give you something else to do something where it isnt damp questioned randy i have asked him about it answered his father but just at present there is nothing else in sight you must take care louis said mrs thompson it will not do to risk having the rheumatism come back i wish i could get something to do said randy while the evening meal was in progress i might earn some money and it would help but there doesnt seem to be any kind of an opening in riverport times are rather dull answered mr thompson and i am afraid they will be worse before they are better on the following day randy went out after blackberries jack went with him and the boys went up the stream in the latters boat if i can get a good mess mother is going to preserve some said randy i like blackberry jam answered his friend the two boys had brought their lunch with them intending to remain out all day by noon they had picked twelve quarts of berries and then sat down by the river side to eat their lunch what do you say to a swim remarked jack after the meal was over just the thing cried our hero but we mustnt remain in longer than half an hour i want to pick more berries they were soon in the water which was deliciously cool and refreshing they dove and splashed around to their hearts content and raced from one bank to the other and back randy won the race by several seconds i declare randy you are a regular water rat declared jack i never saw a better swimmer well i do love the water that is certain answered randy and you row such a good stroke too thats because i love boats the halfhour at an end our hero leaped ashore and began to don his garments and jack did the same they were just finishing their toilet when a rowboat came into view containing bob bangs and several other of the loud boys of riverport there is bob bangs again whispered randy well have to watch out that he doesnt try to rob us of our berries whispered jack significantly humph up here again eh remarked the big youth resting on his oars we are answered randy i think we can come if we please certainly for all i care growled bob we are picking berries and we intend to watch them too put in randy loudly at this pointed remark bob bangs colored slightly i should think youd pick your company jack bartlett he said coarsely i do that is why i am not with you humph i consider myself just as good as you bob bangs said randy warmly i may not be as rich but i never tried to steal a mess of fish from anybody you shut up roared the big boy and then he started to row away youll not get a chance to rob us of these berries called out jack after him what do they mean about robbing somebody of fish asked one of bobs companions oh that was only a joke answered the rich youth just wait ill fix them for it as soon as bangs and his cronies had disappeared randy and jack went back to their berry picking they worked steadily until five oclock in the afternoon and by that time had a great number of quarts to their credit the folks at home will be pleased said jack my mother loves fresh berries she says they are much better than those which are several days in the market and she is right the boys had brought along several large and small kettles and had left three of these down near the boat filled with the fruit each walked to the shore with a kettle full of berries in his hand well i never cried jack in dismay bob bangs again murmured randy oh dont i just wish i had him here id pummel him good there was good cause for our heros anger on the rocks lay the overturned berry kettles the berries scattered in all directions and many of them crushed under foot and look at the boat gasped jack turning to inspect the craft the rowboat was partly filled with water and on the seats and in the bottom a quantity of mud had been thrown the oars were sticking in a mud bank close by does she leak asked our hero with concern ill have to find out it was soon discovered that the craft was intact and then they set to work to clean up the muss this was no easy job and the boys perspired freely for the day was a warm one then randy looked over the scattered berries about onethird of them are fit to take along he said the others are crushed and dirty ill tell you what i am going to do said jack stoutly i am going to make bob bangs pay for dirtying my boat and he can pay for the lost berries too but how can we prove he is guilty well make him own up to it nobody else would play such a mean trick the two boys were in no happy frame of mind as they rowed back to riverport they suspected that bob bangs would keep out of their sight but just as they were landing they caught sight of him peering at them from behind a dock building there he is cried jack after him randy right you are answered our hero and ran after bob bangs with might and main randy was a good sprinter and although the rich youth tried to get away he was soon brought to a halt let go of me he roared as randy caught him by the collar not just yet bob bangs returned randy a fine trick you played this afternoon i didnt play any trick yes you did i didnt let me go and now bob bangs did his best to get away he saw that randy and jack were thoroughly angry and was afraid he was in for a drubbing or worse he gave a jerk and then started to run randy put out his foot and the big youth went sprawling full length his face violently striking the ground chapter v the result of a quarrel if any boy was ever humiliated it was bob bangs his face and hands were covered with dust and so was his elegant suit of clothing while the skin was cut on the side of his nose now see what you have done he spluttered gazing ruefully at himself my suit is just about ruined and it serves you right bob bangs came warmly from jack that is what you get for trying to run away added our hero ill have the law on you randy thompson maybe ill have the law on you bob bangs you had no right to throw me down in that fashion then why did you start to run away because i didnt want to stay here and you had no right to stop me we wanted to know about this berry affair said jack and about the dirty boat i dont know what you are talking about answered the big boy but his face showed his concern you put mud in my boat and spilled our berries who says i did that we know you did did you see us no but we know you did it and nobody else you cant prove it answered bob and now his face showed a sign of relief he had been afraid that there had been a witness of his evildoing perhaps we can said randy bob bangs i think you are the meanest boy in riverport he continued with spirit i dont care what you think randy thompson who are you anyway the son of a poor carpenter why you havent got a decent suit of clothing to your back for shame bob broke in jack randy is a good fellow even if he is poor well if you think he is so good you can go with him but i dont want to associate with such a low fellow went on the big youth as he started to brush himself off with a silk handkerchief so i am a low fellow am i said randy in a steady voice and coming up close to bob who promptly began to back away ye as you you are stammered the rich youth ive a good mind to knock you down for saying it bob bangs i am not as low as you humph i would never do the low things you have done it was a mean contemptible trick that you played on jack and me by right you ought to be made to scrub out the boat and pay for the berries you spoiled bah i wont touch the boat and i wont pay a cent then you admit that you are guilty i admit that i had some fun at your expense yes answered bob bangs you cant do anything to me though for you cant prove it against me that means if you were brought up into court you would lie about it said randy humph you neednt get so personal randy thompson for two pins do you know what i would do bob bangs what id give you a good thrashing and randy pulled up his sleeves as if he meant to begin operations at once no no dont you you dare to touch me gasped the rich boy in alarm if you do ill ill have the law on you and well have the law on you bob bangs was more alarmed than ever he saw that randy was ready to pitch into him on the instant he looked around saw an opening and darted away at his best speed let him go the big coward called out jack for randy had started after the rich boy we can settle with him another time what a mean chap cried randy i never saw his equal never bob bangs ran a distance of several rods then seeing a clod of dirt lying in the road he picked it up and hurled it at the boys he was not a good thrower but as luck would have it the clod struck randy on the shoulder some of the dirt spattering up into his ear ha ha thats the time you got it sang out the rich boy gleefully and this is the time you are going to get it returned randy and made a dash after him seeing this jack followed after the pair illustration randy caught bob bangs by the arm and threw him over bob bangs could run and fear lent speed to his flying feet but he was no match for randy who had on more than one occasion won a running match amongst his schoolfellows bob started for home several blocks away but just before he reached his gate randy came near to him caught him by the arm and flung him over on his side then to hold him down our hero seated himself on top of the rich boy who began to bellow lustily get off of me i will not you are squeezing the wind out of me what right had you to throw that chunk of dirt at me i er i was only fooling maybe i am only fooling too you are breaking my ribs oh let up i say are you sorry for what you did demanded randy to this bob bangs made no reply i see youve got him said jack running up at that instant yes and i am going to give it to him good answered randy let up help somebody help roared bob badly frightened he began to kick and struggle but randy held him down and as a consequence he was covered with dust and dirt from head to foot in the midst of the mкlйe a carriage came along the roadway it contained mrs bangs and the manofallwork who was driving mercy on us what does this mean burst from the fashionable ladys lips can that be robert help help roared the rich youth more lustily than ever it certainly is robert went on mrs bangs john stop the carriage you rude boy let my son alone she went on in her shrill hard voice hullo here is mrs bangs remarked jack looking around and discovering the new arrival for the instant randy did not see the rich woman and continued to hold down bob who struggled violently sending up a cloud of dust in the road then he noticed the carriage and looked up and his face fell you scamp leave my boy alone screamed mrs bangs oh john perhaps you had better run for a policeman she added as randy let go his hold and arose you had better not mrs bangs said jack bob deserves what he is getting i do not believe it it is disgraceful to throw him down in the road like this stormed the fashionable lady he hit randy with a chunk of dirt i i didnt do nothing howled bob as he got up he was too ruffled to think of his bad grammar and that elegant suit is about ruined went on mrs bangs i never heard of such doings before boy she went on looking at randy you ought to be locked up it is bob ought to be locked up retorted randy he started this trouble i didnt i do not believe it my son is a gentleman i didnt do a thing put in the rich boy feeling safe now that his mother and the hired man were on the scene they pitched into me for nothing at all bob knows better than that said jack yesterday he tried to steal some fish we caught and today he mussed up jacks boat and ruined some berries that both of us had picked explained randy i took him to task about it and then he threw the mud at me then i chased him and caught him as you saw preposterous my boy would not steal said mrs bangs tartly she looked meaningly at jack i presume you and your family are very bitter against us now she added significantly bitter against you said jack puzzled yes because of that iron works affair i dont know anything about that mrs bangs oh then you havent heard yet the fashionable woman was nonplussed never mind you must leave robert alone aint you going to get that policeman and lock them up asked the son anxiously if i am locked up youll be locked up too said randy and the charge against you will be stealing as well as malicious mischief yes and well prove our case added jack bob doesnt know what witnesses we have at this announcement bob bangs face grew pale yo you cant prove anything he faltered you dont know about that said randy taking his cue from jack i will look into this affair later just now i have no time said mrs bangs after an awkward pause robert you had better go into the house and clean yourself up john you can drive on and then while the fashionable woman was driven into her grounds her son lost no time in sneaking off into the house as he entered the door he turned and shook his fist at our hero and jack jack i dont think we have heard the last of this remarked randy as he and his companion started away perhaps not but i think we have the best of it answered jack i dont know about that mrs bangs is a very highstrung woman and thinks a good deal of bob id like to know what she meant about the iron works matter went on jack with a troubled look on his face i hope mr bangs hasnt got the best of father in that deal you had better ask your father when you get home i will the two lads hurried back to the boat and placed the craft where it belonged then the berries were divided and each started for his home little dreaming of the trouble that was in store for both of them chapter vi the iron works affair when jack arrived at home he took the berries around to the kitchen and then hurried upstairs to the bathroom to wash and fix up for supper he was in the midst of his ablutions when he heard his father come in and go to the library an animated talk between his two parents followed something unusual is up thought jack and went below as soon as he was fixed up he found his father sitting near the library table his head resting on his hand his face looked careworn mrs bartlett sat by an open window clasping her hands tightly their earnest talk came to a sudden end as jack entered goodevening father and mother said the boy and then halted maybe i was interrupting you he added jack may as well know said mrs bartlett looking meaningly at her husband i suppose so answered mr bartlett and gave a long sigh know what asked jack your father has had trouble at the iron works answered his mother what kind of trouble it is the bangs affair answered mr bartlett you know a little about that already well amos bangs has forced me into a corner what do you mean by that father he has gained control of the company and is going to consolidate with the springfield concern will that harm you much a great deal i am afraid jack in the past i have known all that was going on now i will have to rely on amos bangs and i do not care to do that dont you think he is honest privately i do not although i should not care to say so in public he and his friends at springfield are sharpers they will squeeze what they can out of the new concern and i am afraid i shall be left out in the cold well i shouldnt trust mr bangs myself he and his son are of a stripe and i know only too well now what bob is have you had trouble with bob questioned mrs bartlett quickly yes answered jack and gave the particulars how bob will crow over me now he went on ruefully this will make bangs harder on me than ever remarked mr bartlett oh i trust not father cried jack i am sure you have trouble enough already the bangses are a hard family to get along with said mrs bartlett i have heard that from several who work for them the men at the office are sorry to see amos bangs in control said mr bartlett they know he will drive them more than i have ever driven them and he will never raise their wages are you going to leave the companys office father yes i am no longer an officer only a stockholder the company ought to give you a position bangs said i could be a timekeeper at fifteen dollars per week how mean and what will his salary be i dont know yet probably a hundred and fifty per week seven or eight thousand per year and youve been getting sixty dollars per week havent you yes then id go elsewhere that is what i shall do if i can find any opening what i am worried about mostly is the capital i have in the iron works fifteen thousand dollars i am afraid bangs will sooner or later wipe me out and do it in such a way that i cannot sue him to advantage its an outrage the trouble is i trusted him too much from the start he has proved to be a snake in the grass and bob is exactly like him said jack the family talked the matter over all during the supper hour and for some time later the prospect ahead was a dark one and mrs bartlett sighed deeply if you cannot get an opening elsewhere i do not know what we are to do said she to her husband ill get something he replied bravely and remember i have a thousand dollars in cash in the bank a thousand dollars wont last long philip after once you begin to use it up that is true have you anything definite in view not exactly i am going to write to my friend mason in albany he may be able to get me something to do at the iron works there he is in charge well i hope it is better than the place amos bangs offered you there is only one trouble went on mr bartlett if i get work at albany we will have to move to that city well we can do that yes but i hate to go away from riverport i wanted to watch bangs you might go to albany every monday and come home saturday night at least for a time yes i might do that answered philip bartlett on the following morning he went down to the iron works as usual as early as it was he found amos bangs ahead of him and sorting out some papers at one of the desks morning said amos bangs curtly goodmorning answered mr bartlett mr bangs what are you doing at this desk sorting out things do you not know that this is my private desk is it i thought it belonged to the iron company answered amos bangs with a sneer the desk does belong to the company but at present it contains my private papers as well as some papers of the company well it is going to be my desk after this ill thank you to take your personal things away you seem to be in a hurry to get me out i want to get to work here things have dragged long enough i am going to make them hum i am glad to hear it answered philip bartlett pointedly i presume we can look for big dividends on our stock next year well er i dont know about that we have got to make improvements and they will cost money you didnt want any improvements when i was in charge that was a different thing the old concern was a smallfry affair we are going to make the new concern something worth while answered amos bangs loftily i hope you do for my sake as well as for the sake of the other stockholders but what salaries are the new officers to have that is to be decided later i trust all the profits are not eaten up by the salaries you cannot expect talented men like myself for instance to work for low salaries you used to be willing to work for fifty dollars a week those days are past but i cannot waste time talking now clean out the desk and turn it over to me concluded amos bangs and walked away with a heavy heart philip bartlett set about the task before him he was much attached to the iron works and hated to leave it presently his brow grew troubled mr bangs he called what do you want now did you see anything of some papers with a broad rubber band around them didnt see anything but what is there i had some private papers they seem to be gone i didnt take them answered amos bangs coldly it is queer where they can be went on philip bartlett well i havent got them philip bartlett hunted high and low for the missing documents but without success then he cleaned out the desk put his personal things in a package said goodby to his former employees and quit the office i am well rid of him said amos bangs to himself and i am glad i got hold of those private contracts now i can make a deal with shaster and turn the work over to the springfield concern and make some money chapter vii more troubles for randy two days passed quietly and randy did not see or hear anything more of bob bangs then he learned through jack that mrs bangs had gone off on a summer trip taking her son with her i hear there are great changes at the iron works said randy to his friend mr bangs they say is in charge he is and father is out of it answered jack bitterly that is what mrs bangs meant when she said i must be bitter against the family is your father out of it entirely jack yes so far as holding a position is concerned he still has his stock but he is afraid that wont be worth much if amos bangs runs the concern what is your father going to do he doesnt know yet he is trying to connect with some other iron works i hope he strikes something good so do i randy i wish i could get something to do too went on randy you mean during the summer yes and maybe later too why isnt your father working not today he has been working in a damp cellar and that brought on his old complaint rheumatism he suffers something awful with it he ought to have a long rest he certainly ought not to work in a cellar he has already told his boss he couldnt go at it again answered randy have you had a doctor yes doctor case came this morning what does he say he says rheumatism is hard to cure and that my father will have to take care of himself answered randy but i must go on now he added i must get some things for mother at the store what randy said about his father was true louis thompson was suffering very much he rested on a couch in the sitting room of the cottage and his wife did what she could to relieve his pain several days passed and the rheumatism instead of growing better became worse so that neither mrs thompson nor randy knew what to do for the sufferer then mr thompsons side began to draw up and in haste a specialist from the city was called in he gave some relief but said it would be a long time before the sufferer would be able to go to work again you must keep off your left leg said the specialist a few days after that louis thompson tried to walk but the pain was so great he could not stand on the rheumatic limb he sank on his couch with a groan i cannot do it he gasped then do not try answered his wife but i must get to work lucy i cannot afford to be idle never mind louis we will get along somehow how much did that specialist charge fifty dollars and what was doctor cases bill ten dollars sixty dollars and we had only ninety dollars in the bank that leaves us only thirty dollars to this mrs thompson did not answer she had used up nearly ten dollars for medicines but did not wish to worry her suffering husband by mentioning it if i dont go to work well all starve to death continued louis thompson well manage somehow answered the wife bravely nevertheless she was much discouraged and that evening when her husband was asleep she and randy talked the matter over as they sat on the porch in the darkness mother said randy earnestly i dont want you to feel troubled you have labored so long for me that it is now my turn i only want something to do my dear child said the mother i do not need to be assured of your willingness but i am sorry that you should be compelled to give up your vacation and maybe your schooling giving up schooling will not be necessary i can study in the evenings i am wondering what i can find to do i know so little about such things randy that we must consult someone who is better qualified to give advice in the matter your uncle peter for instance at this randy gave a sigh i dont know uncle peter he never comes here that is true answered mrs thompson with some hesitation but you know he is a business man and has a great deal to attend to besides he has married a lady who is exceedingly fashionable and i suppose he does not care to bring her to visit such unfashionable folks as we are then said randy indignantly i dont want to trouble him with any of my applications if he doesnt think us good enough to visit we wont force ourselves upon him my dear boy you are too excitable it may be that it is only his business engagements that have kept him away from us besides you can go to him only for advice it is quite different from asking assistance mother and son discussed the situation for fully an hour and at last in the absence of other plans it was decided that randy should go to his uncle the next day and make known his wants mr thompson was told early in the morning and said randy could do as he thought best but dont expect too much from your uncle peter said the sick man peter thompson was an elder brother to randys father early in life he had entered a counting room and ever since had been engaged in mercantile pursuits at the age of twentyeight he had married a dashing lady who was more noted for her fashionable pretensions than for any attractive qualities of the heart she was now at the head of a very showy establishment far more pretentious than that over which mrs bangs presided she knew little about her husbands relations and cared still less the town of riverport was twenty miles distant from deep haven where peter thompson resided with his family a boat ran daily between these places and several others but randy did not wish to spend the necessary fare and so borrowed a bicycle from jack and made the trip by way of the river road a safe if not very comfortable highway randy had been to deep haven several times in years gone by but strange as it may seem had never gone near his uncles residence but he knew where the house was located a fine brick affair with a swell front and leaning his bicycle against a tree he mounted the stone steps and rang the bell whats wanted demanded the servant who answered the summons and she looked randy over in a supercilious manner not at all impressed by the modest manner in which he was attired is uncle peter at home asked randy politely whos uncle peter mr peter thompson no he isnt where is he at his store i expect is mrs thompson at home i dont know ill see who shall i say wants to see her randy thompson randy was left standing in the elegantly furnished hallway while the servant departed he could not help but contrast such elegance with his own modest home come into the drawing room said the servant briefly on returning and ushered him into the finest apartment he had ever entered here he was kept waiting for fully quarter of an hour then a showily dressed woman swept into the room with a majestic air and fixed a cold stare upon our hero are you my aunt he asked somewhat disconcerted by his chilling reception really i couldnt say not having seen you before she answered my name is randy thompson i am the son of louis thompson of riverport ah i see the woman said no more but seemed to await developments randy was greatly embarrassed his aunts coldness repelled him and he easily saw that he was not a welcome visitor a touch of pride came to him and he resolved that he would be as unsociable as his relative what can he want of me thought the woman as randy said nothing more she grew tired of the stillness and drew herself up once more you must excuse me this morning she said i am particularly engaged i suppose you know where your uncles store is you will probably find him there and then she rang for the servant to show our hero to the door he was glad to get out into the open air once more so that is aunt grace he mused well i dont know as i shall ever wish to call upon her again she is as bad as an iceberg for freezing a fellow no wonder she and mother have never become friends chapter viii randy and his uncle peter from his uncles home randy rode on his bicycle to peter thompsons store a fairly large concern the largest in fact in deep haven he found his uncle behind a desk in the rear busy over some accounts for several minutes he paid no attention to his visitor then he stuck his pen behind his ear and gave randy a sharp look how do you do uncle peter said the youth why er who is this stammered peter thompson i dont seem to quite know you i am randy thompson your nephew oh yes my younger brother louis son i believe yes sir i remember you now peter thompson held out a flabby and cold hand come to town on business i suppose in a way yes sir father is down with rheumatism hum didnt take proper care of himself i suppose he had to work in a cellar and that put him in bed and you have come to ask help i suppose peter thompsons face dropped quickly i am sorry but my family expenses are very large and trade is dull if i were able you are mistaken said randy a flush mounting to his brow i do not come for assistance i am old enough to work if i only knew what to do mother told me to come to you for advice peter thompson looked relieved when he understood that randys visit meant no demand upon his purse and he regarded the youth more favorably than he had done ah thats well he said rubbing his flabby hands together i like your independence now let me see he scratched his head do you know anything about horses no sir but perhaps i could learn the liverystable keeper wants a boy but he must know all about horses how much would he pay a week two dollars at the start that would not be enough for me i might get you in some store in the city continued peter thompson would you like that if it paid yes it would pay but little the first year but you would gain a valuable experience i cannot afford that uncle peter i must earn something at once to support our family then i dont know what can be done said the storekeeper with a shrug of his shoulders there are very few things that boys of your age can do and it is so easy to obtain boys that people are not willing to pay much in wages randy looked crestfallen and his uncle embarrassed the merchant feared that he might be compelled by the worlds opinion to aid his brother and his family but suddenly an idea struck him do you know anything about farming he inquired yes sir said randy a little i ask for this reason pursued mr thompson when your grandfather died he left to me a small farm in riverport it is not very good and has been used mostly as a pasture i have been so occupied with other things that i could not look after it perhaps you may know something of it yes sir i do it is about half a mile from our house and is called the twelveacre lot but i didnt know it belonged to you it does what i was going to say is that although i am unable to give you such assistance as i should like i will if you wish it give you the use of that lot and the little cottage on it rentfree so long as you care to use it perhaps you can put it to some use anyway you can use the cottage randys face lighted up much to his uncles satisfaction the land was not extra good and the cottage all but tumbled down yet it was better than nothing they could move out of the cottage in which they were now located and thus save the monthly rent which was eight dollars besides that randy felt that he could do something with the garden even though it was rather late in the season where they now lived there was little room to grow vegetables you are sure you dont want to use the place uncle peter he asked not at all you can use it as long as you please maybe you would like to sell it ahem if you wish to buy it you can make an offer after you are on the place i once offered it to a man for two hundred dollars but he would not take me up then you will sell it for two hundred dollars i will sell it to you or rather your father for a hundred and fifty dollars ill remember that sir it may be that we will like the place so much we shall want to buy if we can raise the money you can pay off the amount at the rate of fifty dollars per year if you wish thank you you are kind and i appreciate it and randy meant what he said peter thompson looked at the clock i must go to dinner now will you dine with me had his uncle been alone randy might have accepted the offer but he remembered the reception his aunt had given him and so declined i think i had better get back to riverport he said i will tell mother and father about the twelveacre lot and see what they have to say about it very well would you mind giving me a slip of paper so that we can prove we have a right to occupy the place pursued randy some folks may try to dispute our right i know one man who pastures cows there he has no right to do so here i will give you a paper in due form whatever his other shortcomings peter thompson was not a slipshod business man he drew up a paper in due form stating that his brother could occupy the little farm for five years rentfree and if he wished to do so could at any time in said five years buy the little farm for one hundred and fifty dollars payable at the rate of fifty dollars per year without interest and now goodby and good luck to you said he as he handed the paper to randy some day if i can get the time i may call upon you but i rarely go away from home randy shook hands and left and in a minute more was riding home on the bicycle well i think ive gained something he thought as he sped along anyway we will have a roof over our heads and that is something to be sure the cottage is a poor one but poor folks cant have everything as they want it when the boy arrived home he found his father had had another bad turn but was now resting easier without delay he told of what had happened at deep haven your aunt is a tartar said louis thompson i never liked her and that is why i and your uncle peter have drifted apart i thought he had sold the twelveacre lot to jerry borden who pastures his cows there jerry borden will have to get out that is if we take possession said randy mother what do you think of it is the cottage usable i have not seen it for a year or more it will have to be fixed up some but i am sure i can do the work with fathers tools it will save the rent money and i can plant a garden even if it is late and we can keep some chickens and then after everything is in shape i can again look for outside work randys idea is a good one answered the boys father our month will be up here next week ill notify the owner at once about leaving the next morning randy went over to the twelveacre farm a corner of which sloped down to the river he had passed it a hundred times before but it was with an entirely different feeling that he surveyed it now it was pasture land naturally good but much neglected a great many stones needed to be removed and the fences wanted propping up and here and there a new rail the house which faced a little side road was a story and a half in height with two rooms below and two chambers above there was a well that needed fixing and also a cistern around the cottage the weeds grew high and one of the windows was out and a door was missing i can fix this place up i am sure of it said the boy to himself he was making a mental note of what was to be done when he heard a noise on the road and saw a farmer approaching driving a dozen cows before him it was jerry borden the man who had been using the pasture lot without paying for it hullo what air you adoin here asked jerry borden looking at randy in some surprise we are going to move over here mr borden answered randy calmly move over here ejaculated the farmer yes in this air tumbledown cottage i am going to fix it up some well i vow it aint fit to live in it will be an the land aint wuth shucks it seems to be good enough for the cows at this jerry bordens face fell a little if you air agoin to move in i guess thet means im to move out he ventured it does unless randy paused struck by a sudden idea unless what asked the farmer eagerly he wanted to use the lot very much for he was short of pasturing on his own farm unless we can come to some sort of an agreement for milk and butter of course i cant let you use the whole lot but you might use part of it did the owner say you could use the place yes we have it down in writing we are to use it for five years and then we can buy it if we wish i see the farmer scratched his head well i dunno maybe we could let ye have butter an milk one thing is certain ive got to have pasturin we could fence off part of the lot in some way and you could use that thets so besides that ill want some plowing done i may have to hire you for that pursued randy i must say i like your spunk randy i shant charge ye a cent fer plowin after that the farmer and our hero talked matters over for half an hour and the farmer told the youth what might be planted to advantage even so late in the season then randy went home feeling that the family was going to make a good move chapter ix the new home the next few days were busy ones for mrs thompson and for randy the landlord of the cottage in which they lived was notified that they were going to move and then the woman set to work to get ready to vacate while randy went over to the other place to put the house in condition for occupancy while randy was at work jack came to see him and insisted upon lending a helping hand randy had brought over some of his fathers tools and also some nails and he purchased at the lumber yard a few boards and other pieces he thought he needed when he once got at it it was astonishing how well our hero used the tools making several repairs that would have done credit to a regular carpenter the broken window was replaced and the missing door found and rehung and several clapboards nailed fast then randy mended the porch and put a score of shingles on the roof this done the chimney was cleaned out and also the cistern and the well was also overhauled in the meantime jack pulled out a lot of weeds and trained a wild honeysuckle over the porch at the end of four days the place looked quite well its a hundred per cent better than it was declared jack it didnt look like anything before ill get a can of paint tomorrow and paint the door and the window frames said randy and this was done he also whitewashed the kitchen and kalsomined the other rooms so that the interior of the cottage was sweet and clean when mrs thompson saw the change which had been wrought she was delighted i declare it looks as well if not better than the cottage we are in she cried and the outlook toward the river is ever so much nicer just wait until i have the garden in shape said randy you wont know the spot what a pity we did not know of this place before mother i think we ought to buy it if we can perhaps we shall randy before the five years are up at length came the day to move a local truckman who knew mr thompson well moved them for nothing you can do some odd jobs for me some time said the truckman to louis thompson thank you i will when i am able answered the sufferer a good deal of the pain had left mr thompson but he was weak and to start to regular work was out of the question another friend took him to his new cottage in a carriage he gazed at the old place in wonder well it certainly is improved he ejaculated we shall get along here very well the moving was done early in the morning and by nightfall randy and his mother had the cottage in tolerable order the stove was set up and found to draw good and the water from the well tasted fine now there is one thing certain said randy mother come what may we shall have a roof over our heads yes my son and i am grateful for it answered mrs thompson uncle peter may be a hard man to get along with but he has certainly helped us the next two weeks were busy ones for randy jerry borden was true to his promise and not only did some plowing for the thompsons but also helped randy to put up a new fence partly of stone and partly of rails it was agreed that borden should have the use of part of the little farm for pasturing and in return was to give the thompsons two quarts of milk a day and two pounds of butter per week and also a dozen fresh eggs a week while the hens were laying that will certainly help us out wonderfully said mrs thompson butter eggs and milk are quite an item of expense and that is not all said randy i am going to help mr borden with his haying soon and he is going to pay us in early vegetables the haying time was already at hand and randy soon pitched in with a will much to his neighbors satisfaction one day jack came to bring good news his father had secured a position with an iron works at albany on the hudson river it will pay him a fair salary said jack i am glad to hear it answered randy what will your family do remain here or move to albany we are going to remain here for the present but if the place suits father after he has been there a while then well move have you learned anything more about the bangses mrs bangs and bob are on a summer vacation yes i know that i meant mr bangs he is in full charge at the iron works here and drawing a salary of eight thousand dollars a year father says he will run the works into the ground so that the stock wont be worth a cent cant your father do anything not yet but he is going to watch things there was some trouble over a contract and he is trying to get to the bottom of that continued jack when randy went to work for farmer borden he came into contact with the farmers son sammy a tall overgrown lad of fourteen with a freckled face and a shock of red hair sammy hated to work and his father and mother had to fairly drive him to get anything out of him city folks dont work like farmers remarked sammy to randy they jest lay off an take it easy how do you know that asked our hero in quiet amusement cos i once read a paper of the sports in the city some rich folks dont work sammy but all the others work as hard as we do i dont believe it said sammy stoutly wish i was a city lad oh wouldnt i jest have the bangup time though sammy borden cried his mother shrilly you get to work an be quick about it im tired answered the freckledfaced lad tired lazy you mean git to work or ill have your paw give you a dressin down drat the luck muttered sammy as he took up his pitchfork i wish i was born in the city come on sammy said randy the work has got to be done so dont think about it but do it huh work is easy to you randy thompson but it comes hard on me and sammy heaved a ponderous sigh the haying was in full blast early in july and randy worked early and late he wanted to get through so that he might go at his own garden sammy dragged worse than ever and finally confided to our hero that he wanted to go to the city over the fourth have you asked your folks yet asked randy no but im agoin to answered sammy well if you go i hope you have a good time said our hero id like to see a fourth of july in the city myself ive heard they make a good deal of noise but i shouldnt mind that gosh i love shootin said sammy arent you afraid you might get lost pursued randy lost snorted sammy not much why you cant lose me in the woods much less in the city the city and the woods are two different places i dont care id know what i was doin it costs money to go to the city i want to go to springfield have you any money saved up to this sammy did not answer then mr borden came along sammy get to work he called out dont let randy do everything i was workin grumbled the son as he started in again you cant expect a feller like me to pitch hay all day long i have to work all day retorted his father it aint fair nohow if you want to eat youll have to work sammy pitched in but grumbled a good deal to himself soon his mother called him and he went off to the house that lad is gettin lazier every day said jerry borden i declare i dont know what to do with him maybe he needs a vacation suggested our hero well he cant have one until the hayin is done declared the farmer chapter x sammys fourth of july the next day sammy sat on a bench on the cottage stoop apparently very intent on a perusal of the farmers almanac but it was evident his thoughts were somewhere else what in nater is the boy adoin asked his mother looking up from a pile of stockings she was mending if he aint twisting up thet almanac as

mrs borden anxiously then you ask paw to let me go twont do no good yes it will you ask him wont you pleaded the son at last mrs borden consented and spoke to her husband about it during the dinner hour jerry borden shook his head he cant go its sheer foolishness he said if you dont let him go im afraid he will run away said the wife he has his heart set on going sammy was out of the room at the time so he could not hear the talk at first mr borden would not listen but at last he gave in although he added grimly that he thought running away would do sammy a world of good hed be mighty glad to sneak back afore a week was up he said when sammy realized that he was really to go to the city he was wild with delight and rushed down into the hayfield to tell randy of his plans im agoin to have a highfalutin time he said just you wait until i come back an tell about it i hope you do have a good time answered our hero and dont get hurt there wont nothin happen to me answered sammy confidently early on the morning of independence day sammy stood at the door of the farmhouse arrayed in his sunday best his folks were there to see him off my son said mr borden dont ye be wasteful o your money an dont git in no scrapes an remember sammy to keep all the commandments added his mother as she kissed him tenderly soon he was off down the side road towards the highway where the stage passed that ran to the railroad station his walk took him by the thompson cottage randy was at home and fixing up the garden im off yelled sammy waving his hand good luck cried randy pleasantly dont get your head shot off he may lose his head without having it shot off remarked mr thompson who sat on the porch with his rheumatic side in the sunshine i do not think it very wise to let him go to the city alone put in mrs thompson from the kitchen sammy tramped on until he came to the main highway and there waited impatiently for the stage to appear he got a seat by the driver and in less than an hour reached the railroad station he had been on the cars before yet the ride was much of a novelty at last the country boy found himself on the streets of springfield there was an extra celebration of some sort going on and great crowds flocked on every side poor sammy was completely bewildered as he was jostled first one way and then another well by gosh if this dont beat anything i ever see he ejaculated where in thunder did all the folks come from anyway sammy looked so truly rural that he attracted the attention of two street urchins who were standing close by theres a greeny ill bet a hat said one of them nudging his companion a regular one and no mistake answered the second urchin lets have a little fun out of him how just look and youll see how i fix him so speaking he took a bunch of firecrackers from his pocket and with a pin attached it to the tail of sammys coat then he set the bunch on fire and slipped back into the crowd crack crack bang the plot took effect sammy was aroused from his reverie by explosion after explosion in his immediate rear he started and leaped into the air in wild amazement by thunder he gasped is thet a cannon bustin the crackers continued to go off and poor sammy leaped around worse than ever say mister whats up he asked of a man who was laughing loudly look behind you answered the man sammy did so one look was enough he began to bellow like a bull and started off on a run knocking down several people who happened to be in his way at last a police officer stopped him what do you mean by making such a disturbance demanded the officer im burning up im exploding dont you hear me gasped poor sammy pooh its only firecrackers and the policeman smiled faintly take em off mister please do pleaded sammy ill give you ten cents for the job they are about burned out answered the officer as the last firecracker went off with an extra loud bang you are safe go along with you and he waved his stick sammy lost no time in sneaking off the boy who had played the trick had a good laugh and so did his companion soon sammy heard a band and saw some milingtary as he called them approaching the sight of the soldiers with their guns awed him yet he followed the procession to a grove where there was more music and also speechmaking he listened to the orations with wideopen mouth until he suddenly lost interest when a bit of banana skin was thrown at him landing directly in the opening wah he spluttered who threw thet skin at me he could not find the offender and so roamed around the grove presently halting before a temporary stand filled with things to eat he now discovered that he was tremendously hungry snathers take the expense he muttered to himself im agoin to have something to eat if it breaks me he had brought along a lunch from home but had forgotten it on the train he approached the stand and looked the stock of eatables over whats the price o them bananas mister he asked two cents each well i suppose if i take two youll let me have em fer three cents couldnt do it well who cares anyway its only four cents let me have two the bananas were handed over and sammy looked for his change but he only had two cents and a onedollar bill can you change that he asked holding out the bill certainly answered the standkeeper and promptly gave the youth a fiftycent piece and a lot of small change with his bananas in one hand and his money in another sammy retired to a distance to count his change and make sure it was right while he was buying the fruit a boy in tatters watched him eagerly now the boy came up to the country lad please mister wont you give me some money to buy bread with he asked in a quivering voice to buy bread with asked sammy in astonishment yes please im awful hungry aint you had nuthin to eat today not a mouthful sammys compassion was aroused and he began to look over his change look out for that cried the tattered boy looking upward suddenly sammys gaze traveled in the same direction as his eyes went up the boy in rags grabbed the money in his hand and in an instant was making off through the crowd the movement was so quick and the surprise so great that for the moment sammy was bereft of speech at length he recovered sufficiently to shout the single word at the top of his lungs constable whats the matter asked a policeman running up thief robbery where is the thief he ran off where in what direction i er i dont know stammered sammy what did he take took all my money how much ninetysix cents it aint all ive got two cents left well if you can point out the thief ill arrest him said the policeman come well take a look around this was done but the boy in rags could not be found drat the luck i suppose the money is gone fer good groaned sammy and he was right for he never saw either the boy or his cash again sammy had expected to remain in the evening and see the fireworks but now his interest in the celebration was gone haint got but two cents left he groaned thet wont buy no supper nor nuthin its lucky ive got a train ticket back but ill have to walk to hum from the station unless theyll tick me fer the stage ride he walked around still hoping to meet the lad who had robbed him his perambulations presently brought him to a spot where there was a pond of water in which some goldfish were swimming the goldfish caught his eye and he paused to watch them as they darted about he was leaning over looking into the pond when some boys came along on a run one boy shoved another and he fell up against sammy as a consequence the country lad lost his balance and went into the pond with a loud splash save me he spluttered i cant swim wade out its only up to your middle sang out a man and arising sammy did as directed he was covered with mud and slime and presented anything but a nice appearance this is the wust yet he muttered and felt half like crying i aint going to stay here no more im goin straight fer hum chapter xi randy to the rescue the next day randy went over to the borden farm to finish up his work there to his astonishment sammy was on hand and apparently eager to go to work well how was the celebration sammy asked our hero no good thats too bad after this im agoin to stay to hum on the fourth went on sammy as he began to fork over the hay vigorously i aint goin to no city to be skinned did they skin you jest about a feller robbed me an i was pushed into a duck pond thats too bad if i hadnt ahad my train ticket id had to walk home went on sammy as it was i had to borrow fifteen cents on the stage to pay fer thet ride no more city celebrations fer me i kin have all i want right here at riverport and then sammy related his adventures in detail to which our hero listened with much secret amusement over at the thompson place the ground had been plowed up in part and as soon as he left jerry borden randy set to work in earnest to plant late vegetables for what our hero had done for the bordens he was paid in vegetables and also received a rooster and four hens this gave the thompsons their own eggs for which the lady of the cottage was thankful randy was at work early one morning when jack appeared hullo at it already sang out jack i thought id find you still in bed i prefer to work when the sun is not so hot answered randy but what brings you out at such an hour as this ive got news what is it we are going to move to albany when the first of next week ill be sorry to miss you jack and ill be sorry to leave you randy but i came over for something more than to tell the news i want you to go fishing with me they say the sport is extra fine just now i dont know if i can go answered our hero doubtfully there is still enough to do here it will be a change for you you have worked very hard lately i admit that go by all means if you care to randy called out mrs thompson you have earned a holiday and the fish will be acceptable all right mother if you say so ill go it did not take randy long to prepare for the outing jack had with him a basket of lunch for two so all he had to get was his line and hooks and some extra bait i hope we catch a good mess today said randy as they started off then i can give mr borden some and he can let us have some bacon that we need i suppose it is rather hard scratching for you just now said jack it is and i am going to look for outside work before long well i hope you find something to do ben bash was looking for work all over this district but he couldnt find a thing oh i know there is small chance in riverport i think i may try elsewhere answered our hero it did not take the two boys long to reach the river at a point where jack had left his boat both rowed to their favorite fishing spot oh isnt that too bad cried jack in disappointment strangers were fishing at the spot and they soon saw that there was no room for them to throw in how is fishing called out randy very good answered one of those present well have to go elsewhere said jack the question is where i know another spot about quarter of a mile from here answered randy it may be just as good they rowed on and reached the new place to find nobody there soon they had their boat tied fast to an overhanging tree and then they got out on some flat rocks and baited up it did not take long to prove that the new fishing place was as good as the old randy drew in a small fish almost immediately and jack did the same then both got hauls of good size maybe well do better than if we went to the old fishing hole observed jack at noon time they knocked off for lunch and a rest and then took a good swim i can tell you i enjoy this cried randy i havent had a chance to go in for so long the swim at an end the boys donned their garments and resumed their fishing they kept at it until about four oclock then all their luck seemed to suddenly desert them never mind said randy we certainly have a prime haul even as it is and he looked the fish over with much pride they wound up their lines and were soon on the way down the river it was rather a hot day so they took their time in getting back what are you going to do with your boat asked randy sell it to mr stanwood for ten dollars you are lucky to get a customer jack i know it id turn the boat over to you only well we need the money now you know and jacks eyes dropped thank you jack but i wouldnt have much time to use it i must put in the most of my time at work i suppose that is true at the same time id rather you had the boat than anybody i know of the boys were coming around a bend of the river when they heard a peculiar noise in the distance what do you make that out to be asked jack as the noise continued i think i know answered our hero it is the new tugboat from the bay i saw it once several weeks ago it makes a very odd sound for the engine is not like the ordinary ones the noise kept coming closer and presently the tugboat came into view it was stuck in the mud and those on board were doing what they could to get the craft afloat again they seem to be having a hard time of it remarked jack as he stopped rowing to watch the proceedings the mud is very sticky here if youll remember answered randy dont you remember how we were stuck here last year yes and how i lost an oar overboard and nearly went overboard myself continued jack with a short laugh heighho randy ill be sorry in a way to lose it all we must write to each other of course the tug was puffing and snorting viciously to get out of the mud on board were four people who were evidently passengers including a lady with a little girl suddenly there came something which sounded like an explosion this was followed by a cloud of steam that seemed to completely envelop the tugboat something is wrong shouted randy oh mamma i dont like this screamed the little girl as she ran to the stern of the tug well be burned up she had scarcely spoken when there came another explosion and the cloud of steam increased the four passengers crowded to the stern in a body and a moment later the two men leaped overboard and called on the lady and her child to do likewise i cannot swim shrieked the lady you must jump answered somebody the tug may blow up the little girl heard this and with a scream she ran from her mother straight for the bow of the tug the next moment she lost her balance and went overboard shes over cried randy and his heart leaped into his throat save my child save helen shrieked the lady and rushed after her offspring soon she was in the water also the situation was certainly a thrilling one the two men in the water were fifty feet away and those left on the tug were in no position to render assistance the child had disappeared completely while the mother was thrashing around wildly in water just up to her neck quick jack turn the boat around ejaculated randy we must get them on board the craft was turned around and headed for the lady then randy threw off his cap he was already in his shirt sleeves and stood up in the bow he gazed anxiously into the muddy water and caught a dim view of the little girls white dress my child my child the mother continued to scream illustration ill bring her up said randy and made a leap overboard just as the gunwale of the rowboat came within reaching distance of the ladys hands the little girl had been caught by the current and was being carried down the stream randy made a quick grab but missed her and then she disappeared from view but in a few seconds more he saw her again and this time secured hold of her arm the next moment he raised her to the surface of the river she was too far gone to do anything but splutter she clutched him with a deathlike grip a thing every person in danger of drowning will do and he had his hands full to keep both himself and his burden afloat shallow water was not far off and he struck out for this and waded ashore in the meantime jack was having no easy time of it getting the lady into the rowboat there was serious danger of the craft overturning and he had to caution her to be careful my child my helen she moaned when she was at last safe my friend will save her answered jack you are sure yes chapter xii a steamboat man having saved the lady from her uncomfortable if not dangerous position jack lost no time in rowing for the shore soon he was at the river bank and the lady leaped out of the rowboat and ran to where randy had placed his dripping burden on the grass my helen is she safe asked the lady anxiously i think so answered our hero but i guess she swallowed some river water oh how thankful i am that you went after her it was the only thing to do i saw she couldnt swim the little girl was still gasping for breath the mother threw herself on the grass and did what she could for her soon the little girl gave a cry mamma yes darling i am here oh dear i am all wet be thankful that your life has been spared that boy brought me out of the water yes dear and he was brave to do it answered the mother and beamed on randy to such an extent that he had to blush by this time the two men had also come ashore the steam was still blowing off on the tug but the danger appeared to be over later the engineer announced that a valve and a connection had broken and the craft would have to remain where she was until towed off i am glad to see you are all safe said the man who ran the tug there wasnt very much danger on board it looked bad enough said one of the men who had leaped overboard i didnt want to get scalded and neither did i added the other it appeared that neither of the men knew the lady excepting by name she was however fairly well known to the tug captain and had gone up the river on the craft to please her little girl i am sorry for this mrs shalley said the tug owner i must say i dont know what to do i must get dry clothing on helen pretty soon the tug is wet from end to end from the escaped steam if i was down at riverport i could go to the hotel went on mrs shalley we can take you down in our rowboat said jack it wont take very long can i trust myself in the boat certainly if youll only sit still the matter was talked over and it was decided that the lady and her little girl should be taken down to riverport by randy and jack the party was soon on the way my name is mrs andrew shalley said the lady my husband is a steamboat owner may i ask your names mine is jack bartlett i live in riverport but i am going to move to albany and my name is randy thompson added our hero i live over there in the little cottage by that clump of trees i am pleased to know you said the lady it was more than kind of both of you to come to the assistance of myself and my daughter it wasnt so much to do answered randy we were close by you are soaking wet its an old working suit and i dont mind the water laughed our hero what a nice lot of fish said little helen who had now completely recovered i feel i should reward you both went on mrs shalley i dont want anything said jack promptly and neither do i added our hero the hotel at which the lady was stopping was built close to the river bank mother and child landed at the dock and randy and jack bade them goodby i shall try to see you again said mrs shalley as she started for the hotel evidently a very nice lady remarked jack as he and randy rowed away yes i think she wanted to reward us randy i think so myself but i dont want any reward neither do i although i shouldnt mind say ten thousand dollars went on jack by way of a joke or the presidency of the united states added randy in an equally light tone the boys had caught so many fish randy decided to sell some from his share he found a purchaser on the dock where they landed and started home richer by fifty cents if i cant get anything else to do i can do some fishing later on he mused i can get at least two or three dollars worth of fish a week and that would be better than nothing and i could keep right on with the farm too when randy returned home he had quite a story to tell to which both his father and his mother listened with interest randy you must be careful in the water said mrs thompson with an anxious look in her eyes supposing that girl had dragged you down i was on my guard mother randy is a good swimmer said his father i was a good swimmer myself in my younger days the fish proved acceptable and randy readily got jerry borden to trade him some bacon for a mess and also give him some fresh vegetables gosh wish id gone fishing said sammy i like to catch big fish well i am not going to stop you said our hero sammy never has no luck put in mrs borden once he went fishing all day and all he got was three little fish didnt nuther cried sammy i got twelve big bites but they got away its the big fish that always get away said randy with a smile never mind sammy maybe we can go together some day id like that answered the overgrown country boy did that bartlett boy get any fish asked mrs borden just as many as i did i understand they are going to move away yes to albany they say down to the iron works that mr bangs is glad to have mr bartlett out of the place i guess that is true its too bad all of the men liked mr bartlett dont they like mr bangs not a bit so mr reilly was telling my husband they say mr bangs is mean to everybody two days slipped by and randy was at work in the garden one afternoon when he saw a buggy stop at the front of the cottage and a portly man alighted knowing his mother was busy our hero went to meet the newcomer is this where randy thompson lives asked the portly gentleman yes sir i am randy thompson oh the gentleman held out his hand i am glad to know you my name is andrew shalley you did my wife and little girl a great service the other day i only did what seemed necessary answered randy modestly will you come into the house mr shalley thanks ill sit down on your porch the gentleman did so what are you doing farming a little we got this place so late this season i cannot do a great deal next year i hope to have the farm in much better shape do you like it i try to like it then you are not naturally a farmer no sir is your father living yes sir but he is laid up with rheumatism so he cannot work at present he is a carpenter indeed i was a carpenter when i was a young man i thought mrs shalley said you were a steamboat owner i am now i gave up carpentering to go into the freight business i made money and then bought a small freight boat then i branched out and now own a steamboat running up and down the hudson river and i also own several steam tugs do you own the one that got into trouble the other day no a friend of mine owns that that is how my wife and little girl happened to be on board i am mr shalley stopped short as a form appeared in the doorway behind him this is my mother mother this is mr shalley the steamboat owner i am glad to meet you said mrs thompson politely will you come in thank you but it is very pleasant on the porch madam you have a good son went on the steamboat owner i know that he did my wife and little girl a great service the other day yes he told me what he did i think er that is id like to reward you stammered andrew shalley he saw that randy was no common boy with whom to deal thank you but i dont wish any reward sir i felt you would say that answered andrew shalley the other lad said the same then you have seen jack bartlett yes i just came from there i wanted to reward him but he would not have it but i fixed him and the steamboat owner smiled broadly yes said mrs thompson curiously i found out he was going to move to albany so i gave him a free pass on my steamboat the helen shalley named after my wife now he can go up and down the river as much as he pleases and it wont cost him a cent i told him id depend upon him to haul folks out of the water if they fell overboard and the steamboat owner laughed broadly that ought to suit jack he loves the water so said randy do you like the water too yes sir then maybe youd like a pass also i couldnt use it mr shalley i was only joking but really randy id like to do something for you to show i appreciate what you did for my wife and for helen i do not want anything mr shalley excepting work work i should imagine you had enough of that right here i mean work that would pay me regular wages we must have money my father needs the doctor and medicine and we have to buy groceries and such and we cant make the farm pay the bills i understand my lad where is your father i am here sir came from the couch in the sitting room may i come in mr thompson certainly answered the sick man and a moment later andrew shalley entered the cottage and was shaking hands with randys father chapter xiii mr shalley makes an offer the two men conversed together for fully half an hour and during that time andrew shalley learned much concerning the thompson family and their struggle to make both ends meet i live at nyack said andrew shalley and my headquarters for boats is there also but the passenger steamer runs from new york city to albany the tugs run anywhere on the river and on new york bay it must be a nice business said randy i like boats of any kind if i had a boat on the river here i might give you a job went on the gentleman but all of my craft are on the hudson they tell me that the hudson is a grand stream nothing finer in this country my boy nothing finer i have traveled all over the united states and i know i think it is fully equal to the german rhine and the st lawrence maybe you could give me a situation on one of your hudson river boats went on randy struck by a sudden idea would you care to leave home oh randy you wouldnt want to go away cried mrs thompson i would if it paid to do so answered randy quickly there isnt much chance for work in riverport and i can keep an eye on the garden said mr thompson i know i am going to feel some better now this spell is passing if you cared to leave home i might give you some sort of a job on one of my boats went on andrew shalley thoughtfully what kind of a job id have to see about it first ill tell you what ill do ill send you a letter next week thank you that will be best but now i am going to do something else the steamboat man drew out his wallet i want you to accept this and he held out five crisp tendollar bills randy did not wish to take the money but the steamboat man urged it and finally laid the bills on the table i am sure you are more than kind mr shalley said mrs thompson i shall remember you let us call it a loan said mr thompson to be paid back when i am at work once more yes call it a loan said randy otherwise i for one dont want it have your way laughed mr shalley but dont worry about the payment before he left he walked around the little farm and praised what randy had done evidently not a lazy boy he told himself and one who is willing to aid his parents that is the sort i like he is a very nice man said mrs thompson when the visitor had departed randy you were fortunate to make such a friend yes but mother i think we ought to pay back that money some day i can do that when i am able to go at carpentering again put in mr thompson after that a week passed quietly enough randy worked early and late and got the little farm in good shape and also visited jack and bade his friend goodby maybe ill get a position on one of the hudson river boats said our hero if you do and you stop at albany you must come and see me answered jack and gave his new address on the following monday came a letter from andrew shalley it was short and to the point and read in part as follows all i can offer you at present is the position of a deckhand on my steamboat the helen shalley if you wish to accept that i will pay you twenty dollars per month and your board at the start and more when you are experienced if you wish to accept write to me and come on to nyack to my office heres an offer at last cried randy as he read the communication he had been fearful that andrew shalley might forget him twenty dollars per month is not so very much said his mother yes but i am to get my board so the money will all be clear profit outside of the cost of my clothing i suppose you will live on the boat put in mr thompson most of the crew do i can send the most of the money home each month continued randy the boat wont run during the winter said his mother who did not much relish having her son leave home well it will run until cold weather anyway and perhaps after that mr shalley will give me something else to do the matter was discussed that evening and before he retired randy penned a letter to the steamboat owner stating he would come to nyack two days later the prospects ahead filled our hero with pleasure the new position would enable him to see a little of the world and meet other people and he was sure steamboat life would suit him thoroughly he knew there would be plenty of hard work handling freight and baggage but this did not daunt him ill try to do my best he reasoned then maybe mr shalley will give me something better later on randy did not have many clothes so there was not a great deal to pack what he possessed was gone over by his mother and then packed in a valise out of the money on hand he was given the price of his stage and railroad ticket and five dollars for other expenses i shant spend only what is necessary said he to his parents randy was glad to see that his father was improving a good deal of the rheumatic pains had left mr thompson and he could get around the house and the garden it would be some time before he could go at carpentering again but he could aid a good deal on the farm which was something all too soon for his mother came the time for randy to depart mrs thompson kissed him affectionately and his father shook him by the hand come back home if it doesnt suit you randy said the mother yes come back and well get along somehow added his father i am sure it will suit me said the boy i know the kind of a man mr shalley is well be sure to get along randy left home early in the morning and half an hour later was on the stage bound for leeville where he was to take the train for tarrytown which is directly across the hudson river from nyack his going away was done so quietly that not a dozen persons knew of his departure the stage was but half filled so he had plenty of room both for himself and his valise arriving at leeville he had an hour to wait for the train and spent the time in walking around the little town he had just passed one of the largest stores when he felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to find himself confronted by bob bangs what are you doing here demanded the big boy rather impudently what business is that of yours retorted randy not liking the manner in which he had been addressed oh you neednt answer if you dont want to sniffed bob bangs i am going to nyack to nyack what for i am going to work for a steamboat owner humph going to work on the river yes cabin boy i suppose sneered the rich boy no as a deckhand i thought so its a dirty enough job and you are welcome to it its honest work and the money is clean answered randy warmly ha what do you mean by clean money demanded the big boy suspiciously just what i said maybe you are trying to help spread that report that the bartletts started about us said the rich youth what report do you mean bob you know well enough the one about my father i dont know aint the bartletts telling everybody that my father shoved em out of the iron works and that our money wasnt clean i havent heard it bah you neednt play the innocent i know you and i know jack bartlett too i dont think your folks treated the bartletts just right went on our hero resolved to stand up for his friends we treated em better than they deserved if i had been my father i should have kicked old man bartlett out your father wouldnt have dared bob bangs but i am not going to quarrel with you what brings you to this place thats my business you neednt tell me if you dont wish to i am here to get a new horse i am going to ride horseback after this went on the rich boy boastfully its a horse that costs four hundred dollars too then you are in luck was all randy answered and walked away leaving the rich youth gazing after him doubtfully chapter xiv bob bangs and his horse randy continued to wander around the country town taking in such sights as came to view in the meantime bob bangs went after the horse he had mentioned the rich youth had bothered his father for a horse for a long time and at last mr bangs had consented to give him a steed the horse was to be taken in exchange for a debt and bob had agreed to go to leeville after him and take the animal to the summer resort at which he and his mother were stopping it may be mentioned that the horse was worth only a hundred and fifty dollars but the falsehood he had told in regard to the horses value did not bother bob bangs in the least he loved to boast upon every possible occasion is he gentle asked the rich boy as he approached the horse that was standing in the yard of the former owner as gentle as a lamb was the answer he he wont run away will he went on bob timidly to tell the truth he knew very little about horses although he pretended to know a great deal he never ran away in his life declared the man who was disposing of the horse then i guess it is all right said the rich boy and started to mount into the saddle for the steed was ready for use wait a minute whats wanted now i want you to sign a receipt first said the man oh all right the receipt was produced stating that the horse was received in good condition and that the debt was canceled thereby and the rich youth signed his fathers name and his own under it then the man held the horse while the boy mounted all safe and sound asked the man yes answered bob bangs goodday and off he rode goodday and good luck to you answered the man and he smiled rather grimly to himself as he entered his house the horse seems to be a nice one thought bob bangs as he rode away i wish i could meet randy thompson it would make him feel sick to see me on such a fine animal the rich youths wish was gratified for turning a corner he caught sight of our hero just as the latter was crossing the street out of the way there randy thompson he cried and urged his horse forward randy had to jump back or he might have been knocked down aint this a fine horse bob bangs cried dont you wish you had him and he cut the steed with the whip he carried to make him increase his speed the horse did not like the treatment received and up came his hind hoofs viciously stop none of that roared bob bangs in fright whoa there he began to saw on the reins and as a consequence the horse turned first in one direction and then another then he started to back and came up on the sidewalk scaring several women and children whoa get up screamed bob bangs more frightened than ever whoa i say what in the old harry is in the beast anyway look out there shouted a man in the crowd youll go through a window next bob let me lead him into the street cried randy rushing up and catching the horse by the bridle you let my horse alone shouted the rich boy unreasonably i can manage him well enough very well answered randy quietly and dropped his hold as he did so the steed made a plunge along the sidewalk for several yards knocking over a barbers pole and a newsstand stop dot vot you mean py dot yelled the german barber rushing from his establishment in alarm get along there you brute cried bob bangs savagely and struck the horse once more again the steed swerved and made a half turn and began to back stop him he is going into the window crash and then followed a jingle of glass and into the window of a grocery next to the barber shop backed the horse until his hind hoofs rested on a row of canned tomatoes and sardines bob bangs gave a yell of fear and terror and dropped to the sidewalk and then caught the horse by the head the groceryman came forth from his store in a hurry and a bitter argument ensued while a big crowd began to collect in the end bob bangs had to promise to pay for all damage done and led his horse away by hand too fearful of further trouble to mount once more randy did not wait to see the end of the dispute for the train was now due and he had just time enough to hurry to the depot and get aboard the cars he dropped into the first seat that came to hand and laughed heartily you seem to be enjoying yourself said a man sitting near i just saw something very funny answered our hero and told what it was the man laughed too it puts me in mind of the time i tried to ride the mule in the circus it was a trick animal and got me into seven kinds of trouble randy had not had many opportunities to ride on the cars and he enjoyed the trip to tarrytown very much noon found him in the city named and he crossed the river on the ferryboat then he hunted up a cheap but neat restaurant where he got dinner no use of bothering mr shalley just at noon hour he thought and so did not go around to the steamboat mans office until one oclock a clerk was present who said his employer would come in at two oclock so our hero had another hour to wait is your name randy thompson questioned the clerk when told that it was he continued mr shalley is expecting you i believe you are to be one of the new deckhands yes i hope you find the work agreeable so do i the other new hand didnt last long how long just one week what was the matter i believe he said he couldnt get along with polk the purser i hope i dont have any trouble with anybody said randy anxiously i am willing to work hard youll find captain hadley a fine man to deal with i think he is one of the nicest captains on the river what do you do here oh i am general office clerk my name is bart sandwood i am glad to know you mr sandwood answered our hero and smiled i hope business is good with the steamer travel has been very good and we are getting our share of freight the other lines bother us some but not a great deal is the helen shalley one of the big boats of the river not one of the largest but she is by no means a small boat then you havent seen her not yet but i hope to soon she will be on her way down the river this afternoon she runs from new york to albany one day and back the next she doesnt run on sundays i am glad of that i dont care to work on sunday well youll have to do a little when there are no passengers on board that is the time to put things in order true enough i am afraid i will be green were you never a deckhand before never at this the clerk gave a low whistle i dont know if captain hadley will like that or not he is a very strict man even though kind i shall do my best to please him early in the spring we had two green hands but they couldnt learn at all and the captain said they were more bother than they were worth i am sure i can learn anyway i mean to try you certainly look bright enough to learn the other fellows were illiterate foreigners and always tumbling over their own feet one dropped a trunk on a passengers foot and the other broke open a box with some fine dishes that capped the climax and the captain got rid of them just as soon as he could find some other hands to take their places concluded bart sandwood chapter xv randy as a deckhand when mr andrew shalley came in he was full of business he nodded pleasantly to randy i will see you in a little while he said and turned to his clerk then bart sandwood was sent off on an errand and the steamboat owner turned to look over some letters that had come in now i am at liberty he said pleasantly shaking hands are you ready for work yes sir answered randy promptly good have you ever been on a large river steamer no mr shalley but i am willing to do all i possibly can to make myself truly useful well if i am any judge of character youll get along all youve got to do is to keep your eyes open and obey orders we have one old deckhand pat malloy he will teach you what to do when can i go to work the boat will be along down the river soon ill take you on board as i want to see the captain as soon as you are settled ill have you fitted out with a uniform how much will that cost me in your case it wont cost anything you are very kind remember i take a personal interest in you randy and i want to see you get along do your duty and rest assured i shall not forget you i dont think ill disappoint you mr shalley randy waited around the office until it was almost time for the steamboat to make a landing then he went down to the dock with his newlyfound friend here were a number of passengers and also a quantity of baggage and freight presently the helen shalley hove into sight with flags flying bravely in the breeze as randy had been told she was not a particularly large steamboat but she was well proportioned and graceful and well liked by those who patronized her we will get better acquainted with the craft as our story proceeds as soon as a landing was made mr shalley went on board taking randy with him captain hadley was at hand so this is the new deckhand eh said the captain in bluff tones pretty strong are you i think so answered randy respectfully well youll have to be to stand this work know anything about handling trunks and such stuff not a great deal but i think i can learn we are shorthanded so you can jump right in went on the captain of the steamboat yes sir who will tell me what to do pat malloy he is the head man of the gang here malloy he called out aye aye sur answered a brawny and jollylooking irishman coming forward and touching his cap heres your new hand pat malloy looked at randy in some astonishment our hero was neatly dressed and did not look as if he was used to hard labor sure an its only a boy murmured the head deckhand he says he can work give him a chance put in andrew shalley there was plenty to do and randy threw off his coat took off his collar and tie and pitched in the labor was by no means easy and he had not the trick of throwing up a trunk to the best advantage yet he did very well and pat malloy nodded approvingly sure an ye do better nor some o thim foreigners already he declared kape it up an well git along foine together captain hadley and andrew shalley watched the work for several minutes and then walked to the cabin of the steamboat here the owner of the boat told something about randy i want you to give him a chance even if he is a bit green said he i want the lad to get along he shall have all the chance possible answered captain hadley i am glad to get a hand who is intelligent then the two conversed upon private matters until the boat was ready to leave nyack goodby my boy cried mr shalley on leaving take good care of yourself and let me know how you get along thank you i will answered our hero it may be hard work at first but youll get used to it i am not afraid of hard work the captain will give you a uniform in a few days the gangplanks were hauled in the lines cast off and with a hoarse whistle the helen shalley continued on her course down the hudson there was a small italian band on board consisting of two violins a harp and a clarionet and they struck up a popular air the work at the dock had somewhat exhausted randy who was not used to handling such heavy stuff so quickly but he took pains to conceal his feelings i am not going to back down no matter how hard the work is he told himself others can do it and so can i among the deckhands was a tall limber american man named jones he came up to randy after the work was done malloy told me to show you around the boat and give you some pointers said jones come ahead they passed from one end of the steamboat to the other through all of the three decks and jones named over the various parts and told what the deckhands were expected to do then they went below and he told of some work there lastly he took randy to the sleeping quarters this is my bunk said jack jones that will be yours over there when you get the chance ill advise you to air your bedding you can do it after we tie up in new york and the passengers go ashore the quarters were small but not any smaller than randys garret apartment in the cottage everything was kept as clean as wax for both malloy and jones were enemies to dirt randy was glad to learn this and resolved to give the others no cause for complaint regarding his own personal habits some boats are very dirty and the bunks not fit for a dog to sleep in said jack jones but malloy wont allow it on this boat and i wont have it either and i am with you answered our hero came from a farm didnt you yes but our family wasnt on the farm long i came from a farm myself how long have you been on this boat came the middle of last season do you like it if i didnt i shouldnt be here i suppose that is so captain hadley is a fine man to work for he is strict but fair and that is what i like what about the others the mate tom blossom is nice too the man we all hate is peter polk the purser whats the matter with him well between you and me i think he is a sneak in what way he is always making trouble for somebody nobody seems to like him much although he attends strictly to business i hope i dont have trouble with mr polk well you will have to watch yourself several other landings were made and promptly at the appointed time the helen shalley swung into her dock at new york city and the remaining passengers went ashore then began the labor of unloading the baggage and freight after which the deck was swabbed up the brasswork polished and such baggage as was at hand taken on board for transportation up the river the next day when he had finished his days labors randy was tired and perfectly willing to rest for a while he had had a good supper and might have gone directly to bed but instead he sat up to write a letter to the folks at home telling his father and mother of his days experience our hero had to go ashore to post the communication and once out in the street he resolved to take a little walk around before returning to the steamboat he was soon walking along west street and then took to a side street running up to the avenues now although our hero did not know it he had chosen one of the worst streets in this part of the great city it was filled with tenements and groggeries of the lowest description and the sidewalks swarmed with all sorts of low characters he had scarcely walked two squares before a roughlooking fellow jostled him the next instant randy felt a hand in his pocket stop that cried randy but the fellow was already running up the street our hero clapped his hand in the pocket and discovered that eighty cents in change was missing i am not going to lose that money he told himself with vigor i may be a greeny but ill give that thief some trouble at first he thought to cry out but then reconsidered the matter and remained silent he set off after the thief and away went man and boy along the crowded thoroughfare the man evidently thought he could lose himself in the crowd but by the aid of the street lights randy kept him in sight he passed along for two blocks and then turned into a side street and then into a blind alley our hero managed to keep him in view and saw him spring up the steps of a dilapidated tenement house the man ran through the lower hallway and into the back yard piled high with rubbish of all kinds here he hid behind some empty boxes randy was soon in the yard and gazing around eagerly as he did so he saw a thin and pale girl of about ten standing near soon she came up to him timidly did you see a man run in here said randy yes she answered but in a hesitating voice where did he go i dont dare tell you whispered the girl why not that is bill hosker and who is bill hosker dont you know him and the little girls eyes opened in astonishment no i dont bill hosker is the boss around here he does just as he pleases if anybody crosses him bill most kills them oh hes a bully is that it yes well where did he go you wont tell him i told you no he crawled in behind those boxes answered the little girl and then ran away randy waited to hear no more but made a dash for the boxes as he did so the fellow who had robbed him leaped up club in hand go out of here he cried in a hoarse voice i dont want anything to do with a kid like you you give me my money answered randy vigorously i am not going to let the like of you rob me ho ho hear the kid talk go away before i maul ye and bill hosker brandished his club but our hero was not to be daunted thus readily and looking around he espied a stick and picked it up then he advanced upon bill hosker who promptly leaped to the top of a big packing case the next instant he came down upon randy bearing him to the ground our hero tried to defend himself but it was useless he was crushed beneath that heavy weight and then the rascal gave him a crack on the head that stretched him senseless chapter xvi in new york city will he live mamma i think so rose but he has been badly misused bill hosker ought to be locked up for it nobody will lock bill up he has too much influence with the politicians answered the woman she was bending over randy who was still unconscious mother and daughter had carried our hero from the yard to their room in the rear of the tenement nobody else had been around the girl had witnessed bill hoskers nefarious deed and had at once summoned her parent mrs clare was a poor widow lady who supported herself by sewing rose was her only child and did what she could to help her mother sewing did not pay well and the clares had all they could do to make both ends meet but mrs clare had a warm heart and so had rose and it pained them greatly to see randy so mistreated they carried him into their one room and placed him on their bed and did what they could for him at last he opened his eyes and stared around him then he sat up slowly where am i he asked faintly we brought you into the house mother and i answered rose dont you remember bill hosker struck you down oh yes i remember that now randy took a deep breath and put his hand to his head he hit me pretty hard didnt he i am afraid he did answered mrs clare it was a shame too where is he now he ran away he stole eighty cents from me perhaps he took more said rose he went through your pockets after he knocked you down i saw him do it with his head still aching our hero felt in first one pocket and then another he gave something like a groan every cent is gone how much did you have between four and five dollars i am sorry for you said mrs clare but i am afraid you will never see your money again does that rascal live around here sometimes he comes and goes to suit himself i suppose he will stay away now for a while is there any use of my reporting this to the police do you think i dont think so he once took my pocketbook from the table here i am sure of it but when i reported it to the police nothing was done they said his word was as good as mine how long have i been here about half an hour then he has had a good chance to get away did you bring me here yes you are very kind mrs i am mrs clare and this is my daughter rose and i am randy thompson a deckhand on the hudson river steamboat helen shalley oh mrs clare paused for a moment do you know mr polk the purser yes but not very well i just got the job as a deckhand today mr polk is a relative of mine by marriage i see we that is well we are not very good friends went on mrs clare mamma thinks mr polk hasnt been honest with us put in rose quickly i dont think so either rose you must not talk so but it is true isnt it returned the daughter i may be misjudging cousin peter said mrs clare you see she added by way of an explanation my cousin peter polk had the settlement of my husbands affairs when he died and i have always imagined that well that rose and i did not get exactly what was coming to us mamma thought the account was three hundred dollars short said rose who was inclined to be blunt couldnt you get a clear statement questioned randy with interest we got a statement but it was not clear to me answered mrs clare as soon as he felt able to do so randy got on his feet he felt rather dizzy and he had a large lump over his left ear where he had been struck by the club see here he said when he was ready to depart i am much obliged to you for what you have done but id like you to do more if you will as soon as this bill hosker comes back to this neighborhood let me know youll always find me on board of the helen shalley ill let you know answered rose but dont let bill hosker know who told you or hell want to kill me when randy got back to the steamboat he felt so weak he could scarcely walk on board jones came forward to meet him say you aint been drinking have you he demanded as he saw our hero stagger no i dont drink answered randy ive been knocked down and robbed and sitting down on a bench he told his story to the other deckhand and let jones feel of the lump on his head i was going to warn you when you went ashore but i thought youd be wise enough to keep out of trouble its a shame they told me it wouldnt do any good to tell the police i am afraid not such things happen pretty often in that kind of a neighborhood randy was glad enough to turn in he bathed the lump with cold water and put on some witchhazel which made it feel better despite the adventure he slept soundly until it was time to turn out in the morning i suppose youll want some money said jones i can lend you a dollar till pay day if you wish thank you returned randy you are kind and ill accept the loan ill pay you back just as soon as i get my pay i hate to be without a cent in my pocket i have been there myself and know just how it feels answered jones he had in his rough way taken a fancy to our hero which feeling was reciprocated there was plenty to do before the steamboat left the dock at new york city and randys arms ached when the command came to cast off the lines he had done his full share of the labor and pat malloy nodded approvingly kape it up an youll be all roight said the head deckhand the trip to albany that day had much of novelty in it for randy there was a good deal of work of which he had not dreamed before yet there were also times when he could look at the scenery as the big craft glided along at the newsstand on board there was a big folding map of the river showing the different towns and points of interest and this the standkeeper loaned him for a couple of hours he studied the map closely and was soon able to recognize certain points as they appeared several days slipped by and randy felt quite at home on board he had been supplied with the regulation deckhands outfit dark blue shirt and trousers and a cap to match and looked very well when thus attired he was getting acquainted with the work and could handle a trunk or a box or barrel almost as well as jones or malloy how does the boy do asked captain hadley of malloy its the new broom as swapes clane answered the head deckhand i aint braggin yit captain but he is doing all right so far aye aye sur very well indade i am glad to hear it mr shalley told me the boy needed the job his father is on the sick list and he has got to do what he can to help support his parents i reckon hell be all right answered pat malloy hes better than thim foreigners anyway to him the only foreigners were italians and germans he did not think himself one although he had come from the ould sod less than six years before chapter xvii the purser has his say one night when the steamboat was tied up at albany randy donned his street clothes and hunted up the place where jack bartlett lived he found his former friend at home and glad to see him come in said jack shaking hands how have you been since we met last pretty fair jack and how have you been im all right ive got a job that is why i havent used my boat pass a job yes i am working in the same place where father has a position then you are not going to school again not for the present jack lowered his voice you see father isnt earning any too much so i well i thought id help the family along the two friends sat down in the parlor and our hero told his tale and then jack related some of his own experiences my father is in hopes that he can get at mr bangs before long said jack the trouble is some papers are missing he had them in a desk at the works but when he came away he couldnt find them perhaps mr bangs got them it is possible but father cant prove it have you seen or heard anything of bob bangs lately he is along the hudson somewhere on a vacation with his mother i met him when he was getting a horse answered our hero and told of what had happened i wish i had been there cried jack laughing heartily ill wager bob was as mad as seventeen hornets yes indeed he must have had a good bill to pay for damages randy spent a pleasant two hours with jack and then went back to the boat jack promising to visit the craft some night when the helen shalley should tie up at albany again so far matters had gone well on board randy was much amused by the passengers especially those who were peculiar in their manners there was one fussy old gentleman who went up and down the river twice a week he always wanted to sit in a corner in the shade and asked a dozen times a day if they werent behindhand we are exactly on time said randy to him one day hum cried the old gentleman consulting a watch he carried i think we are twenty minutes behindhand we havent been twenty minutes behindhand since ive been on the boat said randy as he moved off the old gentleman grumbled to himself and restored his timepiece to his pocket a minute later randy saw an englishman saunter along the deck and stop close to the old gentleman randy had noticed the englishman before because he spoke with a strong cockney accent that is he dropped hs where they were wanted and put them in when not needed at this time the steamboat was just approaching the highlands the englishman pointed to the highlands with his cane and addressed the old gentleman hexcuse me he said but are those the ighlands you brag about in this country the islands was the astonished reply why no sir those are not islands at all have you never studied geography an island is entirely surrounded by water continued the fussy old gentleman oh you mean hilands i dont mean them at all dont you know i repeat are those the ighlands you talk about so much went on the cockney blandly they are not islands sir they are the highlands shouted the old gentleman just exactly what i said sir the ighlands no not islands highlands hexactly but you said islands no i did not say hilands i said the ighlands went on the cockney hevidently you dont understand good plain henglish and he walked off in disgust the imp the blithering imp growled the old gentleman may he never come near me again at one of the landings a barrel for use on the boat broke spilling some fancy flour on the deck randy was clearing up the muss when the purser peter polk came along our hero did not witness his approach and consequently the purser received some dust on his shoes which had just been polished hi hi have a care there he cried what do you mean by covering me with dust excuse me sir said randy hastily i didnt see you coming i just had those shoes shined i am sorry sir youre the new man eh yes sir youre a blockhead it seems to me went on the purser who was in particularly bad humor that day an angry remark rose to randys lips but he repressed it you be more careful in the future or youll get into trouble grumbled the purser and walked away the moment the purser was gone jones came up to our hero brute aint he he said in a low voice he called me a blockhead randys eyes were flashing dont you mind him lad he is sour all the way through he dont seem to be able to help it i didnt see him coming he should have looked where he was walking i dont wonder the hands dont like him went on randy i dont think captain hadley would have spoken so not a bit of it the captains a gentleman every inch of him how do he and the purser get along together none too good so ive been told i wish we had a man in place of polk so do i more than likely when he comes to pay you your wages hell take out the price of a shoe shine would he really be mean enough to do that polk is about mean enough to do anything there the talk ended and randy finished up his work the day passed and when the steamboat tied up that night randy was more than usually sleepy it was very warm and he went on the upper deck to get a breath of fresh air see here said the purser coming up to him rather suddenly are you talking about me talking about you repeated our hero somewhat puzzled that is what i said not particularly mr polk somebody on this boat is telling tales about me and i dont like it to this randy made no answer have you heard any stories went on peter polk what kind of stories that i was going to leave the steamboat no sir no stories at all no sir humph and with this the purser walked away what did he want now asked jones coming up a little later wanted to know if i had been circulating stories about him did you tell him no i did ive heard a story in a roundabout way that mr shalley is getting tired of the way polk runs the money matters on this boat does he run all the money matters sure that is a pursers business he does the buying or most of it too i see i dont believe he buys to advantage went on jones closing one eye suggestively i dont understand maybe he buys at two prices some of em do you know randy did not know but he did not say so i knew a purser once on the sea shell who used to pay one price for a thing and then charge the owners of the vessel another price at last they caught him at it and sent him to prison this opened randys eyes to what his fellowdeckhand was driving at do you imagine polk is that sort he is certainly close so you said before well he ought to be watched oh its not my affair said jones say i am going to bed he added so am i said randy and retired thinking of what jones had said and also of what the clares had told him regarding peter polk chapter xviii a meeting on the river two weeks passed and randy felt quite at home on board of the steamboat he had learned his duties fully and was giving satisfaction to captain hadley and pat malloy his only enemy seemed to be polk the purser who was as disagreeable as possible our hero did his best to steer clear of the fellow and in a measure succeeded one evening while the boat was tied up at the dock in new york randy chanced to look ashore when he saw rose clare motioning to him he at once joined the girl i came down to tell you that bill hosker was around yesterday said the girl to our hero is he around now questioned randy quickly no he went away yesterday evening he was only around about two hours i wish i had seen him i thought youd like to know about it i came down last night but a man here told me you were at albany yes we come to new york every other night not counting sundays i think bill hosker will come again soon i suppose he thinks you have given up trying to find him well i havent given it up rose how are things going with yourself and your mother not very good cant she get much sewing to do she and i made only five dollars and a quarter last week and what rent do you pay six dollars a month for just the one room that is certainly hard i wish i could help you but i cant at least not now we wouldnt want help if only we could get more sewing ill ask captain hadley about it he has a wife and a family of girls randy was as good as his word he met the captain the next day when the officer appeared to have little to do captain may i speak to you a moment he asked respectfully and at the same time tipping his cap what is it randy i know a poor lady in new york who does sewing for a living she is anxious to get more work and i am anxious to help her if i possibly can do you know of anybody who would like some sewing done your wife or anybody else hm i dont know answered the steamboat captain ill remember what you say and see is that all yes sir where does the poor woman live not far from our landing place in new york he gave the street and number it isnt a nice neighborhood but it is the best the woman can afford he added yes i know many folks in new york who live in bad neighborhoods simply because they cannot afford something better i will speak to my wife about this the captain did as he had promised mrs hadley was going to new york the next day and said she would call upon mrs clare the family lived in albany so that the captain was home every other night mrs hadley was as good as her word she was a christian woman a worker in the church and she became at once interested in mrs clare and her daughter rose this is no place for rose said she this foul air is bad for her i know it but i do not see how i can turn myself said mrs clare with a sigh poverty had completely broken her spirit the captains wife looked over some of the sewing that mrs clare had done and soon learned that the woman was a clever seamstress then she made an offer if you wish you can come to my home with me she said you can sew for me and rose can go to school and also help around the house i will give you five dollars a week and your board i will accept gladly cried the poor woman and burst into tears of gratitude it was arranged that mrs clare should leave new york on the following saturday she was to sell off the most of her things alas there were not many articles to dispose of and the others were to be transferred to albany on the boat my cousin mr polk will be surprised to learn of this move said mrs clare to the captains wife what is he your cousin queried mrs hadley yes by marriage and then mrs clare told her tale of suffering to which the captains wife gave a willing ear i must speak of this to my husband said mrs hadley i do not think he likes mr polk very much on saturday randy was moving some baggage from one side of the lower deck to the other when peter polk came along as luck would have it some trunks were in the way so that the purser could not pass look here you blockhead why dont you keep this gangway clear he roared to randy i am trying to clear it now answered our hero as calmly as he could it ought to be kept clear always who ordered this stuff here anyway mr malloy he had no business to do it why didnt i id like to be after knowin came in a voice from behind the purser and the head deckhand appeared on the scene oh so youre here are you sneered peter polk i am that mr polk i ordered thim trunks there have ye anything against it demanded malloy boldly if ye have report to the captain youre blocking the whole gangway thim trunks had to be shifted an thompson is shiftin em humph i know me juty on this boat mr polk well er hurry up then and clear this gangway grumbled the purser and walked away malloy closed one eye and looked at randy suggestively with the other he knew he had no right to interfere its not his line o juty said the head deckhand randy completed his work and then went to one of the upper decks to fix some of the awnings to his surprise he found mrs clare and rose there in conversation with peter polk going to albany the purser was saying what for i have a situation there and rose is going also answered the poor woman what kind of a situation i am to sew for mrs hadley not the captains wife yes at this announcement the face of the purser dropped evidently the news did not please him you wont find that very pleasant he said it will be better than starving in the city peter how much is she going to pay you mrs clare told him that is not a fortune you ought to be able to earn more in new york i couldnt get the work i might have gotten something for you if you had let me know went on peter polk thank you i prefer to look out for myself answered mrs clare coolly this looks as if i was letting one of my relatives live on charity pursued the purser i do not consider it a charity how did the captains wife hear of you why she there is a boy on this boat there he is he spoke to the captain about it you mean randy thompson yes that is his name he got the place for you yes how did you happen to know him its a long story he was knocked down and robbed and rose and i went to his assistance but we must go now mrs hadley wanted us to do some sewing for the captain while on this trip and mrs clare walked away followed by rose peter polk gazed after them thoughtfully i hope she doesnt get the captains wife too much interested in her affairs he muttered to himself i shouldnt care to have the old accounts raked up in court chapter xix an unlookedfor encounter it was now early in september and the travel down the river was particularly heavy for many folks who had been away for a vacation were returning to the metropolis baggage kept pouring in until the lower deck was practically filled this is a banner season so malloy tells me said jones to randy i know there is lots of work answered our hero whose arms ached not a little never mind ive got good news what is that mr shalley is going to allow us an extra five dollars this month good enough randy had received several letters from home matters were going smoothly and mr thompson was feeling better every day the garden was doing finely in one letter mrs thompson wrote that there had been two strikes at the iron works each due to mr bangs overbearing manner towards his workmen i thought hed have trouble sooner or later said randy to himself as he perused the communication what a pity that mr bartlett isnt in charge one fine afternoon the helen shalley was steaming down the river as usual and randy was near the bow coiling up a hawser when he noticed a sloop some distance ahead it was tacking in an uncertain manner as if the party on board did not know much about sailing such a craft the sloop was directly in the path of the big steamboat and the latter gave a warning whistle and then turned to one side as she did this the sloop turned in the same direction hullo what does that fellow in the sloop mean cried randy to jones who was near whats the matter hell be run down if he doesnt look out some fool that doesnt know how to sail a boat i guess said the other deckhand swiftly the steamboat and the sloop drew close to one another the big boat let out another warning blast and again the pilot turned her out of her course but the sloop also turned there is only one young fellow on board said jones look he acts as if he was scared out of his wits i know him fairly shouted our hero you do yes it is bob bangs the rich young fellow i told you about the fellow who couldnt manage his hoss the same well he doesnt seem to know no more about his boat than he did about that hoss was the deckhands comment we are going to run into him gasped randy no he is going to run into us it will amount to the same thing so far as he is concerned maybe but it will be his fault if he gets drowned another warning whistle now rang out but was of no avail the sloop swerved again and then came squarely up to the big steamboat which was now backing water furiously stop dont run me down screamed bob bangs he was fairly white with terror his cries were cut short by the crash as the sloop struck the bow was splintered and the shock threw bob bangs overboard luckily he was far enough away to escape the paddlewheel as the helen shalley continued to go ahead despite the fact that her engines had been reversed the first surprise over randy was quick to act not far away was a life preserver having a line attached to it and this he took from its hooks he waited for the rich boy to appear soon he came up spluttering catch the preserver called out our hero and cast the article in such a skillful manner that it fell within easy reach save me save me gasped the rich youth throwing his arms wildly about him take hold of the life preserver called out half a hundred people at once then several other cries rang out at last the motion of the water washed the life preserver up against bob bangs arm he clutched at it desperately by this time the steamboat had come to a standstill and it was an easy matter for randy and jones to pull the rich youth towards the vessel then a rope ladder was lowered and bob bangs came up to the deck dripping with water illustration well young man you had a narrow escape said captain hadley as he pushed his way through the crowd to the spot i know it and its all your fault whined bob bangs my fault nonsense you ran me down ill have the law on you for it dont talk like a fool young man i was in the wheelhouse myself with the pilot and saw just how you acted evidently you dont know much about handling boats i know all about them insisted the rich youth but this was a falsehood as randy well knew bob could row and that was about all youll have to pay for smashing my boat went on the rich boy after a pause and youll have to pay for wetting my new suit he added gazing ruefully at the natty outing suit he had donned but an hour before youll not get a cent out of me said captain hadley firmly this accident was clearly of your own making we gave you plenty of room but you turned directly into our course twice be thankful that you werent ground up under the paddlewheel yes and be thankful that randy thompson threw you a life preserver put in jones at the mention of our heros name bob bangs looked around in surprise he had not noticed randy before what you here he exclaimed and did not seem particularly happy over the meeting i am answered randy did you throw out that line with the preserver asked the captain i did sir and randy touched his cap i am glad to know it and the captains face showed his appreciation of randys prompt action what are you doing here in that outfit asked bob bangs curiously i am a deckhand on this steamboat pooh a deckhand and the rich boys nose went up into the air in disdain he would give randy no credit for helping to save his life clear the deck please called out captain hadley to the crowd that was pressing in on all sides the excitement is over the boy is safe i want you to put me ashore said bob bangs well make a landing a mile below here said the captain i dont want to go to the next landing sorry but we cant turn back answered captain hadley what about my boat well take it in tow this was done and in a few minutes the helen shalley had resumed her journey bob bangs was led to one of the staterooms and offered a dry suit of clothes which he put on ill take your name and address said captain hadley what for as a matter of record and remember i want the clothing returned humph maybe my father will sue you for damages if he does he will lose the case inside of five minutes the next landing place was made and bob bangs went ashore taking his wet suit with him the damaged sloop was tied up at the dock and having discharged and taken on passengers and baggage the steamboat sped on her way once more hes as mad as a wet hen said jones to randy and he ought to be thankful for having his life spared he always was a mean sort of fellow answered our hero and his folks are just as mean as he is then maybe they will try to make trouble for the steamboat owner amos bangs did try to make trouble two days after the accident on the river andrew shalley received a letter which ran in part as follows as you perhaps know my son robert bangs was out on the hudson on the th inst in his sloop when without any cause whatsoever your steamboat the helen shalley ran into his boat smashed it completely and put him in peril of his life i am a man of few words sir and i demand damages for this outrage if you wish to settle you may send me your check for one thousand dollars if not i will sue you for that amount chapter xx what came of a demand the letter from amos bangs worried andrew shalley a little and he at once called on captain hadley as soon as the steamboat made a landing at nyack it seems you ran down a boy a few days ago said the steamboat owner he tried to run us down answered the captain quietly was he hurt not in the least his father wants a thousand dollars damages i wouldnt pay him a cent did you run him down no he tried to run us down this is no joke captain hadley i know it mr shalley but to threaten us with a suit at law is absurd i can bring a dozen witnesses to prove that the accident was entirely of the boys making i am glad to hear that and andrew shalley breathed a sigh of relief he did not care so much for the money but he wanted to know that captain hadley was not to blame that boy acted like a little fool from beginning to end went on the captain of the steamboat and then told his story later randy was called up to relate what he had done and also jones if there is any trouble some of the passengers will testify for us said captain hadley and mentioned half a dozen who had said they would stick to the captain in case of trouble the passengers were wellknown citizens whose testimony would be sure to carry weight in any court of law having satisfied himself that amos bangs had no case against him the steamboat owner wrote to the rich manufacturer to that effect by return mail he received this reply your bluff will not work with me you are to blame and must pay if i do not receive your check for one thousand dollars by the middle of next week i shall bring suit my son is now in bed and under the doctors care because of the accident humph under the doctors care eh mused the steamboat owner this certainly seems to be serious after all he will certainly make trouble for me even if he doesnt win his case again the steamboat owner interviewed captain hadley and then the pair called in randy to learn what he could tell about the bangs family in general our hero told all he knew including the trouble mr bartlett was having with the iron manufacturer evidently he is a man to get money in any manner possible mused andrew shalley he will certainly bring suit i dont believe bob is sick said randy he must be shamming i wish i knew for sure perhaps i can find out for you if youll give me a day or two off said our hero struck by a sudden idea a good plan cried captain hadley let the lad see what he can do by all means the matter was talked over and the upshot was that on the next trip of the steamboat randy went ashore at catskill near which town bob bangs and his mother were spending their vacation from some men at the dock our hero was enabled to find out all about the damaged sloop which had been returned to catskill it was to cost twenty dollars to put the craft in good condition again those folks are stopping at a small hotel on the burnham road said one of the dock men its called the sharon house thank you returned our hero he was soon on the way to the sharon house since demolished by fire it did not take him long to cover the distance as he approached he looked around for some signs of the bangs family and presently espied mrs bangs lounging in a hammock on a side veranda reading a novel i wonder if it is possible that bob is really in bed sick he mused if he is its a wonder mrs bangs isnt with him but then i guess she is a selfish woman anyway randy walked around the hotel and down to the stable here he met a colored boy who helped around the horses say can you tell me where i can find bob bangs he asked boldly bob bangs jest went down to the ball grounds was the answer which surprised randy not a little where are the grounds that way and the colored boy pointed with his hand i thought maybe bob was sick he aint sick hes only pertendin answered the colored boy randy said no more but hurried off in the direction of the baseball grounds just as he came in sight of the place he saw a figure ahead that looked familiar to him unless i am mistaken that is bob he told himself and hurried closer it was indeed bob bangs walking along as if nothing had ever happened to him he was smoking a cigarette he passed into the grounds and randy did the same and took a seat on a bench directly behind the rich youth it was easy to see that bob bangs was not suffering physically he smoked half a dozen cigarettes and applauded as loudly as anybody when a good play was made fine game said a man sitting next to randy it is said our hero he looked at the man and saw that he was evidently a merchant excuse me are you from catskill i am do you want to do me a favor if i pay you for it well it wont be a favor if you pay me i may want your assistance and i may not do you see that boy there yes he doesnt look as if he was sick abed does he sick abed what sort of a game is this and the merchant looked randy over with much curiosity that boys father says he is sick in bed i want to prove that it isnt so what is the game anyway he had an accident on the river and he wants damages from a man i work for it is a putup job oh ive heard of such things before i know a rascal who cut his foot with an ax and then went down to the railroad and laid the blame on a train he got five hundred dollars but later on was found out and sent to prison for the deception well this isnt exactly like that didnt you hear about a sloop running into the helen shalley a few days ago oh yes a friend of mine a passenger on the boat told me about it he said the boy didnt know how to handle the craft well that is the boy indeed does he act as if he was hurt or suffering not in the least would you be willing to testify to that fact if it came to law certainly will you give me your name and address here is my card and the merchant handed it over he did not add that he occasionally sold captain hadley some goods and was glad to do the master of the steamboat a service the game was almost at an end when the ball was sent among the spectators seeing it coming towards him bob bangs leaped up and tried to catch the sphere it hit the tips of his fingers stinging them greatly then the ball came towards randy and he caught it and threw it back into the field what are you doing here demanded bob bangs as he caught sight of our hero watching the game answered randy quietly humph pretty nice game bob humph muttered the rich boy again i see you are feeling fine again i am not i am real sick answered the rich boy quickly sick in bed eh went on our hero with a grin i was in bed last night i suppose so was i im sick yet you showed it by the way you were cheering and yelling when did you come in right after you humph have you been watching me yes you might be in a better business sneered the rich boy i dont think so you need watching you and your father want to cheat the steamboat company by pretending that you were hurt in that collision and here you are as well and hearty as ever added randy in a loud voice so that those nearby might hear i aint well im sick you said that before but nobody will believe it youre well enough to go to a ball game and yell and smoke cigarettes anyway put in the merchant sitting next to randy a good play brought forth a cheer from the crowd which drowned out further talk in the midst of the temporary excitement bob bangs sneaked from the stand and from the ball grounds he feels sick over this laughed the merchant well he cant sue the steamboat company for that sickness laughed our hero in return chapter xxi randy visits his home as soon as he returned to the steamboat randy acquainted captain hadley with all he had seen and heard and gave the captain the card of the merchant you have done well randy said the master of the steamboat i fancy this will cook mr amos bangss goose at nyack mr shalley came on board and heard what our hero had to say i am glad you have a witness said he i have heard of mr budmister before a good business man said captain hadley he will make a good witness if the case comes to a trial but it never did come to a trial andrew shalley received one letter from a lawyer threatening the suit and in return wrote back the particulars of what randy had learned and added that if he heard any more of the matter he would bring suit against amos bangs for conspiracy to defraud there the matter ended the captain was so pleased that when randy asked for a threedays leave of absence that he might visit his home it was readily granted the boy was also given some extra pay for his work at catskill randys homecoming brought a warm smile to the faces of his father and his mother his mother kissed him tenderly and his father shook hands how are you feeling father i am almost well randy i expect to go to work next week but not in a cellar said the son quickly no mr jackson is going to build a wing on his house and has given me the whole contract that is good i will be able to make more money than if i was working for a boss went on mr thompson well you wont be sorry for that said randy with a smile he found matters on the farm moving along nicely the late vegetables were coming in well and their neighbor jerry borden had given them a helping hand say youre agittin to be a regular sailor aint you said sammy to randy hardly a sailor answered randy with a laugh i am a steamboat deckhand its about the same thing wish i was a sailor maybe if you sailed on the ocean youd get seasick sammy i wouldnt nuther i was readin about robinson crusoe onct i wish i was cast away on a barren island it would be lots of fun especially if you had nothing to eat and to drink oh id get something from the ship as crusoe did if the ship didnt go down in the middle of the ocean when i was on the island id sleep every morning as long as i wanted to what would you do if the savages came after you id fight and kill them all that is all but one id want that one for my man friday he aint going to be no sailor broke in mrs borden who overheard the conversation he is going out to hunt eggs an he is agoin to do it right now or ill get the whip ill get the eggs answered sammy and hurried off without further delay that boy is crazy to go somewhere all the time said mrs borden he doesnt seem to like the farm a bit better let him look for work somewhere said randy maybe it will cure him of some of his notions maybe sighed the mother all too soon randys visit had come to an end he remained at the little farm over sunday going to church with his father and his mother and left for the hudson river early monday morning several days passed quietly and once more our hero fell into his routine work jones was sick so the deckhands had a little more to do than usual randy pitched in with vigor much to the satisfaction of malloy and captain hadley one day while handling baggage at the dock in new york randy was surprised to see amos bangs and a stranger come aboard he soon lost sight of the pair and did not see them again until the middle of the afternoon when he discovered them in a corner of the cabin talking earnestly it is queer mr bangs should use this boat after his quarrel with captain hadley and mr shalley said our hero to himself he had occasion to pass the pair a little later and was surprised to hear the name of mr bartlett mentioned dont worry well down bartlett easily enough said the strange man a fellow with bushy black whiskers i hope so answered amos bangs curious to know what they could be saying about jacks father and remembering what he had heard in the past randy walked outside of the cabin and close to a window which was wide open from this point he could hear what was said without being seen very readily i dont like the way matters are standing he heard amos bangs say we must make our position more secure tuller i dont see how we are to do it answered the man with the heavy whiskers i wish i could get bartlett to sell his stock and sign over all his interest can you do that without making him suspicious of what is going on humph he is suspicious already thats the trouble does he know about the deal with kastner i think not it will be a blow when he hears of it i dont intend he shall hear of it just yet if i had robinson where i wanted him id go ahead cant you get him get him i dont dare breathe a word to him amos bangs laughed and the funny part of it is bartlett thinks robinson is in with us you are sure of that dead certain then you must keep bartlett and robinson apart if i can what did you do with the papers you took from bartletts desk they are in my safe at home why dont you destroy them i will some time it is dangerous to leave them around i am the only person who knows the combination of the house safe the papers cant get out without me so the talk ran on for a good hour during which time randy heard many things which appeared to be of value to mr philip bartlett then the two men arose and went to the smoking room and that was the last our hero saw of them until they left the boat half an hour later the talk he had heard set randy to thinking plainly amos bangs and his companion were a pair of rascals and were trying to defraud mr bartlett out of some if not all of his belongings ill have to call on mr bartlett and tell him what i have heard randy told himself see here called out peter polk striding up as randy was going to the lower deck what are you loafing around here for i am going below now answered our hero you cant shirk your work that way thompson the purser came closer listen he whispered after this you keep your nose out of my business i didnt know i had my nose in your business mr polk oh you cant fool me thompson i know it was you went to captain hadley with the story of how i was treating my relatives you mean the clares of course i do after this you keep your mouth shut pursued the purser if you dont well youll wish you had thats all and peter polk went away in extremely bad humor chapter xxii mr bartlett makes a move as soon as the boat had tied up at albany and his work was at an end randy attired himself in his best and took a street car for the residence of the bartletts it was a humble place on a side street quite in contrast to the fine residence the family had occupied in riverport hullo randy cried jack as he came to the door to answer our heros ring this is a surprise walk right in did you send word that you were coming i did not jack is your father home yes he is just finishing his supper i want to see him had your supper yes i got a bite before i left the boat all right otherwise i know mother will welcome you at our table jack went off to tell his father and presently mr bartlett walked in he looked rather careworn and tired evidently his new situation was a hard one to fill and did not agree with him how do you do randy said mr bartlett glad to see you jack says you want to see me i do mr bartlett can i talk to you in private certainly come into the parlor mr bartlett led the way and closed the door then both sat down i want to tell you something about mr bangs and a man named tuller began randy they were on the boat today and i overheard some of their talk tuller eh said mr bartlett and his brow darkened as well as he could randy repeated the talk he had heard jacks father listened with keen interest he was astonished when randy mentioned the papers which had been abstracted from his desk so bangs has them in his safe at home eh he cried well i am going to get them be the cost what it may they belong to me and i am going to take them no matter where i find them he was equally astonished to hear that a certain mr robinson was not acting with amos bangs and certain other men tuller included they gave me to understand that robinson was with them said philip bartlett if robinson will only act with me perhaps i can do a great deal then why dont you write to mr robinson and find out i will go and see him oh then he lives here no in springfield but our works are going to shut down for a few days so i will have ample time randy i am very thankful to you for bringing me this news i hope it does you some good mr bartlett i think it will perhaps ill only be able to scare bangs but that may make him careful so i can get something out of my stock in the iron works company if you ever want me as a witness i will do what i can for you thank you my lad you are kind and i will remember what you say after that mrs bartlett and jack came in and learned something of what had brought our hero to the house good for you randy cried jack father if i were you id break into old bangss safe pray do nothing rash pleaded mrs bartlett remember he is rich and has many friends he is certainly rich said randy but i doubt if the family have many friends all of them are too overbearing bangs broke into fathers private desk and took the papers went on jack it would be only tit for tat to break open the safe and get the papers back i shall see robinson first and then make up my mind what to do answered his father randy spent a pleasant evening with jack and when it came time to go to the boat jack walked half the distance with our hero i wish father could get what is due him said jack on the way he cant stand the hard work he is now doing the next morning randy sailed down the river on the steamboat twentyfour hours later mr bartlett crossed the hudson and took a train for springfield he hoped to find mr robinson at one of the banks and he was not disappointed the bank official for such mr robinson was listened with interest to all philip bartlett had to tell he shook his head when amos bangs and tuller were mentioned i suspected as much said he i was given to understand that bangs had bought you out i couldnt understand it either for you once told me that you did not wish to leave the works i have just gotten back from a trip to europe and have a good deal to attend to here but i will take this matter up as soon as i possibly can and you will stand in with me asked mr bartlett anxiously if you wish it i do then we must act together and what would be your advice regarding those papers in bangss private safe at his house get out a search warrant and take a professional safe man along to open the strong box answered the bank official promptly and do not delay either he may take it into his head to burn the papers up i will do as you say answered mr bartlett with decision some of his oldtime will power had come back to him and he lost not a moment in carrying out his plans he visited a firm dealing in safes and from them got the address of a man who claimed to be able to open any ordinary safe made then he called on this individual you open safes he asked i do if i have the proper authority answered the man can you open a firstclass house safe yes how long will it take from five minutes to three hours what are your charges ten to fifty dollars ill have to see the safe before i can set a definite figure will you be at liberty tomorrow ill be at your service if you engage me now very well you may consider yourself engaged i wish you to meet me in riverport at about noon your own safe no youll have authority to open it i think so ive got to go to court to get it though ah a legal case eh yes you dont object do you oh no i have many legal cases had to force a safe for some lawyers in bridgeport only last week you will not disappoint me not at all mr bartlett with this understanding philip bartlett left the safe opener and took a train back to his home but as it happened a certain man saw him leaving the safe openers office this man was none other than tuller the friend to amos bangs bartlett eh murmured tuller to himself what is he doing in springfield he chanced to know the safe opener whose name was westinghouse and presently dropped into the others office as if by accident how is business westinghouse he said indifferently fair was the answer had two jobs last week good enough how is business with you booming i suppose you get jobs ahead is that it or do you go out on the run so to speak sometimes i get orders ahead but most of the jobs come in on the run safe out of order or something like that ive got to go to riverport tomorrow is that so bank no a private party i reckon going to have a safe opened by an order from the court i think is that so well i wish you luck on the job goodday goodday answered the safe opener once on the street tullers face changed bartlett must have given that order and if so he means to either open up the safe at the iron works or else the safe at bangss house i must see bangs and warn him so that nothing is found which will do us harm at first he thought to telegraph but then came to the conclusion that it would be too risky a letter might not be received in time ill go myself he said and an hour later was on his way to riverport chapter xxiii the papers in the safe at riverport the next day mr bartlett called upon a lawyer with whom he was well acquainted and told to the legal gentleman all that he had learned and proposed to do i wish your assistance mr soper he said you shall have it was the lawyers prompt answer can you get an order from the court to open that safe i believe i can come we will go and see the judge at once fortunately for mr bartlett the judge was easily found and when the matter was explained he issued the necessary papers and placed them in the hands of one of the constables but how are you going to open the safe if it is locked asked the judge constable carley is not equal to it i have engaged a professional safe opener answered mr bartlett he can do the trick for the constable very well mr bartlett the lawyer and the constable waited until the stage came in the safe opener was one of the passengers and at once joined the crowd and was introduced in the meantime jasper tuller had also arrived in riverport in the morning he lost no time in calling at the iron works i want to see mr bangs he said to the clerk who came to wait on him sorry sir but mr bangs went out of town late last night when will he be back not until some time this afternoon possibly not until evening where did he go i must communicate with him at once he went to rochester but i cant give you the exact address answered the clerk jasper tuller groaned in spirit could he have telegraphed to amos bangs he would have done so but the telegram would have remained at the office awaiting a call i must make a move on my own account if i can he muttered he called a carriage and was driven to the bangs mansion a servant answered his rather impatient ring at the front door is anybody at home he asked abruptly mr bangs has gone away sir i know that he snapped is mrs bangs at home now it happened mrs bangs had come home the night before intending to go away again two days later but she had given orders that she wished to see no one i i dont know said the servant girl i can see what is the name jasper tuller it is highly important that i see somebody of the family at once went on the visitor mrs bangs was in an upper hallway and overheard the talk she knew her husband had had some trouble with a book agent over the payment of a bill and took tuller to be that person a gentleman to see you mrs bangs said the maid he is very anxious about it i cannot see anybody returned the fashionable woman coldly tell him i am not at home the girl went down into the hallway where she had left jasper tuller standing mrs bangs is not at home sir you will have to call some other time is mr bangss son at home no sir he is away for the summer when will mrs bangs be back i cant say sir it is too bad the matter is very important i came all the way from springfield to see mr bangs they told me at the works he had gone to rochester i wanted to see him or his wife on business have you any idea where i can find mrs bangs the girl hesitated n no sir she faltered mrs bangs was listening as before and now realized that something unusual was in the air she slipped down a back stairs and out of a rear door then she came around to the front piazza just as the door opened to let tuller out mamie who is this she asked looking at the servant girl meaningly are you mrs bangs asked jasper tuller quickly and as she nodded he continued i am glad you have come i am jasper tuller one of the stockholders in the iron works perhaps you have heard your husband mention my name i have mr tuller what can i do for you i would like to see you in private this with a side glance at the servant girl very well step into the library mr tuller and the fashionable woman led the way to that apartment then the door was carefully closed something is wrong said the servant girl to herself i wonder what it can be she was of a decidedly inquisitive nature and not above playing the eavesdropper she tiptoed her way to the library door and listened intently while at the same time applying her eye to the keyhole now what is it mr tuller asked mrs bangs after the door to the library was shut briefly it is this said the visitor your husband has certain papers in his safe papers which belong to another man philip bartlett proceed i warned him to destroy the papers but he has not done so now mr bartlett is going to come here force open your safe and take the papers away come here force our safe gasped the fashionable woman he dare not do it he is going to do it legally i presume you mean he will bring an officer of the law here yes if those papers are found it will look black for your husband for he has no right to have them in his possession oh mr tuller what shall i do it is easy enough open the safe take out the papers and put them where they cannot be found yes but i do not know how to open the safe dont you know the combination your husband said something about that but i felt there must be some mistake i did know the combination once but i believe i have forgotten it went on the fashionable woman she knitted her brows let me see it was three s i remember and yes yes and what else see if you cannot think it is so very important not alone for your husband but also for myself and others i am trying to think let me see yes there was a and a and then another i mean so many times around i believe i understand mrs bangs you mean twice around to three times around to twice to and then off at yes yes that is it burst out the lady of the mansion how clever some men are and she beamed on her visitor who chanced to be well dressed and not badlooking if that is correct ill soon have the safe open said jasper tuller and walked over to where the strong box stood in a corner of the apartment the lady of the mansion hovered near while jasper tuller got down on his knees and began to try the combination he had to work the knob all of a dozen times before the door of the safe came open at last he murmured as the contents of the safe stood revealed do you see the papers or rather do you know them asked mrs bangs i will know them if i can lay eyes on them was the reply as tuller began to rummage around in the safe the papers were sorted out in different piles and he went through each pile as rapidly as possible presently he found what he wanted here they are he cried in triumph as he held them up chapter xxiv another hiding place mrs bangs breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the papers you are certain you are right mr tuller she asked anxiously yes where did those papers come from mr bartletts desk at the iron works as they were in my husbands safe i think you ought to give them to me i will do so mrs bangs but you must put them where they cannot be found trust me for that the officers of the law may search the whole house dare they do such a thing yes but if everything is found square your husband can sue bartlett for damages and jasper tuller chuckled loudly it will be a good joke on him there are no more of the papers i will take another look and make sure this was done but no more papers belonging to philip bartlett could be found then the safe was locked once more i will put these papers away at once said mrs bangs and left the library with the documents in her hand she was gone all of five minutes and came back smiling quietly to herself now they are safe she said nobody can possibly find them i am glad to hear it answered tuller now i had better be going before bartlett appears dont say anything about my having been here i will not and another thing mrs bangs pretend not to know how to open the safe that will compel them to break it open and your husbands case against bartlett will be so much stronger i shall follow your advice mr tuller but look somebody is coming already went on the fashionable woman as a carriage turned in from the road and came toward the horse block i must get out of this can i go by a back door to be sure said mrs bangs and showed the way as tuller slipped out and passed toward the back road where randy had had an encounter with bob bangs there came a ring at the front door goodmorning mrs bangs said mr bartlett is your husband at home he is not answered the fashionable woman coldly ive got a search warrant for this place said the constable pushing his way in and he proceeded to read the document aloud this is an outrage cried mrs bangs with assumed dignity an outrage and you shall pay dearly for it mr bartlett my husband is no thief to steal your papers perhaps not answered philip bartlett nevertheless i am going to have his safe searched and also this house well since you have the law on your side go ahead but you shall answer to my husband for this indignity the constable began his work and the safe opener approached the strong box and inspected it can you open it asked mr bartlett anxiously with ease was the answer this is one of the oldstyle safes how much will it cost ten dollars then go ahead the safe opener was soon at work he turned the knob around slowly listening intently in the meanwhile he worked thus for perhaps ten minutes when the door to the safe came open without an effort mrs bangs was disappointed she had expected that the safe would have to be blown open in the most approved burglar fashion and was wondering what bill for damages she could render you must have known the combination she said tartly to the safe opener this is my business was the quiet answer the constable with mr bartletts aid went through all the papers in the safe of course the allimportant documents were not found well asked the lawyer after a long wait they are not here replied mr bartlett he felt sick at heart over his failure to bring the papers to light not here no they must have been removed the library was searched and then a look was taken through the whole house mrs bangs followed the men everywhere you shall suffer for this outrage she said to mr bartlett several times i presume i shall have to stand for what i have done he answered meekly of one thing i am certain mrs bangs your husband has those papers or else he has destroyed them you can say what you please mr bangs is an honest man and a gentleman retorted the fashionable woman at last there was nothing left to do but to leave the mansion which mr bartlett did with reluctance i am afraid i have made a mess of it he said to his lawyer i was certain we would find those papers i am afraid you have hurt your case mr bartlett answered the legal light bluntly bangs will now be on his guard and will take good care to keep those papers away from you perhaps he has destroyed them that is not unlikely since it would do him small good to keep them what do you advise me to do next you had better wait and see what develops said the lawyer the safe opener and the constable were paid off and philip bartlett returned to albany in anything but a happy frame of mind a day or two later he called upon randy when the steamboat tied up at the dock for the night my fat is in the fire he said to our hero and told of his failure to locate the missing documents mr bartlett i am sure mr bangs said the papers were in his safe cried randy he must have taken them out when he returned home you can be a witness if the matter is brought into court of course i remember very well all i heard well that is something answered philip bartlett hopefully he went home and the next day received a strong letter from amos bangs denouncing him for the action he had taken part of the letter ran as follows i should sue you for damages only i do not wish to drag you into court on account of your wife and family in the future you need expect no favors from me i am done with you if you want to sell your stock in the iron company i will give you the market price not a cent more remember i shall be on my guard against you in the future and if you dare to molest me again you shall take the consequences he will do what he can to ruin us said mrs bartlett when her husband read the letter to her i suppose so what is the market price of the stock it has no regular market value now bangs will buy it for about ten cents on the dollar oh philip that is so little ill not sell the stock said mr bartlett id rather lose every cent than play into amos bangss hands chapter xxv a victory for randy one day randy was out in albany buying a new pair of shoes when he met rose clare who was also doing some shopping for her mother oh randy how do you do cried the girl running up and shaking hands very well rose he answered you look well oh i am feeling splendid it did you good to get out of new york indeed it did and mamma is ever so much better too i am glad to hear that do you like it at captain hadleys home yes mamma and mrs hadley have become great friends do you go to school yes and oh i most forgot to tell you i got a letter from new york today it was from another girl one who lived in the house with us she says bill hosker has come back to that neighborhood to stay she says he is around every night then i am going to hunt him up oh randy please dont get into any more trouble pleaded rose he has got to give back my money or take the consequences you know what a ruffian he is i will be on my guard this time rose and maybe ill take a friend along added our hero when he returned to the steamboat he told jones about what he had heard jones was now feeling very well once again and he readily volunteered to go with randy and hunt up hosker as soon as the boat got to the metropolis then pat malloy got wind of what was up and said he would go too its no use of going to the police wid such a mather said the head deckhand well bring the rascal to terms ourselves it was a clear cool night when the landing was made at new york the deckhands hurried through their labors and then made off for the neighborhood where randy had been attacked here is the spot where i was first robbed said our hero and pointed it out they walked around the neighborhood for nearly an hour and were growing somewhat disheartened when randy gave a cry there he is you are sure asked jones yes let me speak to him first then well know there aint no mistake went on jones randy was willing and he and malloy dropped behind bill hosker had just come out of a saloon and was wiping off his mouth with the back of his hand he turned down a side street hullo there bill hosker cried jones pleasantly the bully and thief swung around on his heel and looked at the deckhand in perplexity who are you he asked roughly am i right is this bill hosker dats my handle then you are the man i want to see said jones and beckoned for the others to come up when the street ruffian saw randy his face changed color and he wanted to run away but jones grabbed him and so did malloy as both were powerful men hosker was as a kitten in their grasp youse fellers let me go i want you to give up the money you took from me said randy i dont know you young feller yes you do will you give up the money or not i aint got no cash then youll come to the station house with me i bet yer i wont cried bill hosker he started to struggle when jones hauled off and slapped him hard on the right ear now be good or ill shove a few of your teeth down your throat said the deckhand this aint no foolin affair give up the boys money and be quick about it if you dont give up ill maul you so your own mother wont know you bill hosker was thoroughly alarmed he did not mind going to the station house but he did mind a good drubbing and he saw that those who held him were in no mood to be trifled with say let us straighten dis ting out said he at length i want my money answered randy will yer drop de matter if i cough up de cash yes all right den how much was it four dollars and eighty cents the street ruffian pulled a small roll of bills from his pocket dare you are he said as he passed over five dollars youse kin keep de change randy took the bills and stowed them away in his pocket ill give the change to some poor person he said i want only what is coming to me are ye done wid de rascal asked malloy yes well im not answered the head deckhand and neither am i added jones and then both hauled off and let bill hosker have it right and left the street ruffian had one eye blackened and a tooth knocked out and went down in a heap more than dazed let that teach you a lesson said jones its better nor a month in jug was pat malloys comment the state wont have to feed the blackguard randy had already walked on and his friends joined him and all hurried back to the steamboat it was several minutes before bill hosker got up id like ter kill dem fellers he muttered he hurried for the nearest saloon where he tried to drown his troubles in drink in the saloon were several who knew him and one man jeered him because of the black eye this brought on another quarrel and as a consequence both men were pushed out of the drinking resort they continued to fight on the sidewalk until a policeman came along and tried to stop them then hosker attacked the officer and as a consequence was placed under arrest the next day he was brought up in court and sentenced to a year in prison for his misdeeds i dont think hell forget us said jones as the steamboat was reached maybe he will lay for us said randy well we can kape our eyes open put in pat malloy i shall not visit that neighborhood again said our hero now i have my money back i am satisfied new york has altogether too many such toughs put in jones the police ought to clean them all out when i first came here i was attacked in my boarding place on the bowery were you robbed the fellow tried to rob me but he didnt succeed i played a neat trick on him what did you do i had a roll of bills and these i placed in an inside pocket i also had an imitation bankbill one of these advertisements you often see well i took a small roll of paper and put the imitation bill around it and put the roll in my vest pocket the wouldbe thief got the roll and ran off with it he must have been angry when he saw how he had been duped laughed randy i didnt see that fellow again for nearly six months then i met him on the steamboat where i was working when he saw me he sneaked out of sight in a hurry i can tell you did you follow him up i tried to but i didnt see him again until we were making a landing then i tried to grab him but he slipped me in a crowd and went ashore as fast as his legs could carry him concluded the deckhand chapter xxvi new troubles on the following day randy noticed that peter polk seemed unusually sour and thoughtful something has gone wrong with him that is certain thought our hero i wonder what it can be he did his best to keep out of the way of the purser and succeeded until nightfall but then when he was carrying an extra heavy trunk peter polk got in his way and made him stumble and drop the piece of baggage the trunk was split open at one end and some of the contents fell on the deck it was a ladys trunk filled with feminine wearing apparel and a good many passengers laughed what do you mean by running into me you blockhead cried the purser in a loud voice why dont you look where you are going it was not my fault answered randy warmly not liking the mans manner of address you made me drop that trunk i did not it was your own clumsiness no sir said our hero firmly and a crowd began to collect dont dare to contradict me fumed the purser it was your fault and the damage shall come out of your wages mr polk it was not my fault and i shall not stand for the damage done ha you defy me eh you cub go on about your work and ill settle with you later what is the trouble here asked captain hadley coming up through the crowd the blockhead of a boy dropped that trunk and broke it open he ran into me and made me drop it retorted our hero he felt just reckless enough to stand up for his rights be the consequences what they might put the trunk to one side along with the other baggage said the captain we have no time to waste on this just now get that other baggage ashore my trunk shrieked the maiden lady rushing forward oh who broke my trunk it was an accident madam and all my dresses spilt out too i shall sue the steamboat company for damages we will settle with you madam i am sorry it happened went on the captain soothingly it was a mean thing to do said the maiden lady and began to weep two of those dresses are brandnew i guess they are not injured much randy and the others had gone to work again our heros thoughts were busy i believe polk ran into me on purpose he whispered to jones maybe he wants to get you discharged answered the other deckhand i dont see why hes down on you because of that clare affair do you think so sure he hated it worse than poison for the captain now knows just how meanly he acted towards the widow the damaged trunk was passed over to a man on the dock and after some excited talk the maiden lady accepted ten dollars with which to have the box repaired and her things put in proper order it was more than was actually coming to her and she went off secretly pleased in the meantime one of the passengers an elderly man who traveled on the line a great deal went to captain hadley what is it mr delong asked the master of the vessel kindly i wish to speak to you about that trunk that was broken open what of it i saw the accident i was standing quite near at the time well i take an interest in that young deckhand of yours he has done me several small favors from time to time it was not his fault that the trunk was smashed and i wanted you to know it how did it happen your purser got in the way and made the boy stumble to me it looked as if the purser did it on purpose this is interesting mr delong but i dont see why the purser should do such a thing neither do i excepting he may have a grudge against the boy humph the captain grew thoughtful i will investigate this do so and believe me the boy is not to blame said the elderly passenger and withdrew as soon as the end of the trip came and the work on deck was finished randy was called to the captains office now what have you to say about that smashed trunk thompson i am not to blame captain hadley answered our hero and told exactly how the incident had occurred do you mean to say mr polk tripped you up he ran into me and made me drop the trunk if i hadnt dropped the trunk i would have fallen down with the box on the top of me and gotten hurt this is a strange statement thompson why should mr polk run into you he hates me because through me your family learned how he had treated mrs clare when he helped to settle her husbands affairs this threw a new light on the matter and the captain nodded slowly and thoughtfully i did not think this of mr polk i think he hopes ill lose my job went on our hero he continually calls me a blockhead just to get me mad i think hed like to see me lose my temper and pitch into him and then he could get me my walking papers i think i will have to put the damage to the trunk down to the regular expense account said the captain at last in the future be more careful and keep out of mr polks way i will certainly be careful and ill watch him too answered randy evidently peter polk was surprised to see our hero go to his work whistling after his interview with the captain he went to the master of the vessel himself a little later is that boy going to pay for the trunk he asked sourly no you can put it down to the regular expense account answered captain hadley humph it was his fault he says not did he blame it on me he did it was his own fault we wont argue the matter mr polk put it down to the regular expenses and let it go at that and captain hadley turned again to the magazine he had been reading sticking up for the boy muttered the purser as he walked away well ill get that cub yet see if i dont a day passed and randy stuck closely to his duties he saw but little of peter polk and gave the purser a wide berth the purser watched the youth narrowly but said nothing he has got it in for you said jones to randy take my advice and keep your eyes open i am watching him he is a man i shouldnt trust nohow he has got a bad pair of eyes i dont see how mr shalley trusts him with all the boats money matters neither do i answered our hero he could walk off with thousands of dollars if he wanted to said jones and there the talk was dropped chapter xxvii randy makes a discovery the next day randy wanted to change some of his underwear and went into his locker for his things to his surprise he found in the locker a lot of wearing apparel that did not belong to him hullo what does this mean he asked himself but could not answer the question he looked the articles over and made sure they did not belong to any of the other deckhands then as he was folding up an extrafine outing shirt he saw a letter drop to the floor he picked it up and saw that it was addressed to peter polk can these things belong to polk he asked himself if so how did they get here curiosity prompted him to look into the envelope in his hand inside was a single sheet of paper on which was scrawled in a bold heavy hand this brief communication peter polk if you dont pay me that commission of twenty dollars at once i will go to old man shalley and let him know how you are boosting up the expense account g a g randy read the letter with great interest it was postmarked new york and the date was four days back there is some mystery here he reasoned what can it mean can mr polk be cheating mr shalley in some way then he remembered how the purser purchased all the supplies for the steamboat and paid the bills and gave a low whistle i must see captain hadley about this and at once he thought but no maybe it would be better to go and see mr shalley direct he placed the letter in a safe place and then went out on deck he had just started to look for captain hadley to tell him about the strange wearing apparel when peter polk rushed up to him look here thompson i want you shouted the purser wrathfully what is it mr polk ive got you you young thief i am no thief answered our hero warmly you are who says randy is a thafe demanded pat malloy i do and i say it is false he has stolen some of my underwear went on the purser tell me what you have done with the stuff at once your stuff is in my locker mr polk but i did not take it ha what a yarn to tell hand the stuff over at once you can get it if you wish answered randy with a shrug of his shoulders i will malloy come along as a witness answered the purser he walked to the compartment where the deckhands slept and from our heros locker hauled the articles that belonged to him what do you say to that he cried turning to our hero i did not put the things there mr polk if you didnt who did sneered the purser perhaps you did yourself me yes you are crazy boy why should i do such a thing to get me into trouble you hate me and want to injure me thats why nonsense you stole these things it is useless for you to deny it but i do deny it i am no more a thief than you are maybe not as much of a one added randy significantly at these words the purser turned pale for a moment but he quickly recovered i shall report this to the captain ill report too ill have you discharged well see about that taking his things peter polk went to the captains office and told his story captain hadley at once sent for randy this is a queer happening thompson he said captain hadley i am not guilty answered randy it is only another plot of mr polk to get me into trouble and you think he put the things there himself i certainly do i wish you would give me a day off went on our hero after an awkward pause what for i wish to see mr shalley he is in new york on business so much the better i can call on him there after we tie up do you want to take this matter to him not this alone i have something else of importance i know he will want to see me well you can go i hope you are not going to run away and the captain smiled faintly i have nothing to run away for sir mr polk is down on me and i am going to do what i can to show him up that is all but please dont let him know that i am going to see mr shalley you have learned something important yes sir about the purser yes sir but i cant speak of it just yet to you well what about this clothing affair wont you let it rest for a few days if you wish answered captain hadley and then he was called away to attend to some important duties although randy did not know it peter polk was nearby and caught a good bit of the talk between our hero and the captain his face grew deathly pale when he learned that randy was going to see mr shalley and about his own personal doings what has that cub discovered now he asked himself what can he tell about my doings he was so worried he could not attend to his work he turned the matter over in his mind and suddenly remembered the threatening letter he had received he had paid the claim but what had he done with the communication he searched everywhere for it but without avail fool that i was that i did not tear it up and throw it overboard he muttered to himself if that boy has the letter it may lead to an investigation and then he did not finish but clenched his hands in rage and fear he watched randy narrowly and after new york was reached saw our hero make preparations to go ashore he did not know that mr shalley was in the metropolis and could not comprehend randys move are you going ashore he asked of our hero when he got the chance i am where are you going excuse me mr polk but that is my private business did captain hadley say you could go he did well come to my office a minute i want to talk to you went on the purser in a lower tone very well answered randy and followed the man to the office which at this time was deserted thompson i want to know what you found in your locker besides my clothing said the purser after he had made certain that no outsiders were around i found a cigar holder and a match safe and what else i must decline to answer that question at this blunt refusal the brow of the purser darkened you wont tell me no did you find a er a letter perhaps i did i want you to give it up i didnt say i found it but you did find it it is my property and you must give it to me to this randy was silent do you hear me i am not deaf mr polk i know what you want to do hissed the purser you want to get me into trouble but ill not let you do it maybe youll get yourself into trouble bah i am not afraid of a boy but he paused and his manner changed see here thompson you are a poor boy arent you i admit it well some extra money will come in handy wont it what do you mean mr polk ill give you er five dollars for that letter i havent said that i had it yet but i know you have it come what do you say i say i am going about my business answered randy and started for the doorway not yet cried the purser wrathfully and flung him back into a corner youll settle with me first even if i have to call a police officer chapter xxviii out of a tight corner randy was surprised and dazed by the treatment he received at the hands of the enraged purser and for the moment knew not what to do he rose slowly to his feet dont you do that again he cried a dangerous glitter coming into his eyes i will do it unless you give up that letter you shall never have the letter peter polk ha so you admit at last that you have it i do then hand it over or i will call an officer and have you locked up call the officer if you dare and our hero shrugged his shoulders you stole more than the clothing and the letter went on the purser craftily you took fifty dollars in money i took absolutely nothing and you know it then you want me to call in the officer do as you please said randy recklessly peter polk was nonplused he did not want to call an officer yet he wanted to get the precious letter you will save yourself a lot of trouble by giving up that letter thompson he said in a more subdued tone well i dont intend to give it up if i have you arrested i can send you to states prison for five or ten years i will risk it what do you intend to do with that letter said the purser that is my affair going to mr shalley eh perhaps it wont do you any good again randy was silent he had stepped close to the door on the instant peter polk did the same you are not going just yet cried the purser meaningly randy looked through the little window of the office he heard footsteps approaching hullo there jones he called out whats wanted came from the other deckhand come to the office please in a moment jones appeared he was carrying a bucket of water and a deck swab now open that door said randy to peter polk no more nonsense please you are not wanted here jones cried the purser angrily you are wanted said randy open the door i want to get out jones set down his pail and pulled on the door seeing resistance would be useless peter polk allowed the door to come open at once randy stepped out into the gangway ill explain this to you some other time he called to the other deckhand and then ran off before peter polk could stop him where are ye goin called out malloy as he crossed the gangplank im off on business answered our hero and then paused for a moment tell jones to keep an eye on mr polk will you please it is very important i will was the reply in a minute more randy was hurrying up the street he knew where andrew shalley was stopping and took a car to the location the place was a wellknown hotel and in the corridor he met the steamboat owner just ready to go out oh mr shalley i want to see you he cried what is it randy its quite a story and very important then come to my room and the steamboat owner led the way to the elevator as soon as they were in the room our hero told his story in all of its details and then produced the letter he had found andrew shalley listened closely to the story and pondered over the letter for some time randy have you any idea who this person who signs himself g a g can be ive been thinking that over mr shalley and i have found out that there is a head clerk who works for bann shadow the wholesale grocers whose name is george a gaffney gaffney used to come and see polk once in a while and we buy a great many things from bann shadow put in the steamboat owner so we do i will look this man gaffney up at once with the steamboat owner to think was to act and going below with our hero he consulted a directory and found that george a gaffney lived on west twentysixth street i will call upon this fellow said he you can go along they took a car on one of the avenues and got out at the corner of twentysixth street they had to walk half a block the neighborhood was not of the best and gaffneys residence proved to be a fourstory apartment house the man lived on the top floor with his wife and four small children george gaffney was at home sitting in his shirt sleeves by a front window smoking a pipe he was surprised to receive visitors at that hour is this mr george a gaffney questioned andrew shalley thats my name are you a clerk for bann shadow the wholesale grocers i am i would like to see you privately mr gaffney who are you i am andrew shalley the owner of the steamboat helen shalley oh george gaffney was taken aback and showed it plainly his wife had come to a back doorway and was looking at the visitors curiously step in sir said the clerk in a husky voice mary i will see this gentleman alone he went on to his wife who at once retired closing the door after her andrew shalley was a good judge of character and he saw that george gaffney was a family man of fairly good qualities he was extremely nervous i think i can get him to confess easily enough if he has anything to tell thought the steamboat owner please be seated said the clerk and mr shalley and randy sat down then there was a slight pause mr gaffney i am afraid i have an unpleasant duty to perform began andrew shalley in a cold hard voice why er what do you mean stammered the clerk i refer to your dealings with my purser peter polk i er i havent had anything to do with him that is we had some little business but the clerk was unable to go on you sent him a threatening letter the other day me who says so i have the letter in my possession the clerk winced and the steamboat owner saw that the shot struck home this affair is a very serious one you know that as well as i do continued andrew shalley the fact of the matter is it is a states prison offense the mention of prison had the desired effect george gaffney broke down completely oh sir i i didnt mean to do any wrong polk said it would be all right he got me to go into it it was all his doings all i ever got out of it was thirtyfive dollars and that i will pay back mr shalley i er i hope you wont prosecute me for the sake of my wife and children and the clerk wrung his hands in despair didnt you get any more than thirtyfive dollars no sir not a cent more i swear it and polk said that was due to me legally if that is true i will not prosecute you but on one condition name it that you tell me everything you know about peter polks doings i will do it mr shalley chapter xxix george gaffneys statement i cannot tell you all peter polk has done said george gaffney on beginning his story but i can tell you all so far as it concerns his purchase of goods from bann shadow that will be enough answered andrew shalley and brought out a book and a pencil to take notes he came to our firm three years ago and began to purchase various goods for the helen shalley at first he met all bills promptly and never asked for any rebate or commission that lasted for about three months he must have been feeling his way he was at the end of six months he made a claim of a rebate on a bill for a hundred and fifty dollars and we allowed him ten dollars then he got ten dollars more on another bill and after that he claimed a rebate of ten per cent on everything he bought of us you have all those bills on your books we have good go on he gradually got bolder and wanted me to aid him in getting a commission elsewhere on regular steamboat supplies i was willing to make a little extra money and introduced him to the firm of leeson bronette leeson is an easygoing man and he promised polk a big commission on all goods purchased polk bought hundreds of dollars worth of goods from them and got i am pretty sure from fifteen to twenty per cent on every bill paid oh what a rascal murmured randy then i introduced him to another man aaron denman and he got goods from that man too and got his commission how much i do not know for introducing him to denman i was promised that commission of twenty dollars i saw polk was making money hand over fist and when he did not pay me i got mad and wrote the letter and you are sure you never got a cent more out of him than thirtyfive dollars not a cent once in a while he treated me to a dinner and twice he sent me a box of cigars and that is all to tell the honest truth i did not press him very hard for i did not believe in what he was doing i want to be an honest man and i was led into this thing almost before i knew it continued george gaffney after that he went into a great many more details to which andrew shalley and randy listened with interest i can get the actual figures for you from our books said the clerk what does your firm say to this asked the steamboat owner oh they wanted the business so they simply shut their eyes and didnt say anything but that was dishonest true but such things are done every day and the clerk shrugged his shoulders if peter polk has been getting ten to fifteen per cent on all goods he has been buying for me he has robbed me of thousands of dollars said andrew shalley it will be a hard matter to prove some of the transactions mr shalley i guess he knew how to cover up his footprints pretty well well if i can only prove some of them it will be enough for my purpose answered the steamboat owner before he left that night he drew up a long document containing the main facts of the case and had george gaffney sign it and had randy put his name down as a witness what do you want me to do mr shalley asked our hero after they had left the clerks house you can go back to the steamboat i am going to hire a firstclass private detective to investigate this matter thoroughly when i expose polk i want all the evidence on hand with which to convict him he will want to know what i did that is true andrew shalley mused for a moment randy you mind your own business he said suddenly and sharply then he began to chuckle now you can go back and tell polk that i told you to mind your own business i will sir and our hero grinned broadly i will also give you a line to captain hadley pursued the steamboat owner that will help to keep you out of further trouble the letter was penned and a few minutes later our hero was on his way back to the boat andrew shalley went in another direction to hunt up a detective to work on the case it must be confessed that randy felt much lighter in heart he now knew exactly what kind of a rascal peter polk was and felt that the purser could no longer drag him into trouble he will soon come to the end of his rope and that will be the last of him said our hero to himself when he arrived at the boat it was very late and everybody but the watchman had gone to bed he turned in without awakening any of the others and slept soundly until morning much to his surprise peter polk did not come near him that morning and our hero was kept so busy at one thing and another that he had little time to think about the purser and his nefarious doings as soon as he got the chance he delivered the letter mr shalley had given him to captain hadley the captain read the communication in silence then he uttered a low whistle and looked at randy thoughtfully ive been suspecting this he said randy i believe you are to keep mum for the present yes sir i doubt if he troubles you any more ill be glad of it well get to work and some time well see what we will see answered the captain and there the talk was dropped it was a windy and cloudy day and a majority of the passengers were glad enough to remain in the cabin during the trip up the river about noon it began to thunder and the sky grew very black we are up against a storm now said jones to randy well have to take in some of the bunting the order was issued and randy set to work with the other deckhands to strip the decks soon it was raining furiously and all of the deckhands got pretty wet all of the passengers had gone inside so the decks were practically deserted randy was folding up some bunting when he heard a quick step behind him turning he saw himself confronted by peter polk the pursers face was dark and full of hatred now thompson i want to know what you did last night snarled the man i went ashore answered our hero as coolly as he could to see mr shalley yes if you must know and you gave him that letter i did what did he say he told me to mind my own business what for the instant peter polks face took on a pleased look so he really told you that yes humph i reckon you didnt expect such a reception to this remark our hero made no reply is the old man going to investigate went on peter polk you had better go and ask him you answer my question thompson i have nothing more to say at this the purser grew furious there were many occasions when his temper got the better of him and this was one of them he suddenly grabbed randy by the throat bending him backward over the rail you little cur he hissed you are trying to get the best of me but you shant do it le let go gasped randy he could hardly speak ill let go when i am through with you but first i what further peter polk had to say was drowned out by a violent crash of thunder then came a perfect deluge of rain driven over the decks by a wind that blew almost with hurricane force randy struggled harder than ever but the purser continued to hold him then the steamboat caught by the blast careened to one side and in a twinkling the youth was over the rail peter polk released his hold and down went poor randy until with a splash he sank beneath the waters of the hudson river chapter xxx a swim for life the shock came so suddenly that for the moment poor randy scarcely realized what was happening he went down and down and swallowed not a little of the river water when he came up blowing and spluttering he could see but little around him fortunately he had gone off to the rear of the steamboat thus escaping the danger of being struck by a paddlewheel all was so dark and the rain was so thick he could not make out the shore line ive got to swim for it he reasoned and struck out bravely it was no easy matter to keep afloat with so much clothing on he listened thinking he might hear the steamboat but the roaring of the wind and rain drowned out every other sound presently came another flash of lightning and then he saw the boat far ahead of him no one but peter polk had witnessed his fall from the deck and nobody appeared to be coming to his assistance he kept his head well above water and at the next flash of lightning caught a glimpse of one of the river banks without further hesitation he struck out in that direction it was a long and exhausting swim and poor randy thought he would never reach the shore the current carried him far down the river to where there was a small cove lined with rocks on one side and bushes and trees on the other he caught at some of the bushes desperately and at last pulled himself to a place of temporary safety for the time being our hero did nothing but try to get back his breath and his strength in a general way he had an idea that he was some distance below the town of catskill what to do next he hardly knew the first thing to do is to get out of this storm i suppose he told himself but that wont do a great deal of good since i cant get any wetter than i already am feeling a little bit rested he presently got up and walked around the edge of the cove then he began to climb the river bank proper it was hard work but soon he came out on a river roadway and saw at a distance a hotel and half a dozen fashionable cottages this looks familiar he told himself well i declare that place yonder must be the house at which bob bangs and his mother are stopping back of the house was a big barn and further to the rear was another building used as a summerhouse and a place where oars and other things for small boats might be stored the summer storm was now letting up a bit it was still raining but the thunder and lightning had ceased and the wind had gone down to get out of the rain and rest randy took himself to the summerhouse he was busy emptying the water from his shoes when he heard somebody utter an exclamation and turning saw bob bangs standing near umbrella in hand the rich youth was staring at him in astonishment where did you come from he demanded as he entered the summerhouse from the river you look pretty wet i have been in the water quite some time oh did you fall overboard from the steamboat i did you must be pretty careless went on bob with a sneer i certainly didnt fall overboard because i wanted to answered randy as lightly as he could say i understand you are trying to get my father into trouble pursued the rich boy throwing himself on a bench who told you that never mind you are handinglove with the bartlett crowd well why shouldnt i be bob bangs jack is my dearest friend humph i shouldnt care for him for a friend and he wouldnt pick you for a chum added jack quickly i consider myself better than jack bartlett to this our hero did not answer my dad is going to make it hot for old bartlett went on bob he is going to sue him for defamation of character when oh before a great while bartlett had no right to search our house and break open the safe he had the law on his side no he didnt just you wait till my dad brings suit it will ruin the bartletts i hope not how do you like being a steamboat deckhand went on the rich youth to change the subject very well it must

as wet as he was he resolved not to ask any favor at the hands of bob banks going eh said the rich youth yes humph murmured bob bangs and that was all he said despite the steady rain randy walked rapidly to the town doing this that he might not take cold once at the town he hurried to the steamboat landing hullo where did you come from exclaimed the dock master who knew him well from a bath answered randy with a laugh and then said he had fallen overboard from the helen shalley just before the landing at catskill was made nobody said anything about it said the dock master i guess they didnt know it answered our hero what are you going to do now telegraph to captain hadley and then stay in town until the boat comes back tomorrow better get dried off first you can come to my house if you wish it is not far off thank you mr ball randys telegram was a short one it ran as follows fell overboard am safe at catskill join boat tomorrow the telegram sent our hero went with mr ball to the latters house here he was loaned some dry clothing and mrs ball treated him to a late but satisfying supper after the meal was over and as it was now clear he decided to take a walk around the town before retiring had he known of what that walk was to reveal he would have been very much surprised chapter xxxi news of importance as was natural our hero drifted down to the long steamboat landing while he was standing around he saw a ferryboat coming across the river filled with passengers from the railroad station on the opposite shore as the passengers alighted he recognized amos bangs in the crowd the rich manufacturer looked around anxiously and presently caught sight of mrs bangs who had come to meet him in a carriage randy slipped out of sight well demanded amos bangs as soon as he and his wife were together oh amos the woman cried and could not go on is that all you can say viola demanded the husband harshly i can do nothing with the girl and she knows where the papers are she does how did it happen when mr tuller called upon me she played the eavesdropper she saw us open the safe and take out the papers and when i went and hid the papers she followed me but you said you were sure nobody knew where the papers were i thought so at the time but i was mistaken how did it come out the girl did not sweep and dust the parlor to suit me and i took her to task about it she threw down her broom and said she would take no words from me then i told her to pack her trunk and leave the house she grew more impertinent than ever and said she would go but i would have to pay her her wages regularly anyway i asked what she meant then she told me to go and look for the papers i had hidden and they were gone yes i was so overcome i nearly fainted and mrs bangss face showed her deep concern what next i went back to the girl and told her she must give the papers up or i would have her arrested she laughed in my face oh amos think of that horrid creature doing that she knew she had you growled the rich manufacturer what did you do then why i broke down i couldnt help it i asked her what she wanted for the papers she wouldnt tell and i said i would give her five dollars then she laughed in my face again i wanted to drive her from the house but i didnt dare did she say what she was going to do at last she said she would make a bargain think of it a bargain with a servant girl she wants me to pay her wages regularly and also twelve dollars a month for her board will she work for you no indeed she says she will go and live with her married sister humph let me see her name is jackson isnt it yes mamie jackson her sister lives over in oakdale did she go to oakdale i suppose she did she must have the papers with her no i think she hid them for she said we wouldnt find the papers even if we searched her and her trunk i will have to go to oakdale and see her said amos bangs after a pause in which he rubbed his chin reflectively the rich manufacturer and his wife had withdrawn to a corner of the dock while talking randy had kept nearby behind some boxes and barrels and had heard every word that was spoken that he was immensely interested goes without saying on the track of mr bartletts papers at last he told himself now what had i best do about it his one thought was to outwit amos bangs and with this in mind he left the dock and walked rapidly toward the telegraph office i wish to send another telegram said he as he drew the pad of forms toward him must be your night for sending messages answered the clerk by way of a joke i want this rushed through it is highly important all right hand it over randy hardly knew what to say but soon wrote down the following addressed to mr bartlett papers taken from mrs bangs by mamie jackson a servant now at sisters in oakdale hurry if you want to get them address me at catskill having sent the message there seemed nothing for randy to do but to retire this he did and was awakened two hours later by a message from mr bartlett which was in these words coming down first morning train meet me at catskill station hudson river railroad having received this message randy consulted a time table and found that the first albany train would arrive at the station across the river at about seven oclock he arranged to be on hand and then tried to go to sleep again but the most he could do was to take a few fitful naps as soon as the train rolled in philip bartlett alighted randy rushed towards him are you going to oakdale he asked quickly do you think it worth while randy i do then i will go you must come along i will answered our hero and then mr bartlett got back on the train and randy followed him i left word with mr ball so captain hadley wont worry about me randy explained when seated now tell me what this means asked philip bartlett impatiently i have been on the anxious seat ever since i received your telegram i want you to get in ahead of mr bangs said our hero and then told all he had overheard i will make that servant girl give me those papers said mr bartlett with decision perhaps you can scare her just as mr shalley scared a fellow who was aiding another man to rob him answered our hero i will tell you about that another time i am pledged not to say anything just at present chapter xxxii brought to terms conclusion they had to make one change of cars and then take a stage running to oakdale which was but a small village four miles from riverport when they arrived it was close on to midday fortunately for them one of the storekeepers of the village knew mamie jacksons married sister and also knew mamie and he told them where to go it was a dilapidated cottage on the outskirts surrounded by a garden filled mostly with weeds not very thrifty people that is certain was mr bartletts comment i think i shall know the servant if i see her said randy they paused at the gate and saw the two sisters near the side porch one was on a bench shelling peas and the other was lolling in a hammock each looked very untidy and both wore wrappers that were full of holes that is the servant said randy pointing to the person in the hammock and see she has some papers in her hands step behind the wellhouse said mr bartlett and this both of them quickly did well go ahead and read the papers mamie said the woman on the bench aint no use sarah i cant make head nor tail of em answered mamie jackson what do you suppose makes em so valuable i dont know but i do know the bangses dont want that mr bartlett to get hold of em i think you made a good bargain with the bangses that is if they pay up ill make em pay oh mrs bangs was scart i could see it mamie jackson laughed shrilly and to think she was going to discharge me well i guess you gave her a piece of your mind so i did she is too stuckup to live went on the former servant girl when i get my money im going to have a fine dress too and ill buy you one sarah oh mamie will you i want a blue silk so im going to have a green silk and a parasol to match and then oh dear look at them bees and with a shriek mamie jackson threw up her arms and sprang out of the hammock for the moment the papers were forgotten and quick to take advantage of the situation randy darted forward and secured them then he turned the documents over to philip bartlett who are you demanded the woman of the cottage rising in alarm its that mr bartlett himself shrieked mamie jackson forgetting all about the two bees that had disturbed her and which had now flown away oh how did you get here she faltered i came after my papers and i got them sooner than i anticipated answered mr bartlett and there was a tone of triumph in his voice are those your papers asked the girl trying to appear innocent you know they are i do not i i found them i know better you took them from where mrs bangs hid them well she didnt have any right to them i know that well enough i i was going to send them to you faltered the girl she scarcely knew what to say really returned philip bartlett dryly well i will save you the trouble its a shame to suspect an innocent girl like me said mamie jackson bursting into tears my sister never did anything wrong put in the other woman as i have my papers i wont argue with you returned mr bartlett but when the proper time comes you may have to explain how you happened to get the papers are you going to haul mr bangs into court perhaps well i will tell what i know about them if it will do any good mrs bangs and a man named tuller plotted to keep the papers out of your reach they opened the safe and took the papers out just before you came with that constable after that mamie jackson seemed anxious enough to confess and told her whole story omitting to state how she had asked mrs bangs to pay so much a month to her for keeping silent we may as well go back to the town and take the stage for riverport said mr bartlett to randy i will then telegraph to mr robinson to come on and we will settle with bangs tuller company in short order will you make him give up the control of the iron company either that or have him arrested for fraud the journey to riverport was quickly made and the telegram sent to mr robinson the bank official sent word back that he would be on in the morning then mr bartlett went to a hotel and randy hurried home why randy is it really you cried his mother as she kissed him this is certainly a surprise i didnt expect to come home said he how are you and how is father i am real well as you see and your father is doing splendidly he says he feels better now than for three years back that is good news but what brings you i will tell you said randy and sitting down he told his story just as i have related it here in the midst of the recital mr thompson came in and he listened also to what our hero had to say i hope mr bartlett gets what is coming to him said mr thompson and i hope mr shalley brings that peter polk to terms also the next morning randy received word to come to the iron works he went and there witnessed a stormy meeting between amos bangs on one side and mr bartlett and mr robinson on the other randy was called in as a witness and what he had to say made amos bangs gasp for breath and sink into a chair you are going to expose me to ruin me gasped amos bangs at last addressing the two men who had accused him we shall expose you unless you give up the control here and do as we think is fair said philip bartlett as for ruining you i think you have about ruined yourself but my wife and my son mrs bangs does not deserve my sympathy after what she has done as for your son he can go to work as my son has done bob what can he do work may make a man of him he will never amount to anything if you bring him up in idleness it is hard groaned amos bangs i i shall have to go to work myself that is what i was forced to do answered philip bartlett dryly but you will not be so badly off mr bangs your stock is worth at least four or five thousand dollars humph that is not much well i suppose i am cornered and must do as you say and he gave a deep sigh secretly however he was glad to escape arrest a lawyer was called in and the best part of the day was spent in drawing up and signing various legal documents the iron works were thereby placed in the control of mr bartlett mr robinson and a stockholder named wells and philip bartlett was made the general manager of the company all of the books and accounts were placed in charge of an expert accountant and in the end amos bangs had to make good a deficiency of cash the former rich man had to give up his elegant mansion and soon after he and his family moved to the west without leaving their new address behind them when randy went back to the steamboat two days later a surprise awaited him an accountant assisted by a detective had gone over peter polks affairs and discovered that the purser had robbed andrew shalley of between eight and ten thousand dollars polk had taken time by the forelock and fled he tried to get to canada but telegrams were sent out and he was caught just as he was trying to cross the suspension bridge at niagara falls later on he was brought back and tried and received three years in prison for his crimes he had nearly six thousand dollars of the stolen money in the bank and this was turned over to andrew shalley two hundred and fifty dollars went to mrs clare as part of her husbands estate bringing peter polk to justice is due to you randy said the steamboat owner after the affair was a thing of the past i feel i must reward you for what you did i dont ask any reward mr shalley i am glad that i cleared my own name here is something for you nevertheless said andrew shalley and handed a big document to our hero what is it it is the deed to the farm on which your folks are living it is made out in your name i bought the place from peter thompson your uncle now you have something that you can really call your own and mr shalley laughed pleasantly mr shalley you are more than kind cried randy warmly do my parents know of this no you can go home over sunday and surprise them i will and i thank you very much sir randy went home and there was a general rejoicing over the good news but more was to follow i met mr bartlett today said mr thompson he says they want a firstclass carpenter at the iron works to take charge of the repairs he offered me the place at a dollar a day more than i am getting good enough father cried randy that is just like mr bartlett he said he wanted to do something for us on your account and he sent you this added mr thompson and brought out a neat silver watch and chain it was a nice present and pleased randy greatly not long after that the season on the river closed and randy came home for the winter as his father now had a steady place at good wages the youth went to school in company with jack bartlett who had moved back to riverport with the rest of his family randy was a good scholar and made rapid progress i want you to get a good education wrote andrew shalley to our hero then later on you can enter my office if you wish or take a better place on the steamboat six years have passed since that time and randy has finished his education he is now the general manager for the steamboat company and rumor has it that he is soon to
