sing the ruggleses never forgot it i beat the hull lot o yer vii the birdling flies away my ain countree i thought of the star in the east the birds christmas carol i a little snow bird it was very early christmas morning and in the stillness of the dawn with the soft snow falling on the housetops a little child was born in the bird household they had intended to name the baby lucy if it were a girl but they had not expected her on christmas morning and a real christmas baby was not to be lightly named the whole family agreed in that they were consulting about it in the nursery mr bird said that he had assisted in naming the three boys and that he should leave this matter entirely to mrs bird donald wanted the child called dorothy after a pretty curlyhaired girl who sat next him in school paul choose luella for luella was the nurse who had been with him during his whole babyhood up to the time of his first trousers and the name suggested all sorts of comfortable things uncle jack said that the first girl should always be named for her mother no matter how hideous the name happened to be grandma said that she would prefer not to take any part in the discussion and everybody suddenly remembered that mrs bird had thought of naming the baby lucy for grandma herself and while it would be indelicate for her to favor that name it would be against human nature for her to suggest any other under the circumstances hugh the hitherto baby if that is a possible term sat in one corner and said nothing but felt in some mysterious way that his nose was out of joint for there was a newer baby now a possibility he had never taken into consideration and the first girl too a still higher development of treason which made him actually green with jealousy but it was too profound a subject to be settled then and there on the spot besides mamma had not been asked and everybody felt it rather absurd after all to forestall a decree that was certain to be absolutely wise just and perfect the reason that the subject had been brought up at all so early in the day lay in the fact that mrs bird never allowed her babies to go over night unnamed she was a person of so great decision of character that she would have blushed at such a thing she said that to let blessed babies go dangling and dawdling about without names for months and months was enough to ruin them for life she also said that if one could not make up ones mind in twentyfour hours it was a sign that but i will not repeat the rest as it might prejudice you against the most charming woman in the world so donald took his new velocipede and went out to ride up and down the stone pavement and notch the shins of innocent people as they passed by while paul spun his musical top on the front steps but hugh refused to leave the scene of action he seated himself on the top stair in the hall banged his head against the railing a few times just by way of uncorking the vials of his wrath and then subsided into gloomy silence waiting to declare war if more first girl babies were thrust upon a family already surfeited with that unnecessary article meanwhile dear mrs bird lay in her room weak but safe and happy with her sweet girl baby by her side and the heaven of motherhood opening again before her nurse was making gruel in the kitchen and the room was dim and quiet there was a cheerful open fire in the grate but though the shutters were closed the side windows that looked out on the church of our saviour next door were a little open suddenly a sound of music poured out into the bright air and drifted into the chamber it was the boy choir singing christmas anthems higher and higher rose the clear fresh voices full of hope and cheer as childrens voices always are fuller and fuller grew the burst of melody as one glad strain fell upon another in joyful harmony carol brothers carol carol joyfully carol the good tidings carol merrily and pray a gladsome christmas for all your fellowmen carol brothers carol christmas day again one verse followed another always with the same sweet refrain and pray a gladsome christmas for all your fellowmen carol brothers carol christmas day again mrs bird thought as the music floated in upon her gentle sleep that she had slipped into heaven with her new baby and that the angels were bidding them welcome but the tiny bundle by her side stirred a little and though it was scarcely more than the ruffling of a feather she awoke for the motherear is so close to the heart that it can hear the faintest whisper of a child she opened her eyes and drew the baby closer it looked like a rose dipped in milk she thought this pink and white blossom of girlhood or like a pink cherub with its halo of pale yellow hair finer than floss silk carol brothers carol carol joyfully carol the good tidings carol merrily the voices were brimming over with joy why my baby whispered mrs bird in soft surprise i had forgotten what day it was you are a little christmas child and we will name you carol mothers christmas carol what said mr bird coming in softly and closing the door behind him why donald dont you think carol is a sweet name for a christmas baby it came to me just a moment ago in the singing as i was lying here half asleep and half awake i think it is a charming name dear heart and sounds just like you and i hope that being a girl this baby has some chance of being as lovely as her mother at which speech from the babys papa mrs bird though she was as weak and tired as she could be blushed with happiness and so carol came by her name of course it was thought foolish by many people though uncle jack declared laughingly that it was very strange if a whole family of birds could not be indulged in a single carol and grandma who adored the child thought the name much more appropriate than lucy but was glad that people would probably think it short for caroline perhaps because she was born in holiday time carol was a very happy baby of course she was too tiny to understand the joy of christmastide but people say there is everything in a good beginning and she may have breathed in unconsciously the fragrance of evergreens and holiday dinners while the peals of sleighbells and the laughter of happy children may have fallen upon her baby ears and wakened in them a glad surprise at the merry world she had come to live in her cheeks and lips were as red as hollyberries her hair was for all the world the color of a christmas candleflame her eyes were bright as stars her laugh like a chime of christmasbells and her tiny hands forever outstretched in giving illustration she is a little christmas child such a generous little creature you never saw a spoonful of bread and milk had always to be taken by mamma or nurse before carol could enjoy her supper whatever bit of cake or sweetmeat found its way into her pretty fingers was straightway broken in half to be shared with donald paul or hugh and when they made believe nibble the morsel with affected enjoyment she would clap her hands and crow with delight why does she do it asked donald thoughtfully none of us boys ever did i hardly know said mamma catching her darling to her heart except that she is a little christmas child and so she has a tiny share of the blessedest birthday the world ever knew ii drooping wings it was december ten years later carol had seen nine christmas trees lighted on her birthdays one after another nine times she had assisted in the holiday festivities of the household though in her babyhood her share of the gayeties was somewhat limited for five years certainly she had hidden presents for mamma and papa in their own bureau drawers and harbored a number of secrets sufficiently large to burst a baby brain had it not been for the relief gained by whispering them all to mamma at night when she was in her crib a proceeding which did not in the least lessen the value of a secret in her innocent mind for five years she had heard twas the night before christmas and hung up a scarlet stocking many sizes too large for her and pinned a sprig of holly on her little white nightgown to show santa claus that she was a truly christmas child and dreamed of furcoated saints and toypacks and reindeer and wished everybody a merry christmas before it was light in the morning and lent every one of her new toys to the neighbors children before noon and eaten turkey and plumpudding and gone to bed at night in a trance of happiness at the days pleasures donald was away at college now paul and hugh were great manly fellows taller than their mother papa bird had gray hairs in his whiskers and grandma god bless her had been four christmases in heaven but christmas in the birds nest was scarcely as merry now as it used to be in the bygone years for the little child that once brought such an added blessing to the day lay month after month a patient helpless invalid in the room where she was born she had never been very strong in body and it was with a pang of terror her mother and father noticed soon after she was five years old that she began to limp ever so slightly to complain too often of weariness and to nestle close to her mother saying she would rather not go out to play please the illness was slight at first and hope was always stirring in mrs birds heart carol would feel stronger in the summertime or she would be better when she had spent a year in the country or she would outgrow it or they would try a new physician but by and by it came to be all too sure that no physician save one could make carol strong again and that no summertime nor country air unless it were the everlasting summertime in a heavenly country could bring back the little girl to health the cheeks and lips that were once as red as hollyberries faded to faint pink the starlike eyes grew softer for they often gleamed through tears and the gay childlaugh that had been like a chime of christmas bells gave place to a smile so lovely so touching so tender and patient that it filled every corner of the house with a gentle radiance that might have come from the face of the christchild himself love could do nothing and when we have said that we have said all for it is stronger than anything else in the whole wide world mr and mrs bird were talking it over one evening when all the children were asleep a famous physician had visited them that day and told them that some time it might be in one year it might be in more carol would slip quietly off into heaven whence she came it is no use to close our eyes to it any longer said mr bird as he paced up and down the library floor carol will never be well again it almost seems as if i could not bear it when i think of that loveliest child doomed to lie there day after day and what is still more to suffer pain that we are helpless to keep away from her merry christmas indeed it gets to be the saddest day in the year to me and poor mr bird sank into a chair by the table and buried his face in his hands to keep his wife from seeing the tears that would come in spite of all his efforts but donald dear said sweet mrs bird with trembling voice christmas day may not be so merry with us as it used but it is very happy and that is better and very blessed and that is better yet i suffer chiefly for carols sake but i have almost given up being sorrowful for my own i am too happy in the child and i see too clearly what she has done for us and the other children donald and paul and hugh were three strong willful boisterous boys but now you seldom see such tenderness devotion thought for others and selfdenial in lads of their years a quarrel or a hot word is almost unknown in this house and why carol would hear it and it would distress her she is so full of love and goodness the boys study with all their might and main why partly at least because they like to teach carol and amuse her by telling her what they read when the seamstress comes she likes to sew in miss carols room because there she forgets her own troubles which heaven knows are sore enough and as for me donald i am a better woman every day for carols sake i have to be her eyes ears feet hands her strength her hope and she my own little child is my example i was wrong dear heart said mr bird more cheerfully we will try not to repine but to rejoice instead that we have an angel of the house and as for her future mrs bird went on i think we need not be overanxious i feel as if she did not belong altogether to us but that when she has done what god sent her for he will take her back to himself and it may not be very long here it was poor mrs birds turn to break down and mr birds turn to comfort her iii the birds nest carol herself knew nothing of motherly tears and fatherly anxieties she lived on peacefully in the room where she was born but you never would have known that room for mr bird had a great deal of money and though he felt sometimes as if he wanted to throw it all in the sea since it could not buy a strong body for his little girl yet he was glad to make the place she lived in just as beautiful as it could be the room had been extended by the building of a large addition that hung out over the garden below and was so filled with windows that it might have been a conservatory the ones on the side were thus still nearer the church of our saviour than they used to be those in front looked out on the beautiful harbor and those in the back commanded a view of nothing in particular but a narrow alley nevertheless they were pleasantest of all to carol for the ruggles family lived in the alley and the nine little middlesized and big ruggles children were a source of inexhaustible interest the shutters could all be opened and carol could take a real sunbath in this lovely glass house or they could all be closed when the dear head ached or the dear eyes were tired the carpet was of soft gray with clusters of green bay and holly leaves the furniture was of white wood on which an artist had painted snow scenes and christmas trees and groups of merry children ringing bells and singing carols donald had made a pretty polished shelf and screwed it on the outside of the footboard and the boys always kept this full of blooming plants which they changed from time to time the headboard too had a bracket on either side where there were pots of maidenhair ferns lovebirds and canaries hung in their golden houses in the windows and they poor caged things could hop as far from their wooden perches as carol could venture from her little white bed on one side of the room was a bookcase filled with hundreds yes i mean it with hundreds and hundreds of books books with gaycolored pictures books without books with black and white outline sketches books with none at all books with verses books with stories books that made children laugh and some only a few that made them cry books with words of one syllable for tiny boys and girls and books with words of fearful length to puzzle wise ones this was carols circulating library every saturday she chose ten books jotting their names down in a diary into these she slipped cards that said please keep this book two weeks and read it with love carol bird then mrs bird stepped into her carriage and took the ten books to the childrens hospital and brought home ten others that she had left there the fortnight before this was a source of great happiness for some of the hospital children that were old enough to print or write and were strong enough to do it wrote carol sweet little letters about the books and she answered them and they grew to be friends it is very funny but you do not always have to see people to love them just think about it and tell me if it isnt so there was a high wainscoting of wood about the room and on top of this in a narrow gilt framework ran a row of illuminated pictures illustrating fairy tales all in dull blue and gold and scarlet and silver from the door to the closet there was the story of the fair one with golden locks from closet to bookcase ran puss in boots from bookcase to fireplace was jack the giantkiller and on the other side of the room were hop o my thumb the sleeping beauty and cinderella then there was a great closet full of beautiful things to wear but they were all dressinggowns and slippers and shawls and there were drawers full of toys and games but they were such as you could play with on your lap there were no ninepins nor balls nor bows and arrows nor bean bags nor tennis rackets but after all other children needed these more than carol bird for she was always happy and contented whatever she had or whatever she lacked and after the room had been made so lovely for her on her eighth christmas she always called herself in fun a bird of paradise on these particular december days she was happier than usual for uncle jack was coming from england to spend the holidays dear funny jolly loving wise uncle jack who came every two or three years and brought so much joy with him that the world looked as black as a thundercloud for a week after he went away again the mail had brought this letter london november wish you merry christmas you dearest birdlings in america preen your feathers and stretch the birds nest a trifle if you please and let uncle jack in for the holidays i am coming with such a trunk full of treasures that youll have to borrow the stockings of barnums giant and giantess i am coming to squeeze a certain little ladybird until she cries for mercy i am coming to see if i can find a boy to take care of a black pony that i bought lately its the strangest thing i ever knew ive hunted all over europe and cant find a boy to suit me ill tell you why ive set my heart on finding one with a dimple in his chin because this pony particularly likes dimples hurrah cried hugh bless my dear dimple ill never be ashamed of it again please drop a note to the clerk of the weather and have a good rousing snowstorm say on the twentysecond none of your meek gentle nonsensical shillyshallying snowstorms not the sort where the flakes float lazily down from the sky as if they didnt care whether they ever got here or not and then melt away as soon as they touch the earth but a regular businesslike whizzing whirring blurring cutting snowstorm warranted to freeze and stay on i should like rather a large christmas tree if its convenient not one of those sprigs five or six feet high that you used to have three or four years ago when the birdlings were not fairly feathered out but a tree of some size set it up in the garret if necessary and then we can cut a hole in the roof if the tree chances to be too high for the room tell bridget to begin to fatten a turkey tell her that by the twentieth of december that turkey must not be able to stand on its legs for fat and then on the next three days she must allow it to recline easily on its side and stuff it to bursting one ounce of stuffing beforehand is worth a pound afterwards the pudding must be unusually huge and darkly deeply lugubriously blue in color it must be stuck so full of plums that the pudding itself will ooze out into the pan and not be brought on to the table at all i expect to be there by the twentieth to manage these little things myself remembering it is the early bird that catches the worm but give you the instructions in case i should be delayed and carol must decide on the size of the tree she knows best she was a christmas child and she must plead for the snowstorm the clerk of the weather may pay some attention to her and she must look up the boy with the dimple for me shes likelier to find him than i am this minute she must advise about the turkey and bridget must bring the pudding to her bedside and let her drop every separate plum into it and stir it once for luck or ill not eat a single slice for carol is the dearest part of christmas to uncle jack and hell have none of it without her she is better than all the turkeys and puddings and apples and spareribs and wreaths and garlands and mistletoe and stockings and chimneys and sleighbells in christendom she is the very sweetest christmas carol that was ever written said sung or chanted and i am coming as fast as ships and railway trains can carry me to tell her so carols joy knew no bounds mr and mrs bird laughed like children and kissed each other for sheer delight and when the boys heard it they simply whooped like wild indians until the ruggles family whose back yard joined their garden gathered at the door and wondered what was up in the big house illustration iv birds of a feather flock together uncle jack did really come on the twentieth he was not detained by business nor did he get left behind nor snowed up as frequently happens in stories and in real life too i am afraid the snowstorm came also and the turkey nearly died a natural and premature death from overeating donald came too donald with a line of down upon his upper lip and greek and latin on his tongue and stores of knowledge in his handsome head and stories bless me you couldnt turn over a chip without reminding donald of something that happened at college one or the other was always at carols bedside for they fancied her paler than she used to be and they could not bear her out of sight it was uncle jack though who sat beside her in the winter twilights the room was quiet and almost dark save for the snowlight outside and the flickering flame of the fire that danced over the sleeping beautys face and touched the fair ones golden locks with ruddier glory carols hand all too thin and white these latter days lay close clasped in uncle jacks and they talked together quietly of many many things i want to tell you all about my plans for christmas this year uncle jack said carol on the first evening of his visit because it will be the loveliest one i ever had the boys laugh at me for caring so much about it but it isnt altogether because it is christmas nor because it is my birthday but long long ago when i first began to be ill i used to think the first thing when i waked on christmas morning today is christs birthday and mine i did not put the words close together you know because that made it seem too bold but i first said christs birthday out loud and then in a minute softly to myself and mine christs birthday and mine and so i do not quite feel about christmas as other girls do mamma says she supposes that ever so many other children have been born on that day i often wonder where they are uncle jack and whether it is a dear thought to them too or whether i am so much in bed and so often alone that it means more to me oh i do hope that none of them are poor or cold or hungry and i wish i wish they were all as happy as i because they are really my little brothers and sisters now uncle jack dear i am going to try and make somebody happy every single christmas that i live and this year it is to be the ruggleses in the rear that large and interesting brood of children in the little house at the end of the back garden yes isnt it nice to see so many together and uncle jack why do the big families always live in the small houses and the small families in the big houses we ought to call them the ruggles children of course but donald began talking of them as the ruggleses in the rear and papa and mamma took it up and now we cannot seem to help it the house was built for mr carters coachman but mr carter lives in europe and the gentleman who rents his place for him doesnt care what happens to it and so this poor family came to live there when they first moved in i used to sit in my window and watch them play in their back yard they are so strong and jolly and goodnatured and then one day i had a terrible headache and donald asked them if they would please not scream quite so loud and they explained that they were having a game of circus but that they would change and play deaf and dumb asylum all the afternoon ha ha ha laughed uncle jack what an obliging family to be sure yes we all thought it very funny and i smiled at them from the window when i was well enough to be up again now sarah maud comes to her door when the children come home from school and if mamma nods her head yes that means carol is very well and then you ought to hear the little ruggleses yell i believe they try to see how much noise they can make but if mamma shakes her head no they always play at quiet games then one day cary my pet canary flew out of her cage and peter ruggles caught her and brought her back and i had him up here in my room to thank him is peter the oldest no sarah maud is the oldest she helps do the washing and peter is the next he is a dressmakers boy and which is the pretty little redhaired girl thats kitty and the fat youngster baby larry and that most freckled one now dont laugh thats peoria carol you are joking no really uncle dear she was born in peoria thats all and is the next boy oshkosh no laughed carol the others are susan and clement and eily and cornelius they all look exactly alike except that some of them have more freckles than the others how did you ever learn all their names why i have what i call a windowschool it is too cold now but in warm weather i am wheeled out on my balcony and the ruggleses climb up and walk along our garden fence and sit down on the roof of our carriagehouse that brings them quite near and i tell them stories on thanksgiving day they came up for a few minutes it was quite warm at eleven oclock and we told each other what we had to be thankful for but they gave such queer answers that papa had to run away for fear of laughing and i couldnt understand them very well susan was thankful for trunks of all things in the world cornelius for horsecars kitty for pork steak while clem who is very quiet brightened up when i came to him and said he was thankful for his lame puppy wasnt that pretty it might teach some of us a lesson mightnt it little girl thats what mamma said now im going to give this whole christmas to the ruggleses and uncle jack i earned part of the money myself you my bird how well you see it could not be my own own christmas if papa gave me all the money and i thought to really keep christs birthday i ought to do something of my very own and so i talked with mamma of course she thought of something lovely she always does mammas head is just brimming over with lovely thoughts all i have to do is ask and out pops the very one i want this thought was to let her write down just as i told her a description of how a child lived in her own room for three years and what she did to amuse herself and we sent it to a magazine and got twentyfive dollars for it just think well well cried uncle jack my little girl a real author and what are you going to do with this wonderful own money of yours i shall give the nine ruggleses a grand christmas dinner here in this very room that will be papas contribution and afterwards a beautiful christmas tree fairly blooming with presents that will be my part for i have another way of adding to my twentyfive dollars so that i can buy nearly anything i choose i should like it very much if you would sit at the head of the table uncle jack for nobody could ever be frightened of you you dearest dearest dearest thing that ever was mamma is going to help us but papa and the boys are going to eat together downstairs for fear of making the little ruggleses shy and after weve had a merry time with the tree we can open my window and all listen together to the music at the evening churchservice if it comes before the children go i have written a letter to the organist and asked him if i might have the two songs i like best will you see if it is all right birds nest december dear mr wilkie i am the little girl who lives next door to the church and as i seldom go out the music on practice days and sundays is one of my greatest pleasures i want to know if you can have carol brothers carol on christmas night and if the boy who sings my ain countree so beautifully may please sing that too i think it is the loveliest thing in the world but it always makes me cry doesnt it you if it isnt too much trouble i hope they can sing them both quite early as after ten oclock i may be asleep yours respectfully carol bird ps the reason i like carol brothers carol is because the choirboys sang it eleven years ago the morning i was born and put it into mammas head to call me carol she didnt remember then that my other name would be bird because she was half asleep and could only think of one thing at a time donald says if i had been born on the fourth of july they would have named me independence or if on the twentysecond of february georgina or even cherry like cherry in martin chuzzlewit but i like my own name and birthday best yours truly carol bird uncle jack thought the letter quite right and did not even smile at her telling the organist so many family items the days flew by as they always fly in holiday time and it was christmas eve before anybody knew it the family festival was quiet and very pleasant but almost overshadowed by the grander preparations for the next day carol and elfrida her pretty german nurse had ransacked books and introduced so many plans and plays and customs and merrymakings from germany and holland and england and a dozen other countries that you would scarcely have known how or where you were keeping christmas even the dog and the cat had enjoyed their celebration under carols direction each had a tiny table with a lighted candle in the centre and a bit of bologna sausage placed very near it and everybody laughed till the tears stood in their eyes to see villikins and dinah struggle to nibble the sausages and at the same time to evade the candle flame villikins barked and sniffed and howled in impatience and after many vain attempts succeeded in dragging off the prize though he singed his nose in doing it dinah meanwhile watched him placidly her delicate nostrils quivering with expectation and after all the excitement had subsided walked with dignity to the table her beautiful gray satin trail sweeping behind her and calmly putting up one velvet paw drew the sausage gently down and walked out of the room without turning a hair so to speak elfrida had scattered handfuls of seed over the snow in the garden that the wild birds might have a comfortable breakfast next morning and had stuffed bundles of dry grasses in the fireplaces so that the reindeer of santa claus could refresh themselves after their long gallops across country this was really only done for fun but it pleased carol and when after dinner the whole family had gone to the church to see the christmas decorations carol limped out on her slender crutches and with elfridas help placed all the family boots in a row in the upper hall that was to keep the dear ones from quarreling all through the year there were papas stout top boots mammas pretty buttoned shoes next then uncle jacks donalds pauls and hughs and at the end of the line her own little white worsted slippers last and sweetest of all like the children in austria she put a lighted candle in her window to guide the dear christchild lest he should stumble in the dark night as he passed up the deserted street this done she dropped into bed a rather tired but very happy christmas fairy illustration v some other birds are taught to fly before the earliest ruggles could wake and toot his fivecent tin horn mrs ruggles was up and stirring about the house for it was a gala day in the family gala day i should think so were not her nine childern invited to a dinnerparty at the great house and werent they going to sit down free and equal with the mightiest in the land she had been preparing for this grand occasion ever since the receipt of carol birds invitation which by the way had been speedily enshrined in an old photograph frame and hung under the lookingglass in the most prominent place in the kitchen where it stared the occasional visitor directly in the eye and made him livid with envy birds nest december dear mrs ruggles i am going to have a dinnerparty on christmas day and would like to have all your children come i want them every one please from sarah maud to baby larry mamma says dinner will be at half past five and the christmas tree at seven so you may expect them home at nine oclock wishing you a merry christmas and a happy new year i am yours truly carol bird breakfast was on the table promptly at seven oclock and there was very little of it too for it was an excellent day for short rations though mrs ruggles heaved a sigh as she reflected that the boys with their indiarubber stomachs would be just as hungry the day after the dinnerparty as if they had never had any at all as soon as the scanty meal was over she announced the plan of the campaign now susan you an kitty wash up the dishes an peter cant yer spread up the beds sot i can git ter cuttin out larrys new suit i

eily cant you run out and ask mis cullen ter lend me a pair o stockins for peory n tell her if she will peoryll give jim half her candy when she gets home wont yer peory peoria was young and greedy and thought the remedy so out of all proportion to the disease that she set up a deafening howl at the projected bargain a howl so rebellious and so entirely out of season that her mother started in her direction with flashing eye and uplifted hand but she let it fall suddenly saying no i vow i wont lick ye christmas day if yer drive me crazy but speak up smart now n say whether yerd ruther give jim cullen half yer candy or go barelegged ter the party the matter being put so plainly peoria collected her faculties dried her tears and chose the lesser evil clem having hastened the decision by

that style with nine young ones n yer pa always off ter sea the big ruggleses worked so well and the little ruggleses kept from under foot so successfully that by one oclock nine complete toilets were laid out in solemn grandeur on the beds i say complete but i do not know whether they would be called so in the best society the law of compensation had been well applied he that had necktie had no cuffs she that had sash had no handkerchief and vice versa but they all had shoes and a certain amount of clothing such as it was the outside layer being in every case quite above criticism now sarah maud said mrs ruggles her face shining with excitement everythings red up an we can begin ive got a boiler n a kettle n a pot o hot water peter you go into the back bedroom n ill take susan kitty peory n cornelius n sarah maud you take clem n eily n larry one to a time scrub em n rinse em or t any rate gits furs yer can with em and then ill finish em off while you do yerself sarah maud couldnt have scrubbed with any more decision and force if she had been doing floors and the little ruggleses bore it bravely not from natural heroism but for the joy that was set before them not being satisfied however with the tone of their complexions and feeling that the number of freckles to the square inch was too many to be tolerated in the highest social circles she wound up operations by applying a little bristol brick from the knifeboard which served as the proverbial last straw from under which the little ruggleses issued rather red and raw and out of temper when the clock struck four they were all clothed and most of them in their right minds ready for those last touches that always take the most time kittys red hair was curled in thirtyfour ringlets sarah mauds was braided in one pigtail and susans and eilys in two braids apiece while peorias resisted all advances in the shape of hair oils and stuck out straight on all sides like that of the circassian girl of the circus so clem said and he was sent into the bedroom for it too from whence he was dragged out forgivingly by peoria herself five minutes later then exciting moment came linen collars for some and neckties and bows for others a magnificent green glass breastpin was sewed into peters purple necktie and eureka the ruggleses were dressed and solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these a row of seats was then formed directly through the middle of the kitchen of course there were not quite chairs enough for ten since the family had rarely wanted to sit down all at once somebody always being out or in bed or otherwise engaged but the woodbox and the coalhod finished out the line nicely and nobody thought of grumbling the children took their places according to age sarah maud at the head and larry on the coalhod and mrs ruggles seated herself in front surveying them proudly as she wiped the sweat of honest toil from her brow well she exclaimed if i do say so as shouldnt i never see a cleaner more stylish mess o childern in my life i do wish ruggles could look at ye for a minute larry ruggles how many times have i got ter tell yer not ter keep pullin at yer sash havent

illustration i want ter see how yer goin ter behave the youngsters hustled into the next room in high glee and mrs ruggles drew herself up in the chair with an infinitely haughty and purseproud expression that much better suited a descendant of the mcgrills than modest mrs bird the bedroom was small and there presently ensued such a clatter that you would have thought a herd of wild cattle had broken loose the door opened and they straggled in all the younger ones giggling with sarah maud at the head looking as if she had been caught in the act of stealing sheep while larry being last in line seemed to think the door a sort of gate of heaven which would be shut in his face if he didnt get there in time accordingly he struggled ahead of his elders and disgraced himself by tumbling in head foremost mrs ruggles looked severe there i knew yerd do it in some sech fool way now go in there and try it over again every last one o ye n if larry cant come in on two legs he can stay ter home d yer hear the matter began to assume a graver aspect the little ruggleses stopped giggling and backed into the bedroom issuing presently with lock step indian file a scared and hunted expression on every countenance no no no cried mrs ruggles in despair thats worse yet yer look for all the world like a gang o prisners there aint no style ter that spread out more cant yer n act kind o carelesslike nobodys goin ter kill ye that aint what a dinnerparty is the third time brought deserved success and the pupils took their seats in the row now yer know said mrs ruggles impressively

git up all of ye an try it speak up sarah maud sarah mauds tongue clove to the roof of her mouth quick ma thought it was sech a pleasant hat that wed wed better leave our short walk to home recited sarah maud in an agony of mental effort this was too much for the boys an earthquake of suppressed giggles swept all along the line oh whatever shall i do with yer moaned the unhappy mother i spose ive got to learn it to yer which she did word for word until sarah maud thought she could stand on her head and say it backwards now cornelius what are you goin ter say ter make yerself good compny do

dont expect it now well try a few things ter see how theyll go mr clement do you eat crambry sarse bet yer life cried clem who in the excitement of the moment had not taken in the idea exactly and had mistaken this for an ordinary bosomofthefamily question clement mcgrill ruggles do you mean to tell me that youd say that to a dinnerparty ill give ye one more chance mr clement will you take some of the crambry yes marm thank ye kindly if you happen ter have any handy very good indeed but they wont give yer two tries tonight yer just remember that miss peory do you speak for white or dark meat i

sarse with your pudden hard or soft oh a little of both if you please an im much obliged said kitty bowing with decided ease and grace at which all the other ruggleses pointed the finger of shame at her and peter grunted expressively that their meaning might not be mistaken you just stop your gruntin peter ruggles that warnt greedy that was all right i wish i could git it inter your heads that it aint so much what yer say as the way you say it and dont keep starin crosseyed at your necktie pin or ill take it out n sew it on to clem or cornelius sarah maudll keep her eye on it n if it turns broken side out shell tell yer gracious i shouldnt think youd ever seen nor worn no joolry in your life eily you an larrys too little to train so you just look at the rest an dos they do n the lord

get up n go now hev yer got that int yer head about once in so often could any words in the language be fraught with more terrible and wearing uncertainty well answered sarah maud mournfully seems as if this whole dinnerparty set right square on top o me mebbe i could manage my own manners but to manage nine mannerses is worse n staying to home oh dont fret said her mother goodnaturedly now that the lesson was over i guess youll git along i wouldnt mind if folks would only say oh childern will be childern but they wont theyll say land o goodness who fetched them childern up its quarter past five n yer can go now remember bout the hats dont all talk ter once susan lend yer hankchief ter peory peter dont keep screwin yer scarfpin cornelius hold yer head up straight sarah maud dont take yer eyes off o larry n larry you keep holt o sarah maud n do jest as she says n whatever you do all of yer never forget for one second that yer mother was a mcgrill vi when the pie was opened the birds began to sing the children went out of the back door quietly and were presently lost to sight sarah maud slipping and stumbling along absentmindedly as she recited rapidly under her breath itwassuchapleasanteveninnsuchashortwalk that wethoughtwedleaveourhatstohome itwassucha pleasanteveninnsuchashortwalk thatwethoughtwed leaveourhatstohome peter rang the doorbell and presently a servant admitted them and whispering something in sarahs ear drew her downstairs into the kitchen the other ruggleses stood in horrorstricken groups as the door closed behind their commanding officer but there was no time for reflection for a voice from above was heard saying come right up stairs please theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why theirs but to do or die accordingly they walked upstairs and elfrida the nurse ushered them into a room more splendid than anything they had ever seen but oh woe where was sarah maud and was it fate that mrs bird should say at once did you lay your hats in the hall peter felt himself elected by circumstance the head of the family and casting one imploring look at tonguetied susan standing next him said huskily it was so very pleasant that thatthat we hadnt good hats enough to go round put in little susan bravely to help him out and then froze with horror that the illfated words had slipped off her tongue however mrs bird said pleasantly of course you wouldnt wear hats such a short distance i forgot when i asked now will you come right in to miss carols room she is so anxious to see you just then sarah maud came up the back stairs so radiant with joy from her secret interview with the cook that peter could have pinched her with a clear conscience and carol gave them a joyful welcome but where is baby larry she cried looking over the group with searching eye didnt he come larry larry good gracious where was larry they were all sure that he had come in with them for susan remembered scolding him for tripping over the doormat uncle jack went into convulsions of laughter are you sure there were nine of you he asked merrily i think so sir said peoria timidly but anyhow there was larry and she showed signs of weeping oh well cheer up cried uncle jack probably hes not lost only mislaid ill go and find him before you can say jack robinson ill go too if you please sir said sarah maud for it was my place to mind him an if hes lost i cant relish my vittles the other ruggleses stood rooted to the floor was this a dinnerparty forsooth and if so why were such things ever spoken of as festive occasions sarah maud went out through the hall calling larry larry and without any interval of suspense a thin voice piped up from below here i be the truth was that larry being deserted by his natural guardian dropped behind the rest and wriggled into the hattree to wait for her having no notion of walking unprotected into the jaws of a fashionable entertainment finding that she did not come he tried to crawl from his refuge and call somebody when dark and dreadful ending to a tragic day he found that he was too much intertwined with umbrellas and canes to move a single step he was afraid to yell when i have said this of larry ruggles i have pictured a state of helpless terror that ought to wring tears from every eye and the sound of sarah mauds beloved voice some seconds later was like a strain of angel music in his ears uncle jack dried his tears carried him upstairs and soon had him in breathless fits of laughter while carol so made the other ruggleses forget themselves that they were presently talking like accomplished dinersout carols bed had been moved into the farthest corner of the room and she was lying on the outside dressed in a wonderful dressinggown that looked like a fleecy cloud her golden hair fell in fluffy curls over her white forehead and neck her cheeks flushed delicately her eyes beamed with joy and the children told their mother afterwards that she looked as beautiful as the angels in the picture books there was a great bustle behind a huge screen in another part of the room and at half past five this was taken away and the christmas dinnertable stood revealed what a wonderful sight it was to the poor little ruggles children who ate their sometimes scanty meals on the kitchen table it blazed with tall colored candles it gleamed with glass and silver it blushed with flowers it groaned with good things to eat so it was not strange that the ruggleses forgetting altogether that their mother was a mcgrill shrieked in admiration of the fairy spectacle but larrys behavior was the most disgraceful for he stood not upon the order of his going but went at once for a high chair that pointed unmistakably to him climbed up like a squirrel gave a comprehensive look at the turkey clapped his hands in ecstasy rested his fat arms on the table and cried with joy i beat the hull lot o yer carol laughed until she cried giving orders meanwhile uncle jack please sit at the head sarah maud at the foot and that will leave four on each side mamma is going to help elfrida so that the children need not look after each other but just have a good time a sprig of holly lay by each plate and nothing would do but each little ruggles must leave his seat and have it pinned on by carol and as each course was served one of them pleaded to take something to her there was hurrying to and fro i can assure you for it is quite a difficult matter to serve a christmas dinner on the third floor of a great city house but if it had been necessary to carry every dish up a rope ladder the servants would gladly have done so there were turkey and chicken with delicious gravy and stuffing and there were half a dozen vegetables with cranberry jelly and celery and pickles and as for the way these delicacies were served the ruggleses never forgot it as long as they lived peter nudged kitty who sat next him and said look will yer evry fellers got his own particlar butter i spose thats to show you can eat that n no more no it aint either for that pig of a peorys just gettin another helpin yes whispered kitty an the napkins is marked with big red letters i wonder if thats so nobodyll nip em an oh peter look at the pictures stickin right on ter the dishes did yee ever the plums is all took out o my crambry sarse an its friz to a stiff jell whispered peoria in wild excitement hi yah i got a wishbone sang larry regardless of sarah mauds frown after which she asked to have his seat changed giving as excuse that he genally set beside her an would feel strange the true reason being that she desired to kick him gently under the table whenever he passed what might be termed the mcgrill line i declare to goodness murmured susan on the other side theres so much to look at i cant scarcely eat nothin bet yer life i can said peter who had kept one servant busily employed ever since he sat down for luckily no one was asked by uncle jack whether he would have a second helping but the dishes were quietly passed under their noses and not a single ruggles refused anything that was offered him even unto the seventh time then when carol and uncle jack perceived that more turkey was a physical impossibility the meats were taken off and the dessert was brought in a dessert that would have frightened a strong man after such a dinner as had preceded it not so the ruggleses for a strong man is nothing to a small boy and they kindled to the dessert as if the turkey had been a dream and the six vegetables an optical delusion there were plumpudding mincepie and icecream and there were nuts and raisins and oranges kitty chose icecream explaining that she knew it by sight though she hadnt never tasted none but all the rest took the entire variety without any regard to consequences illustration the ruggleses never forgot it my dear child whispered uncle jack as he took carol an orange there is no doubt about the necessity of this feast but i do advise you after this to have them twice a year or quarterly perhaps for the way these children eat is positively dangerous i assure you i tremble for that terrible peoria im going to run races with her after dinner never mind laughed carol let them have enough for once it does my heart good to see them and they shall come oftener next year the feast being over the ruggleses lay back in their chairs languidly like little gorged boaconstrictors and the table was cleared in a trice then a door was opened into the next room and there in a corner facing carols bed which had been wheeled as close as possible stood the brilliantly lighted christmas tree glittering with gilded walnuts and tiny silver balloons and wreathed with snowy chains of popcorn the presents had been bought mostly with carols storymoney and were selected after long consultations with mrs bird each girl had a blue knitted hood and each boy a red crocheted comforter all made by mamma carol and elfrida because if you buy everything it doesnt show so much love said carol then every girl had a pretty plaid dress of a different color and every boy a warm coat of the right size here the useful presents stopped and they were quite enough but carol had pleaded to give them something for fun i know they need the clothes she had said when they were talking over the matter just after thanksgiving but they dont care much for them after all now papa wont you please let me go without part of my presents this year and give me the money they would cost to buy something to amuse the ruggleses you can have both said mr bird promptly is there any need of my little girls going without her own christmas i should like to know spend all the money you like but that isnt the thing objected carol nestling close to her father it wouldnt be mine what is the use havent i almost everything already and am i not the happiest girl in the world this year with uncle jack and donald at home you know very well it is more blessed to give than to receive so why wont you let me do it you never look half as happy when you are getting your presents as when you are giving us ours now papa submit or i shall have to be very firm and disagreeable with you very well your highness i surrender thats a dear papa now what were you going to give me confess a bronze figure of santa claus and in the little round belly that shakes when he laughs like a bowlful of jelly is a wonderful clock oh you would never give it up if you could see it nonsense laughed carol as i never have to get up to breakfast nor go to bed nor catch trains i think my old clock will do very well now mamma what were you going to give me oh i hadnt decided a few more books and a gold thimble and a smellingbottle and a musicbox perhaps poor carol laughed the child merrily she can afford to give up these lovely things for there will still be left uncle jack and donald and paul and hugh and uncle rob and aunt elsie and a dozen other people to fill her christmas stocking so carol had her way as she generally did but it was usually a good way which was fortunate under the circumstances and sarah maud had a set of miss alcotts books and peter a modest silver watch cornelius a toolchest clement a doghouse for his lame puppy larry a magnificent noahs ark and each of the younger girls a beautiful doll you can well believe that everybody was very merry and very thankful all the family from mr bird down to the cook said that they had never seen so much happiness in the space of three hours but it had to end as all things do the candles flickered and went out the tree was left alone with its gilded ornaments and mrs bird sent the children downstairs at half past eight thinking that carol looked tired now my darling you have done quite enough for one day said mrs bird getting carol into her little nightgown im afraid you will feel worse tomorrow and that would be a sad ending to such a charming evening oh wasnt it a lovely lovely time sighed carol from first to last everything was just right i shall never forget larrys face when he looked at the turkey nor peters when he saw his watch nor that sweet sweet kittys smile when she kissed her dolly nor the tears in poor dull sarah mauds eyes when she thanked me for her books nor but we mustnt talk any longer about it tonight said mrs bird anxiously you are too tired dear i am not so very tired mamma i have felt well all day not a bit of pain anywhere perhaps this has done me good perhaps i hope so there was no noise or confusion it was just a merry time now may i close the door and leave you alone dear papa and i will steal in softly by and by to see if you are all right but i think you need to be very quiet oh im willing to stay by myself but i am not sleepy yet and i am going to hear the music you know yes i have opened the window a little and put the screen in front of it so that you wont feel the air can i have the shutters open and wont you turn my bed please this morning i woke ever so early and one bright beautiful star shone in that eastern window i never noticed it before and i thought of the star in the east that guided the wise men to the place where the baby jesus was goodnight mamma such a happy happy day goodnight my precious christmas carol mothers blessed christmas child bend your head a minute mother dear whispered carol calling her mother back mamma dear i do think that we have kept christs birthday this time just as he would like it dont you i am sure of it said mrs bird softly illustration vii the birdling flies away the ruggleses had finished a last romp in the library with paul and hugh and uncle jack had taken them home and stayed a while to chat with mrs ruggles who opened the door for them her face all aglow with excitement and delight when kitty and clem showed her the oranges and nuts that they had kept for her she astonished them by saying that at six oclock mrs bird had sent her in the finest dinner she had ever seen in her life and not only that but a piece of dressgoods that must have cost a dollar a yard if it cost a cent as uncle jack went down the rickety steps he looked back into the window for a last glimpse of the family as the children gathered about their mother showing their beautiful presents again and again and then upward to a window in the great house yonder a little child shall lead them he thought well if if anything ever happens to carol i will take the ruggleses under my wing softly uncle jack whispered the boys as he walked into the library a while later we are listening to the music in the church the choir has sung carol brothers carol and now we think the organist is beginning to play my ain countree for carol i hope she hears it said mrs bird but they are very late tonight and i dare not speak to her lest she should be asleep it is almost ten oclock the boy soprano clad in white surplice stood in the organ loft the light shone full upon his crown of fair hair and his pale face with its serious blue eyes looked paler than usual perhaps it was something in the tender thrill of the voice or in the sweet words but there were tears in many eyes both in the church and in the great house next door i am far frae my hame i am weary aften whiles for the langedfor hamebringin an my faethers welcome smiles an ill neer be fu content until my een do see the gowden gates o heaven in my ain countree illustration my ain countree the earth is decked wi flowrs mony tinted fresh an gay an the birdies warble blythely for my faether made them sae but these sights an these souns will as naething be to me when i hear the angels singin in my ain countree like a bairn to its mither a wee birdie to its nest i fain would be gangin noo unto my faethers breast for he gathers in his arms helpless worthless lambs like me an carries them himsel to his ain countree there were tears in many eyes but not in carols the loving heart had quietly ceased to beat and the wee birdie in the great house had flown to its home nest carol had fallen asleep but as to the song i think perhaps i cannot say she heard it after all so sad an ending to a happy day perhaps to those who were left and yet carols mother even in the freshness of her grief was glad that her darling had slipped away on the loveliest day of her life out of its glad content into everlasting peace she was glad that she had gone as she had come on the wings of song when all the world was brimming over with joy glad of every grateful smile of every joyous burst of laughter of every loving thought and word and deed the dear last day had brought sadness reigned it is true in the little house behind the garden and one day poor sarah maud with a courage born of despair threw on her hood and shawl walked straight to a certain house a mile away up the marble steps into good dr bartols office falling at his feet as she cried oh sir it was me an our children that went to miss carols last dinnerparty an if we made her worse we cant never be happy again then the kind old gentleman took her rough hand in his and told her to dry her tears for neither she nor any of her flock had hastened carols flight indeed he said that had it not been for the strong hopes and wishes that filled her tired heart she could not have stayed long enough to keep that last merry christmas with her dear ones and so the old years fraught with memories die one after another and the new years bright with hopes are born to take their places but carol lives again in every chime of christmas bells that peal
