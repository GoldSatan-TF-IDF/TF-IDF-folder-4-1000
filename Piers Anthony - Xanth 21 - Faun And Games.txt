of his nights sleep out of his eyes and looked down to the base of his tree there stood a fetching nymph with all the usual nymphly features pretty face flowing hair perfect figure and no clothing but there was something amiss what do you mean he asked as he sat up in a fork still getting his bearings what do you think i mean faun come down and chase me the way fauns always do to nymphs then he had it youre no nymph oh pooh she swore pouting she dissolved into smoke and reformed as a luscious clothed demoness i am d mentia out seeking routine entertainment or mischief while my better half waxes disgustingly motherly what gave me away if i tell you will you go somewhere else it was usually possible to get rid of demons if one made a suitable deal with them yes if you want me to her bright yellow dress fuzzed showing the vague outline of her body beneath with almost a suggestion of a forbidden panty line so there was a catch why wouldnt i want you to because i have dreadful information that will puzzle and alarm you and perhaps change your whole outlook that seemed like adequate reason forrest now fully awake jumped down to the ground landing neatly on his hoofs what gave you away was your manner you were not acting like a nymph you were way too forward and intelligent much of a nymphs appeal is in her seeming reticence and lack of intellect now whats this dreadful information follow me mentia whirled in place so that her body twisted into a tight spiral before untwisting facing the opposite direction and walked away her skirt shrank so as to show her legs as far up as was feasible without running out of limb but of course forrest didnt notice because nothing a demoness showed was very real she led him across the glade to a tree on the far side see forrest stared with dismay at the clog tree it was wilting and its clogs were falling to the ground that could mean only one thing it had lost its spirit as it happened the clog trees spirit was forrests friend branch faun they had known each other for almost two centuries because their two trees were in sight of each other almost every day forrest would drop out of his sandalwood tree and join branch in the glade between them to dance a jlg or two with luck their igging would attract the fleeting attention of a nymph or three who would join ill jiggling with further luck jig and jiggle would lead to a pleasant chase and celebration but this morning branchs tree was in a sad state it wouldnt fade so soon if its faun were merely absent fauns and nymphs shared an awareness with their trees that alerted them instantly if harm came to either let a human forester even come near such a tree with an axe and its faun would have a fit let a faun split a hoof and his tree would shudder such reactions were independent of distance a faun could run far away from his tree and still be closely attuned to it they felt each others pain are you trying to ignore me mentia asked warningly demollesses could handle almost anything except that no youre right i am puzzled and alarmed by this dreadful scene do you know anythin about it no i just happened to note it in passing so i looked for the closest creature who might be tormented by it he glanced at her youre one crazy organism thank you she said flushing red with candy stripes the color extended to her clothing and hair and traces of it radiated into the air around her the clog trees distress meant that branch was in serious trouble if not dead what could have happened branch had been fine yesterday in fact he had encountered a nymph from a lady slipper tree whose slippers gave her special fleetness just as the sandals from forrests sandalwood tree gave him excellent footing and the clogs from branchs tree protected his hoofs they had had quite a merry chase because that was what fauns and nymphs did they chased each other until they came together and then they celebrated in a manner that children were not supposed to see because it did tend to get dull just sitting in ones tree all the time in fact forrest now remembered the nymph clad only in her slippers had led branch a chase right out of sight meanwhile her friend from an oak tree named kara ke had done some very nice singing to background music of wind through trees so forrest had had his own distraction naturally he had chased her and naturally she had fled but not too swiftly because she was still singing her oak song so he had caught her and they had celebrated in the usual fashion while she continued singing that had been interesting because she had sung of every detail of the experience they were sharing making it a work of musical art then she had returned to her tree satisfied that her song worked there werent any other nymphs around at the moment so forrest had returned to his own tree and settled down for the night and now his friend was gone so what are you going to do about it mentia inquired do she was right he probably should be doing something but what what do you think i think you will follow their footprints so you can find out what happened to them now thats really sensible he agreed the demoness turned smoky black darn he set off in search of them he had no trouble following their tracks her slipper prints which were hourglass shaped in the manner of the nymph herself and his clog prints which were forceful and furred they looped around other trees as she made cute dodges and diversions it was the chase that counted fauns and nymphs loved lo run almost as much as they loved to dance the better the chase the better the celebration at the end forrest remembered a nymph once who had been in a bad mood because her tree was suffering a fungus infestation and had simply stood there this was of course a complete turnoff and no faun had touched her any nymph who wanted nothing to do with any particular faun had only to refuse to move and he would leave her alone sometimes a nymph teased a faun pretending disinterest then leaping into pursuit the moment he turned his back if she caught him it was her advantage and he had to do whatever she wanted of course that was exactly the same as what he wanted but other fauns would taunt him unmercifully for getting caught mentia floating along beside him was getting bored are you ready for me to depart yes he agreed absently good she remained where she was he realized that he should have urged her to stay then she would have been sure that he was up to nothing interesting the tracks veered toward the void that was the nearby reion of no return of course every faun and nymph knew better than to enter it because there was no way out of it anything that crossed the boundary was doomed only special creatures like the night mares could escape it because they werent real in the way ordinary folk were they had very little substance dont float too near the void forrest warned the demoness she changed course to approach the boundary then paused say you are a cunning one she said with admiration you knew id automatically do the opposite it almost worked too but im only a little crazy you have to be a lot crazy to venture into the void maybe next time he muttered the nymph was clearly teasing branch by passing flirtingly close to the fringe of the void her prints almost touched the boundary then moved away then came close again the menace of that drelid region added to the thrill of the chase forrest had done it too and knew exactly the steps to take to be sure of never straying across the line then his sandals balked he stopped perplexed what was the matter his sandals were magic and protected his hoofs from harm and if he were about to step somewhere harmful they stopped him yet he saw nothing ahead to be concerned about so whats with you mentia asked tired of walking i didnt stop he explained my sandals did say im getting to like you youre almost as weird as i am thats impossible thank you this time her flush of pleasure was purple with green polka dots and it extended down her legs and out across the ground around her so why did your sandals stop im not sure maybe it was a false alarm still his sandals had never yet been wrong so he dropped to his furry knees and examined the ground before him it was ordinary there were a few smiling gladiolas the happiest of flowers and beyond them some horse radishes were flicking off flies with their tails he thought of asking the nearest horse if it knew of anything harmful here but he didnt understand plant language very well and in any event all it would say would be neigh so finally he got up and made a detour around the place oh well the demoness said disappointed but now he couldnt find the trail both sets of tracks were gone so he turned backand that was when he saw it a splinter of reverse wood on the ground he was sure of its identity because the gladiola closest to it was drooping sadly and right across it was a lady slipper print the nymph had inadvertently stepped on the splinter it hadnt hurt her directly because it was lying flat but it must have affected the fleet magic of her slipper so that she had lost her sure footing you see something d mentia remarked astutely now he saw the clogprint next to it and realized the awful truth the nymph had lost her balance because of the reversal of her slipper magic and teetered on the edge of the boundary of the void branch had collided with her caught by surprise by her sudden stop and the two had sprawled into the void yes they are gone it was a freak accident the kind that would happen hardly once in a century the reverse wood splinter might have been blown there recently by an errant gust of wind it would have been harmless except when it came into contact with something magical then that abrupt reversal branch and the nymph were lost they would never get out of the void and their trees would suffer for without its spirit a magical tree slowly lost its magic and became dreadful destiny virtually mundane it was a fate many believed worse than extinction im sorry the demoness said that means that you wont be entertaining me any more forrest had no idea where the nymphs tree was but knew it was suffering similarly he hoped there would be another nymph free to join it and save it meanwhile he did know where branchs tree was but what could he do he could not care for two trees the relationship didnt work that way he was bound to his sandalwood tree he knew of no fauns looking for trees there were more trees than amenable fauns and nymphs so that some trees that might have flourished magically became ordinary it was sad because the right trees had much to offer their companion spirits but true then he thought of something it was a vanishingly tiny chance but marginally better than nothing youre a spirit he said to the demoness how would you like to adopt a tree you mean become a tree dryad so that i would live almost forever and always protect it yes its a worthy occupation it doesnt have to be a nymph any caring spirit will do if the commitment is there and the clogs would protect your feet commitment protected feet she tried to look serious but smoke started puffing out her ears and finally she exploded into a hilarious fireball ho ho ho then again maybe the notion had been worse than nothing demons had no souls because they were the degraded remnants of souls themselves they cared for nothing and nobody sorry i mentioned it oh im not that was my laugh for the day the smoke coalesced into the extraordinarily feminine female woman distaff luscious shape of girlish persuasion with the slightly translucent dress a tree nymph you are a barrel of laughs she formed into a brown barrel with brightly colored pancakeshaped laughs overflowing its rim forrest ignored her as well as he could and headed for his home tree how could he have been so stupid as to make such a suggestion to a demoness she followed the oddest thing is that my better half well might have agreed were she not otherwise occupied she has half a soul but also a half mortal child so shes busy im the half without the soul as if he couldnt have guessed you could share the soul of the tree the soul of a shoe tree she exclaimed her laughter building up another head of steam a clog sole protecting my feet oh hold me somebody i think im going to expire of mirth her body swelled until it burst and disappeared leaving only a faint titter behind this time it seemed she really was gone but forrest didnt chance it he walked directly back without looking around when he returned and looked at the clog tree his heart sank into his stomach the poor thing was so droopy and sad it was all that remained of his friend branch he had to do something to help it he walked up and put a hand on the trunk have confidence clog tree i will find you another spirit just give me time to do it the tree must have heard him because its leaves perked up and became greener it knew him because he had been near it many times and was the friend of its faun it trusted him to help it he had promised and he would do his best some folk thought that fauns and nymphs were emptyheaded creatures incapable of feeling or commitment but those folk were confusing types the creatures of the faun and nymph retreat had no memory beyond a day so every new day was a new adventure but that was the magic of the retreat any who left there started to turn real which meant they aged and had memories some preserved their youth by finding useful jobs jewel the nymph had taken on the chore of spreading gems throughout xanth so that others would have the delightful challenge of finding them and later she had married a mortal man and become a grandmother many others had adopted magical trees just as forrest had it was a kind of symbiosis which was a fancy word meaning that the two got along great together and helped each other survive the trees kept the fauns or nymphs young because trees lived a long time and their spirits shared that longevity the fauns or nymphs protected their trees bringing them water in times of drought and harassing woodsmen who wanted to chop the trees down nymphs had very effective ways to distract woodsmen or to persuade them to spare their trees sometimes a nymph would even marry a woodsman if that was what it took but her first loyalty was always to her tree fauns had other ways such as setting booby traps or informing large dragons where a nice man sized meal could be had near a certain tree one way or another they protected their timber as well as enhancing the natural magic of the trees but the sudden loss of branch left the clog tree in trouble such relationships were not lightly made or broken a faun who lost his tree died and a tree who lost its faun turned mundane an even sadder state so he had to find a replacement if only i had the faintest notion how he said in anguish there was a swirl of smoke it formed into a large pot labeled sex i should have thought a faun already knew how it said but i suppose i could show you if he should have known that the demoness hadnt really gone she was still hoping he might do something entertaining how to find a suitable spirit for the clog tree he clarified naturally you have no better notion than i do naturally not the pot agreed its label changing to kettle as it turned black i would never think of going to ask the good magician humfrey the last time i suggested that i had to guide a stupid gargoyle there and he wound up saving xanth from whatever actually that adventure did have its points it certainly was interesting the kettle formed back into the luscious lady shape so theres no point in suggesting it especially since the good magician charges a years service for an answer so you might as well abandon all hope and just let the stupid tree die ill go see the good magician forrest exclaimed then he realized that she had tricked him into reacting just as he had tried to trick her he had said it and the clog tree had heard its leaves were becoming almost wholesome now he had to do it but a years service i cant leave my own tree that long he protested belatedly and i dont even know the way there you need a guide mentia said i need to go bother my better half some more but i can find a friend to show you the way to humfreys castle i dont want any friend of yours excellent you will find her just as lusciously annoying as i am ill be right back with her the demoness popped off again he had said the wrong thing but he was now committed to going how would the trees fare during his absence he didnt want them to suffer but there didnt seem to be much of an alternative but there might be a way to get some help on that there was a cave nearby where a nice cousin of com pewter dwelt she was compassion and she loved everybody because a love spring flowed in her cave her powers were limited but she would do any favor she could manage for the local folk maybe she would be able to help the trees unfortunately there was a complication about dealing with her which was why he normally stayed clear but at the moment he didnt seem to have much choice he would just have to hope that it would work out all right he fetched his knapsack which he always used when going far from his tree and ran through field and dale until he came to passions cave lovely purple flowers grew at its entrance and the scent of the air was sweet oh no he had in his haste forgotten something important it was usual to bring a little gift to passion when visiting her it wasnt exactly to put her in a good mood because she was always in a good mood it wasnt just protocol either it was that a gift tended to make her feel that she should do something in returnand he really needed that return favor what could he find for a gift passions main weakness was that she couldnt do anything physical she couldnt walk out of her cave and see the sights or pick the flowers so sometimes folk brought her stories of the things outside to keep her informed but he suspected he would need more than that then he remembered something the chips passion loved chips what she did with them no one knew but she truly valued them he knew where some nice chips grew he ran to the glade where the chips were sure enough there was a nice new crop of them chips of every kind grew in profusion which ones would please her most he pondered briefly then went for a potato chip the moment he harvested it he felt the urge to speak and his words were really salty he also felt extremely thirsty he quickly put it into his knapsack and sealed it shut across the glade was a brown region he went there and harvested a chocolate chip it smelled good enough to eat but he didnt dare take time for that now if he ate one he might get a hunger for more and be unable to stop so he popped it quickly into his bag one more should do it he looked around and saw an old block in the center of the glade so he went and took a chip off that it was very stubborn and didnt want to turn loose but when he touched it he got stubborn too and finally did pry the chip off the old block he nerved himself and entered the cave it was very nice inside he knew that it was really a rather ordinary cave but the overflow from the love spring ran through it and some of the water evaporated and suffused the air that was part of the complication he would have tried to breathe through a cloth or something but that would be impolite and impoliteness was bad form when one came begging a favor so he took it in stride and his stride was good he reached the center where reclined a device fashioned of passion wood fle stopped and took a breath before he spoke a screen lighted who is there it inquired in neat cursive script forrest faun he said from the nearby sandalwood tree why dear boy how very nice to see you the screen said with a sweet row of hearts across the bottom uh likewise im sure he said this wasnt going well uh i brought you a gift the screen glowed brightly why how ve thoughtful of you dear boy and the hearts grew larger v y if t t y not well at all uh here they are he fumbled in his bag and pulled out the chocolate chip a sweet for the sweet he found another chip and fumbled it out a salt for the salty oops that wasnt right so he rushed on to the third and a chip off the old block for the stubborn worse yet why dear boy i believe you are flustered the screen said smiling uh yes he confessed he was two centuries old but felt like an adolescent elf how ve sweet the screen turned valentine pink and what is your request of me dear boy forrest launched into his story of the fate of branch faun and the need to save his tree so i must go ask the good magician what to do he concluded but i cant even leave my own tree that long safely so i thought maybe you could well sort of change reality to make the trees all right for a while if you wanted to until i get back suddenly it seemed rather stupid so all this is just to help a tree yes he confessed feeling woefully inadequate the whole notion was ridiculous he would have to find some other way but i guess you have more important things to do im sorry i bothered you dear boy you have such a generous spirit i really like you of course you must save the tree i will help you you will he was amazed he had thought it so trivial as far as anyone else was concerned but now it seemed important again yes of course i have my price dread surged back what changed reality would she require of him yes you kpow i have a romantic nature but that i am a machine i can only dream of love not actually experience it yes this sounded worse but i can on occasion approximate love if i have a cooperativ partner she could what was she going to make him do but he was stuck for it yes kiss my mouse but you dont have a mouth compassion not mouth mouse what i have a mouse she explained patiently i want you to kiss it what term do you not understand buta mouse a small living creature usqfulfor going where i am unable to go in this case romance she thought it would be romantic for him to kiss her mouse i if i have to be thanf l i managed to exchange the donkey i had recently for the mouse it was an asinine creature he certainly wouldnt have wanted to kiss her asinine creature okay then the cave chamber shimmered and he knew she was changini reality it became a lovely glade surrounded by red green purple yellow and orange trees with their assorted round fruits of similar colors and flour plants growing in the center from the far side came the prettiest nymph he could remember seeing with thick lustrous brown hair that spread out to form a cloak for her body but it could not conceal the elegant curves of that graceful form as she walked she came up to him as he stood somewhat bemused by the change he had not expected a reality shift of this magnitude and what was the nymph doing here i am terian she said kiss me but im supposed to kiss aa mouse he said i am that one i am the mouse terian i am older than i look youre the mouse he stared at her but youre beautiful thank you it has been forty millennia since i have had a compliment like that others have thought me to be primitive or crude oh you are neither of those things you are the loveliest creature i can imagine thank you now you must kiss me for i cant kiss you i dont know how like this he said enthusiastically he folded her lithe and softly yielding body in his arms and kissed her firmly on her luscious lips at first she was hesitant but then she got into the feel of it and kissed him back what had been a halfway experimental effort became a fullfledged delight after a wonderfully long time he felt obliged to break it off for one thing he had forgotten to breathe he looked into her deep brown eyes oh terian that was the greatest kiss i ever had thank you then she turned and walked back across the glade astonished he just watched not knowing what to make of it the scene shimmered and the cave returned he was staring at the screen where the words thank you were scripted i dont understand he said mouse terian could not stay i can alter reali only so much perhaps some day someone will go out into the field and harvest me a cereal port so that i can make better se of the mouse but he did enjoy your kiss and so did i he was slowly and uncertainly recovering his grip on reality shewhat is she like really a mouse ran up on top of the wooden frame holding the screen and stood on its hind feet for a moment facing him here so terian really was a mouse he truly had kissed a mouse transformed by a temporarily local change of reality but nevertheless a mouse yet a detail didnt fit but she spoke to me in sound i am rather proud of my sound system as the words appeared on the screen they came in sound too i was the one speaking so it could all be explained it had been crafted from sound and temporary reality it hadnt really been a lovely nymph still it had been impressive i think you are getting close to the feeling of romance compassion he said sincerely thank you wait until i complete my next upgrade then more than kissing will be feasible that was somewhat daunting isis that all yes unfortunately for now take the two disks beside me and set one in each tree they will alter the trees reality slightly so that your absence will seem like only a day they will not wither or wilt but you must be back within a month or the effect willfade and then they will suffer thank you he said gratefully he picked up the two small wooden disks and tucked them carefully into his knapsack any time dear boy it was a pleasure he made his way outside the fresh air cleared his head of the fumes from the love spring he realized that in that ambiance he had wanted to experience the romance and that must have helped the effect what a woman terian had seemed to be some day she would surely make some male mouse excruciatingly happy and once compassion was fully compatible she might make the notorious com pewter happy too there was a swirl of smoke before him two parts of it descended to the ground and formed into feet the rest became a smoky nymph figure this must be the faun she said of course its me mentia he said who else would it be the dark face frowned i am not mentia oops demonesses could be troublesome when annoyed i apologize i thought any creature that lovely had to be mentia oh you did did you mentias crazy consider this the form shifted and reassembled becoming so exquisite that it was difficult to look at her without flinching youre right forrest said shielding his eyes with one hand thats twice as lovely as she was and only half as lovely as i could be if i cared to make the effort well come on faun i dont have all week come on where to humfreys castle of course where else did you think a dim bulb flickered youre mentias friend hmph an exaggeration but yes i am demoness sire and i did owe her half a favor so ill guide you there but thats all no round trip that would require a whole favor and im not going to make you deliriously happy enroute so forget about that too i wasnt even thinking of it she looked disappointed you werent this could be more mischief well i was trying to suppress the thought of it with imperfect success i am a faun you know were related to the satyrs we have similar urges but more self control she considered suppose i looked like this she became somewhat more luscious please dont because then i would be thinking of it all the time suppose i became like this the scant clothing on her form shrank causing parts of her to bulge dangerously then i would be so overwhelmed id be constantly grabbing for you just like a satyr unable to help myself she nodded satisfied and sagged into a lesser form he was learning how to handle demonesses but first i must see to the trees he added then im all yoursor would be if i werent struggling not to think of it d sire looked even more satisfied she drifted beside him as he wended his way back to his home glade is it true that nymphs fauns have very little magic apart from their longevity emptyheadedness and insatiable urge to pretend to summon fleets of storks flocks of storks he responded shortly flocks so it is true cutehorns not exactly the magic of nymphs is to become phenomenally attractive to males when they run and bounce so that any male who spies a running nymph is compelled to pursue her though he knows he cant catch her the magic of fauns is to run fast enough to catch the nymphs and to make them desire to celebrate when there is physical contact fascinating she said sounding bored does it work on other females why i hadnt thought of that i suppose if they removed their clothes and ran i mean the animal magnetism do real women get hot when a faun touches them well we dont chase real women they know too much and they arent as well shaped in addition they often regard fauns as misshapen and are repelled so theres no way of knowing so they tend to avoid contact but if it should happen what then she dropped to the ground and put her arms around him her upper section pressed into his chest in two firm places and her lower section pressed his fur in one firmer place is this sufficient contact then her eyes grew large and dreamy oh its true suddenly i want to get much closer to you the three places increased their pressures forrest struggled to disengage youre not a woman youre a demoness if i tried to celebrate with you you would just dissolve into laughing gas true she agreed dissolving into puffs of vapor that spelled out ha ha but nevertheless also true that your touch inspires a certain lust so i shall make sure not to tease you from too close thank you it had been all he could do to stop from trying what she had been teasing him to try unless i change my smoky mind she said reforming into something luscious he went to the two trees and tucked a disk into the lowest cleft of branches of each the trees did not seem to change but he trusted compassion they should be all right he fetched a spare pair of sandals just in case and put them in his knapsack now i am ready to o which way south he lives below the gap chasm the what dorit tell me you dont remember the forget spell wore off it years ago it isnt that i dont remember its that i never knew oh well its a huge cleft in the ground that is impossible to penetrate unless you know how she pursed her lips as she spoke the words cleft and penetrate as if suggesting something naughty forrest had no idea what nuance she was nuancing so he ignored it will you tell me how of course not thats more of a favor than i owe mentia he had thought as much still limited guidance was better than none maybe he would be able to ask along the way forrest stood at the brink of a monstrous abyss that was yawning despite the fullness of day so this was the dreaded gap chasm it was indeed impressive so how do you suppose you will get across this impassable abyss demoness sire inquired i suppose i will have to find a place to climb down into it cross the bottom and find a place to climb up the other side we fauns are good climbers because of our hoofs ixnay faun the gap dragon ranges the depths eagerly waiting for idiots like you to try just that hes a six legged steamer and chomps first and asks questions later well maybe i can find a bridge across it there must be one somewhere several ones invisible another is one way one way whichever way youre going its going the other way forrest had encountered a one way path in his day so he knew how that worked well ill keep looking there must be some way that folk cross it there is and you wont tell me that would be a smidgen over my half favor so he walked west along the brink after an indefinite time he heard a scrambling in the brush he turned toward it holding his sandalwood staff protectively before him it would kick anything that turned out to be dangerous giving him time to run to safety in two and a half moments he spied an odd animal caught in briers it looked like a male werewolf but couldnt be because that would have changed to human form to pick away the prickly vines as it was the poor creature could hardly move and more beiers were reaching for it they would soon coil completely around and prick it to death so they could feed on its blood forrest didnt like briers much so he decided to help the animal could you use some assistance he called the notwerewolf looked at him arf forrest wasnt sharp on animal languages but he had a nodding acquaintance that sounded like canine for yes so he used his staff to clear a path through the briers they whipped around striking at it trying to stab it but couldnt hurt the wood the staff gave them increasingly hefty kicks in return until they gave up he reached the animal and carefully pried the briers from its body soon it was free now follow me out and stay close to my staff he said the animal nodded when they were safely out of the brier patch forrest turned to the animal if you dont mind my asking who are you and what kind of a creature are you you seem like only half of a werewolf woof the animal replied so your name is woof oh come on youll never get it that way sire said appearing beside them you are wasting my time forrest hardly spared her a dark glance you could save your time by telling me how to cross the gap chasm expediently she ignored that his name is woofer hes a mundane dog forrest was amazed a mundane creature i thought they were extinct no such luck theres more than a slew of them north of xanth she faded out in disgust forrest looked again at the dog well woofer ive never met a real dog before so youre mundane i suppose that means you are of limited intelurn that you dont care to talk much so ill phrase yesno questions one bark for yes two for no okay woof are you friendly woof do you have friends woof are you lost woof can you find your way back to them on your own woof woof then i had better help you find them im not making much progress on my own anyway disgusting sire said somewhere in air ill never get through this chore you know what you can do about it demoness that would be unethical half a favor is half a favor not half a whit more where did you last see your friends forrest asked woofer the dog bounded to the brink of the chasm and pointed upward with its nose over the pit can they fly woof and you couldnt keep up with them running on the ground or maybe you could until you got into that brier patch and they didnt realize you were caught so dont know where you are woof but maybe when they realize that youre gone theyll fly back the way they came and find you woof woofer agreed brightening so lets wait here until they come then youll be all right xanth isnt very friendly to a mundane creature alone woof so they waited by the brink gazing out watching for flying creatures while d sire faded in and out her disgust expanding to its farthest boundaries forrest took some balm from his knapsack and spread it on woofers scratches and punctures and they started healing then forrests sharp eyes spied two things in the air they might be birds but they didnt fly like birds maybe thats them he suggested woof woofer wagged his tail so forrest waved violently to attract their attention the shapes veered toward him soon they showed up as two humanoid figures a young man and a young elfin woman she had wings while he flew without wings evidently they were a couple woofer bounded across to meet them as they landed on the brink the young man hugged him and the young woman kissed his nose then they turned to forrest hello he said feeling abruptly awkward woof woofer said returning to him you helped woofer the man asked he was caught in the brier patch woof but those scratch something awful the woman said hes unscratched woof woof i used some balm forrest said then still feeling awkward im glad hes safe now ill be on my way woof woof but you are safe now arent you forrest said to him these are your friends i think he means that you helped him so he wants to help you back the man said lets introduce ourselves im sean mundane im willow elf the woman said im forrest faun and so you wont have to wonder i really am mundane sean said i visited xanth and fell in love with willow wewell we ran afoul of a love spring without realizing it at first shes large for an elf and flies because she associates with a very large winged elm tree i returned to mundania with her and she found it a really weird place then wtien we came back to xanth suddenly i could fly we dont know what happened but its great now were just enjoying it we hope to marry soon forrest realized that they were as curious about him as he was about them im an ordinary tree faun my neighboring tree lost its faun so i am in search of a replacement faun for it so it wont die or become he hesitated mundane sean said no affront i know how awful that seems to xanthians of course you dont want that to happen so im going to ask the good magician for advice forrest continued though i understand that he charges a years service for an answer and i have to be back with my tree in a month and i cant even find my way across this crevasse so im not sure exactly what im doing sean and willow exchanged a significant glance then she spoke you helped woofer and we appreciate that so maybe we can do you a return favor i dont know how to solve your dilemma but i think i know who might be able to help ill call her she lifted a whistle she wore around her neck and blew on it in barely a moment there was a crashing in the brush as something huge charged through it a dragon forrest exclaimed you had better fly out over the gulf a dragon ass she corrected him friendly indeed now he saw that the dragon was striped and had the head of a donkey it was forging through the brier patch not even noticing the briers and on it was a young woman half a shade lovelier than d sire in her seduction mode disgusting the demoness agreed forming beside him the dragon ass came to a stop before them we heard your whistle the beautiful woman said to willow how may we help this nice faun helped get woofer out of trouble willow explained wed like to help him in return the woman turned her graceful gaze on forrest i am chlorine my talent is poisoning water this is my friend nimby whom i love more than anything in xanth and to whom i owe everything his talent is making the two of us anything we want to be we travel around looking for good deeds to do who are you and why are you worthy of a favor i am forrest faun and im not worthy of any favor chlorine glanced at willow thats not true the winged elf girl said hes trying to find a replacement faun for a tree that will fade or die otherwise he needs to get across the gap chasm so he can go ask the good magicians advice and he doesnt have time to serve a year there because the tree will last only a month the womans gaze returned to forrest i gather youre not the smartest faun in xanth but you mean well that summed it up nicely yes so well help you she decided wont we nimby she leaned forward to hug the dragons neck they seemed to be the perfect combination a beauty and a beast nimby nodded yes i love you chlorine said kissing his neck you gave me back my tear and so much more forrest gathered that there was more to that relationship than showed on the surface why should such a lovely woman care so much about such an ugly dragon but that was the same kind of a question others asked about uns and nymphs with trees why did they bind themselves to such unresponsive plantst there was no point tryin to explain the wonders of the relationships to those who lucked any basis for understanding maybe nby protected chlorine from other dragons though he did not look very formidable maybe he just had a nice personality or maybe it was that great beauty was attracted to great ugliness chlorine straightened up and looked at forrest again get on behind me she said well take you across the gap forrest looked at the daunting vast void but how she smiled and the local scenery brightened youll see so forrest walked to the side of the dragon and scrambled up on its back but his perch seemed insecure the dragons small wings were right behind him and chlorines remarkably contoured backside was before him put your arms around me chlorine said and hold on tight but she reached back and caught his hands drawing them forward until his hands touched across her small waist he clasped his fingers together his face was almost in her flowing hair which smelled of new mown hay the dragon strode forward directly toward the brink his head dropped down into the chasm disappearing from view then the main body crossed the edge turning at right angles they were going down into the gap the sky seemed to whirl as they changed orientation terrified forrest clung tightly to chlorine expecting to plummet into the awful depths of the chasm but it didnt happen he found himself jammed tight against chlorines shapely back his thighs against her hips his face buried in her fragrant hairand they werent falling instead they were moving down the vertical wall as if it were level chlorines hair wasnt even out of place bye sean said waving he was floating beside them but angled differently because to him down was still down it was nice meeting you willow said she was flying similarly her wings beating with a gentle cadence forrest felt the wind from them and knew it was going down but it was like a level breeze to him he was anchored to the wall and it had become his ground the experience was weird but not unpleasant you can relax a little chlorine said oh he loosened the near death grip he had on her body it really wasnt necessary sean and willow waved again then flew away there was a woof as woofer followed them running along the land beyond the chasm thank you forrest called to them remembering his manners and you he added to the woman and dragon its just what we do chlorine replied nimby and i have such good fortune that we try to share some of it with others when the others are deserving but im just trying to help a neighboring tree thats not anything special its something generous and nice she said the fact that you dont regard it as worthy of comment suggests that you are decent and modest thats the type of person we like to help he was getting quite curious about her and the dragon if i may ask whats with the damsel and dragon ass she finished for him m just a somewhat dull plain indifferent girl with not much of a talent but nimby makes me beautiful and smart and healthy and nice and now we live in the nameless castle where a full staff of servants takes care of our every whim once a month we go out around xanth looking for good deeds to do in this minor way sharing out happiness with others the dragon lives in a castle she laughed causing his linked hands on her soft but firm belly to shake oh nimby changes to handsome princely man form for that because he wouldnt fit very well in some of the passages in dragon form and while i love him in any form when it comes to sharing my bed i prefer him as a man more cuddly you know she thought the dragon could become a man that had to be delusion because everyone knew that each creature had only one magic talent and nimbys was walking along vertical walls as if they were horizontal so she must have a fond imagination her notions about her own body and personality were the opposite she credited the drigo with naking her beautiful when it was plain that she was stunningly lovely on her own still she and the dragon were doing him a favor so it would be best not to disparage her notions thats he said nice you dont believe me do you i didnt say that you didnt have to but you dont i mean no offense but yes i dont quite believe you thats good i dont want to be believed can you believe that nimby and i are married and that we spent a month on the far side of the moon reveling in honey i do find that similarly hard to believe wonderful i could probably tell you anything and you wouldnt believe it so i can be completely candid well i wouldnt say that if i told you who nimby really is you truly wouldnt believe me so i wont bother maybe that was just as well the farther they rode the less sense chlorine was making as they continued down d sire reappeared i trust you are having fun she inquired glancing significantly at his hands yes this is a remarkable experience forrest agreed i have never seen such a chasm before i meant hanging on to miss water poison who looks good enough to drink chlorine glanced at her havent you got some better errand elsewhere demoness sire smirked no i then she looked surprised as a matter of fact i do she faded out they reached the bottom of the gulf for the dragons big feet made for swift progress they turned the corner and walked across the level bottom forrest looked up and saw the rim of the chasm impossibly far above and a couple of gnat sized specks that might be sean and willow then he remembered something isnt there supposed to be a gap dragon down here that eats anyone who get caught hes not in this section at the moment chlorine said did you want to meet him no i want to avoid him his name is stanley steamer and he eats only folk he doesnt know i could introduce you thanks all the same id rather not he has a really cute son named steven steamer all the girls swoon over that baby dragon im not a girl she laughed again very well no introduction but if you should ever meet him just say that nimby sent you and he wont eat you ohyou mean dragons dont eat the friends of dragons something like that the winged monsters especially are very honorable they protect their own and the friends of their own but dont abuse the privilege they have to make their living you know by eating most folk they encountered i wont abuse it forrest promised so was this more fantasy on her part or was it valid he hoped he never had occasion to find out they reached the far wall of the chasm which wasnt far off because the gulf was narrower at the base than at the top forrest knew that if he cared to ponder hard on that he might conclude that this meant that the walls werent quite vertical but that intensity of thought wasnt worth the effort so he didnt reach that conclusion the trip up was like the trip down only now forward was toward the distant sky the dragon seemed to have no trouble walking on the wall and forrest did not feel any great pull of gravity holding him back just the supple form of chlorines body as he kept his handslinked you must be hungry she said after a bit have a dough nut theyre very filling she made a quarter turn and put a big spongy nut to his mouth so he could take it without letting go of her he opened his mouth and took it it tasted very good rather like fresh pie crust and was surprisingly filling thank you you are welcome forrest looked ahead and saw a dark cloud approaching that looks like fracto the worst of clouds he said i hope he doesnt decide to wet on us he wouldnt dare chlorine said however the cloud came floating toward them growing bigger and uglier by the moment until chlorine tapped nimby on a scale mischief at two oclock she murmured the dragon lifted his head and glanced at the cloud the cloud blanched and then changed course scudding swiftly away forrest blinked surely he hadnt seen that how could one glance from a comically stupid looking dragon dissuade as mean a cloud as fracto it must be an illusion maybe the womans craziness was spreading to him they reached the top and bent around it things were on the level again the dragon stopped this is as far as well take you chlorine said there is a magic path right ahead follow that and it will lead you safely to the good magicians castle thank you forrest said sliding down to the ground and dont be concerned about the years service she told him humfrey wont require it of you so you will be back with your tree in time i will he asked astonished yes and i think happier than you have ever been she shrugged but of course i dont know the future so i could be wrong she seemed so reasonable in her madness thank you he repeated thank you for everything she smiled lighting up the local scenery again and waved as nimby started off into the jungle he didnt seem to need a path forrest turned and followed the magic path in a moment he thought of something else and turned back a moment wasnt long so he had plenty of time to catch them and ask his question but when he returned to the brink of the gap chasm there was no sign of damsel or dragon he followed nimbys tracks to the jungles edgeand there they stopped it was as if the creature had simply vanished without walking farther could he have flown no there was nothing in the sky they were simply gone that was one curious pair of creatures how could he query a vanishing donkeyheaded dragon oh well he had forgotten his question anyway yes they are really gone d sire said fading in what happened to you i had a sudden urge to busy myself elsewhere it didnt fade until you got free of miss poison so i never got to see whether any bumps in the terrain caused your hands to bump up to her bumps yet another evidence of the odd womans power she had banished a demoness well i no longer need your guidance so you can continue your business elsewhere she shook her finger at him and the shaking progressed down her arm and through her body nuhuh faun i have half a favor to complete you have done so i am now on a magic path leading straight to the good magicians castle she nodded and the nodding spread down too so you are but there is a further complication i dont want to hear it good the good magician always has three preposterous challenges preventing a querent from entering his castle preventing a what a querent a person who comes to make a query thats you so how do i handle those challenges sorry that information is beyond my obligation he looked at her annoyed then he realized that that was what she wanted thank you i appreciate the information now i am better prepared to handle the challenges curses she muttered foiled again she faded out he ran along the path making excellent time by some process he did not understand it seemed to be earlier in the day than it had been when he first reached the gap chasm so that he wouldnt need to spend a night halfway there he wasnt hungry the dough nut seemed to have fed him for a long time indeed in the afternoon he reached the good magicians castle this was an appealing edifice for those who night like that type with red brick walls green tiled roofs and a bright blue moat in the moat was a peculiar monster it had the top of a man and the body of a winged serpent and it was huge there was a drawbridge and the bridge was in the lowered position crossing the moat somewhat hesitantly forrest approached the bridge youll be sorry d sire murmured behind him then go away before you enjoy it too much he said shortly lengthening his stride immediately the moat monster swam toward the bridge come into my grasp faun face he said i havent eaten in days forrest stopped the human portion looked fully strong enough to grab him and dispatch him and the serpent portion looked capable of digesting him there was no way he could avoid those arms on the narrow bridge so this must be a challenge he looked around but the moat seemed to circle the entire castle he couldnt try to swim because the monster would catch him that much easier how was he going to get past a nonchalant man of indifferent persuasion came walking around the moat do i perceive a problem he inquired i am trying to cross the moat without getting grabbed and gobbled by the monster now that is a very interesting statement why do you wish to do that because i need to talk to the good magician indubitably why do you wish to talk with him i need an answer to a problem the man nodded has it occurred to you that you may be misdirecting your energies you cant change the circumstance but you can change yourself maybe you can solve your problem yourself just by developing a better attitude forrest glanced at him who are you i am the castle psychologist it is my business to talk to querents and try to enable them to solve their problems the old fashioned way by themselves if i could solve it myself i wouldnt be coming here forrest said shortly now are you sure of that perhaps all you need is an adjustment of attitude forrests mood had not been great when he arrived at the castle and it was deteriorating i think all i need is a way across that moat why do you feel that way forrests ire was approaching the blowoff point if youre not going to help i wish youd go away so i can concentrate i think we need to get at the root of your hostility did you have bad parenting as a child i never had parents forrest snapped im a faun we all get delivered to the faun nymph retreat where we stay until we go do you want to talk about it i no i the psychologist shook his head im afraid we have a difficult case here this may require many fifty minute sessions why dont you make yourself comfortable and we shall proceed a bulb flashed over forrests head youre part of the problem he said youre another challenge by no means i am a solution but you have to be amenable to it now i can help you but you have to really want to change i dont want to change i want to get across that moat this hostility is doing you no good i wont be able to help you if you dont develop a better attitude forrest considered if what the man said was correct he was a solution rather than a problem but how could he help when he just kept trying to distract forrest or to make him give up his quest forrest forced a moderate expression to his face exactly how do you help people i encourage them to talk about their feelings in this manner explating them in the colloquial sense i am called a shrink one who shrinks the head making it intelligible and less burdensome a shrink suddenly forrest saw a possible way you know i have problems but as you say they are complicated and will take a long time to shrink on the other hand i suspect that the problems of that moat monster are simpler and can be shrunk in much less time why dont you help him first so that there wont be a backlog why that is an appealing idea the psychologist agreed he turned to the merdragon say therelets talk what for the monster asked i can see that you are troubled i wish to alleviate your concerns and enable you to feel good about yourself of course im troubled the monster said im a monster have you any idea how dull it gets being confined to a circular moat yes i can appreciate that but you cant change the moat you can only change yourself perhaps if you developed a better attitude about it you would feel less troubled i would the monster was interested forrest sat back and watched while the two talked and as they did the monster gradually shrank in size the shrink was doing his job you cunning knave sire murmured behind him you figured it out well i didnt want to get shrunk myself he agreed satisfied so i thought id get the monster shrunk instead when the monster was too small to reach the bridge forrest walked across to the castle he was feeling halfway satisfied when he arrived at the inner shore he discovered a set of metal tracks beyond them was a blank wall the tracks and wall continued to either side with no room around them they marked the only level ground outside the castle so he picked a direction at random and started walking between the tracks something swirled before him i wouldnt do that if i were you it said fortunately im not you are you still here d sire he inquired irritably i have not yet quite fulfilled my half favor she said taking luscious shape he had to stop walking lest he collide with her form and get pressed in three places again why wouldnt you walk here if you had the awful misfortune to be me because the locomotive is coming and theres no way to avoid it locomotive this was a new word to him what is that a great huge enormous giant crazy machine that thunders along these tracks squashing anything in its path ohlike a big dragon no more like a train of thought he looked at her you can be pretty irritating its the flip side of my nature those who are most capable of driving a man wild with longing also are capable of annoying him beyond endurance i suppose i could demonstrate her clothing began to fuzz forrest closed his eyes to avoid being freaked out by the sight of her underclothing he knew she had no intention of playing nymph faun with him she just wanted to drive him mad with desire that was how demonesses entertained themselves tormenting ordinary folk so what would you do in my place i would get quickly back to the landing area very quickly forrest heard an ominous rumbling the tracks were shaking and giving out sounds of incipient power he turned opened his eyes and saw a bright light in the center of a black blob coming toward him he ran back toward the bridge as fast as he could the blob expanded into a frighteningly large black onrushing machine jets of white steam sprouted from it and big puffs of roiling smoke poured from a chimney at its top a piercing whistle came from it forrest dived for the bridge he rolled and got his hoofs out of the way just as the monster engine thundered across as sire had predicted he would have been squished flat if she had not warned him thank you demoness he said you saved me from an uncomfortable experience she appeared above him her skirt threatening to show too much of her legs well it would have been a waste to have you squished into oblivion when i was only one and a half challenges away from completing my half favor to be sure he agreed he forced his eyes away from her knees or wherever and climbed back to his feet now what would you do if you were in my place i would board that train before it gets moving again he realized that once it had missed him the locomotive had puffed to a stop not far along the tracks behind it were hitched several cars and the door to one was open right before him it had many windows in a row somewhat above the level of his head so he put a hand on a rail and stepped up the steps into the end of the long car the whistle blew again and the crazy engine puffed and resumed motion struggling to haul the cars along behind it the steps folded up behind forrest sealing him in he was on his way somewhere of course i am not in your place sire murmured invisibly in his ear mentia might be able to handle this situation but i doubt i could what do you mean but she had faded out he was on his own again there was only one way to go on into the main portion of the coach it was lined with plush seats all of which were filled with unmoving human figures they looked like statues for their eyes never blinked that made him nervous he walked along the center aisle until he found one seat that was empty the coach was shaking and its floor was heaving as it got up speed so it was hard for him to keep his feet so he sat in that one free seat he heard a sound beside him it was a young human woman sobbing into a hankie forrest had no good notion how to deal with human women as he had not encountered many his sandalwood tree was in a part of the forest where humans seldom wandered but it bothered him to be so close to someone this unhappy since there was no other place to sit he decided that he would have to try to deal with whatever was bothering the woman hello he said i am forrest faun is there something i can do for you she turned her head and looked at him with her tearrimmed reddened eyes eeeeek she screamed this set him back slightly eeeeek a satyr as if i didnt have trouble enough already oh im not a satyr forrest said firmly i am a faun we are a related but less aggressive species we chase after only willing nymphs her eyes began to clear and her sniffles to snuffle out you dont pursue innocent maidens definitely not well all right then i am dot human and my talent is making spots on the wall im sorry i sorry that you dont have a decent magic talent of course i dont have a talent at all being only part human he didnt count his natural faun traits as a talent i have a decent talent but you said ill show you she focused on the back of the seat before her a picture formed on it forrest stared but thats not a spot its a picture its lots of little spots dots all different colors and intensities so taken together they make up the picture he looked closely and saw that it was true the picture was composed of a multitude of tiny dots so closely set that the moment he blinked they fuzzed back into the picture but thats a good talent i thought you meant spotonthewall as a euphemism for having a worthless talent no its a good talent but its not doing me any good why not because im stuck here behind the locomotive going crazy crazy thats what it does to you didnt you see all those other folk on this coach they look like dummies thats because they have gone completely loco theres no hope for them theyve crashed but im not completely loco yet so theres hope for me thats why im crying her eyes began to brim again i dont understand by the time you understand its probably too late the eifect builds gradually each lap the locomotive makes around the castle makes it worse youre still fresh youre hardly crazy at all and i guess being close to you makes me less crazy for a while until we both are overwhelmed forrest was starting to catch on the longer we stay here the crazier we become because of the locomotive yes i was pretty far gone until you came in but it wont last then we must get off the train before it gets us we cant get off why do you think i was crying i wasnt sure but i hoped to help why cant we get off because it wont stop the windows wont open the doors wont open and even if they did look how fast its going he looked out the window and saw the wall rushing by at blinding velocity he looked across the aisle to the far windows and saw the moat passing just as swiftly but it stopped for me it stops to let folk on not to let them off why didnt you get off when it stopped for me i couldnt the seat belt held me what seat belt forrest saw nothing of that kind the automatic seat belt it clasps you only when the train is stopping so if someone else wants to get on ill be belted too yes it belts everyone so no one will get hurt but thats crazy precisely well well have to get out of our seats while its moving then stop it i tried that the coach is locked up no way out of it the locomotive wont stop unless everyone is secured a bulb lighted the challenge its to make the train stop i guess so dot agreed but i have no idea how and if i dont figure it out pretty quick ill go crazy and become another crash dummy thats true forrest pondered he was starting to feel a bit unbalanced already and he could only have been around the berid once or twice but there had to be a way to get oft the train he just had to figure it out soon he saw no way offhand the limited scenery zoomed by unabated even if he could manage to open a window or door it wouldnt be safe to jump out he had to get the train to actually stop without fastening him down with a seat belt that seemed impossible but there did have to be a way that was in the big book of rules or whatever he hoped so what was he overlooking there hadnt seemed to be much way to cross the moat either but he had managed to use the psychologist to change things so that it became possible too bad there wasnt another psychologist to shrink the locomotive until it couldnt pull them along so fast then another bulb started to light but he managed to suppress it before the woman saw it there was another person and she was it she must be the key to escape she wasnt a fellow trapee she was part of the challenge but her talent was merely spots on a wall very good spots but how could spots stop a train unless dot can you make a picture outside the train well if theres a surface close enough can you make a picture of a door through that wall i suppose but the wall is moving it would carry away my dots no were moving the wall is still oh i suppose thats right she focused on the wall and in a moment a picture formed it was a door it seemed to be right opposite their window unmoving very good forrest said now can you make that door open the door slowly opened revealing a nice garden beyond now can you make a similar door in our window and open it the dots quickly formed a door and it opened now all we have to do is go through those two doors and well be there he said with satisfaction it wont work dot said sadly but he tried it anyway he reached across her and put one hand through the nearer open door and banged his knuckle ooooh he brought his hand back the windows still there dot explained so is the brick wall so is the motion all i do is pictures not changes it just looks different the pictures faded out forrest sighed the doors were illusion the window and wall were reality he should have known it had been a rather crazy idea crazy that figured he sat back and pondered some more he didnt want any more deas he wanted something that worked what could he come crazy i i up with before his mind lost its common sense he still thought it related to dot and her talent how could her talent stop the train not with illusion but reality what he really needed was information like a manual of instructions to know how to stop the train but of course that was another crazy notion because mere pictures couldnt provide that or could they maybe it was worth a try dot just how detailed can your pictures be infinitely detailed she said proudly i can make dots so small they cant even be seen individually then lets make a special picture of a manual on the cover it says iocomotive operating instructions can you do that sure but that doesnt require much detail the picture appeared in the window a book with the required words very good now can you open it the cover turned in much the manner of another door opening revealing the title page inside show the contents page another page turned and contents showed forrest leaned across to read it near the bottom of the page was a listing for chapter stopping turn to page fifty he said reading the indicated page number the pages flipped across stopping at but the print was too small to read can you make the page larger the image expanded until it filled the whole window and the print was legible forrest read it avidly to stop locomotive in its tracks pull the cord above the seat he looked up there was the cord that he hadnt noticed before he reached up and pulled it there was a squeal as the train hurtled to a stop seat belts jumped out to clasp the two of them as well as all the dummies in the rest of the coach oopshe had forgotten that detail you did it dot cried you stopped the train can you show the contents page again the pages turned back he found the chapter for seat belts and turned to that page to release seat belt push button thereon sure enough there was a button he pushed it and the belt unclasped him and disappeared on either side dot did the same you figured it out she said pleased lets get off this crazy train before it starts again he said standing but she shook her head thanks no this is your challenge not mine my job is on this train of thought he had suspected as much thanks for your help anyway it was a pleasure youre a nice person he walked along the aisle to the end of the coach where the door had folded down into steps he stepped down and off as soon as he did the steps folded up again sealing the train and it started moving again well i guess you got through that one d sire said fading into view you can go any time demoness he waited while the train rolled out of the way beyond the tracks was an open door in the wall just like the one dot had pictured he crossed the tracks and put out a cautious hand just in case the doorway wasnt real his hand didnt bang he stepped through he had won the second challenge suddenly he was horribly frightened he reeled staggering back through the door his fear abated what had happened he hadnt seen any monster or hurtling comotive or anything why had he been so suddenly and awfully afraid i think you have a problem faun sire faded out satisfied he stepped forward againand was blasted by the fear he reeled back again out the doorway it was this place he was afraid to enter it but he had to enter it because it was the only entrance to the castle he had found he stepped close to the entrance stopping just short of the fear and peered in there was a small man or maybe an elf or maybe in between whats this he asked isnt it obvious i am la the lost angel i am here to help you enter the castle but first you must conquer your foolish fear so it was the third challenge all he had to do was nerve himself and go on through it seemed simple enough after all la didnt seem to be afraid so probably there was nothing to fear he tried again and was balked again there was nothing to fear except fear itself he couldnt enter that chamber he pondered the chamber itself must be imbued with fear so that anyone who entered it was terrified but then why wasnt the lost angel afraid too was there some secret way to nullify the fear no probably there was a special antifear spell on la so that he was immune it wouldnt make sense to have the folk helping the good magician be afraid to do their duties in each case before there had been a barrier or threat of some kind and a person of some type and the person had been the key to the solution could this be the case again he thought it would make more sense to have something entirely different but he wasnt the good magician and didnt know how the old man thought so maybe there was a pattern and the person would have the answer but not anything obvious what would a lost angel have to do with fear maybe angels were beyond fear so that was how he was able to be in that dread chamber but forrest was no angel so he needed something else still maybe he could talk to la and learn something as he had with the other two he looked in la was just sitting there completely at ease i gather that there is a way for me to eliminate my fear and that you know of it but wont tell me he said la nodded you seem reasonably smart for a faun not everyone considers me so forrest said i met a damsel and a dragon and i think the damsel liked me but thought i was a bit dull beauty is often in the eye of the beholder she was extremely beautiful so i must have been dull in contrast forrest considered how to proceed do you have a magic talent why yes i can change one kind of wood to another kind of wood unfortunately there is no wood here so i cant show you something nagged at forrests mind but he couldnt place it so he talked some more hoping to learn something useful you came to ask the good magician a question and he gave you his answer and now you are serving your yearss service for him exactly if it is not too personal what was your question its not personal at all it wasnt a question it was a request i asked that a significant village be named after me he told me that one already was but that it was in mundania i suppose thats better than nothing and for this you are glad to serve for a year it does seem inadequate but thats what i get for wanting something stupid i am learning a whole lot during this service and will depart here a much wiser creature if i had known how it would be i would have dispensed with the question and simply come for the service that surprised forrest is it the same with dot and the psychologist certainly and for the merdragon too and maybe for you if you manage to get through the damsel said he would not require a service of me now la was surprised i find that hard to believe he always requires a service its his way of discouraging folk who arent serious just as is this business of three challenges why should you be an exception i have no idea maybe its not true who was this damsel she called herself chlorine she said her talent was poisoning water she rode a funny looking dragon ah the dragon ass i have heard of him they are an odd couple well maybe they know what they are doing i have heard that good things tend to happen when they are around as if they somehow reverse the normal perversity of fate reverse perversity then for no reason forrest got a notion reverse wood could that reverse the fright spell on the chamber of course he didnt have any reverse wood but if la cared to cooperate he could get some will you do me a favor he asked the lost angel within reason what do you want i would like you to change some wood for me id be glad to but i dont have any wood but i do forrest removed one of his sandals will you change this sandalwood to reverse wood la smiled you are a clever one very well bring it here forrest started to walk into the chamberand was immediately beaten back by utter fear oh nohe couldnt do what he wanted because of the thing he wanted to eliminate but then he found a way i will toss it to you he threw the sandal la caught it and held it are you sure you want me to do this there may be consequences ill risk them change it to reverse wood very well done the sandal looked the same but when forrest tried to enter the room he had no trouble in fact he was drawn into it delighting in its ambiance not only did he feel no fear he felt absolutely fearless thank you he said to the lost angel that worked perfectly did it sure my fear is gone im having absolutely no trouble with this chamber in fact i could stay here forever thats nice but la seemed oddly subdued well i must move on into the castle proper but ill need my sandal please change it back to sandalwood now i cant do that but you changed it before why cant you do it again because the reverse wood reverses my talent now i cant change anything forrest paused the angel had warned him that there might be consequences he hadnt paid enough attention maybe i can use it anyway he said let me put it on are you sure you want to do that i dont have any magical talent im a faun so it cant reverse it if i take it away from you your own talent should revert to normal so youll be okay and who knowsmaybe ill find some future use for reverse wood so yes this seems the best way la gave him the sandal and he put it on but he felt suddenly quite odd his hair seemed longer than usual and his body felt different his feet felt oddest of all what was the matter he looked down and saw his legs and feet he stared they were human they had five toes and were fleshy with solid heels then he traced the lines of his legs upward they were human with far more flesh than his goat legs ever had had and got really fleshy near the tops and above thatoh my he breathed appalled im a nymph it seems that the reverse wood reversed your nature la said you are now a fine looking female but i dont want to be a nymph he protested then take off the sandal that made sense he tore off the sandal threw it across the room and felt his body reverting to normal he was himself again i guess ill have to do without the sandal he said ill use my spare pair he removed the other sandal put it in his knapsack drew out the other pair and put them on you may still have a problem la remarked not if i stay well clear of that reverse wood ill just step on into the main castle leaving it behind he paused unless it makes things too difficult for you have no concern about me im here for the duration regardless my job is here im a prisoner of this chamber your visit has helped relieve the boredom okay then i guess its farewell and thank you forrest walked to the doorway into the rest of the castle but as he passed through it sudden terror gripped him he reeled back into the chamber and the fear faded then he realized what had happened the spell is reversed now the chamber is fine but iln afraid to leave it i know the feeling la said but how can i see the good magician if i cant leave the room and you cant change the reverse wood it is a question a question he had to answer for himself so he walked around the chamber pondering hard what stuck again d sire inquired mockingly from the doorway leading out to the tracks and moat he had had enough he ran to the reverse wood sandal picked it up and hurled it at her in the course of that action he felt himself changing and changing back the wood passed right through her oooh that smarts she cried flapping her hands to bow the smoke away from a sandalshaped hole in her midsection the sandal splashed into the water of the noat beyond her the water shuddered and turned to fire there was a scream of outrage from the moat monster who must have had to scramble to land a little reverse wood in the wrong place could be a lot of mischief but forrests problem had been solved the chamber was now normal and so were his emotions thanks for your help demoness he called out one doorway then walked out the other into the main castle a young woman greeted him in the ball hello forrest faun she said i am wira the good magicians adaughterinlaw he is ready to see you now just like that he was surprised to have such ready acceptance after the complications of the challenges he has been most interested in your progress this way please magician hunifrey had been following his case the challenges had seemed designed to confuse or discourage him forrest followed the woman through dull passages and up a dark stairway he wondered how she could be so surefooted in such poor lighting soon they were at a study so gloomy that dingy would be inadequate to describe it within it a gnome sat hunched over a huge tome forrest faun is here good magician wira said the gnome looked up thank you dear it was probably illusion but there almost seemed to be a nuance of affection when he spoke to her send him in wira turned to forrest go on in she said there was something odd about her gaze which did not quite meet his own then he realized what it was she was blind that was why she was indifferent to darkness embarrassed for no reason he could settle on he walked on into the magicians crowded study my question is yes yes of course the magician said impatiently imbri will be here in a moment but how can you answer if you dont hear my question i am not going to answer because i wont charge you a service now stop wasting my time forrest experienced an unusual emotion after half a pause he recognized it anger you mean i took all this trouble to come here and to brave your challenges for nothing not for nothing for the solution to your problem that requires neither question nor answer the mare will clarify it in due course but how can i get a solution without he stopped because he saw that humfrey was paying him no further attention the grumpy old magician was lost in his tome wira reappeared come on downstairs it will be all right it always is this isnt what i expected it seldom is so he followed her back through the dusky passages hello fat are you the one i am to guide forrest looked around startled no one was there you a il see me the voice said i am mire imbri the day male i c n speak to you only in daydreams in my dreams he asked surprised wira turned oh shes arrived good sit down here and talk with her i will return when you need me distracted forrest entered the room the woman indicated and sat in a comfortable chair i was once a night mare but i lost my body and became a day mare i am invisible would it help if you could see me yes then close your eyes and make your mind blank forrest did as asked bemused in a moment a horse appeared in his mind a black mare with white socks on her hind legs or perhaps if i assumed girl her voice said the horse twisted and changed becoming a pretty young human woman is this better she asked i can hear you he exclaimed that is i could before but now it seems more like speech yes it is easier to imagine a human form speaking it is your own mind doing it i merely send the thoughts this is a day dreamlet you dont need to speak aloud either i can hear you if you just imagine yourself speaking i can use speech balloons if you prefer speech balloons he said aloud then caught himself and resolved to speak silently next time a cloud appeared above the young womans head with part of it pointing down at the woman image in this manner the words in the balloon wrote regular speech will do he said then caught himself again and added without moving his lips but tell me what is this about guiding me the dreamlet girl frowned prettily i must perform a service for the good magician that service is to guide you to ptero and safely through it i dont know where tero is ptero she said spelling it in a speech balloon wherever in fact i dont know anything about this i came to ask the good magician a question myself but he wouldnt even listen to it i have gone to all this trouble to try to help a tree and he wont even listen the ways of the good magician are often inscrutable to ordinary folk she said tell me more of your situation so he told her the whole story she was a very good listener even making dreamlet scenes to illustrate what he described that way he knew she understood because he could see the details and make corrections when they erred so here i am he concluded ready to ask the good magician how to find a companion spirit for the clog tree and i guess hes mad because for some reason he cant use me for a years service so he wont talk to me at all imbri shook her head humfrey is old and grumpy but he doesnt waste energy on anger he always has some obscure reason for what he does we simply have to figure it out obviously he has something in mind for you because he informed me that my service is to help you we just have to understand what you are doing what i want to do is find a spirit for the clog tree so it wont fade i have to do it within a month i dont know anything about this ptero place why should i go there she considered as it happens i am one of the very few folk in xanth who do know something about ptero not a lot nobody knows a lot about it but some because on occasion i have delivered daydreams there its a very strange place that explains why you are supposed to be the guide but what about me all i can think of is that the spirit you are looking for is there there are people there she laughed and little ha has went out from her image when the demoness had made such laughter it had been derisive imbris laughter was friendly there are more folk there than anyone can count forrest found this confusing how can there be more any person who exists can be counted thats the thing not all of them exist now im really confused how can there be people who dont exist its hard to explain ptero is where all the folk who ever lived in xanth stay and all the folk who ever will live in xanth and all the folk who ever might live in xanth so there are a lot of folk there but whats really strange is the way they live theydo you know anything about quantum mechanics huh i guess not its a concept i picked up from the mind of a former mundane scientist his dreams were really weird i think ptero is a quantum world that is nothing is certain there everything exists in all its possible states at once its only when the folk there visit regular xanth that things start making some sort of sense for a while forrest shook his head i dont want to go there i just want to find a faun for the tree but maybe that faun is there a glimmer began to form a faun for the clog tree since all the folk who ever might exist in xanth are on ptero your faun could be there then you could bring him to the tree the glimmer expanded i think i am beginning to make some dim sense of the good magicians attitude i dont need his answer i just need to go to ptero and fetch that faun myself that must be it she agreed and i must guide you there and through ptero too as well as i am able can you get me through it and back home within a month i can do whatever you wish but you must decide how long your search is i dont know how long it will take to find him i have delivered daydreams there but i dont know the actual landscape i may not be much help though i will try my best forrest nodded im sure you will help a lot at least i wont be blundering there alone then he thought of something else this is your service what was your question to the good magician she smiled wistfully i was foaled as a night mare in and became a day mare in i wasnt the best night mare i was too tender hearted it has been better as a day mare because at least i bring pleasure to dreamers instead of horror but im still not quite satisfied now i would like to gallop in some other pasture the good magician will find me that pasture after i have completed my service forrest was impressed you are as old as i am you were foaled the very year i adopted a sandalwood seedling and became a responsible creature you were a night mare for a hundred and seventy years and a day mare for thirty years so you are two hundred years old yes i dont mean to complain but it does get dull after a while maybe im just a misfit well i hope the good magician has a good new pasture in mind for you im sure he does lets find your faun lets find my faun he agreed feeling better where is ptero at castle roogna this strange land with uncountable folk is at the human capital in its fashion oh you mean thats where the magic is to reach ptero that is where the access is humfrey will have to give you a spell to cross to ptero then i had better wake up and get that spell i dont want to waste any time i will be with you just clear a little place for me in your mind when you want to talk to me i will thanks he opened his eyes there was the cell the same as before but now it didnt seem so dingy wira in a moment he heard her light footsteps approaching have you finished talking with imbri yes for now i need the spell to here it is the good magician said to give it to you when you asked for it she held out a tiny stoppered bottle how do i use it imbri knows just keep it safe you may need it to depart ptero too ill keep it safe he agreed putting the spell into his knapsack would you like something to eat wira asked im sure the designated wife will be glad to fix you something before you go designated wife forrest decided not to inquire thank you no chlorine gave me a dough nut and i havent been hungry since they do stick to your ribs wira agreed then i will show you out she led him to the front gate this was now completely clear there was no wall and no set of tracks the drawbridge was down and the moat was calm with no sign of fire it was evident that the good magician could change his castle around at will thank you he told her i wish you good success wira replied with a rather pleasant smile that lacked any trace of the mischief of the demonesses then she looked embarrassed oh i almost forgot here is your lost sandal she held it out but that had become reverse wood how did you the good magician has ways it is a good sandal he thought you would need it not half as much as he needed a good answer but he stifled that remark thank you he said taking the sandal and putting it in his knapsack now he had a complete reserve pair again and this she said holding out a piece of paper he took it and looked at it but it had indecipherable scribblings i cant read this the good magician scribbled it in his very own handwriting she said as if that were a special thing im sure he had excellent reason keep it with you it may become useful when its time comes what could he do he thanked her and tucked the paper into his knapsack forrest set out for castle roogna it was not a difficult trek because he was on a magic path that was supposed to lead right to it the funny thing was that again it was morning though there had been no night so that he should be able to reach it by evening he wondered about that so he tried asking mare imbri he closed his eyes briefly as he walked making a place for her to appear are you there imbri he asked silently always as long as this service lasts she agreed appearing as the black haired woman now he saw that she rather resembled her mare form in a pleasant way with white socks on her feet and black gloves on her hands her dress was black too i have noticed that its always morning when i start walking though i am sure a couple of days should have passed since i left my tree is there some magic operating imbri considered share your recent memories with me maybe i can see what is happening one hoof tripped and he had to open his eyes he lost the image of her this was awkward walking with his eyes closed so he stopped firstis it possible to see you without closing my eyes her voice came in his head yes if you can concentrate reserve a space about five paces ahead of you and to the side or wherever you want so it doesnt interfere with your view of the path think of me being there he concentrated and after some effort managed to see a fuzzy region thats it imbri said just keep working on it as you walk and i will clarify he did and she did after a while he was even able to see her as a human sized person walking beside him can anyone else see you no only you its like seeing a ghost yes it just requires the right concentration now i will review my memories of the day he thought of his beginning of the trip to the gap chasm guided by the demoness sire then of the ride through the gap on the back of the dragon ass then of the walk to the good magicians castle you are right imbri said its always morning the first morning may have been the work of compassion because she likes you she just wanted to give you more time after you were nice enough to kiss her mouse so she reset your day otherwise it would have been afternoon then the second morning started when you got off the dragon ass thats a strange creature i have no entry into its i ch is funny because she used to be an ormind or ch orines whi dinary girl rather plain and ill tempered actually with dreams as foolish as anyones now suddenly she is phenomenally lovely and intelligent and nice and lives in the nameless castle with that dragon and her mind is completely opaque its as if shes a different person you mean chlorine really does live in that castle i thought she was just pretending she really does live there the castle sits on a cloud that floats across xanth so no one can see that it supports the castle she lives like a princess and that dragon assumes the form of a prince and what they do at night on those air mattresses that the floating castle has is beyond any dream i could bring do you mean like fauns and nymphs she made an equine snort like fauns and nymphs in much the way castle roogna is like a wood cutters hut im surprised that there hasnt been a flight of storks so big as to darken the sky they are surely in love i wish i had been watching when they changed im femalishly curious about what happened they must have stumbled on fantastic magic the oddest thing is that they dont make anything much of it that is they just trundle around xanth as a damsel and dragon doing favors for folk asking nothing in return it is very strange yes i thought so too but how could they have made my afternoon become morning that would require good illusion or very good magic maybe they have a sprig of thyme at any rate it does seem to have happened they gave you more day to do your business and more day again when you left the good magicians castle because the good magician would hardly bother to waste such magic so irrelevantly well whatever the reason i appreciate it it does help me save time so that maybe i can return to my tree within the month by evening they were approaching castle roogna forrest paused to brush out his hair and make himself presentable after all this was the royal human castle and it deserved some respect when he started walking toward it again imbri spoke this time i caught it its morning again startled forrest looked around she was right the sun was at midmorning level he also felt fresh and vigorous as if he had had a good nights rest this is nice magic this is very strong magic imbri said the rest of xanth doesnt seem to be changing just us we just seem to have more time without losing what we have done it is as if we werent supposed to notice the favor well if its from the damsel and dragon i will thank them when i see them again but now i need to find ptero i will guide you there go in and ask to see princess ida forrest approached the castle the moat monster reared up threatenngly this one i can take care of imbri said souffld its all right this is forrest faun and he is with me the monster nodded and sank back under the water i thought you said no one else could see you only those i know well and show myself to souffld has been around a long time he babysits the royal triplets a moat monster takes care of children there is no other place like castle roogna so it seemed they walked on into the castle two girls about six years old ran up to them colliding before they managed to stop they wore matching little crowns oh goody the red haired one cried visitors from afar a faun from north of the gap and a day mare the dark one added meet the children of prince dolph and princess electra imbri said princess dawn who can tell anything about any living thing so she knows about you and princess eve who can tell anything about any inanimate things so she knows about me but youre alive forrest protested no she isnt eve said shes a spirit she has half a soul but no body she lost that in the void in they really do know forrest said amazed ive never seen such magic thats because no magicians or sorceresses ever came to your sandalwood tree dawn said a woman in blue jeans hurried up girls behave she exclaimed the two little princesses immediately stood back and looked angelic im sorry the woman said theyre irrepressible i im princess electra their mother hes forrest faun here to see princess ida dawn said and shes mare linori who has to guide him through ptero oh you are here on business electra said girls tell the princess she has a visitor the two children dashed off uh thank you forrest said i didnt mean to make a commotion i dont know princess ida im supposed to go to the land of ptero electra looked blank go to the land of what ptero where all the mightbe folk stay but ptero s the princess paused well im not sure exactly what it is but its not a place you can go to but we have to go there because thats where ill find my faun electra still looked remarkably doubtful i think ill just have to let ida explain it i hope someone does imbri hasnt the princess nodded i can appreciate why come this way she turned and led them down the hall the twins came dashing back their red and black pigtails flying auntie ida says to go to the tapestry dawn cried brightly and shell meet them there eve finished darkly she says this could get comcom complicated electra finished im sure she changed course slightly and led them upstairs forrest was much impressed because this was only the second time he had used stairs and these were much broader than the ones at the good magicians castle soon they arrived at a pleasant chamber with a nice view of the outside moat and orchard a woman rose to greet them she was another princess because she wore a crown she looked to be about twenty eight but it was never possible to be quite certain with women there was something odd about her head princess ida this is forrest faun electra said mare imbri is with him as his guide and companion any friend of imbri is a friend of mine ida said graciously please have a seat and tell me your concern forrest took the indicated chair i need to find a faun to associate with the neighboring clog tree the good magician told me to look in ptero mare irnbri has been there so can show me the way imbri the princess said it wasnt exactly a question she was addressing the day mare her eyes went halfway blank and she seemed to be listening after a moment she smiled imbri must have given her an explanatory daydream ah i see thats interesting so if you can just tell me where ida raised a hand in gentle negation i will but there are things you must first understand consider the tapestry he looked where she indicated and saw a large tapestry hanging on the wall it was filled with intricately sewn pictures of xanthly scenes they were so realistic that they almost seemed to be moving in fact they were moving this is magic he said it shows all the scenes of xanth she explained in all times or xanth up to the present here is your glade the scenes changed and one part expanded to fill the whole tap estry it was a picture of his own neighborhood there was his sadalwood tree and the nearby clog tree across the glade he even saw the little disk set in his tree this is as it is right now he said amazed here is yesterday she said the tapestry became blank she looked surprised now thats odd it has never done that before maybe its because of what chlorine did with my time chlorine is involved in this he explained about the lovely woman and the dragon ass and how it always seemed to be morning when he traveled i think she had something to do with it ida nodded that would explain it nimby has strange powers she must have asked him to rerun your mornings so you could travel better the tapestry doesnt know how to account for that maybe if you try someone elses yesterday like maybe my trees it would work better she smiled yes im sure it will the scene shifted the trees remained but now there were fauns and a nymph soon the nymph ran away and one faun chased her off the picture the other faun retired to the sandalwood tree you cati see everything he said twice as amazed yes if we know where to look but it is too complicated to try to watch all xanth through all time so we look only when we have reason she turned to face him ptero is like that only more so it would be difficult to explore and perhaps dangerous but i have to find that faun or the tree will fade it was bad enough losing my friend without losing his tree too yes of course i just want you to understand that this is no ordinary mission it is stranger than anything you may have experienced whatever it is it is better than letting my friends tree fade but if you should be lost then your own tree would fade too that made him pause do you think that will happen i dont know i assume the good magician made sure you were capable of handling the situation to the extent anyone could be no he didnt even talk to me forrest said crossly did you go through the challenges yes and then he refused to hear my question what were the challenges like he described them to her as she seemed genuinely interested though he saw little point in this still it was best not to be impolite to a princess as he described each scene it appeared on the tapestry just as it had happened so in each case there was a physical challenge she said which you surmounted by using the talent of a person who happened to be there yes actually the psychologist the dot girl and the wood changing man i found a way to get them each to help me i think this is the kind of ability that would be required on ptero the princess said surely this was the good magicians conclusion but he didnt he always has good reason for his actions though they are seldom immediately apparent to others i believe he is trying to help you in his fashion he did put you in touch with mare imbri after all yes but now i think you are ready to see ptero it is my moon your what then he saw something even more surprising than the tapestry a tiny ball was swinging around the princess head it must have been hiding before because until this time all he had seen was a flicker of something not quite there it was about the size of a large eyeball as it came closer to him it brightened this is ptero ida said it orbits my head and reacts to my moods but it is more than just a tiny moon it is an idea it looks pretty solid to me it is in its fashion you see i am a sorceress and my talent is the idea ptero is a condensation of all the ideas of xanth as they were too numerous and complicated to fit inside my head so it would appear that the faun you seek is no more than an idea not yet formulated in xanth but how can i find a faun who doesnt exist he does exist just not in tangible form you will have to locate him and cause him to exist she had said this was strange he was beginning to appreciate how serious she was you mean that the idea of him isis there in that ball yes the idea of everything is there it seems you will have to go there to find the idea you need but i cant go there he protested its tiny mare imbri has a spell to make you small enough in a manner he didnt much like the sound of this in a manner your body will have to remain behind only your soul can go as you said ptero is tiny but suppose something happened to my soul she nodded gravely this is the risk you take i think it will be all right because the good magician evidently thinks so but there are always risks when the unknown is braved we dont know what you may find on ptero so it might after all be best if no i must save that tree then we shall have to prepare you for your journey your body will rest in this room while your soul visits ptero i will be going around the castle but once you and imbri are there that will be no problem i will return every few hours so that your soul can find your body when it needs to and of course imbri will be guiding you she has visited ptero before so has a small notion of its nature but none of us will be able to help you if you have trouble in fact we wont even know what you are doing the tapestry doesnt orient on ptero because it isnt part of xanth its a derivative so you will truly be on your own forrest swallowed and nobody knows exactly what ill find there but if imbri has been there i went to deliver only brief daydreams imbri said appearing beside him he realized that she couldnt speak to two people at the same time because she wasnt physically real she had to be in the dream of one or the other so she had disappeared when she talked to ida i had a specific summons it was like going toward a light i dont actually know the geography i caught only glimpses enough to know that its a whole world in itself bigger than xanth and maybe more varied and that time is strange there im sure mare imbri will be a great help ida said he glanced at her how did you know that imbri had finished speaking to me i waited for your blank look to pass it isnt polite to interrupt a daydream she says she doesnt know a whole lot about ptero and that time is strange there she will be able to locate friendly folk there because she is used to entering minds that may be your most important asset and she is always good company because of the nature of her business yes of course but he was being polite he had expected a competent guide and it seemed that imbri was going to be something less than that im sorry imbri said i will do my very best but its true i cant guide you perfectly i think that i turned out to be the best of a bad lot as far as the good magician was concerned there wasnt much he could say to that it would be dishonest to deny what she said i must ask you again princess ida said do you really wish to make this excursion realistically i think we have to say that your chances of success are no better than half and if you fail both trees may fade this is at best a doubtful endeavor he knew she was making sense but the thought of giving up of breaking his promise to his friends clog tree appalled him no i must do it as you wish are there any arrangements you wish to make before you go no i just want to get it done and return to my tree then lie on this bed and sniff from the bottle the good magician gave you its spell will free your soul from your body so that it can go to ptero i will remain close until you arrive there but how will you know now that he had decided he was finding new things to worry about imbri will tell me she will guide you there then make a quick trip to let me know he was already becoming happier to have the day mare with him the notion of losing his soul halfway between his body and the little moon did not appeal he sat on the bed then removed his knapsack and lay on it it was very comfortable but he was unable to relax this was the weirdest kind of journey he had never before imagined still he had to do it he reached into the knapsack which he now had beside him on the bed and brought out the good magicians bottle he nerved himself took hold of the stopper and pulled it came loose with a pop and he held the bottle to his nose and sniffed suddenly he felt quite alien he was half caught in a cloying clinging swamp truly bogged down he fought to haul himself free of it he needed expansion room be easy a voice said you dont want to tear off any he looked but his eyes didnt focus in fact he didnt seem to have any eyes he tried to speak but he didnt seem to have a mouth either just float the voice said let your soul coalesce his soul he followed the advice and found that he didnt have to struggle he just floated out of the swamp and as the rest of him came free it drew in together so that he was a single cloud now form an eye so you can see better he focused and the eyeball formed it focused and he was able to see a large whitish wall you are looking at the celling look down he rotated his eye and saw his body lying on the bed asleep he tried to exclaim in surprise but couldnt so he formed a mouth oh for he realized that that was the bog he had just hauled himself out of now make yourself small he willed himself small that improved his focus he saw a horse standing beside him her hoofs were planted firmly in midair mare imbri yes follow me to ptero she walked away he tried to walk but had no legs so he just floated in her wake she was going toward a huge statue in a moment he realized that it wasn t a statue but was princess ida they were gong toward her head keep getting smaller imbri said we have a long way to go he realized that he wasnt actually hearing her for he hadnt formed an ear he was simply aware of her thoughts he saw that she was getting smaller herself so he did the same idas head seemed to grow enormous then he saw a small object like a white ball it was coming toward them or they were going toward it it too grew or seemed to becoming more like a boulder then it was like an island in fact it was looming like a moon which was perhaps unsurprising finally it seemed more like a whole world filling his entire view it was no longer pure white he saw that the white was in patches which seemed to be clouds their designs were much more interesting from above than clouds usually seemed from below because they werent flat they were mountainous now they were falling toward the planet and it became ever larger the spaces between the clouds expanded and he could see green land and blue sea below he realized that he and imbri were still getting smaller because ptero was still looking larger it was amazing how big it seemed as they plunged toward its varied surface time to slow imbri cautioned him we dont want to land too hard but were just souls arent we we have no solidity thats not true there is a small amount of substance in a soul and on a world as small as ptero that becomes significant we will be assuming solid form there he thought of the size of ptero when he had seen it as a tiny moon circling princess idas head now it seemed larger than all xanth which meant that they were so small as to be invisible specks maybe it was possible for their souls to take physical form on that scale that was a relief because he wasnt at all comfortable as a nebulous blob that had to form an eyeball just to see anything he tried to slow but it didnt work he was plunging faster than ever how do i do it just form into a wide flat shape like a leaf or feather then the air will catch you and youll drift down he tried that but was still falling uncomfortably fast its not working very well oh i forgot you have a whole soul its twice as dense as my half soul so you are twice as heavy see if you can form into a parachute what kind of a parrot like this she became a kind of upsidedown cup with strings leading down to a lump of herself below its a mundane concept the canopy catches the air and the blob guides it down he emulated her form and it began to work his broad clothlike upper section caught the air and dragged and slowed the descent of the compact lower part of him even so they were coming down a good deal faster than he liked he expanded his mantle but before it was able to do much good he plunged into the blue sea near the white coast of the green land he descended way down below the surface of the water he held his breath and spread his hands trying to swim toward the surface then he heard imbri be a fish oh he formed into a fish and then he had no problem she formed into a sea horse beside him swim to land i must tell ida that we are safely here but but she was already gone so he strengthened his tall and fins and swam as strongly as he could toward land he hoped there werent any sea nonsters here because one of them could gobble him up though probably he could change into something else like a stink horn and get away he saw the sand of the bottom rising beneath him the water was getting shallow he was nearing the beach he was glad this business of shifting shapes did not come naturally to him though he supposed it could be fun if he learned it well enough the water became too shallow to swim in now what should he do try to become a flatter fish but it would keep on getting shallower until no amount of flatness would work then he laughed at his own stupidity he was there he was at the shore he no longer needed to be a fish he could assume his own shape he did so in a moment he was standing ankle deep in the surf complete with his knapsack his knapsack how had he managed to bring that along he reached into it and found everything there including the stoppered spell bottle and his spare pair of sandals apparently his soul was equipped with whatever his body had that was reassuring something plunged down to splash in the water behind him then the figure of a horse appeared i have told her mare imbri said now we are safely on ptero and can go about your mission great he said and exactly how do we do that i have no idea forrest gazed at the beach ahead of them this was indeed going to be a challenge hey waded the rest of the way out of the water and stood on the shore forrest splashed while imbris feet moved through the water splashlessly the beach was a pretty white ribbon of sand curving around so as to stay between the water and the land with remarkable precision the air was comfortably warm forrest mulled over what imbri had said if you have no idea what to do and i have no idea how are we going to do it maybe we can ask someone something was bothering him slightly and he managed to figure out what it was when you talk your mouth doesnt move thats because mares cant talk well with their mouths they can only neigh so i talk in your head in dreamiets but now im using my mouth to talk to you i can hear the sound thats because you are physical physical but only my soul came here the soul has a very small amount of substance just enough to make a solid body here where everything is very small so you have naturally assumed your regular form complete with sandals and knapsack and you have assumed yours he said catching on but you look a bit hazy thats because i have only half a soul while my mare body is several times as massive as your faun body so i have less than a tenth of your solidity if you touch me your hand will pass through me i it will he reached out to pat her shoulderand his hand sank into her body with only faint resistance he snatched it out sorry she shrugged her shoulders an interesting maneuver it doesnt hurt as long as you can see me and hear me its all right i wonderif you dont mindcould you become all the way solid here if you assumed a smaller form so you could use your mouth to speak certainly if you prefer she shrank becoming a small human woman or girl in a close black dress will this do she asked using her mouth i have only about half your mass so i cant be any larger without diffusing thats fine you look great he meant that her form was satisfactory in the solid sense but actually it was more than satisfactory she looked just like a rather pretty girl or a nymph with lustrous black hair except for the slightly equine set of her nose which was understandable she was after all a type of horse imbri took a stepand tripped falling on her face neigh she exclaimed chagrined im not used to being physical forrest realized that that made sense she had been a half soul seemingly without substance for thirty years and when she had been a night mare before that she had had four feet she wasnt used to handling a real human body my fault he said maybe you had better return to mare form but i dont want to make you feel awkward because i dont talk with my mouth she said im sure i can learn to handle this form if i concentrate but she had a scratch on her cheek from a shell on the beach that made him feel guilty i would rather feel awkward than have you falling and scratching your face she looked alarmed oh did i do that he dug into his knapsack and pulled out a mirror he gave it to her and she held it up so she could see her face i did oh thats embarrassing she brushed her fingers across the scratch wiping it out so that her face was smooth again that surprised him but he realized that since she had shaped the body to begin with she could readily reshape it to eliminate an imperfection like most females she was sensitive about her appearance even in a form that was unnatural for her she returned the mirror and he put it back into the knapsack it banged into something and he realized that it was his spare pair of sandals that gave him an idea you can wear my other sandals theyll protect you from tripping he dug them out and offered them to her they will she looked dubious yes they are magic they protect the feet they wont let you misstep but those are faun sandals im having enough trouble balancing on these human feet i dont think i could do it at all with hoofs of course im used to hoofs but only when i have four of them sandals from my tree fit anyone thats their nature try them so she sat down and lifted her knees so she could reach her feet in the process she showed a very nymphly pair of legs almost up to the panty line in much the way the demoness sire would have done on purpose he wondered if he should mention that because it was clear that imbri was not accustomed to the ways of a physical human body then she got the sandals on discovering that they did indeed fit her human feetand the position of her legs shifted so that much less showed he realized that the sandals were now protecting her feet from harming the rest of her legs by undue exposure because the legs connected to the feet and missteps were not merely of the ground so he didnt have to say anything she stood oh i feel far more secure these sandals are helping even now he had already come to that conclusion im glad actually he could have lived with the exposure of her legs but there didnt geem to be much point in saying that she looked around im supposed to guide you and i havent done a good job maybe we can ask someone that seemed like a fair idea all right is there anyone to ask there are countless slews of folk here im sure one of them must be close by lets walk along the beach and see so they walked along after a time forrest noticed that there was something odd about the air it smelled all right but it had colors it seemed to be green ahead and blue to their right but there didnt seem to be any source he paused turning around do you see colors he asked yes imbri said surprised it is yellow behind us and red over the sea do you think it means anything it must but i dont know what and there just doesnt seem to be anyone to ask he said frustrated if there are so many folk here where are they all linbri pondered then brightened i think i remember from one of the dreamers folk have to be requested otherwise they stay away if they are courteous so that no one gets crowded but how do we request someone when theres no one to ask i think you just do it he shrugged okay he stood straight i hereby request the company of someone there was a sound and in a moment a large figure appeared flying over the trees it came to a solid landing on the sand before him yes it was a winged unicorn taken aback forrest looked at imbri she looked as baffled as he so he turned to the unicorn hello i was just wondering with no introduction the unicorn asked he spoke without moving his mouth uh i am forrest faun i am kero unicorn i was just wondering what service do you have to trade what you are impaired of hearing no i just dont understand what service precisely i dont understand the unicorn looked more closely at him you are impaired of intellect forrest was getting frustrated i am just new to this region i dont know what you mean oh you must have traveled far to be so out of touch very far forrest agreed i suppose i can explain that much without violating protocol in this region we trade services so if you want to know something i can tell you you must trade me a service for my service in abating your ignorance what service do you offer this was new to him what service do you want i have no idea you summoned me so i assumed you had something in mind i had a question in mind thats not a service my answer is a service what other service will you trade for it this wasnt getting anywhere very rapidly so he tried something silly an entertaining jig done what is your question what do the colors of the air mean they indicate direction since we have no sun or moon or stars to mark it blue is north because it is cold red is south because it is hot green is to and yellow is from forrest waited but that appeared to be the extent of the answer so he brought his panpipe from his knapsack played a lively melody and proceeded to dance his jig fauns were good at jigs so he knew it was competent the unicorn watched with seeming interest when he thought he had jigged enough he stopped kero nodded satisfied then spread his wings and flew back over the forest i guess we learned something forrest said watching the creature disappear yes imbri agreed we learned two things that colors indicate directions and that it is necessary to trade services on ptero so we got the better bargain maybe so but what is this to and from business i suppose we could trade for that information but maybe well figure it out for ourselves soon let me see if i can trade for useful information forrest shrugged i hope you can imbri faced the air i request someone to trade with a dark creature faded into view it was a black centaur mare yes what startled forrest was that she spoke both physically and mentally imbris delicate jaw dropped youre a night mare not exactly are you curious about my derivation yes forrest and imbri said together i am chemare it all started when my sire who was horribly prejudiced against zombies was scheduled to have a bad dream in which he and a really rotten female zombie drank from a love spring but somehow the night mare who was carrying the dream got confused or maybe she had a secret thing for the centaur who was rather handsome for his kind and she fell into the dream herself and drank from the spring instead the elixir overwhelmed them both and they promptly indulged in an encounter of love that heated the spring so much it almost evaporated then the mare departed and the dream dissipated leaving the centaur considerably more satisfied than the authentic dream would have left him in due course the mare bore a foal with half a soul black as night but with the form of a centaur that was me but because i derive from an illicit dream i came not to xanth proper but to ptero where i bring bad dreams to those dents who deserve them its not the best existence but t will resi do oh chemare imbri exclaimed how well i understand i was a night mare for many decades i thought you looked somehow familiar but youre in human form yes so i can be substantial for my companion forrest faun whom i am trying to help would you like to exchange a service i would love to but im not sure what we could do for each other is there anything you need forrest asked no i came only because i was closest when the call went out so i truly regret this because its so rare to encounter someone with experience nightmaring but i must go she faded out wait forrest cried too late she was gone we are slow on the uptake imbri remarked we had better be prepared to render some service before the next one disappears yes they dont seem to wait around long without reason there was the sound of running hoofs a centaur came galloping from the green direction followed by two centaur foals she had a white mane and white body but blue eyes forrest tried not to stare at her rippling bare chest knowing that centaurs paid no attention to certain effects but he was impressed she came to a stop before imbri hello mare in human form i am ilura centaur and these are my foals we apologize for our tardiness tardiness we were some distance when we heard your call and the foals couldnt move at adult speed forrest realized that more than one creature had answered imbris call but imbri was already handling it i am mare imbri and this is my companion what have you to trade a pleasant daydream what do you wish in return information on the person on ptero who can best help us to find what we seek what do you seek a faun for a vacant tree that would be cathryn centaur she is the one who best knows where to find fauns there was a pause then imbri realizing that she had her answer looked directly at ilura the centaurs eyes went blank in a manner forrest recognized she was having a daydream he looked at the two foals one was a dark furred male the other a light furred female the male was stoic while the female was impatiently stamping her feet hello foals im forrest faun you must be dissimilar twins the female looked quickly at him im in a hurry she replied the male looked slowly at him im in no hurry he said well im sure your dam will be finished here soon the female reacted rapidly she used a forefoot to scratch letters in the sand the hurry twins imina and imino oh my apology for misunderstanding forrest said dont be imina said quickly it happens all the time were used to it imino added slowly its probably a good thing we dont exist but how can i be talking to you if you dont exist were mighthes imina replied rapidly it would take a freakish set of circumstances to make us real for one thing our dam isnt real either only our sire hurry centaur is real imino said tardily forrest was starting to catch on your sire lives in xanth proper and the rest of you dont thats it exactly imina agreed swiftly we can only come to exist if our dam gets real and encounters our sire and performs a certain ritual that makes human folk uncomfortable to contemplate all that seems extremely unlikely im sorry it doesnt really natter iinino said deliberately there are far too many mighthes for xanth to accommodate ilura had completed her daydream come foals we must be off already imino asked about time imina said i had a very nice dream of your sire ilura said i think he may be almost ready to consider something they galloped off into the yellow color forrest and imbri watched them go those were mighthes he said yes its a shame they arent real how do we find cathryn centaur i think we just ask for her can we just ask for the faun i need she turned to him startled we could certainly try he faced nothing i want to trade with the faun i need nothin happened i suspect he isnt close enough to hear imbri said have you noticed that all the creatures we have encountered here are equine crossbreeds i hadnt noticed he said surprised could it be coincidence it could be but i think there must be sections of ptero for different types of creatures and this happens to be the equine section that would explain why we landed here im equine so was drawn here so there would be no fauns close by cathryn centaur must know where they are that makes sense to me very well lets trade with cathryn imbri stood facing nowhere i would like to trade with cathryn centaur another lady centaur appeared emerging from the forest she was brown of mane and fur with large white wings why hello mare she said i never expected to be summoned why not imbri asked because there is no service anyone can do me so i cant trade didnt you know that i am from far away i know very little about this region but the conventions are similar throughout our world you dont mean to say she broke off looking startled yes we are from xanth imbri said that is extremely unusual as there is virtually no physical contact between xanth and ptero but considerable emotional contact cathryn nodded agreement all we mighthes long to achieve xanth proper but so few of us ever do now i suppose if you offer me some way to cro there then we can indeed deal but as it is impossible to travel there physically i suspect that your mission is of some other nature yes we need to locate a suitable faun to become the spirit of a vacant tree ah thats why you summoned me because i know the best route to the faunhold i yes i i am really sorry that we cant exchange services because i can certainly start you on your way there start us you cant direct us all the way there correct i cant it is beyond my range range oh i see cathryn said sympathetically you are from afar and dont understand our system yes i dont but i am willing to trade if its a matter of that im afraid it is we are unable to interact significantly without the exchange of equivalent services forrest stepped into the dialogue there must be some service you need or desire that we might do cathryn glanced at him i doubt it i am really quite satisfied apart from my natural longing to become real this is a pleasant enough realm and far better than utter nonexistence i would gladly show you around it if if we could do you some service in exchange he finished exactly but as it is i see no cause for further association so if you will excuse me i shall take off she spread her wings walt imbri cried there must be something cathryn paused i would be pleased if there were for you seem like interesting folk and iln sure your need must be extreme for you to make the reat effort to coitimehere but it would be unkind to pretend there is anything feasible every creature has some secret deep desire imbri said i am in a position to know the centaur seemed genuinely curious how could you be in such a position i was a night mare for a hundred and seventy years punishing folk for their darkest desires and a day mare for thirty years rewarding their brightest desires i have never encountered anyone who was wholly satisfied with his lot some dont know their deepest desires but all have them and maybe some demons prey on that forrest said thinking of d sire then i think i must be the exception cathryn said becituse i am satisfied as satisfied as it is possible for a mightbe to be they seemed to be getting nowhere but forrest remembered something the good magicians list he said maybe that has the answer he dug into his knapsack and brought it out now he thought he could almost read the first two words of the good magicians illegible scribble dear horn he said squinting does that make any sense oh cathryn said putting a hand to her ample breast you have found your secret desire imbri said i suppose i have the centaur confessed i never realized it before forrest put the paper away what is the dear horn it is a special horn that when blown will locate a persons true love i have no true love i did not realize until you spoke that i missed him then we must find this horn for you imbri said that may be no easy thing i have no idea where it may be i understand it tends to get left wherever last used forgotten so though you have indeed discovered a service you might render me i fear it is an impossible service forrest found himself becoming canny suppose we agreed to help you find that horn would that be a sufficient service so that we could talk freely while we were doing it why yes i suppose it would be but you may still be wasting your time because it may not be possible to find it and in that case i will not be able to guide you toward the region of the fauns forrest shrugged well take that chance are we agreed yes cathryn said smiling then lets proceed im not much but mare imbri can tune in on dreams and that may help as the dear horn is surely an instrument for the fulfillment of dreams both mares looked at him youre not as empty headed as the average faun the centaur remarked its a luxury i cant afford at the moment i must save that tree and return to my own tree forrest turned to imbri can you orient on some person wtio knows where the dear horn is im not sure but i suppose the good magician wouldnt have asked me to guide you if he didnt think i had some way to do it let me concentrate she closed her eyes she looked much like a nymph that way except that she was clothed yesi am getting a faint glimmering its like the colors of the directions only its more like ight from a distant flickering candle i think i will be able to find it but we will have to go straight to it because its very faint and i may lose it if we delay or deviate then lets go forrest said gratified they set off to the north and slightly to the east there were numerous tracks all hoofmarks that reminded him of the conjecture they had made about regions they had encountered only equine folk in this region a unicorn a centaur and a winged centaur that could be coincidence but he doubted it because in regular xanth he had seldom seen such creatures is this equine country he inquired yes cathryn answered creatures of a kind tend to congregate being more comfortable with similar types theres no rule it just happens so elsewhere there will be regions of dragons or of elves or of human folk or of fauns she agreed actually there may be several regions of each type because of the time time time is geography so there are limits i dont understand will i have to exchange a service in order to find out what that means she laughed no we are in the process of exchanging our services now it is to my interest to facilitate your search for the dear horn and you can surely do that better if you understand our system i had forgotten for the moment that you are from outside have you noticed something about me he glanced at her only that you somehow seem younger than i took you for i was probably distracted by yourthere are aspects of you that resemble a generously endowed nymph and she laughed again making those aspects shake i think i night even guess which aspects you mean but you are not imagining it i am growing younger i was foaled only twenty years before we met so even a small distance to the east makes me noticeably younger how can that be is there youth elixir in the airs no its the direction when we travel into the from we become younger if the dear horn is very far in this direction not only will we be in ogre territory i will be too young to take you there i would regret that because then we could not complete our agreement but how can that be east is a direction not a time perhaps that is true where you come from here east is from or what you might call the past its all the same to us of course but i suppose it might seem odd to outsiders are you saying that if we go one direction we get younger and if we go the other direction we get older that is exactly what i am saying so i am able to go twenty years east from where we meet and seventy years west for reasons of vanity i prefer to remain mostly in the early maturity section neither extreme youth nor extreme age appeal to me particularly he was amazed does this apply to us too i should certainly think so do you feel yourself getting younger no but i wouldnt notice five or ten years and neither would imbri were both two hundred years old you are that age where he was nonplumed why here of course but you must be five or six years younger than you were see i am becoming a teen and younger he looked at her again indeed now her breasts were smaller her flanks were less solid and she had acne on her face her mane which had been loose was now bound into a pony tail he checked himself no i remain much the same faun as ever but i would be only a hundred and ninety or so instead of two hundred i would have to go a long way back to get really young so i gather how far can you go in to into what the future why i dont know it depends on how long my tree lives perhaps four hundred years you are a longlived species well we draw our vitality from our trees if my tree should be chopped down i would fade out right then i see so you should have a wide range of geography here on ptero that is surely an advantage in case your faun is long removed forrest suffered a revelation the good magician must have known thats why imbri and i are the same age and both long lived so we can search farther together that does seem to make sense every persons territory is limited by her life span that is not usually a problem but i confess that at times i do wonder at what must be beyond my territory she was now smaller with no chest development and her mane was in pigtails i hope it isnt much farther imbri who had been walking with a removed expression looked at her not far now i think the glow is stronger but it is still flickering i dont want to pause lest something happen to it but we may have to pause cathryn said we are approaching the edge of equine territory i there was the sound of hoofs and two adult centaurs came into sight the hide of one was dark with a spiral pattern of spots like thickly clustered stars the other was the opposite with a white hide speckled with black dots both carried bows ho ladies the dark one called are you aware that you are near the boundary forrest saw that the land ahead did change they had been walking through a fairly level open forest the kind that hoofed creatures preferred but before them was a tangle of oddities yes thank you alpha cathryn said these folk are from xanth on a mission to locate the dear horn which it seems is in the adjacent territory then she turned to the others this is alpha centauri guardian of the boundary his name got mangled by a passing galaxy but he is nevertheless one of us to be sure alpha agreed gruffly but this is a bad section to cross out the puns have completely overgrown it and are horrible the other centaur spoke you are visitors from xanth proper you will be returning there in due course yes within a month forrest replied i am vision centaur i would like to exchange a service with you well i dont know if we have anything to exchange surely we do i have a message i would like you to deliver to certain parties in xanth i can do that imbri said i can visit almost anyone in xanth in my capacity as a day mare in return i offer my service in helping to protect you from an incipient attack attack cathryn asked concerned ill make that deal imbri said what is the message it is for jenny elf and chief gwendolyn goblin it is that if they will seek out a special type of tick the genetic they can use it to cause their myopic gene to recede that is to become recessive that will render their sight normal so they will no longer need to use spectacles but this is great news for them imbri said they will not be able to perform a return service for it creatures of xanth proper are not necessarily bound by our conventions i merely wish them to have the information i will deliver the message to them imbri said thank you now i suggest that you make a detour because your present course is not wise i dont dare deviate lest i lose the glow imbri said i must go straight ahead cathryn sighed then we shall accompany you we dont have time for a gallop poll on the issue perhaps my staff will help in her hands appeared a long stout pole if that is not sufficient perhaps my talent will avail you have a magic talent forrest asked surprised oh didnt i mention that my talent is blankets they can be very useful on occasion forrest did not comment it was interesting that a winged centaur had a magic talent other than flying though of course as a mightbe she wasnt limited by the conventions of ordinary creatures of her kind but nice as a blanket could be on a cold night he doubted it would be much help against horrible puns alpha looked into the sky oh no i fear the dragons are staging a border raid precisely vision said i saw them from afar cathryn followed his gaze alarmed im too young to use my bow effectively then you and your friends had better flee from or to alpha d vision and i will cover your retreat sal now forrest heard the beat of a number of heavy wings dragons raid equine territory yes alpha said tersely they have a taste for equine flesh of course we just dissolve and reform when eaten but its an exceedingly uncomfortable process he unslung his bow and nocked an arrow i will hold them off fleeand stay out of the air how can we outrun flying dragons forrest asked cathryn its a matter of moving out of their time range she explained looking worried if they are young dragons we can move from and force them to become too young to fly well if they are mature dragons we flee to hoping they will become too old to fly well unfortunately it is a mixed squadron alpha said squintin into the sky as dark shapes appeared some will follow effectively regardiess i will make a security blanket cathryn decided you are too young to make a really effective one alpha warned her i know but it must do she gestured and something spread out from her hands and floated above them it slowly settled covering all of them except alpha forrest realized that her talent was not preesely what he had understood i will defend the outer perimeter of the blanket alpha said aiming his first arrow at the first dragon stay low and perhaps it will suffice the glow is flickering imbri said i am going on i recommend against this alpha said grimly attila the pun passed by here recently and left a disgusting trail it is simply not safe i sug est that you fly over this section or run around it after the dragons depart especially since you are quite young here cathryn and your friends look inexperienced but linbri was already forging into the pun region so naturally foitest and cathryn had to follow this is very bad judgment alpha called after them forrest was sure he was correct well at least the dragons wont attack us within the pun strip cathryn said they dont like it any better than we do forrest heard the bow twang behind them alpha or vision was firing at a dragon could puns really be worse than dragons there was a rustle ahead and something thumped past them it looked like a man except that it had only one armand one leg then it turned its head toward them and forrest saw that it had only half a head with one eye and half a mouth et ut f y ay it screamed in half syllables cathryn raised her staff no you get out of our way half brother she retorted her threat must have been effective because the thing ran away forrest saw as it retreated that it was halfreared too now they passed a sign saying mall it was an open section winding through the tangled puns with shops along the sides the central strip was clear and firm so they ran along it rather than across it making better time then imbri started pulling at her clothing forrests feet felt confined he just had to get them out of the sandals oh no cathryn exclaimed ripping off her backpack a strip mall forrest realized that that made sense in a pun strip he took off his sandals and backpack and felt free meanwhile imbri had stripped to complete nudity and now looked exactly like a nymph it wasnt so bad they held their things and ran on along the strip another truncated figure ran by going the opposite direction this one was female a half sister but while the half brother had been sliced vertically so that he had to jump rather than run this one was halved across the middle she had two nice legs and was topless forrest wondered how the other half of her got along but his brief distraction caused him to misstep suddenly his foot was in a fishshaped blob of jelly it slid out from under causing him to fall on his rear he saw that imbri had taken a similar fall they were no longer wearing their magic sandals so their feet could take bad steps wed better get off the strip and get dressed again he called we need to run safely imbri agreed they scrambled off the strip and donned their things he was surprised to note that she put her upper clothing on before her sandals but of course she wasnt really a nymph however she might look she was a mare when she was in girl form she evidently adopted the conventions of girls and didnt like to show her whole body yet it was a beautiful body human beings had funny attitudes but again his distraction caused mischief suddenly he was struck a blow on the foot he looked and discovered that he had tried to put on a sock instead of his sandal the sock had punched him or rather socked him he tossed it away and found his sandal instead we must keep moving cathryn said behind him were off the mall strip but not out of the comic strip these abysmal puns will ruin us if we dont get clear of them soon forrest massaged his struck foot agreeing then he got up and followed imbri his steps more confident now that they were protected by the sandals they passed a big turtle hey watch where youre going the creature snapped it was of course a snapping turtle my apology forrest said politely though they really hadnt gone that close to it they passed a big tree with a bee sitting on its lowest branch suddenly forrest felt his eyes watering a baybee cathryn cried it makes you cry again he had already discovered that now he was stumbling despite his sandals because the ground was getting marshy from the tears of those who had gone before he lurched past a large plant and almost tripped over one of its square roots a polynomial plant cathryn said attila really did his worst this time then several creatures charged toward them their bodies looked human but their heads were closed fists on some the thumbs were on the right and on others on the left all of them looked vile knuckleheads cathryn said theyre not the smartest creatures but theyre mean run they ran toward what looked like a hanging curtain made up of thin slices of wood avoid those cathryn cried they tried to duck down under it but as they did they slid into deeper swamp and got bogged down i cant see forrest cried those were venetian blinds cathryn said they made us i get it forrest said how do we get our vision back i think i saw some see weed if we can find that they blundered about making big splashes you wont find it that way a voice came who are you forrest asked hoping it wasnt a knucklehead i am the anonymous turtle you passed without notice i can direct you to the see weeds though i havent seen them in days then how can you do it forrest demanded i have turtle recall that did seem to make sense what do you want in exchange something nice to recall im tired of recalling abysmal puns ill do it imbri said i will give you a dream of sweet turtle doves bear to your left you were headed for the seeanenemy which is more trouble than you would care for at the moment keep going there the see weed is right before you forrest couldnt see anything but in a moment he heard a pleased exclamation from imbri then she came to him and touched him with the see weed and suddenly he could see again she touched cathryn then she went to do her service for the turtle but more bs were flying by one stung cathryn well you took long enough to get to it she said crossly in fact you didnt do it at all you just stood there stupidly while your friend fetched the see weed well yes i suppose not that you ever were much of a creature she continued i dont know why im even bothering to help you in your stupid quest you then a second b stung her oh you wonderful friend she exclaimed suddenly hugging him he would have liked it better if she had been at her mature stage youre just so great to have around i dont know how i ever survived without you then something stung forrest on the leg he looked down and saw it was a tic marked tac he pulled it off but it was already having its effect he was realizing how to manage things better those bs were from a have their stings made folk bhave differently one must have been a blittle and the other a bfriend a third b was already stinging cathryn she pushed forrest away bgone she exclaimed tell it to the bs he told her loudly comprehension crossed her face from upper right to lower left she turned to face the remaining milling bs begone the bs buzzed rapidly away heeding the voice of authority cathryn turned back to him oh thank you i really didnt mean those things i said it was just that you got stung he said fortunately i got bitten by a tactic so i figured out what to do imbri returned the turtle is satisfied she reported now we must move on the glow is flickering again she plunged on ahead they followedand suddenly they were out of the comic strip and the dreadful puns were gone ahead of them was a tree twisted into the form of a pretzel we are in ogre territory cathry said nervously shapes loomed in the sky and the dragons are still hunting us forrest added just as nervously athryn centaur glanced at the sky ill throw a blan ket of fog she said raising her hands you can make another kind of blanket forrest asked surprised not just security yes my talent is blankets not just one kind but im only about eight years old now and it wont be very big from her hands poured patches of mist which spread out and sank around them unfortunately it sank too low so that their heads poked out and the dragons spied them this is the best i can do cathryn said well have to duck down in order to hide in it they ducked down the blanket of fog closed over their heads concealing them from the air unfortunately it also made it hard for them to see their way then there was a great thudding sound an ogre cathryn whispered frightened forrest realized that as a child she was much more fearful of monsters than she would have been as an adult he poked his head cautiously up through the top of the cloud blanket and peeked at the sky the dragons were circling looking for their prey they were smaller than he remembered but he realized that this was because they were now younger as the ogre approached huge and awful the dragons peered down at him stay here no dragons go the ogre cried shaking one hamfist but the dragons knew lie couldnt reach them they were young and foolish one of them flew over the ogre and dropped a ball of dung it splatted close and some of it flew out to speckle the ogres hairy hide the ogre growled it wasnt that dirt bothered him but he was not d enough not to know he was being insulted ogres were quite stupi justifiably proud of their stupidity but there were limits he stooped picked up a rock and hurled it at the dragon the dragon tried to swerve but the rock clipped it on the tail knocking it upside down the dragon gyrated desperately to prevent itself from falling to the ground then flew quickly away in a moment the other dragons followed they didnt care to tangle with an ogre in ogre territory satisfied the ogre tramped on he was evidently the border guard it was just as well because the cloud blanket was thinning soon they would have been exposed and the ogre wasnt a much better bet than the dragons as far as their safety went cathryn could have spread her wings and flown away of course but she was too courteous to do that cathryn stood and reculled her blanket the wisps of cloud funneled into her hands and the round was clear again ibri esuined her determined trek it is getting close she said thats good cathryn said because as they walked she was looking more like seven than eight it was clear that she would be unable to go beyond her limit they crested a hill and looked down on an enormous castle it had no moat and evidently didnt need one because the bashed and splintered state of the trees around it showed it to be the home of an ogre what else here in ogre country its in there imbri said the one who knows where the dear horn is dont think theres anything in there but the ogre cathryn said i dont think its a good idea to go in but if hes the one who knows well have to ask him forrest said ogres eat other folk and crunch their bones cathryn reminded him shivering as a child she lacked courage but thats temporary here isnt it imbri asked because all folk are just spirits so cant be truly killed or destroyed yes but its awful getting crunched it hurts and if he crunches you youll be gone from that region you can never return to where you died any more than you can go beyond your regions of delivery or ending you mean folk can die here forrest asked alarmed not exactly we can die but it is limited how can death be limited limited to the region where the death occurs that means that though a person reconstitutes he can never return to that spot or ever come close to it the limit is about six months on a side from and to and equivalent distances north and south both forrest and imbri were perplexed but why cant a person just go there anyway imbri asked he just cant it no longer exists for him he can see the limit but cant cross it you mean it exists only he cant go there forrest asked others can go but not the one who died there yes they pondered that a moment then forrest had another question suppose i get killed by the ogre so i cant go back there but then the ogre comes out here beyond the six month range could i have at him again yes when two folk fight and one kills the other he has to be careful when he leaves that area because the other may be lurking for him to kill him back sometimes two enemies leave a whole series of holes in each others existences making things difficult so as a general rule folk try not to kill or be killed because its such a nuisance what about dragons or ogres thats another matter they are so dull that they dont worry about such complications dragons dont kill their own and dont care about others if an ogre crunches you once hell do it again it isnt easy to talk to an ogre theyre too stupid i think maybe this a bad idea but if we dont talk to him we cant find out where the dear horn is forrest said then we wont be able to complete our service to you and you wont be able to help us find faun country that is true she agreed sadly forrest pondered it occurs to me that this is like one of the good magicians challenges we just have to figure out the way through but we have no guarantee that there is a way through imbri said this isnt a carefully crafted test this is real still even real challenges often have solutions he gazed at the castle maybe animal psychology will help what is the basic nature of ogres everyone knows that cathryn said they are the strongest ugliest and stupidest creatures around he nodded thats my understanding i hear they even have contests in those categories but i also hear that theyre not bad folk when you get to know them who would want to get to know an ogre cathryn inquired we would imbri said so we can ask him where the dear horn is oh thats right i forgot i dont have much memory at this age but forrest was working on his notion ogres have pride dont they suppose we challenged him to an ugly contest but we couldnt possibly win that cathryn said none of us is even remotely uglier than the handsomest ogre so we would lose forrest said yes instantly then he would crunch us but imbri was catching on would he crunch folk he had just bested and who admitted it who maybe even praised his superior ugliness cathryn stared at her what a notion you mean his ogre pride in victory would make him generous forrest nodded yes we could rally make him proud imbri remained doubtful but if it doesnt work we get crunched forrest nodded so i guess id better go n alone both fillies reacted we didnt say that imbri protested no we didnt cathryn agreed but its my idea and theres no sense in having two or three of us get crunched when one will do the two exchanged a generous glance were not sure this is best imbri said consider it this way if i get crunched you will still be here to try it if you wish to perhaps with more success if it works for me then i can ask the ogre to let the two of you in so you dont need to take the risk either way unless you decide to i hate to say it cathryn said but hes making sense fauns are more sensible than i thought imbri agreed and have more courage than i thought well we dont just chase nymphs you know forrest said embarrassed now how can i make myself ugly why even try imbri asked just challenge him and lose he wont know the difference he nodded ill do it he squared himself and marched on toward the castle wait imbri called if you get crunched where will you reconstitute he paused how far is half a year cathryn considered back about where we emerged from the comic strip then ill torm there just this side ot it all right imbri said but be careful forrest he laughed if i was careful i wouldnt walk into an ogres den he resumed his march the castle loomed larger and uglier as he approached it it was huge and squat with dull thatch for the roof and mildew on the stone walls the big front door was well over twice his own height made of ironwood he came to a stop before the door entry was a daunting prospect but he raised one fist and knocked on the wood iron there was no response so he knocked harder still nothing he realized that the ogre probably couldnt hear him for one thing there was a constant rumbling or crashing from within the castle as if something huge and violent were bashing down walls he looked around and saw a big bell on it was printed the word weather beside it was a solid metal bar so he picked up the bar hefted it high and swung it at the bellweather there was a loud gong followed by a crack of thunder a storm cloud formed over the bell shooting out bolts of lightning the lightning struck the bell adding to the sound then a bucket of rain dropped from the cloud and doused the bell the sound faded and the cloud evaporated there was a rumbling behind the door then it jerked violently inward so that the suction of the air blew forrest inside he stumbled and caught his footing helped by his magic sandals there stood the ogre twice the height of a man hairy and disproportionately muscular who you the thing demanded i im forrest faun i come to have an ugly contest the ogre thought about that forrest knew he was thinking because the unusual effort was heating his head and huge fleas were umping off lest their feet get burned then he decided to introduce himself see me orgy so far so good im uglier than you orgy ogre stared down at him ugly faun tis to yawn ill prove it do you have a mirror oigy shook his shaggy head mirror lack ogre crack he meant thit his iace was so ugly that any mirror that reflected it broke this was a complication how could forrest lose a contest if they couldnt compare their faces but maybe they could do it with water do you have a pool sure pool it cool then lets compare faces in the pool then well see who is uglier orgy considered and more fleas jumped off then he decided me say okay he turned and led the way into the castle forrest followed he noticed that much of the castle was in ruins the walls had been bashed down and the stones were scattered across the floor the ogre simply kicked them out of the way not even noticing though some were pretty solid chunks they came to an inner courtyard where water had collected it was dirty but it would do forrest bent lorward so that he could see his reflection he looked just exactly like a faun ugly he said orgy ogre bent over the water quivered and shrank away orgy grimaced the water made waves as it fled to the edges of the pool orgy smiled the water turned muddy and splashed right out of the pool on the far side im impressed forrest said i was never able to make water do that you are uglier than i am by far you must be a legend among your kind he was sincere the ogre had truly impressed him no i am merely an average ogre orgy said sadly but thank you for the compliment forrest stared youre not rhyming i never did rhyme no ogre does it is merely your perception that changed but you still look like an ogre to me but now you see me as an individual instead of a monster you have achieved respect so you are able to hear me as i am i never realized do you mean that all ogres are cultured instead of being stupid that depends entirely on your perception i was afraid you were going to crunch me i was until you showed that you had discovered respect we ogres crunch only the ignorant this is an education forrest said ill never view ogres the same a am excellent you should have no further fear of us but why did you come here i need your help im looking for the dear horn olio you wish to trade services yes is there anything i can do for you im afraid not i am completely satisfied i am sorry you came here for nothing forrest had been afraid of this i came here with two companions they remained apart for fear of getting crunched they might be able to figure out a service that you need then we could trade would it be all right if they sined me here that depends on their perspective if they are ordinary ill be obliged to crunch them protocol you know suppose i explain to them about respect they may not listen most folk are sure they know the nature of ogres but if i can make them understand then they will be welcome to the hospitality of the castle let me go fetch them maybe we can do each other some good after all as you wish meanwhile i shall return to my bashing as forrest walked out of the castle orgy ogre waded into the nearest wall bashing it into rubble with his two hamfists the whole structure shuddered such was the ogres ferocity that it was a wonder that any of the castle remained standing forrest realized that this was the sound he had heard before when he stood outside the door no wonder it required the bellweather to get the ogres attention he went out the door which remained open but it swung closed once he was clear apparently it was set to let visitors out but not to let them in so it was a magic door he departed the bleak castle environs and walked on across the blasted terrain to where the two inaies stood they looked amazed and relieved to see him you may enter the ogres den he said but there is a caution thats a severe understatement catliryn said are you sure ts safe t will be safe if you have the right attitude both mares looked at him doubtfully how can attitude save a person from being crunched by a monster imbri asked you have to leave your prejudice behind and have proper respect for an ogre cathryn asked incredulously forrest realized that there was a problem hes really a very cultured creature you just have to see him as such the two mares exchanged a significant glance i suppose even a stink horn has its culture imbri remarked to no one in particular they were locked into their prejudice he had to get rid of it or it would not be safe for them to enter the ogres den remember how you viewed me at first as just another faun looking for a nymph to chase they nodded do you still view me that way no cathryn said you have a lot more character than i originally supposed so can you appreciate that originally you were operating on prejudice nonsense centaurs arent prejudiced then she reconsidered but im very young now so maybe you do have a point so can you appreciate that the ogre may have qualities to be respected if you viewed him without prejudice an ogre then she heard herself and laughed you wouldnt be teasing a centaur foal would you no i am serious it is a matter of life or crunching the ogre doesnt crunch those who respect him imbri was havin her own problem respecting an ogre is an oxymoron a contradiction in terms they are sheer brutes then respect his brutishness but see him as worthy in his own right well i suppose i can make the effort so can i cathryn said even if i do get crunched they walked back to the castle they came to a stop before the great door now remember hes an individual you will know this by his speech it doesnt rhyme all ogres speak in stupid rhyming couplets cathryn said no they are merely heard that way by ignorant outsiders if you hear him rhyming dont speak because hell know you dont respect him this is wetrd the centaur said forrest picked up the rod and banged the bellweather the fierce little storm formed and the commotion summoned the ogre to the door this time all three of them were sucked inward by the swoosh of air the ogre stood there as huge and brutish as ever orgy these are my friends mare imbrium and cathryn centaur forrest said mares this is orgy ogre master of this castle hello orgy imbri said bravely likewise cathryn said looking as if she were ready to spread her wings and fly away i am glad to make your acquaintance fair mares orgy said graciously imbri hesitated then smiled and i yours ugly ogre she replied but cathryn kept her mouth shut forrest knew that was trouble orgy stared down at the centaur please repeat what i just said to you he requested cathryn took a step back with each hoof looking twice as nervous as before but all he said was forrest began but stopped when a severe glance from the ogre cut him off he realized that this was a test the centaur had to pass on her own you said who cares she mares she said then after half a pause she reconsidered wait that isnt quite it you saidyou said you were glad to make our acquaintance and you called us fair mares forrest breathed a silent sigh of relief then welcome into my castle orgy said grandly and led the way down the hall youre ight cathryn inurinuied as she walked beside forrest he doesnt hyme when i listen with an open mind forrest noticed thitt one of the wtils he had thought was in rubhle was actually solid maybe this was a diflerent passage though it seemed to be the only one available they came to a central hall that had some spare furnishings you must be hungry orgy said come sit at my iliagic table actually the roughhewn treetrunk timber table was way too big and hih for any of them but the ogre found blocks to put on the seats of the huge chairs for forrest and imbri and gently lifted them up so that they could sit at the level of the table cathryn was able to stand on her chair so that her head was high enough food appeared steaming pots emerged from a window in the wall at the end of the table and walked on stout little legs to the center and a big cocoa pot arrived similarly plates and utensils slid along i they took their proper places before each person then the pots unti lifted serving spoons and plopped stew onto each plate wlille the cocoa pot siphoned steaming cocoa into each mug orgy dived into his stew with gusto slurping and splashing but then forrest reminded himselt about attitude and looked again more carefullyand saw that the ogre was using a big spoon in the conventional human manner and neither slurping nor splashing his prejudice had tried to reassert itself they tried their own portions forrest found the substance in his stew to be almost nutlike and quite good the mares seemed to be enjoying theirs too if i may inquire cathryn said what kind of stew is this horse dropping stew orgy said she blinked the stew was brown and lumpy then she smiled surmounting her prejudice horse chestnuts she said yes the chests and nuts drop from the horse trees and we collect the chests and the nut droppings too and the cook makes stew from them imbri said how nice then as they ate forrest got down to business we need to find a service we can render org in return for information about the location of the dear horn do either of you have any ideas not at the moment cathryn said but perhaps if we knew more about orgy and this castle we would get an idea that is too simple to be interesting the ogre said even the most stupid thing becomes interesting when there is a need forrest said he had uttered a magic word stupid orgy said i am as stupid as any ogre very well i will tell you about me and this castle two years ago i was just another ogre happily bashing rocks tying trees in knots and teaching young dragons the meaning of fear i mean its what ogres do then i happened across an odd looking horn that someone had left lying around dimly curious i picked it up and iffed it but it had no particular sme i bt t but it didnt taste sn particularly edible in short it didnt seem to be very useful the scorn this horn i said or words to that effect after all there might be someone listening then i put it to my mouth and blew he paused are you sure you want to hear more this is so stupid that even i am being bored i dont want to be a spoilsport forrest said but i find it fascinating please do go on oh orgy said well it gets duller when i blew the horn it made a noise like none other i had heard it was if you can imagine this the sound of utter longing when i heard that i wanted something so badly that i could think of nothing else i didnt even know what it was just that i had to have it so i blew the horn again and this time i heard an echo from afar and my longing focused on that distant response so i trudged toward it and when i began to lose my way i blew it again and got another echo gradually i realized that i was the only one who heard either the horn or the echo other creatures i passed paid no attention apart from getting hastily out of my way they did not realize that i was on a mission they thought i had come to maraud as usual i continued in this manner for some time until at last i hove into view of this castle the echo came from it it seemed to be unoccupied so i entered naturally i bashed down a wall or two and found it very bashable so i continued it was a real thrill once again destroying something solid eventually pleasantly exercised i dropped to the floor and snored valiantly for a ew hours when i woke there was a table loaded with victuals so i got up and gobbled them down then resuect ny bashing of the walls so it continued for several days before i realized that the walls did not stay bashed they estoied themselves overnight oi even sooner this pleased me iensely ioi it meant that i could bash them down again and indeed so it has been ever since bash eat sleep bash in a perpetual routine i love it it is an ogres heaven since i had no more use for the liorn i threw it out a window after a ttime several monthsi realized that this was the purpose of the horn to lead me to my hearts delight a perpetually bashable castle so this is surely the dear horn you seek and i know exactly where i threw itmemory being inversely proportional to intelligenceand will be glad to tell you if you can find any equivalent service to trade for the information but i doubt that you can as i am completely happy as i am it does seem as if this castle was designed with an ogre in mind cathryn earked perpetual bashing with ieasting in between imbri agreed there doesnt seem to be anything missing yet i too thought i had everything i wanted the centaur said now i realize that i simply had not thought of my missing desire orgy looked at her you have a missing desire yes thats why i seek the dear horn to find your true love yes a companion to be with to love and cherish and breed with she paused oh thats it for you orgy was taken aback i dont think i would be a good companion for you she laughed surely not i favor intelligence and wings i mean that maybe you could use a companion of your own kind an ogress im not sure she might be uglier than i am then the castle might like her better than me maybe a merely moderately ugly ogress imbri inquired who would want a merely moderately ugly ogress forrest saw that this wasnt getting anywhere but it did suggest a line of investigation what about one who is distinctly inferior to you in strength ugliness and stupidity but who really appreciates your ogrish qualities orgy pondered and the teas began limping there is something appealing there it fell into place they had sought to applaud the ogie letting him win an ugly contest that had worked in a manner an ogress could surely do it much better someone to admire your achievement in continuously bashing down the walls wheres the fun of a job well done if nobody notices the fleas jumped higher as if their feet were getting burned yes i hadnt thought of that naturally not forrest said triumphantly you are too stupid but we who cant compare to you in that respect were able to think of it and this must be what we can do for you we can find you such an ogress orgy nodded and the few remaining fleas hung on for that i would tell you where the dear horn is find me that ogress ell if you tell us where the dear horn is we can use it to find her orgy shook his head and the fleas were hurled into the nearest unbroken wall i am too stupid to understand why you wouldnt simply use the dear horn for your own quest once you had it so ill wait for you to bring the ogress the three of them exchanged a somewhat stretched glance naturally it would not be expedient to question the stupidity of their host well search for her without the dear horn forrest agreed do you have any notion who would know where such an ogress might be cathryn asked with something less than full stupidity ogle ogre might know he sees everything how can we find ogle orgy put his last remaining fleas to flight he especially likes to look at esthetic females maybe if you stood on a mountain and looked esthetic he would spy you and come to ogle you this time cathryn and imbri shared a female type glance excluding forrest then they shrugged maybe so one of them agreed thus in due course they departed the ogres castle on a new mission to discover a suitable ogress they headed for the nearest barren peak i hope we are able to compliment ogle ogre before he crunches us cathryn muttered if he comes to ogle you he shouldnt crunch you forrest pointed out and thats another thing imbri said do you suppose all females exist just to be ogled why no of course not forrest said taken aback a number of them exist to be chased and celebrated for some obscure impenetrable reason she turned a dark glare on him he is a faun cathryn reminded her for some similarly unfathomable motive since they had nothing important on their minds forrest shared a concern of his if i am the size i am because of the solidified mass of my soul and imbri is the size she is because of the mass of her half soul how is it that creatures like cathryn and orgy have so much more mass are their souls so much larger now thats an intelligent question cathryn said just when we thought you had used up your supply of intelligence no souls dont vary in size like that in fact we of ptero really dont have souls they come only when we assume reality we have inferior substitute filler material that assumes the semblance but not the essence of souls thus we are limited to our life spans and have no existence beyond them it is one reason each of us hopes to come into genuine existence so we amass as much material as we require to fill out our standard forms and thats it you mean i could assume larger size by adding some of that filler substance imbri asked you could but why would you want to you are pure soul now what higher aspiration can there be to be fully souled to be fully real i am only a day mare i was fully real only briefly when i had a mission in xanth and was king for a moment ever since i have longed to be fully real again and once i complete my service to the good magician by enabling forrest to find his tree spirit i will be perhaps i envy you your chance at reality all of us here on ptero hope for it but most of us know that we will never achieve it how do you know that any of you achieve it forrest asked could you all be victims of a cruel hoax no we do know the chance is real because some of us are real we see them and know it can theoretically happen for others but didnt you say that none of you actually have souls i said that all of us hope for genuine existence and gain souls only when we assume reality some of us do achieve it and the rest of us envy them despite the inconvenience it brings them inconvenience there is a yearwide swath missing from their lives corresponding to the period they are in xanth it is similar to the excluded regions of death but broader because a creature cant be both here and in xanth at the same time forrest shook his head i dont understand that neither do i imbri agreed well it is rather complicated to appreciate until you see it cathryn said perhaps we shall encounter a living person before we separate i forrest hoped so because this was one peculiar thing she was describing souled folk with missing yearwide bands they reached the top of the peak which really wasnt all that high but it made up for it in barrenness as far as they could see there was nothing except dirt and rocks and stunted weeds that didnt dare grow bold for fear of the ogres so visibility was good which was what they wanted now we shall have to give him something to ogle cathryn said distastefully i understand males like to look at forbidden female anatomy but centaurs being more sensible have no forbidden anatomy so it may be up to you imbri but im a mare imbri protested i assumed this form only because its all that my half soul can substantiate and because it facilitates physical verbal speech i wear a dress only because otherwise i would be confused for a nymph but nymphs are mindless creatures cathryn said while you clearly have a mind not unless i speak the centaur nodded point made from afar ogle would take you for a nymph unless you are clothed so he would ignore you because ogling just doesnt work unless the subject is embarrassed so you wouldnt be of interest clothed or unclothed maybe if cathryn put on clothing forrest suggested since centaurs dont normally wear anything that might make her interesting i doubt it cathryn said even straight human beings who have the worst hangups about exposure dont worry much about children and i am now seven years old he had to admit that was true a clothed juvenile centaur would not be worth ogling because even an ogre would know she had nothing to conceal but he refused to give up on the quest well just have to establish that imbri is an adult human female and then have her remove her clothing but that would be improper imbri protested a human woman wouldnt precisely cathryn said that makes it ogleable the logic was impeccable so reluctantly imbri agreed she reformed her dress which was made of her own soulstuff so that it had a number of pieces then forrest and cathryn stood on either side of the peak serving as an audience imbri who had experience with male dreams explained what was required so that they could make suitable comments that would help attract the ogres notice then imbri stood on the highest knoll and lifted her arms behold cathryn said loudly a modest human style female woman lady is about to do a naughty strip tease dance that no decent person should observe great forrest exclaimed just as loudly as an improper male type faun i can hardly wait then imbri began her dance she stepped around wiggling her bottom she was pretty good at it her experience making daydreams must have helped then she kicked one foot high so that her leg showed all the way to the knee her sandals were still protecting her from moving her feet incorrectly so that she managed to show only as much as she meant to disgusting cathryn pronounced more more forrest cried imbri whirled so that her skirt flared out and lifted showing both knees stop this vile display at once cathryn said in her best imitation of an adult voice dont you realize that a child might see who cares forrest demanded irresponsibly there was a faint shudder in the ground either the earth itself was disgusted at the display or an ogre was stirring far away imbri took hold of the kerchief she had formed and drew it from her head she tossed it into the air where it fluttered a moment then dissolved into vapor indecent exposure cathryn protested take it off take it off forrest insisted wickedly as he sat down on the ground the ground rumbled something huge was trudging in their direction imbri worked off her blouse and threw it at forrest who caught it and sniffed it in as vulgar a manner as he could imagine actually it was a very nice blouse with a faint smell of fresh hay it was mare imbris natural soul substance then it dissolved because of course she couldnt afford to get fragmented absolutely revolting cathryn proclaimed divine he countered sincerely imbri was now dancing in a bright red halter and skirt and really did look nice she was small because of her lack of much soul substance but well formed and the tight halter offered a strong hint of even better things to come especially when it bounced with the vigor of her motions forrest was intrigued despite knowing that this was only an act there was something about clothing that enhanced interesting aspects into exciting aspects imbri kicked up a leg and one of her slippers went flying then she danced closer and kicked off the other and such was her position that forrest saw halfway beyond the knee that was dangerously close to panty territory awesome but as he sat half stunned by the prospect the slipper hit him on the forehead it didnt hurt him it felt more like a kiss as it dropped and dissolved then the ogre arrived who she me see he demanded startled forrest turned to him you must be ogle ogre he said it was a good guess because the ogres eyes seemed to bulge halfway out of their sockets there was something else about him but forrest wasnt certain what it was from dawn to dawn me ogre you faun he agreed oh come off it ogle forrest said we know you dont really talk in stupid rhymes the ogre looked crestfallen what gave me away nothing it was orgy ogre who let slip the secret we want to make a deal with you i am not interested in any deal i came merely to get a closer look at your dancing maiden she was just about to reveal something interesting no i wasnt imbri said as her blouse kerchief and shoes reappeared on her body then im out of here the ogre said crossly i cant crunch you because you know my nature and if i cant ogle you then any further dalliance here becomes pointless he has a soul imbri murmured see that faint glow that was the oddity forrest had noted what an unlikely place to encounter a soul imbri reconsidered suppose i dance while you negotiate with the faun ogle considered and his eyeballs heated to a dull red i okay he concluded in due course so imbri resumed her dance with all her clothing in place she did not look perfectly pleased but yielded to necessity also she seemed to enjoy dancing and might have done it for pleasure if it were not for the ogling we need to know where to find a suitable ogress to go stay with orgy in his bashable castle and applaud his heroic efforts forrest said that would be ogress shes not phenomenally ugly but she is extremely enthusiastic the ogres eyeballs were unwaveringly oriented on imbri who was twirling her skirt dangerously high forrest tore his own eyes away realizing that he could probably make a better deal while ogle was distracted what can we do for you in return for this information ogle considered again this time his eyeballs turned white hot maybe that was mostly because imbri was drawing off her blouse again that might not seem like much but the ogre probably had forgotten that there was a halter under it and the centaur was frowning so determinedly that it was obvious that something truly naughty was happening nothing he concluded i dont need anything forrest had a notion based on what he had recently learned from cathryn you like to see things he said especially things youre not supposed to see like human pantomiming he continued emphasizing the first syllable of the last word so that it sounded as if he were about to say the p word cathryns sudden shocked intake of breath aided the effect yeah yeah ogle agreed his eyeballs bulging as if he actually had seen the forbidden thing it was clear that being souled did not change his fundamental nature well the one thing you cant see is what is within your blanked out year yeah i can see everything on this side and everything on the far side but when i try to go into it i just slide right across and my age changes a year in a single moment it is exceedingly frustrating now imbris shoes were coming off forrest knew that he had to get on with it quickly lest she be forced to show something really naughty well we can go there because we arent you we can tell you what is happening in your forbidden section that prospect actually brought the ogres eyes from imbri which meant that she was able to dance without removing any more items giving her more time but only souled folk can see souls he said i am souled forrest said dont you see my glow so i do ogle agreed surprised he glanced at imbri and hers too that makes her even more interesting a naughty view of a souled creature is much more effective than of an unsouled one so it seems you can indeed go into my barred region very well if you will tell me what i am doing in there i will tell you where to find old ogress agreed well go now then forrest realized that it wasnt quite that simple uh where is it right this way the ogre led the way east as they progressed cathryn continued to grow younger soon she was dancing along like a yearling foal fortunately the ogre stopped before she hit the limit of her range here he said right now its when i am twenty four years old and moving slowly forward i dont seem to be much changed on either side of it but i sure am curious about whats in there we will go in and observe carefully forrest said and when we come out well make a full report i dont think id have the patience for that how about half a report half forrest agreed amicably or even a quarter if you prefer wow thats great then a slow thought percolated through what passed for the ogres brain but what will i do with nothing to ogle my attention span is very short cathryn stepped in i will tell you a foals story i know the ogre and the three bares at my present age its the only one i know but i think its a good one i love that story ogle said i havent heard it since i was in my ogret range i will refresh your memory once there was an ogre who was lost in the forest of course he could simply have bashed all the trees to smithereens but of course he was too stupid to realize that of course ogle agreed appreciatively so he stumbled about until he saw this odd house he bashed down the door and went in and there were three bowls of really icky gruel so he gulped down the first but it was too hot forrest and imbri quietly departed as the story enraptured the ogre it seemed that forbidden adventures were almost as compelling as forbidden sights the story wouldnt last long so they had to get to the center and see what there was to be seen and get back as it happened there wasnt much the vegetation was much thicker because it had had a chance to grow up during the years absence by the ogre but since other ogres occasionally passed this way large patches of damage remained forrest could appreciate how orgy ogre liked the perpetually bashable walls of the castle because it was obvious that natural terrain simply could not stand up long to an ogres presence the undergrowth gradually thinned as they progressed east because in that direction it had had less time to recover then forrest saw a hulking figure ahead that looks like an ogre sort of he said sort of imbri agreed but its insubstantial who ever heard of an insubstantial ogre but lo it was true the figure was bashing a small mountain into a molehill and they could see through its outline as well as the mountains outline what could this be its ogle imbri said surprised see those bulging eyeballs she was right the faint image was their ogre and that must be a mountain on xanth because its flat here forrest said walking through both ogre and mountain they paused to study the figure soon the ogre stopped bashing and stepped up on the top of the large molehill he had made he turned around looking in all directions then his eyes bulged and his jaw went slack he remained frozen in place hes ogling something imbri said i wonder what it is forrest walked around the figure he discovered that at the right angle he could see a reflection in one of the eyeballs it seemed to be a white square inside of which was pink material bulging in two places then forrest freaked out he found himself lying on the ground with small planets spinning above his head imbri was kneeling beside him trying to help forrest what happened he tried to speak but his mouth had not yet recovered from the freakout imbri sat on the ground picked up his head and cushioned it in her lap she stroked his forehead her soft hand passing pleasantly across his horns its all right she said just relax you dont seem to be physically hurt he finally got his tongue unfreaked how could i be in soul form he asked forrest she exclaimed youre recovering she leaned down and kissed him it was a surprisingly nice kiss and the way her soft yet resilient blouse nudged his face enhanced the effect i am getting good care he said i cant remember when ive been so comfortable she hugged him in her fashion and that bordered on delightful i was concerned you were looking at the ghost ogre and then you abruptly collapsed what did you see then he remembered i saw the reflection of what he saw what he was ogling in xanth it was i yes a panty in a window imbri dumped is head on the ground youre not supposed to look im sorry he said as he waited for another tiny planet to clear away i didnt know what it was until i saw it and it was just a reflection not the real thing well she said faintly mollified just dont do it again he sat up then made his way back to his feet the ogre was still standing like a statue i guess now we know why he was bashing down that mountain it was to make a platform so he could see something better inside that house when he saw in the window he saw a woman changing her clothing imbri finished disapprovingly suddenly the ghost ogre fell off his platform he lay on his back and ghost planets spun over his head just as they had with forrest the woman must have moved away from the window breaking the freakout view we have more than enough to report i think forrest said lets go back before cathryn runs out of story yes she said tightly she was becoming more like a woman and less like a mare in attitude as well as appearance forrest wasnt sure that was a complete improvement they left the ghost ogre to recover on his own and hurried back west they emerged just as the centaur foal was finishing and so the ogre bashed his way out of that house and never went there again and he never ate icky gruel again either yeah yeah ogle agreed we have returned forrest said both centaur and o re looked at ttiem you look as if you are recovering from a freakout cathryn said to forrest and you look as if you are recovering from awful outrage ogle said to imbri right on both counts forrest said grimly we saw the image of your xanthine self bashing a mountain into a molehill imbri continued until he could look in a window and see a panty forrest concluded ogle was amazed i ogled a panty that is correct imbri said primly it was outrageous you should be horribly ashamed ogle tried to wipe the amazement awe and delight off his puss horribly he agreed no wonder i feel so high near that border he glanced at forrest with a womendontunderstand expression forrest could only nod slightly hoping the females wouldnt catch it so now you can tell us where old ogress is cathryn said as a foal she did not seem as upset about the report as she might have been but it plainly set her back somewhat right this way ogle agreed and began tramping northwest they followed with cathryn rapidly aging and with each step her expression became firmer she was achieving adult female human perspective on the report unfortunately even though centaurs normally didnt care about human hangups forrest knew there would be no point in discussing the matter the ogre was right women just didnt understand some things maybe that was to prevent them from getting freaked out by their own apparel they passed the general vicinity of the knoll where they had met ogle and went on they entered a region of tumbled timber trees and there in a crudely fashioned pig sty was an ogress she was covered with stinking mud hey what are you doing old orgy asked im trying to make myself ugly she responded dolefully usng bad smelling mud packs maybe you dont need to be ugly these folk have a deal for you then ogle having fulfilled his part of the exchange tramped away looking at everything except the notuglyenough ogress she noticed forrest imbri and cathryn for the first time faun mareswho cares she inquired forrest leaned over the rail ot her sty how would you like to live in a castle with all the food you want and an ogre who heeds your every word and doesnt care how you look me think meoh phooey on the rhymes id love it what deeply disgusting thing do i have to do to get it just make sure your every word is praise for the ogres accomplishment in knocking down the walls so well but that comes naturally normally i have to stifle it lest i be unogressly nice come with us and well take you to castle and ogre she lurched out of the sty shedding squishes of manure lets go you dont even need to wear the mud forrest said excellent she tramped to a nearby well hauled out a huge bucket and doused herself with cold water in a moment she was wet but clean they set off for the castle out of curiosity imbri said why is it that ogle stares at attractive human women and their clothing but wants an uglier ogress i have wondered that myself said i think there is something wrong with his vision so that he thinks human women are somehow uglier than ogresses its a sad case very sad imbri agreed satisfied they reached the castle and stood at the closed door old glared at the bellweather and it immediately sounded the alarm in a moment the door opened and orgy stood there are you the ogre who so successfully bashes down walls the ogress asked yes orgy looked pleased for an ogre show me how you perform this great art i can never see enough of superior wall bashing soon it was apparent that they would get along orgy was bashing down walls at twice his prior pace and old was waxing ever more delighted in his accomplishmedt as she feasted at the well stocked table the visitors had fulfilled their service orgy paused in his bashing and pointed out through the hole in the wall he had just made fifty three of your paces straight out that way he said good fortune on your quest thank you forrest replied and the three of them stepped through the wall and started counting paces it required three paces to get beyond the castle sure enough just fifty of forrests paces out from the wall lay a glowing horn forrest picked it up and gave it to cathryn now you can show us where the faun territory is he said she considered no i think not this is merely the means to the end the exchange will not be satisfied until the end is achieved forrest sighed inwardly she was right they would have to complete that aspect before moving on still this was progress hey returned toward cathryns adult range as she was not comfortable as a juvenile they came to the comic strip there was nothing to do but plunge on in hoping to make it through without suffering permanent damage to their dignities there was a wall on it were the words punnsylvania punitentiary abandon sanity all ye who enter here we have no choice cathryn said grimly as she scrambled over how i hate the comic section forrest and imbri followed her he was used to puns in xanth but here on ptero they seemed to be festering out of control but he knew the strip wasnt deep they would soon be out of it they almost crashed into a billbored it seemed to have been fashioned from unpaid bills that had gotten bored with their inaction so had clumped together to form a sign saying boring dont touch that cathryn warned you will have to pay any bill you get but she was too late forrest had already touched a corner and a bill had stuck to his hand it formed into a face pay me it cried why should i i dont even know you because otherwise ill turn you over to a collection agency and it indicated a horrendous hooded ogre shape labeled your money or your life it held a huge bone in its paws which it snapped in half imbri burst out laughing its not funny forrest said im about to get my bones broken im not laughing at you she chortled im stuck in this arti cle he looked she was indeed caught in a bush whose twigs resembled little rs they were tickling her unmercifully it was an rtickle plant how did that happen he asked her i followed that head line she gestured back where there was a line of heads on the ground he took a step toward her but stumbled into a plant that looked like a tangle of spaghetti use your noodle it exclaimed angrily so he did he reached across and plucked a handful of rs from imbris bush here is your pay he told the bill rubbing the rs against it oh ho ho hee hee it squealed thats notha hawhat i meant then blame it on the retickle bush there thats where i got this ticklish business collectorhoo hootake care of it the bill cried as it slid off his hand the hooded ogre tramped to the bush and began pounding it with two hamfists rs flew all over soon the ogre was laughing as it flattened the bush imbri escaped but didnt manage to stop laughing im not gettinghee heetickled any more she explained its that it serves it so right they lurched away from the bushes cathryn was trying to work her way past a counter made of packed beans i cant get by this bean counter she complained a head formed from the counter of course you cant it said nothing gets by me but forrest saw something else it looked like a huge man bigger than an ogre but it was standing quite still his feet seemed to become roots and his hands sprouted coin sized mints what is that the centaur glanced at it a managemint i think she said then she brightened she plucked a mint from the tree and stuffed it into the mouth of the bean counters head take that she said with satisfaction the bean counter began to fade his beans became shriveled a vile odor of indigestion issued from him help im genuinely aging he cried thats because you ate the mint cathryn informed him now you will age rapidly into stinking extinction unless you do whatever the managemint plant demands what does it demand the bean counter asked count its mints she said but im a bean counter i dont count mints too bad i hope you fade out before your odor of spoiled beans permeates the entire neighborhood i suppose i could count some mints he said dolefully one two buckle my shoe three four then while the counter was distracted they squeezed by it and out to decent terrain they had gotten back through the comic strip without quite going crazy some day im going to gather a posse and stamp out every pun in existence cathryn muttered they went to the section where they had first met the centaur it was interesting to see her age as she walked progressing from foal to gangly juvenile to early filly and finally to fully flushed young female her mass changed but didnt seem to affect her directly she evidently didnt have to eat to add weight any more than she had had to eliminate to lose it he knew that he and imbri were aging the same amount in years but it didnt make as much difference to them then cathryn stopped are we ready for the next adventure she inquired when there was no objection she lifted the dear horn and blew on it there was no sound yet the centaur stood as if enraptured marvelous she breathed but it didnt work forrest protested she didnt even waste a glance on him you forget that only the one who blows it can hear it the echo is from that direction she pointed due east they set off east that was a relief because it was open range and ordinary trees as far as the eye could see no pun strip to struggle through but cathryn was getting young again that was mischief of another nature suppose her true love were beyond her range that would make him truly inaccessible and that was what happened the centaur grew smaller than either of them and had to pause this is near the limit of my range she said i can go farther but i wont be able to talk because i didnt learn until i was two you will have to go on without me but we cant hear the echo forrest protested you wont have to just continue in a straight line and you will encounter him he hasnt moved in some time so he may be sleeping bring him here and your service will be complete ill wait forrest exchanged a look with imbri but since it was the same look neither gained anything from it so they walked forward following the direction suppose the limit of his range is beyond hers forrest asked imbri when they were beyond the hearing of the centaur so that they can never meet i dont think the dear horn works that way she said the ideal true love has to be one you can be with i hope he hoped that was true but things were so odd here on ptero that he lacked confidence they saw an odd region to the south it was somewhat foggy but they could see a number of figures standing there like statues do you suppose her true love could be there imbri asked its not the right direction but we could ask he used a hoof to mark a line pointing the right direction so they could resume travel without going astray then walked south they entered the fog somewhat warily but it seemed to be harmless forrest approached a glowing young woman may we talk to you he asked her sure she replied thats what were here for all the people are here to be talked to imbri asked yes this is a section of limbo we are the characters who arent even mighthes im astride but what kind of existence do you have then a very feeble kind the woman said sadly we all long to achieve regular mightbe status but we cant until someone takes an interest in us and recognizes our talents imbri exchanged half a look with forrest characters who werent even mighthes if we talk to you and identify your talent will you become a mightbe forrest asked yes please do that i would do anything to become mightbereal do you need a girlfriend im rather metallic but i can be very soft when i want to be in the manner of my mothers side of the family i dont need a girlfriend im a faun i just chase nymphs no relationships last longer than a day and most are merely minutes but ill be glad to help you how do i recognize your talent you just talk with me and ask me questions until you are able to figure it out i cant tell you because i dont know it but i can tell you anything else about me how can you know about yourself if you arent yet real or even theoretical well i havent done anything of course because limbo is the place of nothing doing but every person has an origin so i have a family history i cant tell you that on my own but will do so if you ask that seemed straightforward or at least not too far angled who is your father esk ogre his father is smash ogre and his mother is tandy nymph oh you have some nymphly ancestry forrest said becoming more interested yes about a quarter so im sure i could run and scream in the nymphly way and do what nymphs do if you are interested forrest was interested can you kick your feet cutely and fling your hair about for these were specialties of nymphs and such actions really delighted fauns im sure i can hows this she flung her hair so violently that her feet left the ground and she kicked her bare legs in a fetching manner well perhaps but then he saw imbri frowning and realized that he was drifting from business he was just trying to find out about this region in case it held a clue to the whereabouts of cathryns true love who is your mother bria brassie thats where i inherit my metallic nature from shes made wholly of brass but im only half brass so i can become halfway hard but thats not my talent im also fairly strong from my ogre heritage and not too bright something connected a bulb flashed over forrests head exactly as in xanth proper i think youre mistaken astrid you are bright your talent must be shining oh she cried suddenly glowing more brightly yes thats it i know it now oh thank you faun she grabbed him and kissed him and she was right she was surprisingly soft beneath her coppery sheen im halfway real now youre welcome forrest said oh i think ill kiss you again and maybe even there is no need imbri said quickly actually forrest wouldnt have minded as he hadnt celebrated with a nymph since his arrival oil ptero but of course imbri was right they had to get on with their business so astrid ran off to find her proper territory forrest and imbri returned to the line he had drawn in the dirt to resume their quest as there didnt seem to be much help in limbo how could the folk there know about cathryns true love when they had no experience as mighthes before long they came to a small forest of normal pines it would have been better to avoid them but then they would have lost their direction so they went straight tears ran down their cheeks as they brushed by the trunks of the sad trees then they entered a gladeand there was a juvenile centaur young imbri whispered maybe eight years old so he can go forward and overlap cathryns range eight years isnt too much of an age difference yes the dear horn knew what it was doing but then he had a bad thought if this is the one it has to be we wouldnt have encountered him otherwise theres always reason for folk to meet in ptero that did seem to be the case so they approached the centaur he was standing within a circle of fourteen crosses set upright on the ground he looked out at them hey want to play crosses he asked actually we have come on a more serious matter forrest said we would prefer to talk well i want to play crosses forrest saw that this was in the nature of an exchange of services suppose we talk while we play crosses well okay i guess he sounded just like a human boy of that age which was surprising because centaurs were generally far more intelligent and adult than humans how could this be the ideal love for cathryn who was a true centaur in attitude very good forrest said though he was afraid it wasnt i am fottest faun and my companion is mare imbrium so so whats your name oh contrary that figured well contrary centaur lets play the game and talk you will have to explain the rules to me so they played the game while imbri quietly watched its like this contrary said we take turns standing inside the circle of crosses the one outside takes a cross and throws it at the one inside and he cant dodge or anything forrest was not especially pleased with this the crosses were small but what if one hit an eye it could hurt and what then thats it ends when we run out of crosses forrest remained uneasy but there was nothing for it but to play the game so he could talk he hoped that he could ascertain whether this was the correct centaur and he hoped the answer was no who starts in the circle you do youre the challenger forrest stepped into the center and stood still contrary walked around outside eyeing forrest from every angle then he pulled a cross out of the ground and threw it at forrests face if the centaur expected his target to flinch maybe forfeiting the game he was disappointed the cross struck forrest between the eyes it didnt hurt in fact it disappeared but his eyes felt funny he looked around he saw two images of the surroundings and a lot of fuzziness what had happened two young centaurs trotted up okay your turn forrest knew there was only one centaur why did he see two he made his way out of the circle as much by feel as by sight he saw two imbris sitting just far enough from the pine trees so she wouldnt cry what youre crosseyed she murmured then he caught on the cross had made him crosseyed so he couldnt properly focus on things he turned to face the centaurs he closed one eye and one image disappeared it would be harder to aim but he could do it tree fauns were good with wood so now he could throw a cross at contrary and make him crosseyed too or were there other choices he decided to experiment he pulled up a cross aimed very carefully and threw contrary did not flinch and the cross struck him on the back of the head nothing visible happened then the centaur spoke frowning what you do that for he demanded crossly it had worked now contrary was really cross i want to know something about you forrest said as he came in to exchange places do you ever go west whats it to you goat hoof the centaur demanded angrily i am merely curious you must know that you will age as you go achieving maturity why do you remain here in your youth cause i dont want to grow up contrary snapped then he hurled a cross at forrests legs it struck one knee and suddenly he was crossing his knees though he was standing it was awkward but in a moment he found he was still able to move about if he did so carefully he wobbled his way to the outside while contrary stomped crossly inside he was catching on to the game but he still didnt have all the information he wanted why dont you want to grow up he asked cause theres a stupid filly out there i dont want to meet now throw your stupid cross that sounded like cathryn forrest threw his cross at the centaurs arms it struck and disappeared and contrary uttered an illegible syllable and crossed his arms with luck he wouldnt be able to throw well why dont you want to meet her forrest asked as they exchanged places again cause i played a game of crosses for stakes with someone from the far west and he had seen my future and he told me that this stupid filly would completely change my attitude on everything and get me to liking mushy stuff and make me a responsible adult yuck so im staying right here sensibly young whats it to you and he kicked his cross with a foreleg sending it hurtling into forrests torso forrest twisted around so that his head faced the opposite way from his hoofs his body was crossed this made it even more awkward to stand but he was still able to walk moving his kneecrossed legs backward he was coming to the conclusion that he didnt really like this game at least now he knew the problem the llvenile centaur didnt want to grow up so he was able in the unique environment of ptero to avoi d adulthood because time was geography and the creatures had freedom of geography as an adult in love with a responsible centaur filly he would become a responsible citizen children of any species lacked the experience to appreciate the qualities and satisfactions of maturity so how could he persuade the errant juvenile to approach his later life meanwhile he was reaching the outside and contrary was inside where should he throw his next cross would the centaur quit playing if struck on the ear would that prevent him from hearing forrest wasnt sure but decided to try it he just wanted to finish this game so he could recover his faculties and consult with imbri maybe she would have a notion how to get contrary into his adult territory he oriented carefully and threw his next cross at the centaurs ear he scored but nothing seemed to happen how are you doing he asked contrary looked the opposite way where are you so that was the effect the centaur was crosseared and heard things crossed so that sounds seemed to come from the opposite direction look away from my voice he said contrary turned around oh yeah he said crossly crossed hearing i should have remembered well get ready because ill really get you with the next one forrest didnt like the sound of that but had to go back into the circle they had used up only six of the crosses this game had a long way to go unfortunately contrary hurled his cross it struck forrest on the chest right over the heart the feeling was strange but not bad it wasnt making his heart malfunction so what was the point i crossed your heart the centaur said with satisfaction now you have to tell the truth l always tell the truth forrest said annoyed not this way tell me your most embarrassing experience i dont have to do that yes you do now talk and he found that he did have to do it his crossed heart compelled him the thing he hated most to confess this game had abruptly gotten worse i was in my tree when a flock of harpies passed he said they were noxious creatures with the heads and breasts of women and the bodies of birds and foul of aspect and language they liked to soil the leaves and branches of my tree with their droppings and snatch away sandals for which they had no use they just dropped them in the nearest bog so i did my best to drive them off throwing sticks and stones at them i didnt try to curse them because no one has a mouth as fowl as a harpy they love to indulge in swearing contests and can make an ogre blush with a bad series of expletives they were just out for mischief and i just wanted to be rid of them then i heard a maidenly scream the dirty birds had gotten hold of a nymph and were dragging her away i leaped from my tree and ran to her rescue beating off the clustered harpies they cursed me so villainously that the nearby foliage wilted and my poor ears turned bright red but i rescued her and the harpies flew away screeching imprecations youll be sorry the last one cried as she flapped skyward eanwhile the nymph was excruciatingly grateful my hero she cried throwing her fair arms about me and kissing me ardently naturally i returned the favors and proceeded to that celebration for which fauns and nymphs are justly known she was unusually eager to complete the celebration and i assumed it was because of her joy at her deliverance from the horrors of capture by the harpies so it was an even more delightful experience than usual she kissed me repe atedly seeming unable to get enough even after the culmination but at last she relaxed and i made ready to return to my tree but then i saw that the harpies had returned and utterly befouled it their stinking manure drenched every branch and the leaves were wilting and the sandals were rotting my brief distraction had allowed them free access and they had taken full advantage of it i looked back at the nymph and saw that she was changing form she was not a true nymph she had been changed by a spell of illusion and now was revealing her real nature she was a harpy herself one of the filthy flock hee heee heeee she screeched as she spread her dirty wings which had only seemed like arms and flapped away i was sick not only had i failed to protect my tree from befowlment i had celebrated with a noxious harpy hen they had tricked me doubly and made me as squalid as my tree of course i went to work cleaning the tree with buckets of water i hauled from a nearby spring the job took days and it was weeks before the smell faded but i couldnt similarly clean myself and thereafter that harpy hen would flap by and chortle at me reminding me of my folly it took me half a century to live down that humiliation and i hoped no one would ever again hear of it forrest stopped talking he had done what he had to do telling his deepest shame because of the compulsion of the cross which would not be denied it wasnt your fault imbri said they tricked you ill tell everyone contrary exclaimed what a great story there was definitely something about this juvenile centaur that forrest didnt like so this time he threw his cross at contrarys mouth it worked the centaur brat got so tongue twisted that he couldnt speak at all intelligibly i think im ready to quit this game forrest said getting a reasonably smart notion dont you agree contrary fftbbabbleughh thats what i thought then we are agreed this game is done at that point his body untwisted and the missing crosses returned to their places in the circle thats not what i said contrary protested oh it sounded like it to me i suppose well have to play another game then you bet and this time ill play to win but not crosses forrest said i have a better game in mind there is no better game than crosses yes there is lets have a contest to see who can free more folk in limbo but there arent any penalties so thats no fun they just run off to their territories we can make our own penalties if you lose you must come with us west until you reach age thirty but i told you i dont go into the green i stay here in the yellow thats why its a good penalty you really dont want to do it because you know that filly might catch you and make you disgustingly adult and responsible yeah a horrible fate and of course you might escape it if you can run back east fast enough you dont have to do anything there just go and touch the spot where you are thirty yeah then i can close my eyes and gallop back into the from before the fatal female shows up then he glanced cannily at forrest but whats your penalty if you lose forrest gulped a day of playing crosses with you a year a week a month forrest yielded to horrible necessity a month done lets go play then he paused again but how will we know who wins well take turns questioning limbo folk whoever guesses more talents so as to free more folk wins but what if we miss if one of us misses he loses a point then the other can question that same person and if he succeeds he wins a point a two point advantage wins the contest contrary remained canny seeking the catch how much time to question each i mean someone might not be able to guess so he would just keep asking questions indefinitely good point we need a timer theres some baby hourglasses growing nearby we can harvest one that goes for five minutes agreed when its sand runs out time is done lets go ill really enjoy tromping you at crosses for a month straight i hope you know what youre doing imbri murmured as they went to harvest a minute glass if you get stuck for a month youll be too late returning to your tree i know but we have to get him into her range ill just have to make sure to win the contest they reached the hourglasses which were actually the fruits of a large thyme plant they were in all sizes from two seconds to several days contrary plucked one of the smallest this should do for three minutes how do you know see its got the number on it he held up the little timer and sure enough there was a on it then they went to the section of limbo which wasnt far away who goes first forrest asked the centaur considered trying to figure out where the advantage was the one who went first might win and be aheador might lose and be behind the confidence of youth won ill go first as you wish they entered the fog how do we decide which one to start with contrary asked each of you choose the subjects for the other imbri suggested both centaur and faun were startled by the notion then both agreed it made a certain sense so forrest got to choose for contrary he saw a number of statues it seemed that they werent allowed to speak until spoken to maybe that was what gave them their first suggestion of potential reality one was a halfway handsome young man of almost princely mien forrest shrugged and indicated that one contrary approached the figure hi you whats your name as he spoke imbri set down the minute glass and its sand began sifting to the lower section the figure came to life i am crescendo whose son are you i am the son of prince dolph and princess electra that startled forrest because he knew only of the twins dawn eve but he realized that a given set of parents could have additional childrenand in any event the folk here were merely mighthes who might never actually be delivered to xanth parents there could be hundreds of such children there might be no limit whats your talent contrary asked it was a clever try but it didnt work i regret i dont know it if i did i wouldnt be here is there anything about your ancestry that would suggest your talent yes all the descendants of bink my great grandfather have magician caliber talents so i must be a magician but thats just a matter of opinion isnt it theres no way to be sure how a given talent will be judged true but mine should be a good one forrest watching began to get a notion that name crescendo sounded like growing force or something musical when he played his panpipes he sometimes crescendoed could this persons talent be associated with music your name sounds like a word contrary remarked to what does it apply as a word i wouldnt know why wouldnt you know i dont know is it because it relates to your talent i cant say if it doesnt relate to your talent you ought to know so it must relate to powerful music why i suppose so the figure said surprised forrest saw that crescendo had not been able to think of that himself but could see it now that it had been suggested by an outside party can you play music i dont know contrary looked at forrest may i borrow your panpipes forrest hesitated but realized that it would not be fair to interfere he dug out his panpipes and handed them over as he did so a piece of paper fluttered away in the breeze it must have been stuck to the panpipes contrary in turn handed the pipes to crescendo play this the pipes began to play beautiful panpipe music but crescendo wasnt playing them he was just holding them they were playing themselves contrary took the pipes back and returned them to forrest then he picked up a stone play this crescendo took the stone and it immediately played rock music contrary gave him a cup of water and it made water music he gave him a handful of air and it made air music crescendos talent was coming c lear you have the talent of touching anything and making it make music contrary said thats must be close to magician level considering the beauty and power of the music yes crescendo exclaimed and suddenly the very ground around him was playing earth music thats it oh thank you what can i do for you in return for enabling me to become halfway real the centaur considered but imbri intervened he has done you a service already by giving you a point oh yeah contrary agreed remembering depart crescendo you are free the man needed no further urging he took off at a run for wherever his territory was forrest realized that the geographytime effect must be suspended for the limbo folk until they took their places where they belonged bit by bit he was learningthe devious ways of the idea planet but now it was his turn contrary walked among the statues and stopped by one that looked much like the last this he told forrest imbri turned the minute glass over and the sand started sifting forrest addressed the figure who are you and what is your lineage it was best to be efficient so as to conserve time for more questions i am revy son of magician grey and sorceress ivy another magician then powerful magic should be easier to guess as it was more comprehensive still this wasnt easy so he borrowed a device the centaur had employed does your name suggest your talent i cant answer that he was getting warm what could revy mean revered that didnt seem quite like a talent revelry again it didnt seem apt reverse aha could your talent be to reverse things it could that helped can you make hot things cold no interesting a talent couldnt be confirmed but it could be denied if wrong noit could be confirmed the centaur had done so it was just necessary to find the right thing to confirm can you reverse the flow of a river no hm this was trickier than anticipated revy could probably reverse something but not ordinary things how could it be a magician caliber talent if it was so limited unless can you reverse magic itself yes revy exclaimed with happy realization my father can nullify magic so i can reverse it he prevents magic from happening i can send it in the opposite direction good for you forrest said well satisfied go find your range thank you the man ran off youre welcome forrest murmured he hoped he was getting the hang of this but now he had to select another candidate for the centaur what might be tough enough for contrary to miss but easy enough for forrest to get he wasnt sure so he looked for something differentand found a demon child the figure was male with small horns and looked about five years old of course apparent age didnt matter much because of the timegeography factor still this one might do this contrary approached the child who are you and what is your derivation i am demos and i am the son of prince demon vore and princess nada naga xanths most handsome couple also the brother of demonica who had the undeserved fortune to make it to xanth instead of me so you are not a descendant of bink the centaur remarked of who never mind demons generally dont have magic talents other than their demonly qualities and neither do the naga folk because they can already shift from full human to full serpent to their natural combination form so you may not have an actual talent oh but i do im sure of it i just dont know what it is curses the centaur muttered then it could be anything yes i hope you can discover it the centaur considered as the sand ran through the minute glass could it relate to the changeability of your parents yes ha so you can change yourself oh sure to human or naga or serpent form or any other because of my half demon heritage that doesnt count contrary muttered disappointed a magic talent isnt quite that way can you affect other things with your magic i wouldnt know the centaur pondered again forrest saw the sand running low unfortunately he couldnt figure this one out either can you take magic away from things no then can you give magic to things yes that meant he was suddenly very close the centaur oriented on it with greater precision than he had shown thus far can you make a nonmagic object in some way magic yes i like for example a candlestick could you imbue it with the power to burn without using up its wax yes thats it i can do that contrary looked surprised then relieved forrest realized that he had been guessing more desperately than was apparent and had been lucky but now it was forrests turn to guess the centaur walked among the statues and selected a boy with a fishs tail this then there was a sound overhead they all looked up oh no imbri exclaimed the dragons are back dragons contrary asked who stirred them up i think we did forrest said when we were headed for ogre country well get rid of them then forrest thought of something imbri can you diffuse to dream form and plant a thought in their minds yes but what thought would distract them from us maybe if you gave them something else to chase like a wild goose dragons like to eat geese because they dont like getting goosed she agreed so they try to eat the geese first its a personal thing ill see what i can do she expanded fading into mist as her density decreased the dragons had been drawing up their formation about to go into strafing mode suddenly they hesitated then they winged rapidly away imbri had given them a dream of wild geese on the wing soon imbri reappeared condensing into her small human form that should hold them a while but we had better not dally because i wont be able to distract them that way again forrest approached the figure contrary had designated as imbri set the minute glass again who are you and what is your derivation i am nigel son of prince naldo naga and mela merwoman i dont know of your parents what are their qualities my father is a prince of the naga folk who are a serpenthuman crossbreed whose natural form is a serpent with a human head my mother is a humanfish crossbreed like a mermaid only better developed in front and able to turn her tail into legs so she can walk on land there was some notoriety when she was advised to put on clothing so she went to a pantree and harvested a panty and freaked out every male she encountered oh that one news of her did penetrate my corner of the forest so does your talent relate to either of your parents natural abilities such as changing from human to serpent or fish form no is it a minor talent of the spot on the wall variety no forrest was getting the hang of this the folk of limbo knew what their talents werent so it was the fast way to zero in on what they were is it a major talent magician class no then it must be a significant talent neither major nor minor i wouldnt know uhhuh does it relate to yourself no does it relate to objects no does it relate to other people i wouldnt know forrest paused does it relate to anything other than other people no he was definitely developing technique but he saw the sand running low in the minute glass he needed to identify the talent readily does it affect other people i wouldnt know does it change their mood no does it change their appearance nigel hesitated im not sure now that was interesting a qualified response but the sand was almost out and he had to get it in the next couple of questions does it change their nature yes can it heal them no hurt them maybe the last gasp of sand was going he had only one more chance what would change appearance without necessarily healing or hurting so he took a halfway wild guess can it change their age yes i can rejuvenate others and there he had it as the sand ran out it had been a close call hey you cheated contrary protested looking at the minute glass what are you talking about you got an extra minute forrest looked at the glass it now had the number on it four minutes how had that happened imbri had the answer we moved westtoward the to so we got a little olderand so did the minute glass so its bigger the centaur nodded yeah i guess so maybe i got an extra minute too okay forrest looked for another subject he needed to find one that would stymie the centaur because otherwise he would be stymied himself all too soon he found a reasonably pretty young woman it was a foolish notion but maybe a woman would be trouble for contrary who was trying to avoid meeting a filly centaur this contrary approached the woman what is your name and heritage i am scintilla my father is crony and my mother is vendetta they dont get along too well so im not sure theyll ever get around to signaling the stork to deliver me too bad the centaur said without sympathy does your talent relate to your name no the centaur continued to question her establishing that her talent affected herself rather than others but not in any obvious way indeed it was not obvious to contrary who finally ran out of time without establishing her talent unfortunately forrest was no better does your talent help you or others not usually does it hurt anyone sometimes does it annoy you or anyone else sometimes does it do anything physical not really mental possibly emotional perhaps these indefinite answers were balking forrest just as they had balked contrary he was unable to center on any particular talent and time ran out for him too the worst of it was they couldnt even admit defeat and ask for the correct answer just to satisfy their curiosity they were left to their infuriating ignorance whose turn is it to pick the next forrest asked you picked the last now its my turn he scouted around looking for a winner for him this it was a rather hairy old man forrest wondered about the variation in age among the folk of limbo as they were all merely potential beings shouldnt they be ageless but maybe they could be any age they chose until they reached their territories when they could control their age by moving around forrest approached him as imbri set down the timer who are you and what is your parentage i am hugh mongus son of scab and svelte does your talent affect others in a manner does it affect you that depends this promised to be another frustrating interview forrest soon established that the talent didnt affect anything physical but might affect something mental how do others feel about it that depends depends on what on how they feel about it forrest suppressed his annoyance because he didnt have time for emotion his glass was sifting sand but no matter how he tried he could never pin mongus down and finally he ran out of time contrary aware that he could win the contest by getting this one did his best but the subject was just as balky for him does your talent affect inanimate things that depends depends on what the centaur asked in much the tone forrest had found himself using on your definition of inanimate you dont know what the word means i know what it means then give me your definition anything that isnt living or moving very well does your talent affect anything that isnt living or moving that depends depends on what on how you see it i see it the way you do does it affect anything that isnt living hugh considered yes i think it does good does it affect any living thing that depends confound it cant you say anything else not if you dont ask a more relevant question the centaur seemed about to swell up to adult size but then his time ran out this candidate too had defeated both of them now it was forrests turn to choose again he spied a gnome woman did gnomes have talents this contrary approached her as imbri set down the timer what is your name and ancestry i am miss gnomer of respectable but anonymous gnome stock miss no more ino miss gnome ino the centaur looked a bit nettled understandably well whatever your name is do you have a magic talent yes does it affect you yes does it affect others iyes i does it affect things ino does it help anyone no does it hurt anyone no contrary paused it is indifferent to the welfare of anyone iyes is it under your conscious control no is it apparent to others sometimes when i cant answer that is it like a spot on the wall no the centaur paused again his time was running out and he was getting nowhere forrest was stumped too does it please anyone no does it displease anyone no confound it woman it has to be one or the other does it contrary scratched his head trying to think of a definitive question time imbri announced showing the exhausted minute glass dam the centaur swore he had lost another giving forrest another chance to win forrest tackled the subject as imbri turned over the glass since he had no idea how to proceed he tackled a minor irritation exactly what is your name miss gnomer miss nomare no can you spell it no forrest began to get a glimmering does your talent relate to your name yes is it that it is unspellable no so you cant spell it because that would reveal your talent maybe miss gnoma he said but realized that he had gotten it wrong again miss gnome still not right then a light bulb flashed is it that no one gets your name right yes she cried with realization misnomer that must be very frustrating no i am used to it may i go now yes of course then as the woman departed forrest realized that he had gotten two points ahead and won all because he had tried to get the name straight and failed he looked at contrary you must go to your age thirty dam the centaur repeated glumly i should have guessed that talent this was a tougher game than i anticipated forrest said it was just luck that i won its just luck when any ordinary creature beats a centaur well lets head west but then the dragons reappeared there was something about their flight formation that looked angry we had better hurry imbri said i cant fool them again so they ran west trying to find cover under stray boulders or trees but the dragons werent fooled they oriented and prepared to dive down on their victims contrary unslung his bow run for cover ill hold them off you cant stop a whole flight of dragons forrest protested true but i can delay them i am older and stronger now go indeed he was now about twelve they had come several years to he seemed to have matured somewhat in attitude too forrest hesitated not wanting to desert the centaur but what else could he do then he had half a notion maybe there would be a hint on the good magicians list of words he dug into his knapsack but couldnt find it oh nothat must have been the paper that had fluttered away when he took out his panpipe whats the matter imbri asked aside from the dragons i lost the good magicians list of words she looked stricken but she tried to put a good face on it well get through without it he hoped so they were really on their own now the centaur fired an arrow upward it would have been a remarkable shot for anyone but a centaur it struck the lead dragon on the snout pinning it closed the dragon huffed and puffed but couldnt dislodge the barb and weewawed out of control the flight of dragons followed their leader making a crazy display as they all weewowed across the sky huffing and puffing then another dragon caught on flying dragons were not known for their intelligence because the heat of their fire tended to fry their lightweight brains but they had some experience with injuries the other dragon took the end of the arrow between its teeth and hauled it out that freed the leader who cauterized its wounds with fire then resumed the chase meanwhile the fugitives had run farther west and had a lead but the dragons quickly caught up again and there was still no cover so forrest took his turn he brought out his panpipes and played a military melody reveille the dragons were militaristic creatures they heard the music and immediately fell into formation for review then forrest played a marching tune and the dragons proceeded to march across the sky their wingbeats keeping perfect step then the leader who had been a bit distracted by the fresh holes in its snout realized what was happening it roared drowning out the melody the dragons milled about then oriented once again on the targets but the desperate fugitives had made further progress westand caught up to cathryn centaur who had cut south to intercept them she was about five years old at this point with cute pigtails and a toy bow and quiver her white wings too small at this age to enable her to fly were folded forming a kind of cloak over her body contrary now thirteen glanced at her with disdain go away twirp i have no interest in you she stared at him you mean youre the one my supposed ideal mate a wingless landbound creature what a laugh for sure brat now get out of the way before you get toasted and gobbled by a dragon dont quarrel you two forrest cried can you help cath ryn i think so theres a forest just north of us run to that for cover she turned to show the way her little hoofs galloping swiftly the dragons will follow the sound of our hoofs and close in on us anyway contrary sneered but he turned to follow her and for rest and imbri ran along behind the dragons wheeled in air and looped around to cut them off but the fugitives had just enough time and reached the cover of the edge of the forest just ahead of the first blast of fire they turned west to go into the center of the wood cathryn raised her hands as if throwing something whats the matter twirp contrary demanded giving up already dont worry in a mo his voice cut off forrest looked afraid something had happened but the centaur was still running and still talking his mouth was moving but no sound was emerging what had happened then a dreamlet voice came n his head cathryn threw a blanket of silence imbri explained now the dragons cant hear us they cant track us by sound and with the cover of the trees the dragons couldnt track them by sight either now the four of them could make good their escape cathryns remarkable talent was really helping but there were harpies in this forest the dirty birds came flapping down intent on mischief there were so many of them that there was no way to avoid them cathryn now a size larger at age six raised her hands drawing in her blanket suddenly the harpies became audible weve got you you s one was screeching well poop your faces id rather face the dragons contrary muttered so would i forrest agreed one of the harpies looked a lot like the one who had tricked him a century ago though of course she couldnt be the same one cathryn made a motion as of throwing something toward the harpies it was another blanket but it was hard to see it spread out and surrounded them with a fine sparkling net at that point their cursing was silenced but it hadnt ceased they were all screeching worse than ever it just wasnt getting out i threw a blankety blanket cathryn explained now their cussing is reflecting back on themselves and smirching their own feathers indeed provocative symbols were appearing of lightning strikes corkscrews exploding cherry bombs asterisks and stars they were striking the harpies who were screeching worse than ever as they felt themselves tagged by their own expletives this only intensified the problem scorch marks were appearing on their tail feathers you can do that to harpies contrary asked amazed thats not bad gee thanks little cathryn said blushing that reminded contrary of his objection to her he shut up so as not to let slip any other compliment the four ran on by leaving the harpies to their fate but now the dragons could hear them again for the blanket of silence was gone cathryn could throw only one blanket at a time still she had really helped them to move along imbri ran beside cathryn im sure hes much more mature when hes adult he has already shown some beginning signs of centaur decency but the wings he has no wings nevertheless i think he is the one maybe we can verify it with the dear horn cathryn nodded as they ran she lifted the horn and blew on it forrest heard nothing but the filly nodded again it echoes from him it must know imbri said i suppose but the filly seemed anything but certain the dragons were reorienting on their sounds but now cathryn had to draw in her last blanket because she couldnt maintain it at a distance and the harpies were escaping too they were horrendously furious wait till we catch up with you their fowlmouthed leader cried well tear you to quivering stinking bits a dragon swooping down to spy out the fugitives heard it roared it thought she was screeching at the dragons soon several more dragons came swooping down ready to avenge their honor dragons and harpies didnt get along too well together at the best of times and the dragons were in no mood to be insulted so they shot fire first and saved the questions for later but the harpies were in no mood to brook interference either and this was their forest forrest and the others ran on not staying to watch the developing fray but they heard the roars and curses as it worked its way into something the forest would probably remember for a long time they emerged from the forest they were at this point a fair distance west and contrary was a stallion in his twenties readily taking the lead cathryn followed now coming into her teens her wings had grown and she was using them to add to her forward velocity then came forrest and imbri they had been running for some time but forrest didnt feel really tired apparently soulbodies didnt fatigue the same way physical ones did so while the centaurs had to hold back somewhat to keep from leaving the two more human figures behind it remained a fast pace contrary put on a spurt and came to a line marked stepped across it and stopped he was now a fine mature figure of a centaur muscular and handsome there is my mark he said i have crossed it now i must flee before i get trapped he turned as the others were catching up cathryn drew to a halt they knew this was the turning point in a second way if the stallion passed her and escaped back to his childhood she would never see him again but how could she stop him contrary took a step back forrest saw that the centaurs eyes were closed he was refusing to look at the filly so that was how he proposed to avoid the dread confrontation if he never saw her in her mature aspect he couldnt be impressed by her look at me cathryn cried you owe me that much i think no i dont contrary retorted i made a deal to cross my thirtieth year that was all he took another step what can i do the filly asked defeat looming kiss him imbri said succinctly cathryn smiled ill give him fair warning then she called to the stallion if you dont open your eyes and look at me ill intercept you and kiss you contrary took another step cathryn took two steps she could travel faster with her eyes open than he could do safely with his eyes closed the stallion heard her hoofbeats which she was taking pains to make loud his fine centaur mind processed that information and he realized that he would have to compromise very well one look then im gone and you cant interept me agreed but i will throw one blanket at you he laughed a blanket of silence do your worst foal forrest realized that the stallion had not gotten a good look at her since the forest and retained a mental picture of her as six or seven that was an understandable but foolish error contrary faced cathryn and opened his eyes his jaw dropped slightly forrest looked at the filly to see what the stallion saw she was now a lovely fullbreasted longmaned whitewinged centaur filly with a deep brown hide and flowing tail she was panting slightly with her recent exertion if she had been a nymph she would have been stunningly attractive she was surely similar for a centaur then she threw a blanket again forrest didnt see it directly but the scintillation of the air indicated that there was something flying toward the stallion it reached his head contrary blinked his eyes lost focus whats this he asked confused a blanket stare cathryn said a blank stare i dont understand that is its effect why are you fleeing me he looked at her again im drawing a blank on that is there some reason there may be why dont you blow this horn she stepped forward offering it to him he looked puzzled what horn is this it will show you by its sound where your true love is he frowned is that a challenge is it he took the horn and blew it hard there was no soundbut then he stared at cathryn in a new way you are the one he said in wonder you really are the one i will sacrifice anything for you but now it was cathryn who wasnt sure if only you could fly she said regretfully who said i cant fly and suddenly from his body two massive black wings unfolded what they had taken for his body color was actually the hue of the flattened wings i never had use for them before for they would only have taken me where i didnt want to go but now i want to fly with you you fantastic creature forsaking my prior childishness now it was cathryns jaw that dropped the dear horn did know she breathed it really did contrary dropped the horn come fly with me my sudden love we have more than geography to explore oh yes but first i must guide my friends to the territory of the fauns or as close as i can get to it we will do it together he said graciously and to hurry it up we had better give them a ride there yes cathryn agreed little hearts were forming around her head she was falling in love forrest picked up the dear horn and put it in his knapsack then he climbed onto contrary behind the huge wings and imbri mounted cathryn its funny to ride an equine she said im equine myself the faun region is to cathryn said i dont know whether its within my range but ill do my best to give you good directions if it isnt the two centaurs galloped west then they spread their wings and leaped into the air surprising forrest this was indeed faster he saw the ground passing rapidly behind but as they gained elevation the ground became smaller and passed behind more slowly as if annoyed at being neglected the mixed fields and forests gave way to mixed mountains and valleys and then to mixed ponds and islands the landscape seemed to be just as varied here as it was on xanth after a time the two centaurs glided back to land were getting a bit old for this contrary explained then forrest saw that the creatures hide had become mottled with age he was now nearing the old end of his life and was slowing down forrest looked across at cathryn and saw she had aged too they had come a long way in a short time then the centaurs stopped this appears to be my limit contrary said i dont want to become so feeble that i fall forrest hastily dismounted and so did imbri they were in rolling country and ahead oh dread was a comic strip the faun territory is farther away than i thought cathryn said with regret but i can tell you who can take you farther the human princess twins dawn eve continue straight to until you come to castle roogna and seek them out but we are already in castle roogna imbri said ptero is a moon circling princess idas head perhaps in that larger frame but it is here too and this is the one you need we have set you due from it so you cant miss it if you stay on course and if you return this way send a signal and we will come to pick you up again thank you forrest said he realized that cathryn really had been a big help they had learned a whole lot about ptero in her company ohone more thing she said you have been more than accommodating in our exchange of services and i have not been able to complete my exchange service adequately so i feel i should provide you with something extra here is one of my blankets that a passing magician obligingly canned for me she held out a small tin can but i thought you had to invoke your spells yourself and that they fade after a while true but this canned spell is special thanks to the preservative properties of the can you may invoke it at any time simply by saying invoke while holding it before you it is a blanket of obscurity scurity imbri asked what effect does that have it makes you unlikely to be noticed the centaur explained it wears off after an hour but you can invoke it again thereafter it takes the same time to recharge an hour so dont try to invoke two blankets at once i realize that this isnt much but i have nothing better to give you please accept it with my thanks for your assistance to me i of course forrest said moved by her gesture im sure it will be useful if we have to pass by a monster thank you you are most welcome cathryns old eyes were bright it seemed she had appreciated their association then he and imbri turned to the west for the next leg of their journey it was bound to be an adventure of its own o either side they could see nice solid land but straight west was a bog it was tempting to deviate but then they might lose the line to castle roogna so they went straight ahead splashing into the shallow water forrest hoped that the puns would not be too bad this time fortunately the land soon rose up restoring their firm footing but no sooner had they set foot and hoof on it when two odd birds marched up who are you the birds demanded in unison we are visitors from afar in search of castle roogna forrest answered we are named forrest and imbrium we are a pair o keets the birds answered peet and deet welcome to canary island they didnt look much like canaries to forrest being more like small parrots but he didnt comment on that thank you we hope just to cross it quickly and go on our way do that we dont like landbound folk to stay long with that the two birds marched on they came to a tree it was huge and globular with feathery leaves and it was right in their way the trouble was it was also astride the only feasible path leading due west to the south was a section of what looked a lot like slow sand which would take forever to cross and to the north was a similar patch of what looked like quicksand which had risks of its own i wish we could just go right through this tree forrest said maybe we can climb over it imbri said then the tree opened a huge round eye that was followed by a second eye and a beak just below it that they had taken for a broken off limb hooo it hooted its an owl forrest exclaimed a huge owl an owl tree imbri agreed then the owl spread its wings and took off well this is canary island forrest said bemused we have to expect birds even if they arent all canaries several white birds flew overhead their bodies were in the shape of the letter c cgulls imbri said identifying them a ball of blackness approached forrest paused not sure whether it was dangerous but then he saw it was in the shape of a bird of prey oh its just a night hawk he said he stepped aside to let it pass then stepped back onto the path when the light returned but another bird flew up what a weird set of characters it said eyeing them you are absolutely laughable haw haw haw and a mockingbird imbri said one of the more obnoxious avians but harmless they ignored the mockingbird and of course that discomfited it so that it flew away but another bird flew in to perch before them what are you fools doing here it demanded harshly you dont belong here go away go away we are only crossing the island forrest explained you are polluting it with your foul presence the bird raved get off our land go away go away the bird continued to shout at them going on and on now i recognize it imbri said its a raveon then a harpy appeared dripping wet she smelled terrible youre one of the canaries forrest asked surprised im a waterfoul she answered i should have known he said hurrying by they passed a large trunk a bird was pecking a big hole in it the moment it spied them it flew to a branch above them and pecked a shower of sawdust and bits of bark so that they were dirtied hey what are you doing forrest demanded annoyed for answer a smelly bird dropping came down just missing his head thats a peccadillo imbri said a bad mannered pecker then there was the melodious cry of a lady bird to the north and the peccadillo flew off to have something to do with her they especially like the ladies imbri explained with what might possibly have been the hint of a smirk at last they got off canary island and the edge of the comic strip was there so that they returned to regular land i can see why not many folk care to cross the boundaries forrest said those puns dont really hurt you but theyre annoying as anything i understand that some folk like them imbri said who would like anything like that mundanes maybe mundania is a strange repressed place it must be to have folk who like such junk the new region was hilly and it was impossible to keep to a straight line west but they oriented as well as they could returning to the correct direction and compensating for their deviations hoping they were close enough to find the castle they were rewarded they crested a ridge and there in a colorful valley below was a picturesque castle there it is forrest said relieved imbri wasnt so sure that doesnt look like castle roogna things are different here on ptero maybe the castles are different too maybe she agreed doubtfully they trekked on down the slope and reached the bowlshaped valley where the castle stood the trees closed in around them each a distinct color brown including the leaves green including the trunk yellow blue or white they were pretty but so thick that the castle was now hidden with no clear path then forrest noticed that one white tree had a brown trunk it was comparatively normal he went to that tree and spied a blue tree with a brown trunk between them ran a straight brown path this must be the route he said so they followed the path it turned at right angles then turned again refusing to be rounded but it stayed between the brown trunked trees so they followed it despite its constant square turns and in due course it brought them to the bank of the square moat around the castle from this vantage the castle was much larger than it had seemed from afar it had massive white stone walls red roofs and three squared towers rising above the second story the drawbridge was up and the moat was deep there seemed to be no way in this seems less like castle roogna forrest admitted the landscape is different and theres no princess in blue jeans to greet us its the good magicians castle imbri exclaimed its always different and always a challenge to get into three challenges he agreed remembering so we did go astray and came to the wrong castle im not surprised the path across canary island was somewhat crooked and there were distractions then we had to guess at the direction when we passed the hills i suppose well just have to retrace our steps and try to find the right direction they turnedbut now the magic path was gone the forest had closed in solidly behind them forrest had experience with trees and could see immediately that these ones had no intention of allowing them to pass back through brambles thorns stickers nettles and sharp pointed plants festooned the region between trees it was a one way path lmbri said i should have thought of that im not used to being solid i should have thought of it too forrest said ruefully im supposed to relate well to trees well well just have to ask the good magician the way to castle roogna forrest eyed the moat does that mean well have to get through three challenges and pay a years service she nodded im afraid it does unless we can talk him into letting us through without all that well he didnt charge me before im still not sure why imbri looked thoughtful but didnt comment so they addressed the challenge of getting into the castle there was no sign of a moat monster but they didnt trust that so forrest experimented he picked up a pebble and flipped it into the smooth water enormous teeth snapped out of the water and caught the pebble before it splashed then the water was still again it had happened so quickly that he wasnt sure he had actually seen it but he concluded that swimming would not be a good idea we might dissolve into floating souls and condense again on the other side imbri suggested im not sure thats in order i think we should stay with the rules of this realm while we are in it i suppose so i suppose dissolving into vapor might count the same as getting crunched by an ogre and prevent us from returning to within half a year of this spot that too he agreed he had actually been thinking of the ethics of it assuming there were any physically it seemed possible after all she had dissolved to send the dragons their distracting dream but it seemed unwise to tempt the limits he couldnt reach the drawbridge from this side so couldnt cross that way the moat looked way too deep to fill in even if he had a shovel and the bank seemed too solid to dig anyway but if this was like the castle in xanth there would be a way he simply had to find it he looked around there was a brief cleared area around the moat before the trees socked in tightly there was room to walk so he walked around the larger square to see what he could see imbri walked with him i never had to worry about moats she said apologetically i just trotted across them being insubstantial she looked at the nearest tree i dont suppose you could cut down a tree to make a bridge or raft cut down a tree he asked horrified a living tree i could never do that i am a tree protector sorry i wasnt thinking but maybe if there is some deadwood that would be fine but i dont see any neither do i but whats that over there he looked an upsidedown bush someone must have pulled it out maybe we can help it they went to the bush which was in an embarrassing predicament its roots were in the air and its leaves halfway buried in the ground though it was a living plant forrest lifted it carefully and set it down the right way up while imbri used her hands to scrape dirt in around its base but the moment forrest let go the bush flipped over spraying dirt and was upside down again they contemplated this phenomenon it cant live and grow that way forrest said its a regular plant it needs earth on its roots and sun on its leaves what would make it reverse itself like that reverse he murmured an idea homing in on him then he lifted the plant up again dig down deep there may be a piece of reverse wood there imbri dug in the earth and in a moment found it a fair sized stick she set it on the ground and the green grass turned red in its vicinity then she dug out a place for the bush and forrest set it in she packed the earth around it and this time it stayed put im sure it will be more comfortable now forrest said satisfied you really do have a feeling for plants imbri said yes it comes from associating so long with a tree i dont like to see green growing things abused thats why im on this quest after all yes she looked thoughtful again well have to put this reverse wood where it wont do any more mischief forrest said he picked up the wood it didnt affect him because he had no magic talent to reverse of course reverse wood was funny stuff sometimes it did reverse things in unexpected ways then another notion hovered around his head imbrido you suppose there could be any magic in that water magic she asked blankly lets find out he tossed the stick into the water in front of the lifted drawbridge then water quivered then solidified it wasnt frozen just solid forrest set one foot on it then the other the water was now like ground its natural liquidity had been reversed in this section imbri joined him you solved it she exclaimed i would never have thought of that i almost didnt he admitted but usually things are as they are for a reason at least around the good magicians castle im glad the reverse wood didnt turn the water into fire they reached the inner bank but the drawbridge remained up and its planks blocked off the main entrance so they walked to the left which had the green haze of to and rounded the corner of the castle there was an odd procession of people garbed in black several of them were carrying a large long and evidently heavy box which was closed what is this forrest asked perplexed by the scene i think i know imbri said its a funeral a funeral who died i dont know but that looks like a coffin i dont want to get mixed up in death then this must not be the right way they backed off and went into the yellow haze of from they rounded that corner there was an amazing assemblage of big white longlegged birds storks imbri exclaimed identifying them what are they doing here same thing the funeral is doing here forrest suggested when we walked around outside the moat i didnt see either they appeared after we crossed the moat its another challenge it must be a challenge she agreed but a strange one what are we supposed to do with either a funeral or a group of storks i wonder there must be something do you suppose we could question them i suppose we could try they will cooperate to exactly the extent they are supposed to so they stepped around and hailed the nearest stork will you talk with us forrest inquired sorry dont have time im too busy watching the screen for blips blips signals if i miss one the supervisor will pull my tail feathers out one feather for each blip i miss that hurts well could we help watch your screen while we talk the stork considered its highly irregular but not forbidden forrest said well help and the supervisor can pull out one of our feathers or whatever if we miss any very well the stork agreed hello i am stanley stork you are forrest faun and mare imbrium imbri for short imbri said they joined him at the screen this was a large square panel with a black background whats a blip imbri asked three little points of light theres one now stanley pointed with the tip of his wing forrest saw them three bright specks like stars in a row moving quickly across the screen from left to right in a moment they were gone it would have been easy to miss them what are they he asked a signal i have to record its exact azimuth and elevation and relay the information to central processing the stork used the tip of his beak to peck at several numbers on a keypad theres another imbri said stanley looked up quickly oh thanks i would have missed that while i was recording the other he punched in more numbers what kind of signals are they forrest asked still perplexed you know orders orders for what babies of course thats the only product we carry at last it dawned on him signaling the stork this was the recelying end of those signals do you get many signals imbri asked just the right number the problem is the infernal bogies bogies the irrelevant signals theres one now on the screen was a pattern of two dots only one in ten is valid the others are spurious we have to weed them out how does someone send a bogie forrest asked fearing that he knew the answer by going through the motions at the wrong time or not completing them the stork said or when they arent qualified demonesses do that a lot and nymphs they think its funny to imitate the procedure when they arent on the list for deliveries that was what he had feared all his celebrations with nymphs were just cluttering the storks screen he felt guilty the valid ones are bad enouch stanley said catching another blip if those idiots had any idea how hard we have to work to prepare a delivery and get it exactly right i mean suppose we delivered an ogret to a human female think of the notoriety that would cause but no they keep signaling merrily away all night as if its nothing at all how are babies actually made forrest asked i mean once a valid signal comes well its complicated we then the stork glanced warily at him are you cleared for restricted information i guess not then move on im busy enough as it is stanley seemed to have a case sorry forrest said somewhat lamely they moved on other storks were busy handling paperwork and sorting and wrapping babies there was a loading dock where storks hooked their long beaks into the top loop of the slings holding the babies and with much labor took off on their delivery routes it was a very busy scene they reached the far corner of the castle and saw the straight and narrow ledge crossing the back side there must be some way to get into the castle forrest said but between the funeral and the storks i dont see it i dont either she agreed we really dont belong to either the beginning or the end of life were in the broad middle section should we cross to the other side and check out the funeral again im not sure what good that would do if only there were something halfway between the extremes then he paused do you think it could be literal literal halfway between the two sides of the castle thats so stupidly simple it cant be right right he agreed remembering how similarly stupidly simple the solutions to the challenges of the good magicians castle in xanth had been yet none of them had been obvious ahead of time magician humfrey just seemed to have a way of making ordinary folk feel stupid they walked down the far side of the castle there halfway was a small door they tried it and it opened they had found the way in passing the second challenge inside was a large chamber with a raised stage at the far end there was painted scenery and several people before it a man was directing the exact placement of the scenery and giving the others admonitions for their performances it was a rehearsal for a play and it was just beginning im not sure we belong here forrest said the director turned be silent and sit down or ill throw a curse at you curse fiends imbri whispered dont annoy them forrest had heard about the curse fiends they lived in a castle under lake ogre chobee they all had the same talent that of throwing curses and they put on plays they didnt like interference or competition sensible folk stayed well clear of them he looked at the door but it had closed and barred itself they would get hit by a barrage of curses if they tried to get out because the door would surely make a lot of noise disturbing the play that was the way of such things so he looked for the nearest chair and imbfi looked also they would have to watch the play rehearsal maybe they could get away when the intermission came there were two empty seats in the audience unfortunately they were not together so forrest had to sit between two young men while imbri sat between two women hello the man on the left whispered i am justin case my talent is to always have just the thing someone needs hello the man on the other side whispered i am his twin brother justin time my talent is to have my brother present just when he is needed i am forrest faun my talent is to care for my tree well that is surely a worthy endeavor justin case said in a disparaging tone at least it lacks the frustration i experience i always have what others need but never what i myself need our talents dont work on ourselves justin time explained i am never in time to do myself any good and i dont help my brother either i am sorry to hear that forrest said i can see that it must be very frustrating yes wed give anything to have even one bit of selfish good fortune like marrying two lovely young women and living happily ever after forrest wished he could help them and wondered whether he should give them the dear horn to use but then the stage was called to order and the play began so that had to wait an old man stepped to the center of the stage the curse fiends present raven a play in one act by sofia socksorter the good magicians wife fle stepped away a young man came on the stage and stood before a painted mountain i am called son he announced i am the unacknowledged son of magician grey and sorceress ivy he looked at his feet it seems they took too long to marry so when the stork brought me they werent ready so i was raised in an orphanage with no proper name but now i am eighteen and ready to claim my heritage but first i must perform some significant service for the king so that i may earn my recognition i also want to prove that my talent of the ability to manipulate peoples minds is truly magician caliber because someone claims that its not that my mother ivy enhanced it to make it seem greater than it is so now i will go to prove myself and seek my fortune son marched in the direction marked to which was his near future meanwhile the light on him faded and another brightened on another part of the stage showing a painting of a fancy castle inside the castle sat a man on a throne the man wore a crown i am king dolph he announced i am the human ruler of xanth my talent is to assume any form i wish to he suddenly turned into a dragon then into a male harpy then into a unicorn he returned to man form but today i am receiving visitors in case any member of my kingdom has a comment or complaint he glanced to the side queen electra who is here a woman wearing blue jeans and a crown appeared its a man who claims to be your real father this should be interesting send him in electra pushed an electric buzzer a buzz sounded and a door opened a man entered the royal chamber he looked somewhat scruffy so you claim to be my true father king dolph inquired dont you know that i am the son of king emeritus dor and queen emeritus irene that was established long ago no it wasnt the man said you were delivered to me but i was busy cutting magic canes so i set you under a cabbage leaf in the castle roogna garden and went on with my work before i could return for you queen irene discovered you and claimed you for her own there wasnt much i could do because i had to deliver my load of canes to the local store immediately or i wouldnt get paid for them by the time i had done that i had forgotten all about the matter but now i have remembered so i have come to fetch you home and put you to work cutting more canes so i can retire king dolph did not look entirely pleased by this news it is true that i was found under a cabbage leaf but thats because the stork was unable to get into the closed castle no it wasnt the man insisted its because i put you there my wife was most upset when i mentioned it this morning and insisted that i set the matter to rights immediately i will have to ponder this king dolph said come back next week my wife wont like the delay here is a pretty bead give her that to distract her king dolph plunged his hand into the royal treasury and fished out a sparkling bead he gave it to the man gee shell like that the man said departing with the bead next king dolph said in a businesslike manner that will be son queen electra said he just arrived she pressed her buzzer son entered and what can i do for you king dolph inquired politely i am your unacknowledged cousin son i want you to send me on a significant quest so i can prove myself and claim my rightful heritage as a member of the royal family and maybe marry a nice princess thats a worthy ambition king dolph agreed very well go find out whether the man with the bead really is my true father okay ill go to stork headquarters and check the records do that son exited the light faded on the king and followed son he walked slowly across the stage and the scenery moved past him in the opposite direction showing his progress but before he got to the stork works he encountered a pretty girl she had long dark hair with a matching dark temper i say son inquired are you by any chance a princess for he had always been intrigued by darktempered girls there was just something about them his attitude on stage showed this clearly no i am merely raven an ordinary person whose talent is to change the color of my eyes to match my moods her eyes brightened as she spoke too bad he said with real regret for i mean to marry a princess too bad she agreed her eyes darkening moodily for you are a handsome man with the look of a magician about you i mean to marry a magician well maybe youll find one are you going my way i believe i am shall we travel together until we separate her eyes turned hopeful blue that works for me so they walked together and the scenery moved on behind them to show their joint progress shall i tell you my abbreviated life history as we travel raven inquired as the scrolling scenery threatened to become repetitive and therefore in need of distraction from i am always interested in the life histories of pretty girls son said even if they arent princesses so she told him her story my mother wanted me to be a powerful sorceress she wasnt much impressed with my eye colors her eyes turned motley dull depressive brown so she made a deal with a demon the demon gave me a bottle on a cord around my neck it enables me to take snatches of other peoples talents and store them inside the bottle then i can use these samples of magic oh i say nowcould i use any of those talents i can think of some that would be really handy no she said regretfully her eyes turning a gloomy gray there is a spell on it which allows only me to use it in return for this bottle which does on occasion give me sorceresslike powers my mother agreed to give the demon her other child to be his slave she believed it to be a good bargain because she had no other children one can never be certain of such a thing son said i am the unacknowledged first son of magician grey murphy and sorceress ivy and now i have returned to make my status known i am on a quest to ascertain whether king dolph has an unacknowledged father thats fascinating raven said clearly unfascinated her eyes turned dishwater dull i am now sixteen and i have a lovely sister named robin i am afraid that the demon is going to take robin away to be his slave especially if she grows up to be as pretty as i am she is fifteen and shows every sign of it so i am traveling to castle roogna to seek help but i just came from castle roogna son said why didnt you say so raven demanded angrily her eyes turning smoldery you didnt ask oh well i suppose i had better turn around and go the other way but you cant do that son protested why cant i because i have fallen in love with you this made her pause but im not a princess she protested but you are beautiful true she said reasonably but however persuasive that may be it still doesnt make me royal unfortunately yet if i successfully claim my heritage and am recognized as a prince and marry you then you will become a princess he pointed out with a certain appealing logic ravens eyes turned speculatively bright i suppose if you prove to be a magician it would be feasible you are after all a handsome man good lets get on to the storks the storks she exclaimed alarmed i wasnt ready to go quite that far that fast i think signaling even one stork is a very serious thing especially before marriage he realized the nature of her confusion i am going to stork headquarters to check the records of deliveries to ascertain whether king dolph was delivered to dor and irene or to an anonymous cane cutter for some reason the king wishes to know ravens eyes blushed beet red oh im so embarrassed i thought you meant well i certainly wouldnt mind summoning the stork with you so if you prefer to take it that way no i think ill quit while im ahead she decided her eyes becoming a peaceful green lets go question the storks so they continued on to the stork works which were exactly as forrest and imbri had seen them the stork in charge of records didnt want to show them to unauthorized personnel but son used his talent to chance its mind and satisfy it that they were authorized they looked on the page listing dolph delivered to ruben and rowena cane cutters it said oh no son said somewhat dismayed i fear i will have bad news for exking dolph i fear i have even worse news for him raven said faintly he looked at her in surprise what could be worse than suddenly never having been a king suddenly being enslaved to a demon he stared at he in wild surmise you mean yes ruben and rowena are my parents he is my longlost brother i never knew i had but how is this possible dolph is thirty years older than you are ravens eyes turned a nonplused color why i never thought of that they arent old enough this whole scene is impossible cut the curse fiend director cried this is all wrong how did that ending get in the play im sure i dont know raven said look madame take you spoke the line you my name is miss take the actress said primly well this is all your fault miss take you got the line wrong dont yell at my sister like that another curse fiend exclaimed you are the one who cast her in that role as a favor to you out take the director retorted now were in a prime picklement tomorrow is the show its too late to get another actress well if you were a better director youd have had an understudy the director pulled out two handfuls of his hair oh woe ts me the shame of it the play wont go on there was a silence slowly forrest realized that this wasnt really a curse fiend play rehearsal but a challenge he was supposed to figure out what to do that meant that there must be something if he could just comprehend it he was getting half a notion how these things worked the elements of the challenge were always in plain view it was just a matter of understanding their relevance there usually wasnt much that was extraneous most of a given setting was pertinent that meant that the play the audience and the chamber all related but how suddenly he had it you can fix the play he called the director whirled to face him what interference is this i am forrest faun and i have a notion how you can fix it forrest said standing but it may seem unusual no idea is too unusual if it saves the play what is it my neighbor on my left must marry the actress for raven what are you talking about you foolish faun the director demanded the private lives of the actors and audience have nothing to do with the play yes they do forrest said your play went wrong because the actress miss take has a talent that is bound to foul it up since it is too late to change the actress you must change her name so that it no longer has a bad effect as it happens justin case here can do that by marrying her so that her name becomes mrs case but he doesnt want to marry a failed actress speak for yourself director justin case said standing shes a beautiful woman in or out of the play but she wouldnt want to id do anything to save my role miss take said the director nodded very well then but be quick about it well have to stage another partial rehearsal to be sure its straight but how can you marry and leave me alone justin time asked after i have so loyally gotten you where you needed to be at just the right time thats right justin case agreed you deserve a lovely actress too forrest thought quickly is ravens beautiful sister robin a character in the play yes of course the director said she has to be saved from the dread demon then she can marry justin time but miss inform wouldnt speak for yourself director a lovely young woman said walking on stage let me get a look at this man justin time stood he was a handsome man appearing alrost ageless miss inform nodded hell do but if you are only fifteen justin time began doubtfully that is my role age she replied with a smile i am actually slightly older and a good deal more experienced good enough justin time agreed then lets get this done with the director said the four of you stand before me the two men and two women lined up before him by the allthority vested in me as almighty director i now pronounce you men and wives now get on with the play the men quickly kissed their brides and returned to their places in the audience pick it up from raven yes the director directed give her the cue son on the stage son stared at raven in wild surmise you mean yes she replied striking her dramatic pose ruben and rowena are my parents he is my longlost brother i never knew i had but how is this possible dolph is thirty years older than you are i thats right there must be some mistake lets look at that record again son peered at the stork records oh now i see that it is mismarked theres a note error proper parents are dor irene of castle roogna oh thats a relief son said i liked king dolph ill be glad to bring the good news to him he paused but then why did your father say that the baby was his viously he lied because he wanted a son instead of only daughters that makes sense son agreed but what about my sister whom the demon will now claim as his slave son looked grim i shall have to fight him so as to keep your family happy but you cant fight a demon raven protested you forget my talent of manipulating mens minds hes male so maybe i can change his mind he struck another pose demon come here there was a gout of fire and a puff of smoke when it cleared there was a horrendous figure of a demon who calls demon ize i do son said i shall not let you make a slave of this womans lovely little sister lovely sister the demon asked i thought it was a vastly older brother no that was a clerical error raven has no brother only a sister hm what does she look like here is her picture raven said holding it forth d ize peered at it that could be airbrushed shes probably really ugly she is not here ill conjure her in person and prove it you can conjure son asked surprised its one of the pieces of talents i have saved in my bottle raven explained she brought out her bottle and popped the cork sister robin come here she intoned a bird with a red breast flew in it landed on the floor and became a beautiful young woman yes sister dear demon ize here thinks youre ugly raven said really robin turned to the demon inhaling not really ize said quickly you are truly lovely and he plans to make you his slave raven continued sourly really robin said frowning does that mean i wont be able to look for a nice man to marry who will have the talent of changing form and flying with me i can do that ize cried changing into a green jay suddenly i dont want to enslave you to my surprise i want to marry you you lovely creature the bird said geethats nice robin changed into her bird form and the two of them flew away well i guess that solved your problem son said and king dolphs problem lets go back to castle roogna so i can gain my recognition as a magician you changed izes mind raven asked impressed yes it really wasnt difficult when he saw how pretty she is i hope you dont mind having a demon in the family well it does seem better than the alternative and it does seem like a magician caliber talent lets go to castle roogna they linked arms and walked off stage that works for me the director said be here tomorrow for the official production the members of the cast scattered and the two actresses went to join their husbands meanwhile the directors roving eye fell on forrest what are you waiting for faun go on in to see the good magician and a door opened beyond the stage forrest and imbri walked up to the door and through it you figured it out imbri said admiringly youre a pretty smart faun no i just caught on to how these challenges work in real life i probably would have flubbed it but he was pleased with her appreciation an old dull woman approached them in the next chamber assorted socks were tucked in her apron pockets so you repaired my play she said thank you i am sofia socksorter designated wife of the moment uh yes forrest said we came to of course himself will see you now just follow the trail of socks they followed the trail of socks he always had trouble keeping track of his socks imbri murmured thats why he married mundanias best sock sorter but even she cant keep up on a bad day so i seeand smell the trail led up to the good magicians cramped study there was humfrey as before hunched over his monstrous tome uh forrest began the gnomelike figure looked up yes yes of course your service will be to serve as adviser to the princesses dawn eve to enable them to save the human territory from marginalization the magic path will take you directly to castle roogna but i havent even asked my you came to ask the way to castle roogna humfrey said irritably i have answered he returned to his tome they had been summarily dismissed again but it was true they had only sought the way and for that they had to pay the equivalent of a years service it didnt seem quite fair they went back down the dingy winding stairs how can humfrey be here the same as ever forrest asked imbri he sips youth elixir to maintain his age at about one hundred she reminded him no i mean shouldnt he be banned from ptero since hes a real person in xanth only a year i think the rest of his life is unobstructed as with ogle ogre oh yes i suppose so its strange seeing someone i met there here yes but it will be stranger seeing dawn eve sofia gave them lunch and showed them to the magic path be sure not to stray from it she warned there are dragons out there we will stay on it imbri promised himself does appreciate what you are doing even if he doesnt show it sofia said if not for you those two foolish princesses would be off looking for husbands isnt that normal for human beings forrest asked not when their territory is being marginalized save that and then they can do whatever else they want but i dont even know what the term means im sure you will find out now off with you the matter is urgent she shooed them out the door and toward the magic path this realm is as strange as xanth imbri murmured its stranger sofia called after them she was probably right he path brought them safely and conveniently through the forest but it was a fair distance just as it was in xanth so they stopped at a rest station as night came they knew that night had nothing to do with the progress of the sun across the sky because ptero simply used the light of xanth sometimes when princess ida put her head in shadow the scene dimmed forrest wasnt sure whether he should be tired but when darkness closed he found he wanted to sleep so that was all right sleeping was no more unnatural here than eating it seemed they could take or leave either depending on the local circumstance what does it feel like being solid he asked imbri as she settled down beside him i mean im used to it but you arent especially not in girl form she agreed but i find i am getting used to it and at times i rather like it i am even beginning to feel solid girl emotions oh what are they appreciation for the beauty of the forest and the niceness of folk like cathryn even things like eating and sleeping are interesting experiences i suppose so this world of ptero seems all right as i become accustomed to it yes then sleepiness overtook him and he faded out he woke later feeling a motion near him he discovered that it was imbri putting a conventional blanket on him you looked cool she explained he had indeed become cool but the blanket fixed it thank you you are welcome forrest he started to drift back to sleep but then he realized that she had no blanket of her own arent you cool too he asked it does not matter yes it does isnt there another blanket i found only one use it and sleep in peace but you must be sleepy too you should have it but then you would be cold forrest pondered briefly we could share it she hesitated he had been afraid of that if you are concerned that i view you as a nymph no it is clear that you do not you are a far more responsible faun than i expected caring for my tree has made me that way please do join me imbri we are both warm and the blanket is large enough for us both thank you she dissolved her clothing and joined him after an astonished instant forrest realized that she did not care to sleep under a blanket in her clothing it wouldnt feel comfortable so she had eliminated her dress it made sense but in that instant she had indeed looked exactly like a nymph that had an effect on him that he hoped he could conceal from her he did not want her to think that he had tried to deceive her she settled down beside him her body touched his at shoulder and hip she was soft and smooth and warm just like a nymph but she was not a nymph he reminded himself forcefully she was a mare in girl form and an intelligent and thoughtful creature not interested in nymphly pursuits so he faced away from her and did his best to ignore her presence it took some time but at last he did manage to sleep again but later he drifted awake to discover her nestled against his side her nymphly attributes very soft he didnt dare move but he wasnt quite sure he dared sleep again lest he dream of chasing and catching a nymph and do something that would appall her he wished he had anticipated this situation and avoided it yet at the same time he also liked this unexpected contact with her he knew that his awareness of her had changed in a way that could not be undone she was still imbri his helpful companion but now she was also somewhat more than thatin a way he must not allow to show forrest lay awake struggling to adjust his thoughts but they would not fit back into their former simplicity he knew imbri as a person not a nymphbut now he wished she could be both that was of course impossible so it was a long night but in the morning he was not tired or logy apparently in this state he did not really need sleep it was just a convenience during darkness as the light brightened imbri stiffed and woke she stretched rubbing against him then sat up ohof course she said glancing at him we shared warmth for a moment i wondered what i was doing under the blanket with you just sleeping he said yes thank you she stood lanced down at her bare body and concentrated her dress formed from her substance covering her i feel like a sorceress when i do this she confessed but its really not magic just reshaping of my soul material yes but how different it was to see that nude body when he knew she was not a mindless nymph that awareness should have caused him not to care how she looked but instead it made him care even more last night he had wished she could be both nymph and friend the two aspects separate taking turns now he wished she could be both at once that was a significant change in concept the idea of celebrating with a real person a friend instead of doing the mindless thing with one and respecting the other a human woman could have fit that description as humans had minds and bodies but imbri was not human and she had no body except in the present rather special situation so it was pointless to dwell on it you seem rather thoughtful this morning imbri remarked did you sleep well what could he say the truth was not appropriate but he did not like the notion of deception so he hesitated oh you didnt she said in brief anguish i shouldnt have taken part of your blanket you lacked room to sleep freely i must have tossed and turned and poked you in the night no no thats not it he protested you were perfect i didnt poke you not exactly this struggle to find a compromise between accuracy and discretion was awful it was not an exercise normally required of tree s pirits i dont understand did i poke you or didnt i did i disturb your sleep or didnt i forrest decided that evasion was untenable he would have to be forthright and take the consequence you did poke me but it didnt hurt you did disturb my sleep but not because of any restlessness on your part you slept quietly but i poked you with my elbow no my knee no i dont understand what did i poke you with your still he hesitated she looked down at her body i dont see how then her human mouth turned round my maidenly bosom i poked you with that forrest felt himself blushing a thing he had never done before possibly no faun had managed it before oh forrest she said chagrined i never thoughti look like a nymph dont i and youre a faun yes now it was out and you had to hold yourself back from being a faun all night yes i would never haveif i had realizedthis isnt my natural formit just never occurred to me that it doesnt matter he said wanting to get off this embarrassing subject yes it does i have treated you with discourtesy and caused you distress i dont know how i can make up for that i should have understoodits so obvious in retrospect please its not important lets just resume our trek i was just so thoughtless no apology can be enough but i must do something then a new expression crossed her face forrest i keep forgetting that im solid here on ptero even when that makes mischief i forget that it can also abate it i can be a nymph for you no i dont want that no really it is no affront to me we animals dont take such things seriously i can play the game perfectly if you will just tell me how lets seenymphs run and scream cutely and kick their feet and fling their hair about and pretend to signal the stork as she spoke she dissolved her dress ran around in a little circle kicked up one foot and then the other and flung her lengthening hair in a full circle then she tried a cute scream eeeeeek no forrest cried stop it she stopped immediately im sorry forrest do i have it wrong no i just dont want you as a nymph but you saidin the night youre not mindless oh but i can pretend to be i would know better she nodded sadly so i cant be a nymph for you all i can do is frustrate you yes i truly apologize forrest if there is any other way i can make it up to you no we must get on with our mission yes of course she agreed chastened so they resumed their trek but in his mind he saw her again and again acting exactly like a nymph he had wanted so much to play that game with her but to have her pretend to be mindless and believe she was satisfying him when what he truly wanted wasno he couldnt accept that neither would he ask her to do it while not pretending to be a nymph because that would imply some actual commitment on her part and he had no right to desire that she was just with him on an assignment to help him find a faun for a tree when this quest was done she would be free to go her own way her service to the good magician fulfilled forrest i see you are still depressed imbri said as they walked i know its my fault i wish no its my fault and he knew that was the truth he had no right to soil her innocence with his unrealistic desire i want to speak no more of it of course she agreed chastened again no danger threatened them on the way because the path was enchanted the scenery was mountainous but the path wound around remaining almost level so that this was no problem they could admire the view with impunity only when there was no alternative did the path climb to any height in due course they came to castle roogna which was in a forest in a valley the path had climbed over a ridge and the valley was laid out for their view like a large picture but there was something wrong with that picture what are all those lines forrest asked startled i dont remember seeing them for the valley was crisscrossed with long colored lines that extended from hillside to hillside as if some giant had drawn them with a pencil only the area immediately around the castle itself was clear of the lines im sure they werent there in xanth imbri agreed but of course this isnt xanth its a smaller replica still we havent seen such lines elsewhere in ptero i dont think it can be normal do you think it could relate to the problem we are supposed to solve she asked marginalization marginalization he repeated pondering they do look a bit like margins as if somebody drew some lines to mark off the valley then drew some more lines nsde those and more farther inside leaving less space in the center it reminds me of a game i used to play as a faun she laughed you arent still a faun actually he wondered the fauns of the faun nymph retreat were shallow creatures intent on only one thing and the nymphs provided that the fauns who left the retreat and sought useful employment became deeper but not by a whole lot it was just that they now realized that the pursuit of nymphs was not the only thing though it did remain the main thin those fauns who chose to associate with trees became deeper yet but still were not by any means really serious people on this quest forrest had become far more thoughtful than ever in his life before and the episodes on ptero had accelerated that change right up until last night when he had actually held back from doing what was natural and this morning when he had declined imbris offer to play nymph despite considerable temptation no faun he had ever heard of would have done that so he was certainly no longer a normal member of his kind but that was too complicated to go into right now when i was young what was the game we played it with stone knives we cleared a patch of dirt and took turns flipping our knives into it so that they stuck point first then we extended the direction of the blade each way making a line that divided the patch into two sections whoever missed the clear patch or didnt get his knife to stick in the ground lost his turn the clear patch kept getting smaller as it got subdivided until finally it was too small to hit the last one to get his knife into it was the winner but what was the point just to win we had to have something to divert us when there were no nymphs in sight that was it she glanced sidelong at him your horizons have broadened since then if only she knew how far yes anyway a game would look like that valley it was hard to get the knife to fall just the right way and it got harder as the game progressed so that usually just a slice was taken off the edge of the remaining patch if this is a game its about three quarters through what kind of creatures could play such a game with the human territory of ptero invisible giants she nodded if it is such a game what does the winner get castle roogna he said and with it dominion over all the human beings of ptero she nodded again and you have to help dawn eve save the human territory from marginalization now i think we know more about the nature of the threat marginalization he repeated pressing in of the margins until there is nothing left in the center that seems like something that needs to be dealt with yet the king would be a magician imbri said how is it that he could not fight this incursion something must have happened to him we had better get down there quickly before it gets any worse but wont the giants see us and stop us from getting there especially if they should suspect our mission yes so well use cathryns blanket of obscurity he reached into his knapsack and brought out the little can you are getting smarter all the time i wouldnt have thought of that please dont compliment me she looked at him surprised why not when its true he would have bitten his tongue but it was too late for that so he told the truth because i already care too much for you in your present shape and that just makes it worse she stared at him in astonishment then she looked thoughtful i w ii try to be more careful he held the can in front of him i invoke you nothing happened but that was the way it was supposed to be he put the can away and they started down the hill at the edge of the forest they came to their first line they halted just short of it the thing was green and marked the ground without actually cutting into it in the manner of a shadow it crossed rocks and trees the same way it wasnt visible in the air but its dark green line showed against the leaves and branches above it indicating that it was a vertical plane do you think its safe to cross it forrest asked with the concealment of the blanket it should be but maybe we should move carefully and not talk much when we cross i agree ill go first why because if it is dangerous i dont want you hurt but the quest is yours i should be protecting you not you me her logic was good but it wasnt enough the thought of her in danger because of him was not to be suffered please imbrilet me go first you idiot she cried that startled him what did it ever occur to you that i might feel the same way about you he considered no i know im just a day mare but i have feelings too i dont want you to be hurt any more than you want me to be hurt and what would i do if i didnt see you safely through this quest she was right i apologize imbri suppose we take turns trying the dangerous things all right i apologize too i shouldnt have blamed you for caring for me she stepped forward and crossed the line nothing happened apparently it was dangerous in itself or the blanket of obscurity was protecting them forrest stepped across there was no sensation it was just a marking not an actual barrier forrest breathed a sigh of relief i think well have to cross several more lines but it seems to be safe imbri nodded and they continued toward the castle they did cross other lines each a different color without trouble he wasnt sure whether this was because of the obscurity spell or the enchanted path or because the lines werent actually dangerous he didnt like the idea of wasting magic but he didnt like unnecessary risk either until they understood exactly what was happening here they had to be careful the path led through the great orchard where pie trees and shoe trees and many other types were cultivated it passed a cemetery with a sign saying beware of zombies it led up to a deep moat where an old moat monster eyed them warily in short things were completely ordinary near the castle even the monster was familiar hello souffle imbri called but this monster is too old to be that one forrest said you forget we have come far west into the to she reminded him folk are older here she went up to pat the monster on the nose but souffld shied away not recognizing her youre in the wrong form forrest murmured oh yes she faced the monster in my natural form i look like this she fuzzed out and assumed her mare form it wasnt dense but it was clear enough to see soufflds eyes brightened now he recognized the day mare he lowered his head as she returned to girl form and this time suffered himself to be patted on the nose i have only enough mass to be this form she explained besides im traveling with forrest faun so its easier to be two footed but im still mare imbri they crossed the moat and came to the castle entrance a woman came to meet them at the gate something was orbiting her head princess ida imbri cried do we know each other the princess inquired politely im mare imbrium in human form because thats all the mass i have this is forrest faun we met a few days ago in xanth forrest nodded as he was introduced but he wondered because this woman was older than the one they had met before im sorry but i dont remember about what age was i then twenty eight i thinkthe same as princess ivy that explains it then that is in our blanked year until that passes we wont know what happened therein blanked year forrest asked remember ogle ogre imbri murmured now he understood the year surrounding their present existence in xanth what year is it now imbri asked we are forty now twelve years after that that explained why she looked older but there was also something odd about her moon when we met you your moon was round forrest said princess ida smiled of course my present existence here is a derivative of that reality so my moon differs she angled her head so that the moon swung into full view this is pyramid now he saw that the moon was not round but triangular or at least had a triangular outline it seemed to have four sides each triangular it rotated around three while the fourth faced down becoming the base of the figure forrest found this a bit hard to assimilate isis it also a world in its own right the way ptero is of course though we dont know what is on it no one has been there but we suspect that the ideas that never were are there that makes sense forrest agreed and what brings you folk of xanth to our realm ida inquired politely we seldom if ever have visitors from there forrest has a quest to find a faun for a neighboring tree imbri explained oh you will have to go farther to for that the faun territory is there but meanwhile im on a mission for the good magician forrest said i have to advise princesses dawn eve to help them save the human territory from marginalization oh thats wonderful we were so afraid that help would not come now im hopeful that it will be all right but i hardly know what to do the good magician would not have sent you unless he were sure you could do the job our situation is verging on desperate there are so few of us left so few imbri asked come you must meet king ivy she will help explain king who king ivy she had to take over when king dor was lost right this way but what of king dolph imbri asked oh hes not until later but hes lost too lost there are only six of us here now ah here we are they had arrived at the throne room sure enough a woman of forty sat on the throne she rose to come to them as they entered king ivy this is forrest faun and mare imbrium from xanth princess ida said they are here to enable dawn eve to handle the margins what a relief king ivy said come we must have a banquet but is this the time for that forrest asked i mean if the situation is serious we can talk best then princess ida explained everyone gets together for a banquet soon they were at the banquet hall the other members of the castle arrived and were introduced consort grey a handsome man just beyond forty princess electra who was or depending on whether chronological or normal living time was counted and her daughters dawn eve who were a buxom eighteen dawn had flamered hair green eyes and wore bright clothes eve had jet black hair and eyes and wore dark clothing both were startlingly beautiful when i met you two a few days ago you were six years old forrest said bemused yes thats our blank year dawn agreed so we dont remember you eve said but were sure youre an interesting person girls dont be too forward their mother electra warned them oh pooh dawn said hes a faun its impossible for us to embarrass him eve agreed then they both leaned forward over the table so that their ddcolletages fell open flashing four impressive hemispheres and for the second time in his life forrest blushed girls electra exclaimed indignantly see dawn asked her sister as they straightened up i told you it was possible to embarrass a faun you win eve agreed but we probably couldnt do it again you wont electra cried before they could do it again youll have to excuse my impetuous children the two girls shrugged in unison looking halfway smug forrest found himself becoming a trifle nervous about having to advise them while he was trying to show them what to do what would they be showing him it would have been easier to work with the two six year olds whose naughtiness would have been more limited the banquet was good with slices of buttered breadfruit and chipped potatoes and pitchers of drink forrest spied one whose label seemed to say boot rear so he poured himself a mug of that as he liked forest products he took a sip and it was very good but dawn sitting across from him looked alarmed youre drinking toot rear oopshad he taken the wrong drink he had seen only the latter part of the label the last thing he wanted was to embarrass himself at the kings banquet but then he saw that the pitcher did say boot not toot both girls seeing his face burst out laughing they had fooled him electra glared at them and the two subsided this was surely going to be a long assignment how can we help you perform your service king ivy inquired as they proceeded to dessert i admit that i have no idea how i should proceed forrest said i dont think i have any qualifications oh you are surely qualified consort grey said the good magician always knows you just have to discover how you are qualified but i dont even know anything about human women let alone princesses how can i presume to advise them your authority derives from that of the good magician ivy said the twins may pout as she spoke dawn eve pouted prettily but they know the mission is quite serious and will do their best they know that this is the only way to save their father prince dolph and at that the twins were abruptly serious can you tell me just what the situation is we passed a number of lines as we approached the castle but dont know what they mean the king sighed they mean that the human sector of ptero is being marginalized some hostile force is laying siege to us and has already limited us to the immediate region of the castle so that we cant range through our lives and belome young or old as we choose this means that i am stuck at age forty which is definitely not comfortable for a woman and so is my sister ida but thats the least of it all the human beings of this territory have been lost to the margins so that only the six of us you see here remain soon all of us will be gone if you are not able to guide the twins successfully all are gone imbri asked appalled all ivy said firmly at first we sent folk out to try to deal with it but none of them returned even magicians and sorceresses were lost our daughters melody harmony and rhythm are gone and my grandparents magician trent and sorceress iris and greys parents magician murphy and sorceress vadne they went out and got caught by the margins the margins forrest repeated those are the lines yes they appear suddenly and whatever is caught within them is lost sometimes we can see their forms faintly within their enclosures but we cant reach them you cant cross the lines forrest asked we cant cross they are like glass walls impenetrable but we crossed them without difficulty they seem to be one way walls grey explained my talent is to nullify magic but i have not been able to nullify the margins i think it is because they are merely the effects of some distant magic which i cant reach similarly eves talent is to know anything about anything inanimate but she cant discover anything about the margins so it may be that they arent really there though their effects certainly are did you try to cross any margins the other way forrest exchanged a chagrined glance with imbri no it didnt occur to us but still how can folk be trapped behind the walls then why dont they cross in toward the castle when the margins are laid down they seem to exert control over whatever they enclose grey said the inanimate things remain as they were but the animate things become ghostly you are the first folk to pass through them and reach us since the marginalization began a few weeks ago on occasion we have seen birds from elsewhere fly in but soon they drop into a marginalized segment and become ghostly but then that should have happened to us too imbri said we would have thought so ivy agreed but we are very glad you got through the blanket forrest exclaimed it must have helped blanket princess ida asked he has a blanket of obscurity that cathryn centaur gave us imbri said cathryn eve said her dark eyes brightening like stars is she all right yes shes fine imbri answered shes the one who told us to come to you twins but how do you know her since you live beyond her limit of old age eve smiled our from limit comes close to her to limit we used to explore that way and we met her we were so small that we had gotten lost but she called out to us and directed us back to so that we were all right so we like her and feel that we owe her a service dawn said but we have found no way to render it that must be why she sent us to you forrest said she knew that you would help us in our search since she couldnt search eve asked i am looking for a faun for a tree in xanth that is what brought us to ptero everything else constitutes the complications of that search things do get complicated king ivy agreed by any chance did the good magician in xanth send you to ptero yes forrest agreed and the good magician in ptero sent us he paused why he must have chained himself i mean made a chain from himself to himself to get help to you from xanth he sent us to his other self here and then he paused momentarily confused by the complication of it it isnt easy to fathom humfreys ways grey agreed but they always make sense at the end i came to appreciate that during the years when i worked for him but im still just a faun forrest said i cant do any special magic and i dont know a whole lot how could i possibly succeed where magicians and sorceresses have failed if the good magician believes you can succeed then im sure its true grey said then he looked thoughtful tell me forrest do you happen to know princess idas talent yes its the idea too bad king ivy muttered what forrest asked startled grey raised a hand my wife was thinking of something else allow me if you will to explore this just a bit further do you know how idas talent actually works yes her moon is a solidification of all the ideas associated with xanth its where they are stored thats why we are here in pursuit of an idea the idea of a faun who can associate with my neighboring tree ivy looked up seeming interested and that is the extent of it grey asked its just the moon what was the point of this yes as far as i know am i being stupi d about something by no means grey said quickly no one can be expected to know what he hasnt seen and hasnt been told i suppose so forrest agreed he glanced at imbri but she averted her gaze that bothered him he looked at the twin girls and they averted their gazes too there is something isnt there there is something you dont know but it is no fault in you grey said carefully so why dont you tell me what it is so i wont be so stupid you are not stupid you are merely ignorant of something as anyone in your situation would be i shall be glad to tell you but i would like to establish something first this was getting annoying forrest didnt like games where everyone else knew what he didnt and shared a smug superiority because of it establish what i would like to ascertain whether you agree with my point about the good magician that it isnt easy to fathom his ways yes i agree and that since he seems to believe that you can succeed in this mission to ptero it must be true yes i suppose though he seems more devious than he has to be so you too believe that you will succeed what was with all this circuitous dialogue yes i dont know how ill succeed but i probably will im sure you will ida agreed thank you princess forrest turned his attention back to magician consort grey so what is it i dont know aside from how to live up to the good magicians expectation the rest of the nature of princess idas talent it is true that it is the idea but that is not the whole of it it is that anything she accepts as true is true and she is glad to agree with the beliefs of others thats nice forrest said glancing at ida but isnt that true of anybody i dont accept anything as true that i know is not true after all but you could be mistaken yes anyone could princess ida is never mistaken this was odd but anyone can be confused or have wrong information at some point not ida when she accepts an idea it is true that is her talent but forrest looked again at the princess no offense princess but so what since she agrees that you will succeed in your mission you will succeed grey said that is her talent her reality becomes our reality a pale gleam dawned as a sorceress she makes things come true forrest said that really helps but why didnt she just decide that one of you could overcome this marginalization why bring an ignorant faun into it because the idea has to come from someone who doesnt know her talent forrest pondered that all of them obviously knew princess ida well even imbri had known the princess before only forrest himself hadnt known her talent though he had thought he did so only his own belief in the success of his mission counted his ignorance had been his greatest asset so now i will succeed he said slowly but what i believe after this wont count because now i know the true nature of princess idas talent thats it grey agreed but it is enough that assurance guarantees not only your personal success but the salvation of the whole human complement of ptero until this point we have had to face the prospect of extinction forrest was amazed and not completely pleased so i was sent here because of what i didnt know so that you could persuade me that i could succeed so that it would become possible for me to succeed thanks to princess ida so that you could escape your fate oh dont be so poopy about it dawn said well make it up to you eve added both of them inhaled you will not electra snapped they burst into mirth even forrest had to laugh at that the prospect of working with them was beginning to seem not so bad at least they were cheerful and surely their talents were worthwhile so now it seems we all know where we stand king ivy said we have no better notion than you do how to proceed from here but we will give you any support you need thank you forrest said i suppose i should consult with the girls and see if we can develop any strategy for dealing with the margins sure lets go to the bedroom right away dawn said brightly ill turn down the sheets eve agreed darkly girls electra said severely when i was your age at least i had some manners mom when you were our age you were married dawn said and exploring tfle adult conspiracy and in blue jeans too eve added while we wear dresses she spun about causing her skirt to rise dangerously now its our turn while were lush and full of all the ages to be stuck in electra moaned youre impossble oh come on mom dawn said you enjoyed signaling the stork to order us admit it maybe the tapestry room imbri suggested if its not being used so you can show us exactly where things are oh we can do that without the tapestry dawn said serenely tugging at her blouse eve tugged at her skirt but this time king ivy added her glare to that of electra and the two decided to behave they went to the tapestry room forrest was almost afraid that he would see himself lying on the bed there but it was empty the four of them sat on the bed facing the tapestry forrest found himself flanked by dawn eve their soft hips touching his he was uncomfortable but pretended not to notice he knew they were having innocent fun with him and didnt mean what they hinted can the tapestry show the margins he asked sure dawn said she was usually the first to speak and eve the last there they are a pattern of lines appeared on the picture they crisscrossed the valley forming a giant circle castle roogna was in the center of the portion that remained clear the lines extended out to the pun strips that bordered the human territory and stopped there none seemed to be near the good magicians castle however so the attack is limited to the human region forrest said trying to proceed intelligently despite his continuing awareness of the maidenly hips touching him he tried to think of the girls as the little ones he had first seen but it just didnt work they were big girls now yes eve agreed somberly even the margins cant stand the puns imbri and i thought the pattern resembles a game played by invisible giants he said tossing knives oh youre so smart dawn exclaimed nudging him he was determined not to be falsely flattered do you have invisible giants here sure eve agreed soberly but they havent done anything like this before in any event they wouldnt have magic like this imbri pointed out who would have magic like this we dont know dawn said maybe an evil wizard eve added not a magician or sorcerer he asked we dont think there are any left dawn explained so it must be something nonhuman forrest nodded that makes sense to me both girls turned their heads to look at him you mean youre taking one of our suggestions seriously eve asked forrest was taken aback shouldnt i you both know more about this situation than i do nobody ever took us seriously before dawn said forrest began to get a glimmer why they tended to misbehave im supposed to advise you how to handle the marginalization i cant do that if i dont take you seriously the two exchanged a glance on either side of his face it brushed his head feeling like a caress youll actually pay attention to our ideas eve asked yes of course what are they we think the wizard must be hiding in the hills somewhere in an ugly castle hating human beings because hes not pretty like us dawn said and hes casting out margins to hem us in so we cant escape so he can destroy us all eve said then we should find him and stop him forrest said but how you got through the lines dawn said so maybe you can take us through so we can sneak up on him but the lines are one way we cant be sure of that eve said uncertainly maybe it just seems that way but if even grey murphy couldnt dent them we think maybe the wizard is watching and does something to strengthen a margin when one of us approaches it to make us think we are trapped more solidly than we are dawn said eagerly maybe if we could go to a line without being noticed we could get through it or do something to it well if my blanket of obscurity helps they clapped their hands in perfect unison lets try it eve said the worst we can do is fail by all means forrest agreed pleased with the progress they were making the twins were no longer trying to distract him they were genuinely interested in the project they went downstairs and to the front gate there forrest brought out the canned blanket and invoked it nothing seemed to happen but he proceeded with confidence toward the margins they stopped before the nearest line which was red when imbri and i came through the lines were visible but we couldnt touch them he said but we didnt try very hard if your theory is right we should be very quiet and careful because the spell of obscurity may not be very strong i dont know how far out it reaches so we should remain closely grouped too they clustered in close the twins touching him on either side but this time they were not trying to tease him it might also be that its the margins themselves that react when people approach dawn said so that you got through because they didnt know you were challenging them that makes even more sense to me forrest said the lines are here all the time and if they have any awareness the inanimate does have awareness eve said i can talk to it though not the way grandpa dor can i will try to fathom the nature of the margins if i am able to get close enough to make contact you couldnt touch it before forrest asked it was just a blank nothing she said i reached out my hand and it stopped as if meeting a wall but there was nothing there i can tell anything about anything inanimate but this wasnt a thing it was a force i couldnt reach its substance if it has any lets see if we can cross the line forrest suggested then lets explore it from the other side but if we do succeed in crossing it dont make any exclamations of joy or victory because that might attract the attention of whatever brings down those birds who fly in we dont want to be trapped as they were the two girls shuddered together well be very subdued dawn said ill go first forrest decided then you follow me dawn then eve then imbri but shouldnt someone remain on the other side in case we are trapped eve asked so she can tell the others what happened forrest nodded good point maybe dawn should be last so that both of you arent at ridk the twins exchanged another glance forrest noticed that their glances were identical except that one was bright and the other dark and met exactly in the center of the space between them then dawn nodded when there is something animate to check ill cross first she said forrest reached across the space over the line a faint shadow showed on his arm but there was no resistance he stepped across and stood on the other side eve tried it next she reached to the invisible wall and found nothing so she too stepped across she looked back at her sister can you hear me dawn yes dawn agreed so were doing it imbri crossed now lets see if you can analyze it from this side she said eve squatted so that she could touch the line on the ground its still notwait its very faint but i can feel something its not the thing just the energy from it which piles up at the ground itits because it isnt projecting up from the ground its coming down from above down from above forrest echoed surprised but theres nothing up there imbri looked up nothing except xanth is this an idea coming from princess ida in xanth she wouldnt do anything mean like this dawn said we know her shes nice then it must be from somewhere else forrest said can you trace it eve moved her hand maybe its energy but i can feel the slightest tingle it seems to go straight up from the shadow on the ground if it comes from above it must come from somewhere imbri said ptero is turning so shouldnt the shadow be moving across the ground the other three looked at her it should dawn agreed so maybe it isnt coming from above but it is eve said i can tell maybe not from beyond ptero forrest suggested could it curve or bend thats it eve said i can tell now it turns a corner i can feel that much from its nature a corner that way she closed her eyes and pointed thats toward castle roogna imbri said the enemy menace is in castle roogna dawn asked appalled but thats us could you have an enemy in your midst forrest asked feeling a chill no dawn said theres only king ivy and consort grey they would never betray the human territory after all they govern it theres momshed never do it either and aunt ida is ivys twin sister shed never do it it isnt the two of us either and theres no one else in the castle now we know forrest got a weird notion there could be others eve looked at him we have explored every cranny of the castle with our magic theres no one have you explored pyramid both their mouths dropped open pyramid dawn said its a whole separate world in itself anything could be there including even an evil wizard eve agreed we never thought of that its forrests business to think of it imbri said he must be right we have seen how much there can be on a seemingly tiny moon ptero is such a moon pyramid is another and there could be anything at all there including someone who wants to take over ptero your evil wizard it could be dawn breathed that would explain everything but what can we do about it we can go to pyramid forrest said but can we imbri asked you and i came here by leaving our bodies behind and letting our souls become solid but our souls wouldnt fit on pyramid and what of dawn eve their souls are mostly tied up in their living year in xanth how could they go forrest pondered dawn eve must have small soul fragments heremaybe about the same amount as we have relative to ptero enough to animate their bodies on pyramid thats true dawn said souls are living so i know we have just that much but what of you two who are allsoul here well just have to leave most of our souls behind forrest said and use just enough for ptero it should be similar to what we did in xanth leaving our bodies lying in the tapestry room the other three nodded i think we shall have to go to pyramid imbri said but first well have to tell the others moms not going to like this much eve said darkly but shell get used to it dawn said brightly she always does forrest and eve stepped back across the margin and the four of them walked back toward castle roogna forrest was pleased with the progress they had made but nervous about what might be in store for them this mission had just become more complicated than he had expected ou want to go where electra demanded appalled mother we already explained dawn said as if the woman were slow in intellect its the only way to deal with the marginalization eve continued the margins are coming from pyramid so we have to go there to stop them but its just a decoration spinning around princess idas head how could any of you fit there but the question was rhetorical because her next question was suppose you dont return i fear it is a risk they will have to take king ivy said the alternative is to allow ourselves to be marginalized out of existence remember they are going to succeed forrest faun will succeed electra said that says nothing about my daughters but his mission is to advise them how to accomplish it grey said so if he succeeds so do they yes im sure they will ida agreed and i confess to being curious about who lives on pyramid electra seemed to have some continuing misgivings but she knew that the alternative was just as bad they went up to the tapestry room with ida and the four of them lay down on beds there i will guide dawn imbri said and forrest will guide eve it will be somewhat strange at first but that will settle down once we are on pyramid it should be fun dawn said bravely but she looked a smidgen uncertain if nothing goes wrong eve agreed looking two smidgens uncertain forrest was not at all certain that nothing would go wrong but he didnt care to say that he hoped that idas belief in their success would make it true but he had not seen her talent in action so he proceeded with the program he sat up dug out his bottle and took it to dawn sniff this he said hoping that it worked the same way as it did in xanth he pulled out the stopper dawn sniffed a strange look spread across her features she closed her eyes and stopped breathing forrest brought it to eve she sniffed and faded similarly out then he lay back on his own bed the same one he had used in xanth and sniffed it himself soon he was floating as before but this time it wasnt his soul leaving his body exactly it was a tiny part of his soul detaching itself from the main mass and carrying his awareness with it this way it was imbris voice directing dawn she had not had to use the elixir perhaps because she was long accustomed to soul form forrest concentrated and formed his own eye and ear and mouth he oriented oti eve who was lying there with a haze drifting above her rather she was the haze floating above her unused body the body was dark and lovely but looked dead form an eye he told her pull yourself together the mist quivered and coalesced a bulbous eye developed in its top thats it he said encouragingly now form a mouth and ear slowly these things formed this is weird the mouth said it will become familiar once we land on pyramid he told her see if you can form your own shape as we go in a moment well join imbri and dawn and fly to that world she shaped up getting the hang of it and became a somewhat tenuous naked woman you can use your substance to make clothing he told her realizing that she was now going into what amounted to fullsoul status just concentrate on it the same way oh a clumsy dress formed around her now follow me he made sure her eyeballs were aimed in his direction and started moving toward imbri and dawn dawn had made similar progress her form was lighter in color with an illfitting white dress but her face was recognizably her when eve caught up the two gazed at each otherand burst out laughing easy forrest cautioned them as they threatened to fragment into cloudlets the two managed to stifle their mirth actually it was probably a good thing because it meant they were adapting to their situation this way imbri said she was in her mare form she started trotting up a steep invisible hill they followed using their legs to run up the same hill make yourselves smaller as you go forrest said doing it himself keep condensing soon pyramid came into sight above and ahead it looked like a distant moon with a sharp triangular outline it expanded as they contracted until it resembled a close planet then it looked like a huge turning world each of its faces was a different color blue red green and the bottom was gray this is wild dawn remarked appreciatively and perhaps fun eve agreed they oriented on the middle of the triangle they were headed for the blue face forrest maybe you should use the obscurity spell again imbri suggested good idea he reached back into his knapsack and brought out the can invoke he said nothing happened but it was probably working now no evil wizard would notice their landing maybe ooooh were falling dawn cried but we can control it imbri said just focus on slowing when you wish to they came down onto a land that was surprisingly ragged considering the evenness of the outline there were mountains and ravines and tilted plains with lakes splashed between but what was most remarkable was the color it was all in shades of blue forrest hadnt marveled about it before being too distracted by the problem of landing safely but now he realized that even the clouds they had passed were blue so this was no special effect like the blue sky of xanth it was the color of the substance of this world on this side i dont think were on ptero any more dawn murmured that isnt the blue of north its all over the magic of pyramid must be different from ptero just as pteros magic is different from xanth forrest said it may take us a while to adapt im getting dizzy eve said the idea of not knowing the direction by color is awful how will we know from and to there may not be any forrest said age and geography may not be linked on this world oooh ugh dawn said i hope i dont get sick eve added you may be feeling blue forrest said both girls glanced at him sharply and he realized that he had said something funny he had been thinking of the loneliness of leaving one world and trying to adjust to another but he doubted that they would believe that they had landed on a field between mountains it was covered with blue grass and blue flowers it was also tilted when they stood they were at an angle to the plain but they were safely down imbri retained her mare form evidently she had enough soul mass to assume her natural mode on this world she was a glistening blueblack with a sleek hide and nice mane and tail dawn knelt to check the grass this is natural and friendly she reported it will produce seeds for us if were hungry dawn got down beside a rock this is natural and friendly too she said it will make itself soft if someone wants to sit on it so far so good forrest thought given a choice he preferred friendly things then a horde of little creatures came charging across the ground toward them they were like squirrels except that they ran on their hind two legs they were light blue are they friendly forrest asked worried the grass says no dawn said the rock says yes eve said forrest made a quick calculation does that mean that they eat grass and dont eat rocks yes they said together then the creatures were upon them they formed circles around each of the four visitors chirping avidly they all stood perpendicular to the plane in contrast to the visitors these are lings dawn said as she touched one a variety of a broad species that appears in many places there are earthlings xanthlings prerolings and pyramidlings they can make the impossible possible they are widespread on pyramid they noticed us because we stand skew and arent blue forrest was impressed her talent went beyond what he had imagined maybe we need to change so that we arent immediately obvious to folk we might not want to be obvious to he said also i had better renew the spell of obscurity it must have worn off but if the magic is different here the spell wont work imbri pointed out she didnt use her mouth she used a dreamlet evidently she was able to do multiple dreamlets here having more than enough soul to go around so they could all hear her at once unless the lings really can do the impossible he replied can they make us blue yes dawn said after a moment and they can make us tilt with the land the way they do but theres a cost there always is imbri muttered what cost forrest asked warily dawn touched the lings again trying to understand whoever gives anything away on this world gains equivalently she looked up does that makes sense it seems impossible and they are creatures of the impossible forrest said so it must be true so maybe we dont want to accept anything until we understand its consequence if the giver gains what does the receiver lose dawns brow furrowed as she concentrated on the little creatures the receiver gets smaller she said the giver gets larger weird eve said how much larger and smaller forrest asked not a lot but some for an individual gift those who give a lot can become giants eventually but those who accept a lot can get rather small in time and even disappear then lets choose carefully forrest said i think we do need to merge with the natives and if the obscurity spell doesnt work he paused can they fix that it seems impossible so yes they can dawn said then lets accept three things from them the ability to stand at right angles to the terrain as they do and blue color and a working obscurity spell i dont think we need more after all dawns eves talents are working so maybe our direct personal magic isnt lost theyll do it dawn said the lings closed in around the four and suddenly they all changed color and tilted to conform to the terrain the lings looked a size largerand maybe the four visitors were a size smaller forrest brought out his canned spell and invoked it then the lings lost interest roaming on across the field nibbling on stalks of grass so the blanket of obscurity was working again the four surveyed each other their tilt did not seem odd because now they matched the lay of the land but their color was something else dawns red hair was now purple and her white dress was pale blue eves black hair was midnight blue and her dark dress was perhaps two hours off midnight while her skin was light blue mare imbri was also midnight blue forrest was medium blue his furred legs darker than his upper torso and his hoofs darker yet actually we dont look bad dawn said smiling her teeth were metallic blue and now we fit in eve agreed this isnt so bad so far so far forrest agreed but we know there are mean folk here because of what theyre doing to ptero and we dont know their full powers thats why i felt it was worth a price to become halfway anonymous so now that were halfway anonymous what next imbri asked forrest found decision making awkward but that was his job now so he pondered briefly we need to find the source of the margins i think the blue ones must come from this side of pyramid maybe the center dawn nodded makes sense to me so lets go to the center do we know which way that is eve knelt down and touched the ground with one hand yes that way she pointed a direction you can tell direction by feeling the ground forrest asked i can tell anything about anything inanimate the ground is inanimate so i just selected for its orientation the center of this face is that way you girls really do have formidable talents he said i didnt realize how useful such magic could be eve looked at dawn he appreciates us shall i blush or shall you its my turn i think dawn said whereupon she turned as red as her hair but since her hair was no longer red but a shade of blue her blush was blue too however it was a redder shade than the rest of her forrest wasnt sure whether they were teasing him again and decided not to inquire they might decide to make him blush again they were being helpful now but they remained mischievous girls they set off for the center of the blue triangle however they soon encountered a body of water it was on the slope and it sloped the same way but this no longer seemed odd because the four of them were oriented at the same angle oh good im thirsty dawn said is it safe to drink eve lay down at the edge of the water she touched its surface with one finger how come you got to be the one to blush she demanded suddenly im sure it was my turn dawn was evidently surprised well you can have the next turn i didnt realize and how come you rate the bright red hair and green eyes while im dull shades of black well were both blue now but and how come you always get to speak first and i always have to be second ever since we were children eve i dont understand the water forrest exclaimed it did something to her dawn nodded eve whats with the water eve concentrated this is the jealous sea it makes anyone who drinks it or touches it jealous then she heard herself talking and was startled oh no oh yes dawn said thats why youre suddenly jealous of me when you never were before that waters no good right eve agreed still i dont see why you then she stifled herself realizing what was happening we had better not drink this water forrest decided well wa ik around it theres bound to be other water this way imbri said in a dreamlet and trotted around to the side soon the jealous sea gave way and they came to another large body of blue water should i try this first dawn asked oh now youre trying to do my work eve grumped she squatted at the edge and touched the water then she stood i feel like doing something new she said forrest look at this she pulled off her blue blouse she dropped it and it dissolved into soul substance as it left her hand she was left wearing a blue bra that hardly seemed up to the chore of containing her bosom that must be the indecen sea imbri said catching on to the symptom you bet it is eve said pulling off her skirt and letting it dissolve similarly she wore a blue slip that seemed hardly better than nothing forrest had been slow to react but now he turned to face away from her he had had enough trouble when imbri was in girl form the last thing he needed was trouble with an indecent princess what dont you like me eve demanded coming up behind him lets do something really outrageous lets go find another sea dawn cried why i like this one eve put her arms around forrest from behind hey i asked you a question forrest faun i think youre beautiful forrest said struggling to free himself but the more he struggled the tighter she clung to him and the more her body flattened against him she wasnt small the way imbri had been on ptero she was almost his own height and almost his mass but the distribution was way different let go of him sister dear or ill dawn started tugging at eve youll what sister dear eve demanded challengingly ill jump in that water eve paused then she let go she knew that if dawn jumped in she would suddenly be twice as indecent as eve and therefore twice the competition she didnt want that forrest took advantage of his release to move quickly away eves indecent proposal had interested him more than he dared admit he needed to stay well away from her until the effect of the water passed imbri approached him maybe you should ride me she suggested in a dreamlet thanks he hopped onto her back she was big and solid enough now so it was no problem for her and this would keep him pretty much out of the princess reach that was of course why imbri had suggested it they moved on leaving the indecen sea behind they hurried because all of them were getting thirsty and they didnt want to give eve any time to think of anything else to do as it was she remained without her outer clothing and was trying to catch forrests eye it was obvious that the effect of the water had not yet worn off then they came to a large blue rock it extended to the edge of the sea so that they had either to splash through the edge of the sea to get around it or make a long detour the other way they stopped before it considering maybe we could climb over it forrest suggested maybe you could imbri said but i would have to change form which would put her back in girl form he knew she had adopted her natural form so as not to tease him any more her shape shifting ability seemed to be pretty much limited to going between her two natural forms he preferred to keep her as a mare maybe we could make a ramp high enough to cross it he said but there was nothing from which to make a ramp so eve approached the rock ill find out if there is any good way to get past it she said but first how about a little kiss faun that was more mischief forrest faced away from her he didnt want to offend her but he knew that it was only the water that made her so forward well maybe after i get the answer eve said she bent over to touch the rock after making sure that forrest was looking her slip was becoming shorter as time passed she was getting smarter about herindecency her hand passed through the rock she fell into it and disappeared hey she cried this isnt real rock its sham rock dawn tittered you must be lying then its not that kind of sham rock eve retorted but you can lie if you want to very well i dont want to kiss someone all over his fur neither do i eve said i really hate the notion enough lying dawn said then she walked into the rock to rescue her sister in a moment they both emerged we can walk right through it dawn called come on imbri walked cautiously forward carrying forrest the blue darkness of the rock closed about them in a moment they emerged from the other side and there ahead of them was a third body of water forrest hoped that this one was good eve walked toward it are you sure you should dawn asked nervously better than you risking it eve said flopping indecently down on the ground with her legs spread forrest managed to avert his eyes just before disaster she touched the surface a beatific smile crossed her face and drifted some distance beyond oh i feel so relieved what is it dawn asked its a mer sea she said in kindly fashion it forgives everything then wed better drink it imbri said forrest jumped off her back and they went to drink as soon as he touched the water a marvelous feeling of compassion washed through him eve approached him forrest i apologize for my unfortunate behavior i really should not have thats all right he said quickly it was the water yes but you still look doubtful t s just that if you dont mind yes if you would put your clothing back on oh it must have been her turn to blush because she did so to the waist before reforming her outer apparel after that they walked more comfortably on toward the center of the triangle but the blue landscape darkened night was coming that probably meant that xanth was darkening and with it ptero and with it pyramid it had nothing to do with the spin of this world so they looked for a suitable place to spend the night the darkness wasnt complete this was awkward because the blue landscape remained somewhat strange to their eyes and made relaxation for sleep difficult that looks like a nightshade tree lmbri said that should help sure enough under the blue tree there was a pool of darkness it was midnight blueblack the same as imbris hide and impenetrable beside it was a sweetgum tree so they picked a number of the leaves and twigs which were made of sweet gum with a slightly woody flavor this was enough to satisfy their incidental hunger their renewed thirst was satisfied by several small local ponds which turned out to be teas serendipi sereni punctuali joviali and naugh they were especially tempted by the last one but after the experiences of the seas concluded that discretion was best farther along they spied calami adversi frail and pomposi which were worse so they gave up on their search for anything better they drank the serenitea and soon relaxed into sleep in the pleasant darkness of the nightshade imbri remained in her mare form needing no blanket while the girls lay close together and were warm that left forrest alone thinking thoughts that made him feel guilty it had been bad enough when imbri was in girl form now there were two genuine girls next morning they took turns bathing in the pool with punctualitea then promptly got on their way this was just as well because the terrain became much rougher they were no longer walking tilted relative to the larger landscape which suggested that they were approaching the center of the blue triangle and eves testing of the ground verified this but this levelness of the underlying land seemed to encourage the surface features to splurge and the landscape was like tumbled blue blocks left by a giant they had to scramble over and under and around and squeeze through reluctant crevices so that it took them most of a day to travel what might otherwise have been a twohour walk then as they finally cleared the blue blocks they came to a jungle inhabited by cat people fortunately forrest had remembered to reinvoke the blanket of obscurity so the cats didnt notice them that was just as well because when they changed from cat to people form and various combinations of the two they probably wouldnt like being spied on but maybe i can approach one separately and get her advice on the local situation dawn said brightly because there must be something to send out the blue lines and we had better know what we are looking for before we blunder into it the others agreed but when dawn located an isolated blue cat woman and approached her she had a problem please misscan you tell me about this region the woman ignored her and went about her business of scratching out blue catnip i just want to know what is ahead dawn said trying again is there any special danger the cat walked away its the blanket of obscurity forrest said catching on it makes you unnoticeable dawn sighed thats right and im sure it has protected us from much mischief but how can i talk with this feline just touch her and learn all about her dummy eve said a dim bulb flickered over dawns head she touched the cat womans arm she is catrina she announced of the category of feline folk who cater to the catacombs she had a whole collection of cat combs she has made for the ones who live in mazelike tunnels on occasion she brings some combs to the blue wizards castle its very forbidding and no one can get in who isnt invited its guarded by all manner of monsters you can tell all that from one touch of the cat woman forrest asked yes its part of everything about her but i cant get beyond her personal experience shes never actually been inside the castle and knows nothing about its content but shes afraid of the wizard who has given so much away that he has become enormous forrest took a moment to work that out remembering that on this world creatures gained size and power by being generous but how can he give so much away he asked i mean where does he get anything to give away it must come from somewhere from ptero imbri said in a dreamlet thats right eve agreed see if he gives away any talents dawn checked yes he has given away many talentsand i recognize some from people i know on ptero one cat woman got the talent of changing things to strawberry jam for all that it comes out blue another got the talent of charisma which becomes purrsuasion now she is queen of the cat people another got the talent of spellchecking hey isnt that com pewters talent imbri asked no his talent is changing local reality to suit himself forrest said but checking spellsthats a strong one if that belonged to one of the folk captured by the margins it is becoming clear where all the magic is going the blue wizard is getting it and giving it away to add to his power another got the talent of changing the color of the sky dawn continued checking the cat woman so she can make it any shade of blue another got the talent of throwing his voice with his hand so he can make it go anywhere so the wizard is stealing talents from ptero to give away hers imbri said indignantly how can he get away with that apparently pyramids rules dont take account of the outside realm eve said thoughtfully so he has a dandy way to become allpowerful and there must be other wizards on the other faces of pyramid forrest said doing the same thing and we have to stop them dawn said letting the cat woman go on her way does anyone have any idea how there was a silence that bobbled around from one to another none of them knew what to do which meant it was up to forrest i suppose we should approach the blue wizards castle and see what we can do he suggested feebly now i am just a nafve girl eve said with barely a notion of the adult conspiracy and no experience her sister smirked at that but even i know that wed probably get hauled in and executed without trial i couldnt have said it better even if you did usurp my turn dawn said it wasnt your turn you spoke last before me but this is a new subject i always comment first on new things girls girls forrest said finding himself shoved into a role their mother had played on ptero both turned to him their motions so well coordinated that he knew he had been had imbri faced away letting him handle it in his own fashion and what are you going to do about it dawn inquired spank us shall we hoist our skirts for it eve continued so you can smack our pan girls he cried in boldface then more quietly after this mission is done and your friends have been saved and we are no longer in danger of being executed then you may tease me as much as you want and maybe even make me blush again you are both extremely attractive young women and i am a faun and i would love to play games with you in my natural fashion but at present we are in danger and any mistake we make could cost us not only our lives but imperil the fate of all the human folk remaining on ptero so though you may regard me as unqualified and perhaps laughable i hope you will allow me to do the best i can in the role that the good magician requires of me that is to guide you to success in saving yolr land from marginalization the two exchanged a glance then they turned together to look at forrest all four of their eyes were bright we apologize most abjectly dawn said we were indeed forgetting our mission she wiped a tear from her right eye but we ask you to understand that we do take the mission seriously eve continued we tend to joke around when we are under tension because it is better than crying she wiped a tear from her left eye forrest was chagrined i didnt realize i apologize for we will behave from now on dawn said until the mission is done but thereafter eve said we may indeed tease you in fun and play with you in the manner of nymphs that isnt necessary he said quickly i never meant to suggest we are of age dawn said and we are learning respect for you eve added but so now we will apologize to you in the manner of the gourd and leave you with a moderate notion of what we have in mind but the gourd apologies are excessively he began alarmed but he was cut off by dawn who stepped into him embraced him closely and kissed him with such passion that his head seemed in danger of floating away it was as if the sun were rising and blinding him with its warm delightful light then she released him and eve hugged him so firmly that he needed no eyes to appreciate her every contour and kissed him even more passionately this time it was as if the sun were setting and carrying him into the lovely encompassing night then she let him go and he stood stunned with little suns and moons circling his head dawn had primed him and eve had wiped him out from what seemed like a far distance he heard them speaking again we do like you forrest dawn murmured in his left ear and when we do show you our panties we wont be fooling eve murmured in his right ear then they kissed his pointed ears simultaneously forrest found himself lying on the ground with little hearts and planets spinning crazily over his face the girls were fanning him and brushing off his fur i guess we overdid it dawn said he fainted but well be more careful from now on eve agreed we had better change to blue jeans and not too tight but once this is done well show him everything this had gone on more than long enough forrest opened his eyes i think im all right he said i we doubleteamed you dawn said we apologize no he exclaimed desperately they both laughed not gourd fashion silly eve said weve already done that then they helped him up they were now in baggy blue jeans and blue plaid shirts that cut their feminine appeal in half since there were two of them that was still more than enough we thought you were being gallant eve said now we realize that you really do like us as we like you im a faun he repeated i like nymphs recently i have been learning to like real folk too but im not used to the emotions so we gather dawn said you have surely had far more physical experience than we as delicate maidens would care to imagine while we have had more emotional experience than you have been equipped to comprehend it will be fun merging experiences in due course but it is true that we face what may be a deadly challenge here eve said so while maybe we shouldnt have teased you dawn said we do feel that you were being nafve about the approach to the wizards castle and while we dont want to interfere with your role as assigned by the good magician eve said we hope you will reconsider i think i had better he agreed ruefully suppose we approach the castle cautiously staying out of sight and see what we can make of it imbri returned to the dialogue she had been so still that he had almost forgotten her the girls can explore the castle to a degree without even approaching it thats better he agreed if we can find someone who goes in and out of the castle or some object that has been inside we can watch and see imbri said so they made their way on toward the castle forrest refreshed the blanket of obscurity that was proving to be a big help because they might otherwise already have been noticed and surrounded by the wizards minions if he had minions the castle was a huge grim structure of mottled blue there was an odor waiting from it i know that smell imbri said i have encountered it on the moon blue cheese but isnt that squishy dawn asked not when its old enough the cheese of the moon ranges from almost liquid brie to rock hard cheddar any cheese gets firm when exposed to the sun for a few years and magic could stiffen it eve said a guard marched around the castle he didnt see or notice them thanks to the obscurity and their care in hiding and passed quite close look at that dawn whispered his hand is metal sillythats a hand gun eve pointed out it makes sense for a guard the man marched on past them and forrest saw that his hand really was a gun he wondered what happened when the man wanted to shake hands with anyone a light came on at the side door of the castle it was a special shade of bright blue oh i wouldnt want to smear that ultraviolent light bulb eve said those are mean when messed with then the door opened and a man emerged he was carrying a bag of something he walked to a pit some distance from the castle and tossed the bag in then he returned and reentered the castle garbage dawn said ugh but its been inside the castle forrest pointed out so ugh eve said well maybe its not a good idea eve sighed no it makes sense its just not very romantic so they circled the castle at a distance until they came to the pit it had every type of refuse and it stank but they climbed down into it looking for the most recent bag ah here it is eve said putting her hand on it recently carried by jan itor it contains trash and kitchen leavings collected by the night watchman a lert they are from all over the castle just what we need dawn said i know youll just love sinking your hands in all that sister dear with luck some of it isnt dead yet sister dear eve agreed wrinkling her nose so you will also have the pleasure she opened the bag and pulled out a tube toothpaste that pastes the mouth closed no wonder they threw it out dawn spied a large ant struggling to escape the bag she let it walk on her hand this is a deodorant it can make a person lose the sedse of smell i guess they threw it out because they like the smell of blue cheese eve pulled out an old pen this is what is left of an invisible ink pen she said originally the pen held several large ugly animals but each animal used up some of the ink and the pen gradually shrank until it was too small to be of use what about the layout of the castle forrest asked is there a secret entrance whee does the wizard stay in due course piecing through the thrown away junk they were able to work out a fair notion of the castle plan the wizard lived in the highest chamber through which the blue lines passed the lines actually seemed to come from below however the dungeon that was entirely sealed off from outside and only the wizard had access from inside there was no refuse from it evidently it had its own internal garbage dump so the riddle of the lines remained we need more information than we can get from outside forrest said but if even the servants dont know whats in that dungeon who else will know only the wizard imbri said and he keeps the secret so that no one else can steal talents from ptero and give them away for power but someone else must know forrest said because there are three other wizards with the secret and they used it to make themselves supreme in their triangles dawn said and they wont tell us either eve agreed we need a better idea imbri said something flirted with forrests attention and slid away he pursued it and managed to nab it before it escaped it was an idea idea he exclaimed idaher talent is the idea maybe she would have an idea but idas far away dawn said that is her head isand huge eve agreed noi mean the ida who must be here your world of ptero orbits ida of xanth this world of pyramid orbits ida of ptero so there must be an ida here with another world and maybe she would know the secrets of the worlds the girls exchanged another glance this is weird dawn said but maybe true eve said and worth a try imbri said if theres any chance shes here and she would know shes a nice person and surely would help us they climbed out of the pit and walked away from the castle they found a lake that didnt have any objectionable magic and washed up the girls simply waded in with their clothing on and after a startled moment forrest realized that since their clothing was part of their soulstuff it didnt matter then they pondered how to locate ida i can learn much from living folk dawn said but its sort of random finding out whether they know a particular person could take a long time same for the inanimate eve said i could see whether a rock had ever seen a particular person pass but first id have to go through its entire list of people which could be hundreds and it might not recognize a particular person anyway rocks arent very smart grandpa dor could make them talk dawn said that made it much easier of course we had to watch our skirts when grandpa dor was around eve said any rock we stepped over would blab about what it saw unless grandma irene was there dawn said she could glare a rock into silence from far away we miss them eve concluded sadly i think well have to ask someone forrest decided that means letting the blanket of obscurity wear off which in turn is risky imbri said i know it so maybe the three of you should remain protected by it while i stay apart so i can become evident alone maybe you should ride me so that if there is trouble i can gallop away with you forrest thought of protesting but realized that she wanted to take the same risk he did good notion he looked around it seemed to be getting late in the day lets find a place to sleep and in the morning the girls can take the canned blanket spell while we go out they looked for a good place to settle soon they found a small range of blue mountains very small they were hardly waist high but the minipeaks should serve to conceal them from the view of the main path when they lay down but as they approached the range it got up and walked away astonished they watched it depart then dawn laughed a mountain goat she said i should have recognized it they found another place near blue berry bushes which made it handy for supper as they ate the wind came up whistling softly through the trees it made a sad melody i always liked the blues eve remarked but as darkness closed the temperature dropped forrest realized that he hadnt thought to bring a second blanket so he dug out the one he had and gave it to the girls this will do for the two of you he said they looked at him i wish this wasnt a serious mission dawn said because then we could share the blanket with you eve said im sorry too he said but i will join imbri for imbri in mare form was both warm and safe so things worked out after all he lay down beside imbri you really are a nice person she murmured in a dreamlet for him alone no im not i really wanted to sleep with them i know you did right between them knowing that they would probably dissolve their clothing under the blanket just as i did but you refused to do it thats what makes you nice just as you were with me but i should not even be wanting to do such things you are a faun its your nature and what of you he demanded what do you think when you see me reacting to those pretty girls it makes me feel less guilty for what i did to you you didnt do anything to me yes i did and i will make it up to you when i figure out how you know i cant really do anything with those girls theyre princesses they are of a slightly different culture than the one we encountered in xanth maybe its all right for them to play with fauns if they want to i doubt their mother would approve mothers never do in the old days i delivered thousands of bad dreams to worried mothers they think their daughters must be pristine and never do what the mothers did when they were young so the daughters simply dont tell their mothers she chuckled in the dreamlet now that queen iris has been rejuvenated to her twenties she doesnt tell her daughter irene who would not approve iriss present activities folk seldom approve the fun others have still forrest those two girls know their own minds and they know your nature if they decide to celebrate with you you should feel free well i dont feel free i mean i would love it but i dont think its proper her dreamlet image shook her head because you have been placed in the role of adviser which implies parental authority so you act as a parent would though you wish you could act as a normal faun would thats it he agreed as a bulb flashed over his head how well you understand well i have had some experience in dreams and what you feel for the girls is a dream thank you imbri you have helped me to clarify my mixed feelings maybe thats what im here for the dreamlet image walked across to the fading bulb and planted a kiss on it forrest felt the kiss on his face he was startled imbri i will change to maiden form if you ask me i know my own mind too suddenly he was horribly tempted imbri was definitely of sufficient age and experience and she surely did know her own mind but he had to demur i cant ask you to do that i know forrest i know you dont feel free to be a faun or free to make commitments of that nature so you are caught in a personal limbo i wish i could free you from it and i will if i ever find the way meanwhile i respect your stance and i respect you uh thank you would it help if i sent you a wishfulfillment dream it might but i think i need to focus on my mission now and not waste imagination on anything else then i will send you a dream of deep sleep in his minds eye he saw a pale blue cloud floating toward him the words deep sleep were embossed on its surface it loomed large smelling of gentle music and encompassed him and he sank into it with relief he woke much refreshed his head was against imbris gently heaving side dawn eve were up and picking blue berries wearing blue skirts and slippers in a moment they spied his flickering eyelids and came to join him have a berry forrest dawn said plumping herself down crosslegged beside him yes they are very good eve said doing the same their firm legs showed well beyond the knees were they teasing him again he opened his mouth to say but i can pick my own berries but before the first word popped out eve leaned dangerously forward and popped a berry in it was delicious he chewed it then opened his mouth to thank herand she popped in another he gave up the unequal struggle and ate the berries he was given there was something to be said for being catered to by willing maidens but they had a day ahead of them forrest dug into his knapsack and brought out the canned blanket dont invoke this until after imbri and i are out of range he told them and dont do anything too wild we dont know the limit of the obscurity yes master they said together and laughed their tightly bloused bosoms heaving and get out of those nuisance clothes before something freaks me out they glanced down startled oops we forgot dawn said her pale blue blouse rippled and became a heavy blue plaid shirt we just naturally dressed our usual way when we woke eve said her blueblack skirt twisted and formed itself into baggy dark blue jeans after just naturally sleeping nude and dreaming of fun with a faun then they stood together dawns light blue skirt changed to pale blue jeans just a bare instant before it would have shown too much and eves dark blouse changed to a dark shirt just a transparent instant after it had shown more than enough they were definitely teasing him apparently they just couldnt help themselves he would simply have to try to ignore it he wished himself success already he was wondering just how blue their panties might be then he mounted imbri and she walked out onto the path she didnt hurry because they werent trying to go anywhere just to meet someone they could ask directions of he glanced back but didnt notice anyone good that meant that the girls had invoked the blanket of obscurity and unless they did something foolish like dancing naked and screaming he wouldnt notice them soon they approached a woman who was walking along the path in the opposite direction hello forrest called hoping that this was the right way to address a pyramid native she looked sharply at him do you want something from me faun he reminded himself that the folk here always looked for chances to get ahead by giving things away yes actually who are you and what do you want this seemed surprisingly easy i am forrest faun and i want to locate princess ida we dont have any princesses here maybe shes not a princess here she has a moon orbiting her head the woman shook her head never heard of her so i cant help you so i might as well harass you harass me i am polly motph and i can change myself into what i can imagine today i am irritable so i shall become a dragon and gobble you and your stupid horse up hoping you dont taste too bad her face stretched out to become a dragons snout and her body burst out of its clothes to become serpentine but we havent done anything to you forrest protested precisely the dragon said snapping at them imbri leaped into the air to avoid the teeth she landed at a full gallop getting out of there unfortunately forrest wasnt used to riding and wasnt ready when the mare shot forward forrest didnt he landed on his butt in the path well now the dragon said youre too small for a dragon but just right for a griffin she warped into a griffin forrest scrambled to his feet and ran but the griffins beak darted forward and caught his tail his hoofs were moving but he wasnt getting anywhere imbri turned and came charging back naaaay she neighed she leaped her forehoofs aiming for the griffins body curses the griffin muttered in the process releasing forrest then it twisted into a flying snake and wriggled out of the way imbri landed and galloped on unable to halt on such short notice but she had given forrest the reprieve he needed he ran after her hoping to get enough of a lead so that the monster couldnt catch him but polly morphed back into the griffin and took flight forrest heard the wingbeats as she gained on him then suddenly he collided with something remarkably soft he landed in a tangle of limbs he blinked and saw what he hadnt noticed before though she was up against his chest dawn hey i finally got your attention she said drawing her face from his ear and fluffing out her red hair but the griffin has lost track of you eve said he looked at his legs and discovered what else he hadnt noticed they were tangled up with another girls legs eve she drew her face from his belly and fluffed out her tangled black tresses i really didnt think we would get to this stage until after the mission she confessed what are you girls doing we are saving you from getting chomped dawn said prying her flattened bosom from his chest with the help of the blanket of obscurity eve said unwrapping her cramped legs from his thighs because we really dont want you to be hurt even if you would simply be launched back to ptero because without your guidance we would not be able to complete our mission and we really do like your company by this time they had unstuck the rest of themselves from his body both girls were disheveled but still pretty in a wild sort of way uh thank you forrest said realizing that he could indeed have been gobbled and banished from this region for whatever period was required by the framework of pyramid they had saved him from that by intervening in the only way they could considering that he was not aware of their presence by tackling him and bringing him into the coverage of the blanket dawn gave him a direct green eyed glance as bright as sunshine you are welcome eve gave him a sidelong black eyed glance as mysterious as night it was our pleasure forrest tried once more to get through to them you know your teasing ways are very difficult for me to handle dawn shook her head some of what you take for teasing is merely our natural flair eve frowned and in this particular instance we were not teasing we really did want to save you and we really do like you forrest was nonplused i mean you really are two very lovely and provocative young women and i we know dawn said seriously we know our nature and what kind of reaction is to be expected from a male of any type and we are ready eve said just as seriously to make absolutely plain our readiness to accommodate that reaction in due course every time he tried to reason with them it just got worse but i told you this mission we understand dawn began but we are falling n love with you i eve concluded then tears dropped from all four of their eyes forrests jaw dropped but you were just flirting and i knew that it wasnt serious you are princesses and im just a faun we are girls who have never been certain whether any given mans interest in us was because of our royalty dawn said or because of our physical appeal eve continued or our sorceress caliber magic or our novelty as morning and evening twins and we cared for none of these kinds of interest in themselves we wanted to be valued for ourselves but i do know of your royalty and appreciate your beauty and your magic and your novelty forrest protested i am fascinated by all of them so i am no better than any of those you have encountered and i am just a faun of no particular authoity or ability so so you have no ambition with respect to us dawn said just a healthy desire to celebrate with us in your quaint fashion eve said and accomplish your mission and go your way yes i cant remain in your world i must return to my tree and since i know that true human beings dont believe in dalliance for its own sake i am trying to avoid it which is our point dawn said you know us and appreciate all our points yet have no ulterior motive you are the first male outside our family eve said whom we can truly trust therefore we love you but trust is only one element of a meaningful relationship he protested and it is a property of fauns to make the females they touch want to celebrate so your emotions may not be genuine or at least not natural but we are young and fickle and our love will not endure so we hope to indulge it with you during this window of opportunity and then we will go our separate ways dawn said and remember each other with a certain wistful fondness eve said with delight in the memory of the experience which was our very first of this type and no regrets and no regrets forrest was overwhelmed maybe they were influenced by his faunish effect on females but they had understanding too thisthis is not an offer i can decline but while we are on the mission it would be an abuse of the trust placed in all of us to play certain fauny games dawn said and such faun games might interfere with our pursuit of the mission eve agreed so for now we will pretend that this dialogue has not yet occurred but we will never doubt that it will occur in due course uh yes forrest agreed he was deeply touched but knew that this was no time to be distracted from the mission wheres imbri they looked out at the rest of the region polly morph in whatever form was gone imbri was walking along the path looking around as if seeking something she had lost forrest disengaged from the girls and approached the mare hoping that the spell of obscurity was not actually on him since he had not been present when it had been invoked he needed to be visible to imbri hey he called she whirled orienting on him where were you her dreamlet query came the girls hauled me under the obscurity blanket but you were gone for some time we had something we needed to work out oh they are in temporary love with me oh they dont get to meet many males who dont want something from them dont you want something nothing that would diminish them or commit them it seems and did you get it not yet right now the mission is more urgent imbri might have inquired further but at that point another creature appeared on the path forrest quickly mounted imbri so that they could appear as faun and horse and they walked toward the new arrival it didnt resemble polly morph fortunately in fact it didnt resemble anything forrest remembered seeing before anywhere it seemed to be a mass of curving projections some furry some bare some pointed some floppy and some vaguely like nothing specific hello forrest called the thing cringed away dont yell it exclaimed from somewhere within faintly sorry forrest whispered i just wanted to ask no no questions are too loud it said sidling away just what kind of creature are you forrest asked mildly annoyed im all ears it said disappearing around a curve thats true imbri said in a dreamlet now i recognize the different shapes of ears it must be very sensitive to sound maybe well have better luck with the next one forrest said and here he comes imbri said maybe this time i should try addressing him my technique hasnt been getting us far for sure the man looked to be about thirty two wearing an elegant blue royal robe and a blue crown he was smiling and looked friendly hello imbri said in a dreamlet directed to both forrest and the man he looked at her startled why its a night mare he exclaimed former night mare now a day mare imbris dreamlet figure clarified how did you recognize me oh i have had many deliveries i was originally from an awful place called mundania i have my mundane name to prove it todd loren mundania how did you get here im not sure but i think it was my imagination i dreamed of a special world where i was a royal character and could do magic and suddenly i was here with my talent of being able to direct wind to blow to particular places it may not be much but i enjoy it do you happen to know a woman called ida the one with the moon thats the one can you tell us how to find her no but i can direct you to her just follow that gust of wind todd gestured and wind stirred up some dust becoming visible as a fuzzy ball thank you imbris dreamlet figure cried as they pursued the wind you are welcome im always glad to gain size thats right forrest said as they moved on folk grow and gain power as they give things away but i dont think i lost any mass i did because the favor was to me imbri said but i have plenty of mass now if i lose too much ill have to resume maiden shape is all i hope you get it back when we leave pyramid pyramid is so small that whatever we lose here is surely unmeasurable elsewhere he realized that this was probably the case this was the moon of a moon as it were and its entire mass was much less than that of either of their condensed souls on ptero they followed the wind along the path glad that it wasnt zooming wildly crosscountry the way most winds did forrest hoped that dawn eve were keeping up because the wind didnt pause but then it did pause it hovered in place barely hanging on to the blue dust that made it visible it was beside a young woman her hair and eyes were a silver shade of blue and there was even a sprinkling of blue snow on her head she was pretty but looked hard thats not ida forrest murmured there must be a reason the wind is waiting imbri said in a private dreamlet we had better inquire ill do it he looked at the woman hello she looked coldly at him do i know you no and i mean no harm but we are following a wind and it is pausing by you so i wondered whether there is a reason i am forrest faun and this is mare imbri the woman turned deep blue eyes on him i am the lady winter otherwise known as winter lee cheryl jacobs i dont know why i am here but i dont think it is to dance with the wind that nameare you mundane yes at least i was before i came on this trip maybe thats why the wind is pausing it was sent by another mundane and maybe its curious because there cant be many mundanes here another mundane winter asked interested yes a man he wears a crown he seemed nice maybe i should meet him at least he would understand why i find this place so strange the wind divided and one gust swept back up the path just follow that wind forrest said it should lead you right to him thank you winter said smiling so brilliantly that it seemed like sunrise she followed the gust heyi feel heavier forrest said surprised you just did someone a favor imbri said i think the wind did recognize her as a mundane and felt an affinity because todd loren was mundane they should like each other hes mature and nice and shes young and pretty i guess so he agreed the half gust of wind resumed its motion and they followed it as the path wound around blue hills across blue fields through blue forests past blue lakes and under blue skies then it paused again by what looked like a cemetery this is just a field full of crosses forrest said they must be marking graves indeed there were big crosses and little ones each one carved from wood and slightly different from all the others some were fairly straight but others were curvaceous in fact they seemed to be about as individual for crosses as people were for people forrest had a vested appreciation for wood and found it intriguing in its own right whatever form it might be carved into but he didnt recognize this particular variety but in xanth graves arent marked by crosses imbri said this isnt xanth in fact it isnt even ptero who knows what the rules may be on pyramid he was suspicious because of the way the crosses had been used in contrary centaurs game on ptero if these were anything like that he wanted no part of them maybe so she agreed let me send a dreamlet down to see whether theres a body dreamlets can explore not exactly but i can send them to anyone including the dead she concentrated and he saw a dreamlet in a little cloud float down and disappear into the ground below a cross in a moment it bobbed up again its dream figure looking perplexed no theres nothing there imbri said in a separate dreamlet to forrest so they are just stuck in the ground forrest said they arent alive i suppose eve could tell us all about them if she were here perhaps we should wait for the girls to catch up id like to be sure they are all right as long as the wind is willing to wait all right it does seem to be a smart gust at that the swirling wind darkened blushing though it could not speak to them it evidently understood what they said that gave him a notion while we wait gustis there anything to eat around here the gust swept across to a billboard on the far side of the field it had a painting of a grand assortment of berries all were in shades of blue of course but seemed to be of many varieties they looked delicious but this is just a picture forrest said the gust brushed up against the picture and it almost seemed that some of the berries moved so forrest reached out to touch a berryand it was round not flat he picked it and put it to his mouth a billberry he exclaimed i should have known imbri trotted over billberries they are very good for you she put her mouth to the billboard and took a bite of berries but then she spat something out i got a billfold by accident her dreamlet figure said making a face forrest saw the oh ect on the ground it was a wad of folded paper gray on the front green on the back it did look inedible apparently the billboard wasnt perfect there was some contamination something tapped him on the shoulder he jumped there was a vague female shape smelling faintly of morning ohdawn he said relieved i hadnt noticed you because of the blanket of obscurity her voice breathed in his ear i can see you quite clearly and so can i eves voice murmured in his other ear then they both nibbled on the tips of his ears stop that he exclaimed imbri looked around did i swish you with my tail i didnt mean to no the girls are here she squinted why so they are that obscurity is effective now that i know what to look for i can see them so could forrest eve would you check one of those crosses and learn what its all about the wind brought us here so there must be some reason ill be glad to her vague form kissed his cheek and departed that wind must like you dawn said kissing his other cheek i think its just doing its job maybe it appreciates the way i cooperated with it to send lady winter to todd it has been very helpful eve is signaling we had better go there forrest looked but no longer saw eve the blanket had covered her ill lead you dawn said she took his hand in hers squeezing his fingers in a way that reminded him exactly how female she was these girls might be young but they had learned a good deal already in a few steps they approached a gradually clarifying figure holding a cross as forrest concentrated eve became recognizable these crosses enable folk to cross things she said eyes ts mountains rivers peopleanything then they could be useful forrest said relieved the function of pyramid crosses was different from ptero crosses indeed they are put out here for anyone to take and use but when one is used their maker gains the benefit of a given favor and the one who uses them loses mass so we dont want to take too many can one cross enable more than one person to cross something a big one can a small one is limited both in person and distance four small ones would enable four people to cross one mountain while one big one might enable all four people to cross a whole range of mountains but the big one will exact a greater amount of mass so we dont want to use any of them more than we need to suppose we take several crosses but dont use them then there is no price it doesnt matter where the crosses are only how they are used then we should take a fair collection of them and not use them unless we have to he decided how intelligent eve said are you trying to tease me again no just to remind you he walked among the crosses that was when he discovered that he was still holding dawns hand she had not reminded him he let go embarrassed and heard her obscure chuckle i think we should each carry two small ones and one big one can we do that i mean i have room in my knapsack but do the rest of you have a way to carry things sure dawn said in our purses and i have a pack imbri said forrest leaned down to take a cross but now eves hand stayed him i wouldnt she murmured why not because that particular one is made of petrified wood forrest froze then he moved his hand very slowly down barely touching the cross fear coursed through him it was true this cross made anyone who touched it terrified but i might be able to use this too he said if i got caught by a monster i couldnt escape but how can you take it with you if it frightens you imbri asked it shouldnt frighten me once im not directly touching it he reached into his knapsack and pulled out a handkerchief he wrapped this around the cross so that he could pick it up without touching it the handkerchief was thin so his fright was there but he was able to handle the cross until it dropped into his knapsack that was a brave thing to do dawn said taking his hand again no it wasnt i was scared but i knew there was no danger its not handling danger but handling fear that makes a person brave isnt it forrest hadnt thought of it that way maybe but it had to be done if i wanted that cross they each took two small crosses which disappeared into their various packs and purses without trouble but the large crosses were too big to fit finally eve found one folding cross and they fit that into imbris pack which was larger than the others that would have to do now the wind having dallied all this time amusing itself by whirling up dry blue leaves and grass and making funnelshapes of them resumed its forward progress they followed the blanket of obscurity was fading so that the girls remained fairly clear the path led past several huge blue bee hives they had been constructed in the shape of wooden boats with closed tops and these were arranged in a giant semicircle the bees were very large and they were flying in with blue books forrest paused to take in this scene i never knew that bees collected books he said surprised eve went up cautiously to touch one of the fancy hives it seemed that enough of the blanket of obscurity remained on her to keep the bees from being disturbed then she laughed these are arkhives she explained where the bees store books so they wont be lost that must be why these bees are so large they are constantly doing good deeds for this region by saving all these good references they went on hurrying to catch up with the gust but now they came to a wide blue lake and the wind was moving right across it toward a blue island forrest considered the water do you suppose we could swim eve touched the surface with a finger i think not this water contains all manner of horrible blue monsters then this must be what we have the crosses for we had better each use one small one saving the other for the return trip they dug out their small crosses and held them up uh how do they work forrest asked belatedly just describe where you wish to cross and say invoke eve said to that island forrest said looking at it invoke suddenly he was there and the cross was gone he felt lighter though that might have been his imagination he turned to look backand the others arrived they made streaks as they crossed the water in half an instant that was fun dawn said but we dont want to do it too many times eve said the wind was waiting for them they followed it along a winding path to a blue ridge of mountains on the ridge was a house built of blue stone as they approached it a woman emerged aunt ida dawn cried going up to hug her you havent changed at all eve said doing the same ida returned their hugs then inquired you seem like such fine girls do i know you orrest approached i must explain we are from the world ofof ptero do you understand oh my yes but i have never had visitors from there before how nice i am forrest faun and this is mare imbrium and these are dawn eve the daughters of prince dolph and electra i am so glad to meet you do you have nieces here dawn asked i dont think i do but this is not the same world as ptero yes eve said we have been trying to get used to its rules we have come to stop its wizards from hurting our people on ptero oh are they doing that i didnt know im afraid they are forrest said we hoped that you would know how to stop them ida shook her head this caused her moon to wobble and careen into view apparently it had been hiding behind her head until now look at that dawn exclaimed a doughnut eve said the moon zipped back into hiding please dont use that word ida said the correct term is torus oh were sorry dawn said blushing a modest blue extremely sorry eve agreed blushing an immodest blue were so ignorant forrest knew that this was at least in part an act similar to their flirtation with him but it was nevertheless impressive the twins were very good at manners well i suppose you couldnt know ida said being from another world yes but we want so much to learn dawn said and never to make the same mistake again eve said ida glanced at forrest in a way that indicated that she was not being much fooled at any rate i was saying to my regret that i dont know the answer to your problem the blue wizard has confined me to this island to keep me as he puts it out of mischief i am surprised that you were able to locate me so readily we asked around forrest said we thought that since you have the sorceress talent of the idea you might have an idea about how we might proceed why yes of course you mean you do know how to stop the wizards no but i do know how you should proceed they looked at her blankly you see ida explained i know where the answer is to be found i dont have it because i cant go there her eyes fixed momentar iy on her moon oh no on torus forrest asked weakly yes im sure that the ida who lives there has the answer thats why the wizard confined me to be sure that no one had access to my moon and no creature of this world is able to come here a powerful spell repels them but perhaps he didnt reckon on visitors from another world it was beginning to make sense we are certainly from other worlds forrest said the girls are from ptero but imbri and i derive originally from xanth xanth what realm is that forrest exchanged half a glance with imbri ida didnt know about xanth it is a larger land imbri said in a dreamlet on it is princess ida about whose head ptero orbits fascinating and what larger land does xanth orbit on larger land forrest asked blankly since pyramid orbits the ida on ptero and ptero orbits the ida on xanth what lands ida does xanth orbit forrest found his jaw hanging as low as imbris jaw which was surprising because her mares mouth was larger than his why we dont know he said ida smiled maybe after your mission here is done you can descend to that world and find out i wonder whether its an infinite progression i wonder too imbri said but now you will want to visit torus ida said you will have to leave much of yourselves here however fortunately i have room in my house but i am obliged by our nature to take some of your mass for the favor of facilitating your trip unless you can do me a return service we hope to free you from this island and free pyramid from the tyranny of the wizards dawn said ida shook her head these are hopes rather than realities we can tell you all about what we find on torus eve said so that you will know it as well as if you had been there yourself ida smiled now that is a service no one else can do me that i would very much value so though i may gain some of your masses when you go you wont miss it because your bodies will be asleep here and you will recover it when you tell me about torus do come this way she led them into her blue stone house which was neatly kept there were two beds there and a couch the girls lay on the beds and forrest took the couch and imbri lay comfortably on the floor then ida sat between them in her chair forrest brought out his bottle he gave each girl a sniff and lay back on the couch and sniffed it himself one by one they dropped into unconsciousness as their soul fragments drew free the process was becoming more familiar with experience this was the third time for forrest and imbri and the second time for the girls efficiently they waited up forming into floating shapes making eyeballs and ears and mouths soon they looked reasonably like themselves then they flew toward torus condensing as they moved the world loomed larger its doughnut shape becoming dramatic where should they land on it imbri seemed to know so they followed her horse form she headed first for the center of the hole then to the inner surface the world was variegated which was a relief that meant that they would not be confined to shades of a single color i am orienting on idas identity imbri said in a dreamlet it is an ability of night mares to locate the sleepers who need their dreams its not very accurate when folk are awake so it didnt help on pyramid but i think well be reasonably close to her when we land they were drifting toward a forest in the forest was a glade and in the center of the glade was a single large tree that did seem like the best place to land as their navigation was a bit unsteady and a clear spot was best indeed they came down somewhat hard having misjudged the oddly contoured terrain of torus which curved away to east and west and upward to north and south imbri landed solidly on her four hoofs but forrest fell on his back and the two girls tumbled in spreadlimbed disarray that would have been embarrassing if they hadnt been in blue jeans as they got to their assorted feet they discovered that the glade was not nearly as nice as it had seemed from afar it was bare of grass and littered with bones what kind of place is this dawn asked nervously eve touched a bone uhoh she said this bone belonged to an animal that was eaten by a tangle tree but that means dawn said looking quickly around now they all saw it the single tree in the center was the largest awfullest tangle tree forrest had ever seen it had an enormous number of tentacles and these were now quivering as the tree realized that prey was near we have about half an instant to get out of here forrest said starting to run but a tentacle lashed out and struck his knapsack there was a dragon claw on the end that hooked right in in only a quarter of an instant forrest was hauled into the air imbri galloped over ill rescue you she cried in a dreamlet ill bite through the vine before it hauls you into the maw you cant dawn cried that tentacle is antiored with dragon scales she was correct imbri reared up on her hind feet and clamped her teeth on the tentacle just over forrests head there was a clang as enamel ground against metal then imbri dropped down unsuccessful get away from here the rest of you forrest cried not while youre in trouble eve said well stop it somehow you cant stop an armored tangle tree but the two girls heedless of their own safety drew two sharp little knives he hadnt known they carried and reached up to stab at the tentacle from either side one must have gotten a point past the armor because suddenly the tree squealed in pain or outrage and the tentacle hauled forrest up twice as high then two more tentacles whipped out and wrapped around the girls they screamed as they too were hauled into the air oooh this is worse than i thought eve cried as she reached up to touch a metal scale the tree has eaten many dragons and saved their scales to make it impervious dawn reached up similarly and it has healing elixir in its sap so that it heals as fast as it is injured look at that trunk eve cried it has mirrors to make it almost invisible and it has the strength of a sphinx dawn said gleaning more information from the living part of the tentacle she touched if the trunk is also protected by dragon scales eve said then it cant be burned even by salamander fire and it has a voice and can talk dawn said for sure the tree said now which of you delectable creatures shall i chomp first none of them imbri cried in a dreamlet ill kick your bark in oh sure three more tentacles whipped out and wrapped around the mare soon she was dangling in air too ill send you toruss worst dream imbri threatened i am toruss worst dream then forrest got halfway smart he reached into his pack and brought out the canned blanket of obscurity spell invoke he cried the blanket waited out and covered him and part of the tentacle that held him the tree for ot about both the tentacle went limp letting forrest drop to the ground ha hathe faun got away dawn cried gleefully what faun the tree demanded the one you caught eve said now you cant eat him ill find him and the tree wrenched its roots from the ground and began writhing across the glade searching for its missing prey it shot tentacles out to circle the edge of the glade so that no one could escape even if unseen all four of them stared astonished this truly is the worst tangle tree ever imbri said now a tentacle reached into the trees central foliage and brought out a sword where are you faun the voice rasped come taste this steel i liberated from a human fool who attacked me he didnt taste very good but i love his sword that sword was whipping around so swiftly that forrest had to stay well back to avoid it even if the tree couldnt locate him directly it knew there was a faun somewhere and was bound to get him eventually he could feel the merest tingle of the blanket covering him and realized that he could move it about if he handled it carefully that explained cathryn centaurs throwing motions she really did have hold of her blankets then dawn tried a new tack i know all about you tangler she called you lied youre not toruss worst dream what about the golem king the whole tree shuddered i will eat you first you impertinent creature it said you look delicious the tentacle started to swing toward the trunk i am delicious dawn retorted but you dont deserve the because the golem king is worse than you and he should get me the tentacle hesitated youre bluffing the tree said you dont know anything about the golem king forrest made his way toward her if he could throw the blanket over her before she got eaten the tree would lose track of her too yes i do dawn said the tree didnt know that she was reading all this information from its own partly living wooden flesh the golem king can make golems in a second he can make golems like people and like tangle trees and like dragons and he can make them life size or gnat size hes a golem himselfand so are you you big fake aieeee the tree screamed and if he ever got hold of a pretty living girl like me he wouldnt eat me hed marry me dawn concluded triumphantly because hes lonely down in the earth region where he lives because nobody else will go there hes cunning and can change his form instantly but he has no company and thats what he wants most of all so when he finds out that you caught me and ate me instead of turning me over to him hell destroy you with one flick of his finger or maybe turn you into a golem privy potty or a golem sphinx dropping eve added tittering it almost worked the tree shuddered and the three captives were lowered toward the ground but then it recovered some of its wooden cunning but ill make sure he never finds out ill gobble all of you down immediately and bury your bones where theyll never be found the tentacle started moving again forrest leaped the last few steps toward dawn and flung the blanket over her head he couldnt see it and hoped it didnt hang up on the tentaclevine holding her then she dropped slowly to the ground it had worked the tangler had forgotten about her oooo thank you she exclaimed kissing him firmly on the right eye i was afraid you wouldnt be in time you were great he said you made it pause long enough she kissed him again say i have an idea not now he cried realizing that her contact with him was affecting her in the usual way we have to save the others oh yes she agreed remembering ill help they ran after eve as the tangler hesitated realizing that it had been about to do something but not remembering quite what forrest realized that the blanket of obscurity must work as much on the mind of any person or creature who might notice as on the folk being covered it was an excellent spell they held two ends of the blanket and tossed it over eve in a moment she dropped to the ground joining them in their coverage get imbri she said urgently indeed it was time for imbri had been carried almost to the gaping wooden maw in the trunk of the tree the mirrors had been moved aside so that its complete horror was evident the several tentacles holding imbri swung her back and forth getting ready to heave her into the maw forrest and the girls ran close and heaved the blanket with all their force it sailed over the mare and into the maw oh no the maw creaked closed there was a crunching sound the blanket had been consumed now they were exposed the tree became aware of all of them there you are it creaked now has it been an hour imbri asked i dont think so for it took an hour for the canned blanket spell to recharge they had to find their own way out if they were going to it seems to be in doubt imbri remarked let me see if i can peek into its vegetable brain they waited while the tentacles flailed why isnt it attacking us dawn asked shuddering maybe the blanket tastes funny eve said then imbri had it its forgotten its mouth her dreamlet exclaimed it cant eat us because it has lost track of how the blanket saved us after all forrest said relieved they walked slowly out and the tree ignored them obsessed with its own problem it knew it wanted to do something but couldnt figure out what it was its wooden mind wasnt very sharp and it couldnt focus well on more than one thing at a time so they were escaping but it was no sure thing they made it to the edge of the glade the tree was still distracted they breathed a collective sigh of relief and lets stay clear of the golem king too dawn murmured forrest looked around the glade was surrounded by thickly meshed thorny brambles except for several paths above loomed the vast shape of the other side of torus curving around and downward north and south like a massive rainbow it made him feel dizzy as if he were about to fall upward toward it so he pulled his eyes back to the ground the girls following his gaze looked similarly giddy just out of curiosity dawn began why didnt you use the petrified wood cross to scare the tree off eve finished ouch he had a ready answer i never thought of it neither did the rest of us imbri pointed out they followed a path out it was intended to bring prey into the tanglers glade but it was a two way track it led in due course to a village do we want to meet any people forrest asked the others has it been an hour yet dawn asked almost i think then maybe we can use it if we get into more trouble lets talk with the people i can learn a lot if i can touch one of them that seemed good because though ida should be reasonably nearby they had no idea in which direction the villagers might know they walked on in there was a banner flying in the center it said hollowday a holiday imbri asked they dont seem to be celebrating eve approached a wan villager excuse me sir she said prettily what are you celebrating he glowered at her nothing but you have the big banner up its hollow day its empty we have nothing to do on it we hate it then maybe you should find something good to do eve suggested that would brighten the day like what the man demanded grumpily like helping a group of strangers to find ida the lady with a moon he considered very well take that path he pointed out one they wouldnt otherwise have noticed thank you so kindly dawn said flashing him a smile and a bit more as she bowed slightly so very very kindly eve added doing much the same it doesnt matter the man said we exchanged he faced away from them hey villagers we have something to celebrate there was a cheer forrest and the others moved on along the path do you think this is really the way forrest asked i dont want to be unduly suspicious but he was telling the truth imbri said in a dreamlet i can tell when a person isnt guarded they really were looking for something to celebrate and couldnt think of it themselves dawn said shaking her head this is a very small world eve said maybe they dont have much sense which is our good fortune forrest said soon the path brought them to a large lake or small sea it curved up at the end and down at the sides in the manner of this world they stood at the bank and gazed across it barely in sight was an island on pyramid she was on an island imbri remarked do you suppose its the same here it could be dawn said brightly or it might not be eve said darkly forrest sent a grizzled glance at them you girls are not being really helpful they exchanged one of their own glances forrest wasnt sure why as they pretty well knew what was on each others minds before they spoke should we be helpful dawn inquired maybe in exchange for a kiss eve answered no physical contact forrest cried aw they said together we do have a mission imbri reminded them with just the merest hint of annoyance suggested by the background image of her dream let a horse kicking two girls in the rear so hard that they went flying through the air to land with a double splash in the lake i think that means no kiss dawn said with faintly feigned regret well have to help without repayment eve agreed with mock irritation its your turn its my turn eve walked to the edge of the water and poked her finger in this is the sarah sea containing the isle of niffen which is a large island with white beaches and lush colorful foliage sparkling streams run in all directions and there is one huge flat rock right smack dab in the middle of the island its inhabited by unicorns dragons pegasus griffins mermaids elves winged goblins harpies genies and assorted crossbreeds all living in harmony especially niffy gliff who is half dragon half pegasus with a unicorn horn from somewhere in her ancestry they dont much trust strangers because once hunters came in an ugly little boat wanting to capture and kill the people and animals and beild a squat commercial tourist hotel instead fortunately niffy and his friend cliffy put on their scariest costumes snuck up on the hunters cried neee hhhoooooouuuuu and scared them out of their skins saving the isle she stood and came to take forrests hand forrest was impressed you can tell all that just from sticking your finger in the water its my talent eve said just as my sister could tell all about every nymph you ever chased and caught just from touching one of your fingers including the one who turned out to be a harpy but of course she wouldnt tell anybody about that or about the way the leaves of the neglected tree got disgustingly soiled with thank you forrest said tightly your talents are indeed impressive so is ida on that isle oops i didnt check for that eve let his hand go knelt and stuck her finger back in the water yes she lives on the flat rock and goes each day to fetch water from the nearest sparkling stream she stood again and took his hand again what was she up to now how do you know about the living creatures on the isle imbri inquired isnt that dawns talent not exactly dawn said our talents overlap somewhat so when i tell everything about some living thing i also know what it is wearing where it lives and what the weather around it is even though these are inanimate because they relate to the creature im examining similarly dawn knows about the living things that relate to the inanimate thing she is examining so if i touched a pool and she touched a fish in the pool we would both learn most of the same things that does make sense imbri agreed forrest didnt comment he was embarrassed because of the discovery of just how much the girls had fathomed of his past history he had thought of them as provocative but essentially innocent creatures now he knew that they knew everything they wanted to know of whatever nature probably the dread adult conspiracy of silence had never had much effect on them though they would have been careful to seem properly innocent so what should we do now adviser dear dawn asked brightly now that we know where ida is forrest darling eve added darkly giving his hand a tweak we go see her he said gruffly well have to use our other small crosses oooh suppose we get trapped on the isle of niffen dawn said and theres nothing to do but live there forever and raise our children eve said which we will no doubt have to signal the stork for many times somehow coaxing the cooperation of a reluctant faun imbri sent a dreamlet of two lovely nymphs one fair and one dark tugging a reluctant faun toward a love spring his hoofs were leaving dragmarks in the soil the mare was evidently enjoying the way the twins constantly put him on the defensive both girls laughed appreciating the apt image we wont get trapped forrest said trying to sound neither intrigued nor grumpy well have the one big cross left and anyway once we talk with ida we can return directly to pyramid to pursue our mission the two girls exchanged yet another unnecessary glance are we losing our teasing skill dawn inquired of no one in particular or is he losing his teasability eve asked of the same person once more she squeezed his hand he just wants to get the job done forrest said finally freeing his hand and taking his small cross from his knapsack the girls dug theirs out of their purses forrest was never sure what happened to those purses when they werent in use they just seemed to disappear imbri used her teeth to get hers then they invoked them almost together and zoomed across the lake to the isle of niffen it was exactly as described the beach was white and the foliage was lush and colorful and there gliding in was niffy gliff the combination griffin pegasus with the horn he looked threatening we arent hunters imbri cried in a dreamlet we are visitors from another world who must talk with ida neigh niffy inquired well were not exactly friends of hers imbri said in the dreamlet but we know herher cousin on the other world and she sent us to talk with ida so im sure well be friends the moment we meet niffy considered and decided that that was good enough neigh he said and led the way they followed him along a nice path that wound through the lush foliage to a sparkling steam the lushes looked a bit tipsy but the sparkles were beautiful they came to the huge flat rock which had steps at one edge so they could climb to the flattop and there was a nice little house with a pleasant little garden ida came out to meet them she looked just the same except that her moon was in the shape of a cone i am told you know my cousin she said what cousin would that be a number of creatures had gathered around the house evidently news of the visitors had spread rapidly across the isle they seemed to be in a state of readiness forrest realized that if the creatures thought the visitors were not on the level they would be quickly leveled cousin may not be exactly the right word forrest said she is your analog on the world of pyramid about whose head this world of torus orbits she thought you could help us learn what we must know to save pyramid from cruel exploitation by the colorful wizards i why i suppose i could ida said i dont know the answer myself but i believe its on cone forrest quailed we have to go to another moon were already on the moon of a moon of a moon ida smiled i suppose that would get confusing no i can take a come section and get the information let me concentrate she concentrated the moon took note as its point pointed straight up for a full orbit yes i have your information ida said but there is a complication you may not have considered there always is imbri muttered in a dreamlet sent to forrest alone what complication is that he asked ida it is that here on torus anyone who does another a favor or a service incurs a burden of emotion the greater the service the greater the emotion so we are rather careful about the services we render and to whom emotion forrest said as in happiness or sadness not exactly as in liking or loving uhoh dawn murmured mischief eve agreed forrest agreed does this mean that if you do me the service of telling me what i need to know you willthat is exactly considering the importance of the information to your mission i will be in love with you and without meaning any affront to you i must say that i do not care to be in love with a creature who will immediately leave me forever i would not care to have that happen either forrest said even if i were staying here i am not at all sure it would be proper you surely have some prince who will seek you out at some time that would be nice ida agreed is there any way to counter or nullify the effect imbri asked in a general dreamlet yes there is people can exchange equivalent favors so that the effect cancels out these must occur at about the same time if one favor is done at one time and the other at another time both will incur the penalties in fact this is the way marriages are made by the exchange of favors on consecutive days so if you have some favor you can do me in return that is as valuable to me as my information is to you we shall be all right oh wow dawn said we were all doing each other favors trying to escape that tangle tree so they canceled out eve agreed but then i got a favor from that villager no you did him the favor of showing him how to have a good day imbri said in a dreamlet it was a fair exchange oooo thats what he meant dawn exclaimed clapping her hands when we thanked him and gave him something to see he said it doesnt matterwe exchanged and we didnt understand eve agreed he meant that we didnt love him and he didnt love us so there was no point in showing him anything interesting but he was interested or he wouldnt have said that es its nice to know that our stuff works here too you girls seem to enjoy impressing men ida remarked they both smiled acknowledging it but then you did a service for forrest dawn said telling him all about the lake and isle which had enhanced her feeling for him forrest realized ruefully that explained some things but there seemed to be no point in discussing that now at least they could balance things with ida this was looking better what information do you want that is this valuable unfortunately what i most desire is knowledge of something i fear you would be even less in a position to know than i as you may have noticed the isle of niffen is on a small sea i would like to know all about this sea from its name to its deepest creatures i already know all about the isle but the water has eluded me i can eve started but forrest cut her off with a sharp glance her sister wiped the cut off her face the glance had been too sharp you dont want to do that forrest said because then you would love ida then eve would love ida and ida would love forrest dawn said thats no good but suppose eve gave forrest the information imbri asked and then he gave it to ida in exchange then eve would love forrest dawn protested doesnt she already eves mouth formed a pretty round i do we both do dawn said but wouldnt she love him more than i do i think i already do eve said because it was for him i got the information on the lake and isle i didnt realize the effect it would have on me oh my dawn said dismayed thats why you were holding his hand was i i suppose i was i didnt realize you could do him a favor some other time dawn imbri suggested maybe so dawn agreed thoughtfully i will keep it in mind forrest wished he had known of this complication before asking eve for the information on the lake he had wondered about the hand holding because up until that time the two girls had done things evenly but he hadnt understood so had done her no return favor but that complication would have to wait forrest faced ida eve can tell anything about anything inanimate she will learn all about the lake and tell me and i will exchange that information with you does this seem fair yes remarkably fair ida agreed then eve and i will go to the water and learn what we need meanwhile dawn and mare imbri can chat with you if you like im sure there are incidental things you could exchange keeping them in balance even as he spoke he wondered why he had set it up that way surely he didnt want to be alone with eve at this time or did he yes surely ida agreed so forrest and eve followed the path back to the water the assorted animals of the isle let them be knowing that they were not hunters eve insisted on holding his hand again if i am going to be even more in love with you i want to grab every moment i can she explained but such contact with me will only increase your desire toto do what we should not it cant she said dreamily forrest decided not to argue though he was not entirely at ease with this for one thing this was the first time he had been really alone with either girl so the inhibition of numbers was gone eve was evidently working up to more than just information and he was evidently facilitating it though he knew he should not the complications of relationships with normymphly women were both confusing and tantalizing they reached the water and she knelt down ready to stick her finger in then she stood no i have a better notion she said approaching him what is that he asked warily this she lurched suddenly and pushed him into the water when he tried to catch his balance she flung her arms around him and hauled him down they both made a great splash as they fell in but there may be water monsters he cried trying to scramble back out she just clung more tightly no there arent not at this beach now let me tell you all about it but you dont have to hold me while you tell me he protested yes i do she said firmly very firmly for she was plastered against him and she had dissolved all her clothing you are taking advantage of the situation he informed her and he was letting her he realized i certainly am this is almost as good as a love spring but whats the point you know im not going tonot until the mission is done i know but you will be sorely tempted and you will remember what i feel like this close and when the time comes you will not try to find a pretext to avoid it she was eerily accurate already it took most of his willpower to maintain his nominal diffidence how do you know so much about me when its dawns talent to know all about living creatures not yours he was trying to distract her they had already explained about the overlapping of their talents she told me but doesnt she have aan equal interest why should she tell you how to when her chance comes shell do the same my chance just happened to come first so she didnt interfere and i wont interfere during her turn but how does she know you wont our agreement is up to but not including the stork we must be together for that so ill give her the chance to do you an equivalent favor before then so well be even again and well both give you opportunity to do us favors on other days so your interest will match ours we will keep you quite busy for a while you girls are almost frightening in your cooperation never trust a sorceress she agreed let alone two of us forrest resigned himself these girls had his number and knew it he eally didnt need to do them any favors to find them dangerously appealing tell me all about this lake she started talking punctuating her sentences with kisses on his ears it took some time at last they emerged from the water forrest was shaky not from the information but from eves kisses there might not be magic in them but they nevertheless had extraordinary force she was right he would be dreaming of her during whatever off moments were available and when the time came he would not make any excuses she had captured his desire the irony was that his weakness of the moment gave her the pretext to put her arm around him and help support him she hadnt bothered to form clothing and her touch remained electric if you had been a nymph all this would have been abated in seconds he muttered with no emotional complications instead you have chained me i know she said smugly youre not used to dealing with women with minds were dangerous we are aware of consequences and we know how to make a temporary interest permanent she nudged him without using an elbow but somehow this session hasnt changed my feeling for you it couldnt increase what was already complete he said glumly maybe i he decided not to inquire what she meant she surely understood further aspects that would only alarm him worse he had anticipated problems with terrain monsters magic and people but never with emotions he had hardly known what emotions were before all this began now he knew that they were the most formidable of the lot they returned to the central plateau along the way forrest recovered his steadiness and his fur dried and eve shifted to dry clothing their immersion in the water was not obvious she released his hand so that even that aspect disappeared he was struggling to keep his face and manner straight and was privately amazed at how readily eve made herself look cool as if nothing of any kind had even been thought olviously girls were better at this than men or fauns at least that was one close call imbri said in a dreamlet if she had kissed you on the mouth instead of the ears dawn also looked knowingly at them without comment forrest approached ida the name of the lake is the sarah sea he began he went on to describe its depths in meticulous detail as he spoke he found himself becoming increasingly interested in ida she was an attractive woman with a remarkable talent and now he was in a position to know how special her moon was eve had tempted him wickedly but he knew it was desire rather than love ida did not tempt him in that manner but his feeling for her was becoming encompassing he wanted to stay with her forever and bask in the delight of her mere presence this he realized was love an emotion he had never before experienced it was different from desire though there were connections between the two should ida express any interest at all in desire he realized it would spring fully formed from the broad base of the larger emotion fortunately she gave no such indication though her moon angled to observe him better now it is my turn ida said when he finished you have delivered in full measure and satisfied my lifelong curiosity do not be concerned about your present emotion it will shortly pass here is the information you need you have to talk to the margins and explain to them that they have been deceived that they are not giving favors they are stealing them and will be diminished thereby margins forrest asked the lines the creatures who generate the lines ida said they are kept in the cellars and not told much of anything that is true a bulb flashed over forrests head so if they learn the truth theyll stop generating the lines and the power of the wizards will collapse ida smiled im glad that this information is useful to you it certainly is but how can we get into the castles to tell the margins imbri asked forrest relayed the question you have merely to locate ghina whose talent is to put people to sleep ida said she is somewhere on pyramids red face and will help if you ask her also jfraya whose talent is to draw a door that opens but how do we find gina and jeffrey ghina the daughter of graeboe giant and gloha goblinharpy i believe a large invisible winged goblin girl and jfraya of uncertain origin on pyramids green face i fear you will have to accept some favors there and be accordingly diminished i can do that imbri said so we have it forrest said thank you so much no thanks necessary it is a fair exchange then he realized something my emotionit has faded i dont love you any more not that you are unworthy its just that yes it abated when i returned the favor but i trust you can appreciate why i demurred before yes its a great emotion but it must be invoked suitably that is correct i am glad we were able to arrange our exchange of information for we both profit handsomely thereby so am l he said much relieved if only eve could be similarly turned off but he knew of no favor he could do her at the moment now we must return to pyramid do you have any objection if we go directly from here none i have not before observed travel between worlds it should be interesting maybe so he looked at the others are we ready no dawn said i havent had the chance to do you a favor to match eves better yet forrest suggested why dont i do eve an equivalent favor so that her emotion abates i cant think of one but maybe you can maybe i can dawn said nuhuh eve protested i like it this way but we have to be even dawn said how long has it been since eve did her favor for forrest ida asked an hour dawn said then its too late favors have to be exchanged soon before the emotion sets in place then ill just have to do forrest some favor dawn said forrest what do you really truly most want to know about some living thing where to find a faun for my neighboring tree thats my whole mission here but i have to touch a living thing to know about it i cant find your faun from a distance unless i can touch someone who knows where he is i wish you could do me that favor forrest said but it is evident that you cant maybe one of us knows dawn said without knowing she knows i mean so i could find out i do not ida said i would have to query cone again and that would mean dont do that forrest said its dawns favor i must have ida smiled i understand lets hold hands dawn said desperately if the information is among us i can get it i cant hold hands imbri said in a dreamlet but you can touch us eve pointed out so they formed another circle with the two girls holding forrests hands and touching imbri on the other side there was a pause there is something dawn said not the faun somethingsomething better i think oh she let go what happened eve asked is something wrong dawn looked awed h dont think so but i dont know what to do its allall mixed up forrest was getting impatient do you have the answer or dont you dawn turned to ida aunt idawhere i come from thats what you areyou always had good advice for us i really need it now is there any waywithout complicating things ida nodded there may be dear if you care to tell me what is on your mind i would be free to offer an opinion which you would be free to ignore so there would be no actual service would that do yes then we shall do that lets take a little walk into my house the two went into the house the remaining three looped a glance around what do you think she saw eve asked it must have been something that one of us knows or maybe has seen and not realized its significance imbri said she knows just about everything i know eve said so i dont think its me i have seen too many things to remember imbri said in the course of my delivery of bad dreams so one of them could relate but why wouldnt she tell us or at least forrest all i know i learned in the vicinity of my tree forrest said this adventure has shown me more new things than i ever saw before so unless i saw a faun in passing and didnt realize itand why wouldnt dawn tell me that she said it wasnt a faun but maybe better eve said but that still doesnt explain why shes so confused dawn and ida emerged from the house dawn looked radiant she marched right up to forrest i love you as much as eve does now she said embracing him and kissing him ardently on the mouth he realized that it must be so for her passion was heating him making him desire her as much as he desired eve her body was pressing him in all the places eves body had just as urgently so were even again she gave him a final squeeze and turned him loose he reeled and would have fallen had not imbri alertly intercepted him and supported him with her solid shoulder we had better complete this mission soon imbri said in a dreamlet those girls are too much for you true words he put his arm across her shoulder gradually regaining his equilibrium im just not used to this sort of thing he said but what favor did you do him eve was asking dawn sister i cant tell you and i cant tell you why i cant tell you but believe me you would do the same in my situation i dont understand i know im sorry but so it must be for now eve looked at ida so it seems it must be ida agreed and now i think you are ready to return to pyramid and complete your mission but how can she have done me a favor and i not know it forrest asked as perplexed as eve in time you will understand forrest exchanged a glance of mottled frustration with eve dont you hate it when someone says that eve asked yes it makes me feel like a teenager exactly she agreed then she came across and kissed him on the mouth if dawn can do it so can i but i didnt get to press my bare body against him in the water dawn retorted how do you know about that eve demanded when we held hands i fathomed everything including what youre not telling us yes dawn said smugly its time to go forrest said before it could erupt into a sisterly fight yes imbri agreed her dreamlet figure sounding no more pleased than forrest or eve time to go lets hold hands eve suggested just to be sure no one gets lost dawn said at another time forrest might have objected but at the moment his main concern was that they make a safe return to pyramid before anything else happened to confuse the issue so he didnt argue eve took hold of his left hand and dawn took his right hand and the two of them caught imbris mane on either side with their other hands each of the girls squeezed his fingers with knowing implication they were even all rightbut what of him then all of them diluted their bodies this is impressive ida remarked as they expanded and thinned i wish all of you the very best give my regards to ida of pyramid then they became too diffuse to hear her they were drifting up into the sky which was the hole in the center of torus they had to move out of it so as not to collide with the world again as they continued to expand the lakes forests fields and mountains spread out below and around them as they went forrest peered at the inner side of the douhnut until he located the sarah sea with its island in the center he hoped ida wasnt lonely it would not have been a bad place to reside they moved well clear of torus growing impossibly large then forrest saw a far larger shape beyond and realized that it was idas head ida of pyramid they would have some interesting things to tell her too it became easier as they oriented on the larger world they were too diffuse to continue holding hands their substances passed right through each other but now there was no danger of getting lost still one nebulous figure clung to his left extremity that would be eve or was it what was he to do about her whichever one it was when the two girls had been equally interested it had been awkward and worse when eve was more interested but now it was worse yet because now he was wishing that the mission could be finished so that he and they could do whatever they had in mind he would have to play no favorites but that would be a lie eve had become his favorite she had aroused emotions of a scope and complexity he had not before experienced yet dawn had the capacity to even it up as her last embrace had shown just what had she done to increase her emotion when their own monstrous bodies came into view they separated each descending toward his or her own even eves empty body intrigued him now it looked lovely in its dark perfection he would have to dissipate that feeling if he could mare imbri was the first to reach her body she landed on it with her hoofs and sank in so that was how it was done forrest moved his own feet toward that landing but he hung back somewhat wanting to make sure that the others docked successfully before he did he didnt know what he would do if anything went wrong but he felt it was his responsibility he saw dawn reach her body she elected to swandive into it her soulself assuming the form of the bird just before it disappeared into the flesh actually her whole body was condensed soul but that didnt seem to matter in this circumstance her head faced him at the last instant and winked what did she know then eve reached her body she assumed the form of a perfect image of herself only without the clothing and sank down on her back she glanced lingeringly at him as she disappeared and smiled oh yes she remained aware of him then it was his turn he dropped in feet first trusting imbris technique and felt his feet and legs encounter slow resistance he arranged himself and lay down across his body sinking in then it became stifling he was suffocating he wanted to pull out to escape to win free but couldnt the body had hold of him and was sucking him into itself in all its solid parts and aspects but he reminded himself that this really was his body in this world and that he would like it as soon as he truly got back into it it merely felt a bit corroded from disuse at the moment then the melding was complete he opened his eyes around him the others were stirring what an experience dawn said she looked at forrest as if pondering experience of another kind yes indeed eve agreed then she sent a sultry glance in forrests direction in more respects than one for sure da helped them reorient are all of you all right she asked you were gone for several hours forrest looked at the tiny torus orbiting her head so much had happened there yes i think we are physically he said both girls laughed emotionally we changed dawn said the two of us fell in love with him and he became fascinated with us but we learned what we need to know eve said your persona there was very nice and now we will share it with you forrest said we will tell you all about torus im so glad ida said bringing a plate of cookies and for the next two hours they told her everything they could remember that they deemed important or interesting ida was fascinated especially with the revised rules of services and emotions there and with the information about the other idas come moon how i wish i could meet her she said that i fear is impossible imbri said how could you take your moon alongwhen going to that moon how indeed ida agreed sadly but this detailed knowledge of it is the next best thing im glad she has a nice residence she sent her regards to you forrest said remembering oh how nice shes a nice person dawn said just like you eve said oh ida blushed then it was time to resume their mission we must locate ghina on the red face and jfraya on the green face forrest said with their help we can nullify the wizards then you will be free that will be nice ida agreed but do be careful because the wizards may not take kindly to your effort as long as nobody tells them what we are up to we should be all right imbri said in a dreamlet i will certainly never tell ida said farewell good visitors dawn eve hugged her then the four of them left her blue stone house and walked off the blue ridge to the blue lake there forrest took the large cross from imbris pack they clustered together and shot across the water in a bundle they landed tumbled together on the far shore dawn was plastered across forrests front and eve across his back all of them on top of imbri but no one was hurt he wondered to what extent the girls had arranged things that way did it matter they disentangled and resumed their trek the red face was in the direction they thought of as west though such a designation was meaningless here a straight march in that direction would get them there forrest invoked the blanket of obscurity so that they would not be bothered by natives but night was coming they needed a place to spend the night they were in deep woods and werent sure how safe it would be because the blanket would wear off long before the night ended already they heard the howling of the hunting wolf spiders they didnt want to blunder into a wolf web dawn went from tree to tree touching their trunks this is a tea tree she said of one it grows all kinds of teas mediocri subversi adverse propensi versatili priori supertori monstrosi we get the point eve said we wont be drinking any of those dawn circled around it and on this side its a tree tea she announced when enemies meet here they can make a peace agreement theres a house eve said maybe we can stay there how long has the blanket been invoked imbri asked over an hour forrest said but what we want is friendly accommodation so if we find that we wont need the blanket so who inquires at that house i will we all have our own value so none of us are more at risk than the others but we love you dawn said we dont want anything to happen to you and i dont want anything to happen to any of you he glanced at imbri if an ogre or something answers the door throw a bad dreamlet at him to distract him until i can get away the others nodded realizing that this was probably sufficient protection he went up to the blue house and knocked on the door a young woman with blue hair answered she reminded him of someone hello he said i am forrest faun from another world and i and my friends need a place to stay the night we wondered if you another world she asked do you mean ptero yes as a matter of fact we are on our way to the red face and you are welcome we havent had visitors from there for a long time in fact weve never had them i am ilene and this is my brother gerrod she indicated the man who came up behind her he looked familiar too dont you want to meet my companions to be sure certainly bring them in forrest turned and beckoned the others they came to the house you look familiar ilene said looking at the twins i am dawn i am eve we are the twin daughters of prince dolph and princess electra thats it ilene cried you are our cousins we are the children of grey and ivy oh more cousins dawn said how nice do you have magician caliber talents eve asked of course i control storms and geffod communicates with water fascinating dawn said i know about living things and i know about inanimate things lets compare notes ilene said soon gerrod and eve were telling each other about all manner of aspects of a cup of water and it was clear that their talents were genuine similarly ilene and dawn were demonstrating storm clouds and information about living things then they all settled down inside including imbri for a nice supper and more talking forrest realized that on these worlds where the mighthes resided it was easy for them to accept alternate folk dawn eve knew all their cousins on ptero and ilene and gerrod knew all their cousins on pyramid they considered it a fair exchange of information and no one gained or lost size imbri paid her way by demonstrating her ability to project dreamlets and forrest brought out his panpipes and played a merry melody for their hosts so it was a good night in the morning refreshed they set off again ilene and gerrod did not know what was to be found on the red face it seemed that the folk on one face kept pretty much to their own color and those who tried to cross over stood out like sore big toes but geffod gave them several packaged storms to use in case of need imbri accepted them and did lose some mass but it seemed worth it as they progressed the ground tilted it didnt bother them since they tilted with it but they were aware that they were getting near the edge of the blue triangle when they reached it the demarcation was striking the border was like the ridge of a mountain range blue on one side red on the other well have to change color forrest said maybe not imbri said with the blanket of obscurity we may not be noticed he hadnt thought of that then lets go ahead you can ask directions with dreamlets that show the correct color they crossed the ridgeand abruptly their tilt was wrong it was geared to the blue face which was sharply different from the red face they were now at a steep angle to the terrain in fact their heads wanted to collide with the ground at a slight angle while their bodies wanted to point slightly into the air we are oriented ninety degrees to the blue face imbri said the red face differs from the blue face by a hundred and twenty degrees we shall have to crawl on our hands i dont feel comfortable with that indeed she was lying on her side with two feet in the air maybe i can figure it out eve said she touched a finger to the red rock aha theres a colony of lings near the edge we can make a deal with them that was a relief they crossed back to the blue face and walked along the edge until they were near the lings this happened to be by the shore of a blue lake that went right up to the boundary bent around the corner and became a red lake at the new angle then they waited for the obscurity to wear off so that forrest could crawl to the lings camp but as the spell faded a large canine creature loped toward them from the blue side what is it eve asked concerned that looks like a dire wolf dawn said get well away from it maybe i had better invoke the blanket of obscurity again forrest said taking it out of his knapsack no just cross to the red side dawn said urgently she and eve were already doing so while imbri stood warily by a deep bass note sounded from the lake almost under forrests elbow he jumpedand the can flew out of his hand it splashed into the water where a big fish swallowed it oh no dawn cried thats a largemouth bass it swallowed the can meanwhile the dire wolf was coming close forrest quickly brought out a storm package and opened it dark clouds swirled out making sheets of rain and peals of thunder the wolf got a blast of spray in the snoot reconsidered passed close by them and ran on not attacking of all the bad luck forrest said thats the thing about a dire wolf dawn said wherever it goes disaster follows thats why we had to get away from it and he hadnt done so not realizing what she meant now their main protection from hostile interest the blanket of obscurity was gone if only he had understood in time there was nothing to do but dry off and proceed with their mission hoping they could get along without the obscurity forrest crossed to the red and crawled to the place where the lings were they were easy to deal with they flocked to the edge and treated each person as she crossed imbri was the one who made the actual deals so she lost several more bits of her substance and became a smaller horse but now they were able to walk at the correct angle they were also red they had had to deal for that too things were looking better but they were paying a price if only they hadnt lost their main protection maybe they were blundering because of the prior loss of the good magicians list of words dawn touched the plants and eve touched the objects and soon they had a notion where a sleeptalented woman had been they followed her trail being watchful for any dangers and in due course located her except that when they found her they couldnt see her there was her nice little red brick house but no woman they had not wanted to be sneaky but their awareness of danger made them careful so they peeked in a window first and saw nothing but shes there imbri insisted i can feel her fleeting dreams then forrest made a connection shes the daughter of graeboe giant is he an invisible giant not any more imbri said hes a winged goblin now but he has the invisible heritage shes invisible eve touched the house why so she is this is the house of an invisible woman so maybe we should just knock on the door and introduce ourselves forrest said instead of generating our own complications the others abashed agreed so forrest knockedand in a moment a redcloaked woman answered yes she inquired from the depths of her cowl i am forrest faun i have come to ask a favor from ghina i am she i am glad to give favors for they increase my stature what is your wish my friends and i need your help to nullify the four wizards of yramid oh my she exclaimed that is a very dangerous undertaking yes but if we succeed the tyranny of the wizards will be ended and you will be free free were free now the wizards have done a great many favors for us oops he had forgotten that though the wizards were oppressing the folk of ptero it was the opposite for the folk of pyramid ghina might not want to cooperate he pondered as swiftly as he could and decided that the truth was best though it was dangerous to utter we are from another world the wizards are harming that world in order to do favors here she considered are any of my friends being harmed they could be there are many mightbe folk there and surely some of them are relatives of yours he wasnt quite sure what system there was as there seemed to be mighthes on all the worlds but it seemed a safe assumption that there were invisible giants goblins and harpies on ptero so her ancestry was surely well represented well then i suppose i had better help and if i am helping my relatives it isnt really a favor to you its a fair exchange of favors he said relieved very well ill help she stepped out the door but dont you have to close up your house or anything it will keep until mom and dad fly home or until my brother geddy walks home hes out charming the ladies with his songs where are your friends here they are the three others were stepping forward this is mare imbri who speaks in dreamlets imbri sent a dreamlet of a winged goblin girl hello and these are dawn eve human whose talents are to know all about living and inanimate things the twins in red jeans nodded forrest noticed irrelevantly that dawns hair color had returned to its natural flame hue while eves hair was now midnight red both girls remained infernally attractive ghinas cowl looked thoughtful are you related to magician trent hes our great grandfather dawn said now rejuvenated to his twenties eve said so hes not much older than we are thats the one mother knew him the cowl looked down as if blushing in fact mother rather liked him if he had been willing she would have ordered me from the stork works with him instead of with graeboe and i might have been visible not that i have any objection to graeboe hes a fine father its just that sometimes i wonder what i might have looked like like this imbri said in the dreamlet her human figure conjured a bucket of red paint and flung it at the cowled ghina figure the paint splashed all over washing off the cowl and leaving a red winged goblin girl oh ghina cried delighted im pretty just like your mother imbri agreed they started off i suppose we should do the red wizard first since were here forrest said do you know where his castle is in the center of the red triangle ghina said but i dont know the best way there ill ask the chess nut chestnuts talk forrest asked she must have smiled youre funny she led the way through the forest to a glade wherein stood assorted life sized redwood figures of men women horses towers and children the floor of the glade was marked in squares light red and dark red as they approached a figure of a light red man with a pointed hat slid across a diagonal and grabbed a dark red child figure it tossed the child to the edge of the glade where it joined a tumbled collection of figures uncle kerby ghina called there was a stirring yes niece ghina a voice came from the air ohan invisible giant of course dawn murmured from her fathers side of the family eve agreed imbri made a dreamlet showing the glade with its wooden figures and the outline of ap invisible giant standing over them ready to move another piece the giant seemed to be of about average size for his type with unruly brown hair and green eyes apparently his invisibility allowed him to be normal colors instead of shades of red where is the center of the triangle ghina asked all paths lead to it kerby replied moving another chess piece thank you uncle but were forgetting something dawn said thats right jfraya eve agreed so they were they needed both people to do the job well have to go to the green face first forrest said with regret kerby overheard him that will be a harder trip uncle could you help us ghina asked i could but i dont want to take any mass from you sweet thing i will trade you this smile she said turning her invisible face in kerbys direction forrest couldnt see the smile but the glade brightened the giant must have seen it being also invisible climb on he said imbris dreamlet showed a huge hand being laid on the ground before them they climbed on and took hold of the fingers and imbri lay in the palm then the hand lifted above the trees and the red terrain whizzed by below it didnt take long kerby lowered them at the corner between the red and the green faces actually i could reach across if you know where your friend is the giant offered let me touch a tree dawn said maybe she walked past it once let me touch the ground eve said maybe a path leads to her home they scrambled off the invisible hand they had the usual trouble with the changed angle of the green face but crawled to a green tree and green stone soon they returned someone once opened a door near here dawn reported the trees were astonished for it was a door into the ground and the ground knows of other doors that opened in it in that direction eve said pointing i will reach as far as i can in that direction kerby said the girls scrambled back onto his hand then they rode way out across the green terrain until the giants reach reached its farthest reaches and he lowered them to the greensward thank you uncle ghina called flashing another gladebrightening invisible smile as they slid to the ground welcome niece he called back as he started back toward his chess game his voice sounding lower because of the special magic of doppler it occurred to forrest that doppler must have been an interesting magician though it wasnt clear why he wanted to fool with sounds now they had to struggle with the terrain it was possible for them to walk erect if they clung to trees and other features of the greenscape but not easy there seemed to be no lings in the vicinity so they were stuck in the greenery being both red and grounded maybe we can brace each other dawn gasped so we can walk more or less upright or tie ourselves together eve added so we can be braced without using our hands they found some greenbriar vines but they were too thorny to use then they saw a green rope leaping around forrest managed to snag it as it jumped over him the rope struggled wanting to be free to leap some more but the girls grabbed hold of its ends and subdued it its a jump rope eve gasped they wound it around and tied themselves into a clumsy mass it worked not well but better than nothing and the ropes natural inclination to jump helped imbri was the center and the other four clustered around her their feet bracing outward it was uncomfortable but feasible for now forrest was wedged against ghina because there needed to be two people to a side and the twins couldnt agree which one of them would get to press against the faun ghina was invisible within her cloak and cowl and quickly shed those so as to be entirely invisible and less noticeable but her body was solid forrest felt her wings brushing him every so often and he was aware of other parts of her he realized that he was in close contact with yet another healthy young woman how did he keep getting into these situations shes that way eve said after touching the ground for information not far so they trundled along in that direction forrest had no idea what they would do if something unfriendly spied them they werent in any condition to fend anything off maybe another storm package would drive it away but maybe not say i never realized that fauns were so interesting ghina murmured do you suppose we could unfeasible he said was there any point trying to explain about the effect faunish contact had on females oh she said regretfully they half dragged half jumped onward until they came to the greenhouse residence that eve indicated was the one rather than knock on the glass door and possibly freak someone out they decided to let imbri contact the woman with a dreamlet jfraya imbris joint dreamlet called showing imbris human form in a green dress properly upright may we speak with you a woman appeared in the dreamlet she was of course green especially her thumbs and carried a green watering can who are you i am mare imbri from another world my friends and i need your help to stop the wizards but the wizards havent done us any harm jfraya protested but they are doing others harm by stealing from another world imbri responded we have in our group two people from that world whose people are sorely suffering what makes you think i can help ida of the world of torus said you could ida but shes confined to an island on the blue face yes shes ida of pyramid the ida i mean is on the world of torus which orbits her head imbri made an image of blue ida and her doughnut shaped moon this is too complicated to argue jfraya said so i suppose id better help you very good i think your world will be better off without raiding other worlds after all you wouldnt want other worlds raiding yours i suppose then imbri introduced the others of their party in the dreamlet but why are they all tied together are they prisoners imbri explained about the difficulty of walking on this face oh i can fix that jfraya said where do you want to go to the green wizards castle first jfraya stepped outside her greenhouse open this door she said she brought out a large pen and drew a crude door on the ground with hinges on one side and a handle on the other then she went back into her house to finish watering her plants the group trundled up forrest reached down for the drawn handle to his half surprise he caught hold of it he hauled on it and the door opened folding out of the ground below was a passage slanting down it had a floor a ceiling and two sides there was a faint green glow so that it did not become dark deeper in you know we could walk on one of the walls forrest said they untied themselves one by one and climbed down into the passage dawn went first and stood on the slanting wall which was about right for her orientation then eve joined her their upper bodies were pointing slightly downward so the wall was close to right angles to them their four dainty feet were aimed almost directly at forrest say wed look good in skirts dawn said yes considering the angle eve agreed their red jeans fuzzed and became flaring red skirts forrest quickly clapped a hand to his eyes before he saw very far beyond their four nice knees stop it he cried aw they said together laughing i wish i could do that ghina murmured that intrigued him though he knew it shouldnt couldnt you if you put on stockings and panties no theyre too close to my body they turn invisible only the thicker material can retain its opacity im sure its for the best he said insincerely their jeans are back she informed him he ventured a look sure enough it was safe and probably the mischievous girls had not really let anything show they knew that the mission wouldnt get far if they freaked him out in the middle of it now he and ghina climbed down into the hole and stood on the wall finally imbri rolled over and in and they were all there fortunately it was a large passage with room though there wasnt much clearance for their heads then jfraya emerged i think my greens have enough water for a few days she said she entered the passage standing in its floor this was awkward because she was about at right angles to them and their upper bodies were at cross purposes but they would just have to give her space and make do they walked along the passage giving each other sufficient room this goes to the wizards castle forrest asked it should but i should warn you that one never can be quite certain what one will find along the way but if you made this passage there shouldnt be anything else along it should there i made the door not the passage i made a door into a passage that goes to the wizards castle oh that meant that they might not be safe after all are there likely to be dangers there could be but i could make another door to escape the passage eve touched the floor which was her wall this is a goblin tunnel she exclaimed why yes so it is ghina said i should have recognized it from my goblin heritage but it is deserted dawn said good jfraya said i tried to pick an empty one they proceeded onward with greater confidence in due course the passage opened into a series of galleries in one some metallic green plants grew with fierce straight spikes a steel plant eve exclaimed they make swords from these she touched one of the spikes too bad we delicate girls dont know how to use swords they knew how to use whatever else they had though forrest thought darkly the next chamber was encrusted with green gems now these we might use eve said touching one they are stratagems from the stratosphere they help folk devise plans forrest agreed lets harvest some and keep them for use when we need them so they pried several of the gems free and each person put one in purse or pack the next chamber was filled with bouncing orangegreen balls basketballs eve said after checking for storage storage she caught a ball and pulled at its binding it opened out into a basket put whatever it is inside then close it up and let it bounce it will keep until you open the basket ball again too bad we dont need to store anything ghina said she had recovered her red cloak from somewhere and was wearing it so they could see her general form they moved on before long they approached the surface no passages actually enter the castle jfraya said the wizard saw to that but they should exit in sight of it and i can make a door through the wall but it wont be safe i understand that the wizard has monsters and things guarding his premises leave them to me ghina said my talent is making folk sleep when i was young i thought i was just boring but then i learned it was magic and you will be able to approach them because they cant see you jfraya said thats nice actually they can smell me but ill put them to sleep before they can do us any harm still forrest said they could give the alarm so we had better approach carefully lets wait until night dawn suggested then well all be halfway invisible he nodded we might as well rest we dont know exactly what well face inside the castle they foraged for something to eat the first plant they found had berries like big green toes well maybe dawn said touching it these fruits make a special kind of jam she paused toe jam ugh eve said wrinkling her nose then they found a sweetie pi tree with sweetie pies and feasted on them after that they settled down in a chamber to which jfraya opened a door and found a number of nice pillows therein it was wonderful to relax for a while forrest woke to find himself extraordinarily comfortable dawn was stroking his hair eve was polishing his hoofs and ghina and jfraya were buffing his fingernails he couldnt actually see ghina for she had evidently doffed her red cloak but he felt her touch on his right hand uh he said intelligently oh youre awake dawn said then we had better get on with our mission eve said which is to get into the green wizards castle ghina said and inform the margins jfraya concluded then they all laughed they had had their little joke making like quadruplets i didnt mean to sleep he said embarrassed just to rest ghina squeezed his hand you forget my talent we didnt want a male overhearing our girl talk jfraya said oh well at least that demonstrated that her talent was effective it also left him curious about what they had talked about the magic of fauns dawn said answering his thought to his further embarrassment how they may not look like much but their touch makes a girl think of longlegged birds its similar to the magic of nymphs he said just the sight of them running makes a male think of the same birds but the magic of fauns also works on other females ghina said so does the sight of other women running also work on fauns jfraya asked yes he said as does their soft touch and their pretty speech so if you girls dont mind they laughed again and let go of his extremities their girl talk must have established that this one faun was harmless yes imbri said in a private dreamlet but they do like you forrest and he liked them but they all had business to accomplish they organized themselves then quietly exited the chamber it was dark outside but the green castle was illuminated from within the pale green light spilling out through the green glass of the windows at each story several large ugly grotesque and generally unpleasant green monsters patrolled the premises unfortunately they still could not stand on the green surface their feet wanted to be just slightly higher than their heads in the ease of walking along the tunnel wall they had forgotten the problem only jfraya was properly upright we will just have to crawl forrest decided it wont be comfortable but it will get us there maybe i can fly ghina said she tried itand promptly flew sideways almost colliding with a tree they couldnt see her but saw the disturbance in the air try flying up at a steep angle or diving down forrest suggested ghina experimented and after a while managed to get the right onentation i think im flying almost straight up but im really flying more or less level she said i have room to make mistakes if i stay high enough i dont think i can crawl well enou h imbri said but i think i can project my dreamlets as far as the castle why dont i remain here and be with you in dreams then we are ready forrest said he started crawling mostly on his hands pulling a foot down frequently to give a push he was getting the clumsy hang of it the others did similar maneuvers the twins made intriguing outlines with their jeans mostly in the air he noticed that their hair fell to the side instead of toward the ground it was clearer than ever why few creatures crossed to faces of pyramid not their own ghina went first spreading her invisible red wings and flying toward the nearest monster which resembled a corpulent tangle tree with tentacle rot in a moment that monster lay down to sleep ghina had exercised her talent in two and a half more moments another monster lay down that one was a cross between a huge green slug and a crushed caterpillar then the third and fourth which were too illfavored to describe now the six of them could approach the castle without being challenged but they were careful because the folk inside the castle were not asleep and if any of them looked out and saw the sleeping monsters they might give the alarm so there was no hurry so that they would not stumble in the darkness and no talking they knew what they were doing any communication between them was to be handled by joint dreamlet there was no moat apparently the green wizard believed that the monsters and wall sufficed they reached the wall and forrest put his sensitive ear to it instead of to the ground where it had been dragging and listened there was a faint sound to the side that should be the margins eve touched the wall and verified it the little creatures were working inside they went to the portion of the wall closest to that sound and jfraya drew a door they opened it and stepped inside there were perhaps a dozen little green pyramids with triangular faces sitting on the stone floor from several of them green lines projected upward are these the margins forrest asked mentally his thought taking the form of a dreamlet that imbri shared with the others are they alive they are alive dawn replied in her own dreamlet as she touched the nearest pyramid but clothed in green stone they live in the fissures of the stone they cant move of their own accord but can be moved by others the green wizard brought them here can you establish contact with them he asked imbri i think so imbri formed a picture of a green pyramid hello i am a visitor from another world hello several pyramids chorused would you tell me what you are doing we are marginalizing a segment of ptero so as to improve it and thus gain mass dawn eve put their hands over their mouths so as not to exclaim in maidenly indignation how does marginalizing it improve it imbri asked there are bad folk there marginalizing captures them and takes away their magic so they cant do any more harm dawn opened her mouth to protest but eve stifled her who told you this the green wizard let me show you how it really is imbri said in the dreamlet the world of ptero appeared and expanded there were happy people all across the human section then colored lines appeared cutting people off making the others afraid and unhappy those are not bad folk imbri said they are good folk they are being harmed by your margins but how can this be so the green wizard said we were doing great favors and would grow greatly in size and have you grown in size not yet we were wondering yet you know you have captured many folk on ptero the change occurs instantly so you must see that you are not doing favors it is the green wizard who is growing in sizeby giving away those stolen talents it is true he has become enormous while you have not so wouldnt it be better to stop helping him the pyramids consulted it seemed that however strong their magic might be they were not phenomenally smart yes they decided well stop wait forrest cried in his share of the dreamlet if the green wizard is stopped now the other wizards will be warned and will be on guard we need to delay it it would be better if you waited three days imbri said could you stop then yes thank you then imbri thought of something what will happen to you if the wizard is mad at you nothing if he bothers us well marginalize him very good imbri said we thank you and the world of ptero will surely thank you in due course they left the dungeon well satisfied the four monsters were beginning to twitch ghina didnt bother to put them to sleep again it was better to have them wake and resume their guard duty with the green wizard none the wiser they were able to crawl fast enough to get clear before any monster actually woke well that part of the mission went well forrest said but now we have three days to do the other three wizards i hope you can open doors to passages that go there jfraya oh yes then lets do the red wizard next i think thats the closest one actually they are all the same distance from each other eve said because each is in the center of its triangle but since were red we might as well do that one dawn said jfraya opened a door to a passage slanting to the center of the red face and they walked along its wall that was a relief after their struggle on the surface this one was unused like the other but not perfect they passed a gallery supported by pillars that resembled feline creatures catlpillars there was what appeared to be a prison cell there wherein was a comely young woman look ghina said the goblins left a prisoner behind we should rescue her i dont trust this forrest said we had better first find out why they imprisoned her and left her and why she seems healthy despite this neglect eve touched a pillar learning what it had seen that is a geisa girl she said pronouncing it gaysha anyone who gets close to her may be caught by her geis and have to do whatever she says they paused reconsidering thats dangerous forrest said we dont know what she might demand the goblins must have isolated her here deliberately so she couldnt do them any mischief pretty girls are mischief dawn said especially those with strong magic eve added i think we had better just leave her there forrest said regretfully we cant risk being diverted from our mission the others reluctantly agreed uncle grey murphy could take away her magic as punishment if she did anything wrong on ptero dawn said but uncle grey is trapped in the margins eve said caught before he could nullify their magic then maybe mother electra could use an outlet to free her when no one else was near dawn suggested which is a secret passage only mother electra can open eve explained thats interesting jfraya said id like to meet your mother i dont know if thats possible forrest said we of larger worlds can travel to smaller ones by leaving most of our mass behind but i think it would be more difficult for those of the smaller worlds to go to the larger ones they would probably be insubstantial and seem like ghosts maybe someone with the talent of blessing could reverse the curse of the geisa girls compulsion ghina said as they moved on another chamber was filled with snakes i wish we had the blanket of obscurity now forrest said those look poisonous indeed in a moment they were surrounded by very poisonous looking snakes the snakes were on the floor while most of the people were on a wall but in the confines of the passage they were close enough there are too many for me to put to sleep ghina said and they could follow if i made another door jfraya said forrest couldnt think of anything intelligent to do so he tried something stupid take us to your leader the snakes made a path through their number toward a special cave forrest and his party walked the nearest wall in that direction here lay a large snake wearing a crown its the king cobra dawn whispered forrest had another idea not nearly as stupid as the last one o king cobra we crave a favor he said we need to proceed quickly to the red wizards castle the king nodded several monstrous snakes slithered up the travelers including imbri climbed onto these snakes and were carried swiftly onward they rode at a considerable angle but the snakes seemed to understand forrest looked back sure enough the king cobra looked a size larger soon they were at the end of the tunnel they slid off the snakes who seemed even larger than before and moved back out onto the red surface now they were correctly oriented except for jfraya she had to lie on imbris back because she couldnt stand on the ground it was still night they proceeded directly to the red castle and ghina put its guardian monsters to sleep except for one this was an animated angle i recognize that eve said its a guardian angle it protects folk against math courses but we arent math courses forrest said right she approached the guardian please dont let any math courses get us she beseeched it the angle nodded its acute point graciously it would protect them from that threat they entered the castle in the same manner as they had the other and explained things to the red margins inside the margins agreed to cease operations in two and a half days they emerged and passed through a door to a passage leading directly to the blue face this one however was not completely desetted but there arent any really bad folk on it eve said after touching its wall except maybe the cuss today a toad that swears forrest asked not exactly it is found in the grounds for divorce if we avoid the chamber where those grounds are it shouldnt bother us they avoided that chamber by taking a detour on the alternate passage they encountered a man of many colors his skin was not blue red green or gray which explained why he wasnt walking the surface of pyramid instead it was rainbow colored hello the man said i am hue man the six of them introduced themselves then moved on it wasnt that there seemed to be anything wrong with hue man who seemed completely human but that they were in a hurry to complete their mission and didnt care to advertise it lest word get to the wizards it was a long trip to the blue face and by the time they reached it the night was done they had to remain in the passage forrest still had some food in his knapsack and ghina had some invisible sandwiches so they ate lightly and relaxed when night arrived they went out onto another face where they couldnt walk this time they tilted the opposite way but it hardly mattered their feet still wanted to be slightly above their heads jfrayas feet went the opposite direction from theirs but again ghina was able to adjust her flying and she put the monsters to sleep so that the group could crawl in and alert the margins this time they learned something new the blue margins mentioned that they were able to communicate along their lines that was how they identified people trapped within the enclosures formed by the lines so if anyone got in the line of sight of a line between the margin and the world of ptero he or she would be able to talk to the margin generating it the lines did not become solid barriers until they were close to the surface of ptero because there was no sense wasting magic actually the whole of pyramid was close to the surface of ptero but forrest understood what they meant the lines went up to the top of castle roogna then bent at right angles and came down after another bend to intercept the ground only with that last bend did they become actual walls so if we climbed to the top of the wizards castle we could intercept the lines and talk to you forrest said getting it straight yes that is how the blue wizard does it however it seemed enough of a challenge just to crawl into the dungeon from the ground trying to get to the top of the castle seemed pointless they got the margins to agree to stop in a day and a half and crawled back out one wizard to go outside jfraya cast about uncertainly i cant find a suitable passage to open a door to she complained there just dont seem to be passages to the bottom face it wasnt a place the goblins wanted to go to ghina said mother commented about that its all stormy and cold thats right jfraya agreed remembering because it never gets any direct sunlight and s always in shadow by most accounts its this worlds dullest face but trying to trek all across this face to the edge and then all across the gray face would take days forrest said we have to move faster than that it will have to be on the surface jfraya said there arent any safe passages maybe we could get rides dawn suggested on cooperative centaurs eve added can you locate such centaurs quickly forrest asked feeling halfway desperate i think so dawn said touching a tree they pass by here often enough and their prints form paths eve said touching the ground so lets go and ask them a favor forrest said is that wise imbri asked we are all smaller than we were if we dont accomplish the mission our size wont much matter he pointed out the others nodded im sorry i couldnt find a suitable door to make jfraya said this seems to be the best alternative they are said to live in the atlas mountains dawn said reading her tree which are beyond the tropical depression eve said reading her ground are they within ready crawling distance yes if we go straight there dawn said which means going through the depression which isnt fun eve said we arent here for fun forrest said they started crawling in the indicated direction imbri who just couldnt crawl well decided to wait where she was they would arrange to pick her up later soon the ground sank lower as they entered the depression exotic warm weather plants grew in it but forrest started feeling extremely sad was any of this worthwhile or would it be better just to quit trying oh im depressed jfraya complained thats because of the tropical depression eve said just crawl on through it forrest was glad he hadnt spoken he had assumed that it was just a warm low place now he knew better beyond the depression rose the peaks of mountains shown outlined against the dimly illuminated sky then they reached the base of the first mountainand discovered that it consisted of piled books atlases what else had he expected watch out for the bookworm eve warned they paused in their crawling as a large worm crawled across their route its segments consisted of books at last they reached the centaur village centaurs came bearing torches dont you folk of the red face know you cant travel redily here one demanded youre just not reddy for the blue forrest dispensed with explanations we need to be carried to the gray face he said there is also a mare who will require several to carry her are you asking for favors iyesi and you know the consequence iyesi then we are glad to help i am chaz centaur he looked around chaliceyou take the faun an earthy brownblue mare trotted up she was as well endowed as the usual centaur filly which was impressive by the standards of lesser females forrest tried to mount her back but couldnt his angle was wrong finally she picked him up with her arms pressed him to her ample bare bosom twisted him around and plopped him on her back once firmly set there he was able to hang on and maintain his position chafe and chidetake the girls two sneering young stallions trotted up the sneers faded when they got two good looks at the girls then they became very helpful one picked up dawn and set her on the others back then the other picked up eve and set her on the first ones back the girls quickly zeroing in on the situation were very appreciative and flattering two males who might have been annoying were quickly being tamed checkerstake the green lady a dappled stallion trotted up and managed to get jfraya on his back chaz looked around is that all no ghina called she donned her red cloak so as to become partly visible i am a winged goblin girl from the red face chenilletake her a centaur filly trotted up and managed to get ghina aboard now where is this mare across the tropical depression toward the blue wizards castle forrest said well go around that the centaurs got moving while their passengers hung on soon they reached imbri chicory chiffon chime chip chaz said and four more centaurs trotted up chenille sew a sling ghinas filly brought out cloth and with magical speed formed a sling suitable for a horse the four other centaurs lifted imbri onto it then picked up the four corners which had been fashioned into harnesses these harnesses went over their heads and around their human torsos so that they did not need to use their hands to hold on they took up their positions and stretched the harness taut imbri was hauled into the air to the gray border march chaz said all ten centaurs set off in perfect step they were on their way but forrest felt lighter he and the others were paying a price for this invaluable assistance how is it that a red faun is traveling here chalice asked him my companions and i are trying to carry out an important mission he explained several of us are actually from another world then to divert her attention he asked about her where i come from not all centaurs have magic talents do certainly my talent is with pottery i can fashion bluebrown clay into excellent utensils the other centaurs have talent too you saw chenilles ability as a seamstress checkers has great ability with board games chicory is a herbalist chiffon can make things transparent chime is an excellent minstrel and chip can shatter objects hes my foal she added proudly we discovered his talent at the expense of a vase thus the time passed amicably enough soon they came to the edge you know its cold around the corner chaz said would you like warm garments forrest looked at the bleak landscape beyond yes i think we had better have that favor too he agreed with resignation in moments chenille had made warm caps and jackets and trousers for all of them including imbri the six members of their party were surely slightly smaller because of this favor and chenille became the largest of the centaurs thank you forrest said you are all welcome chaz replied then he produced a horn from his pack here is a bull horn if you return this way and need more favors blow it a bull horn summons centaurs no it summons bulls of course they graze at the bull market but we will hear the stampede of their hoofs and come to investigate you would not want to ask favors of the bulls are bulls bad folk no worse than the bears generally but these ones can be edi and para bull are all right with their food and stories but stum is clumsy trem is fearful and you wouldnt want to encounter trou or terri you wouldnt believe incredi bull surely not forrest agreed they bid parting to the centaurs and crawled over the edge onto the gray face immediately a chill wind rose stirred by their presence and blew snow in their faces they were at a different angle here but it was no better than the other angles they were unable to walk they could slide somewhat on the snow which facilitated things but this promised to be a difficult journey do you think we could get more help traveling forrest asked i fear well never make it at this rate im checking the snow eve said but its freshly fallen and doesnt have much experience of this region and there dont seem to be any living creatures or plants here dawn said so they slogged on they found that they could slide imbri across the snow especially if they braced each other so as to get good temporary footholds so progress improved but it was still too slow at last as the day faded worn out with the struggle they had jfraya open a door into an isolated cave it was blessedly warm and they were able to stand comfortably on the walls but dawn and eve were doubtful there are mites dawn said stalag mites and they stop anyone from using this cave eve added too bad forrest said we need to rest here were protected by our clothing for all of them were wearing closely fitting jackets and pants that kept them warm despite the weather they did not remove them right away preferring to be sure the cave was safe forrest looked at the stone spikes hanging from the cave ceiling and rising from the floor what are these called stalactites and stalagmites eve said touching them the first descend from the ceiling and the second rise from the floor how can we keep that straight jfraya asked they sound so much alike suddenly forrest jumped something bit my leg he said trying to scratch at it through the tight trousers it was not a problem he had had before because he normally did not wear clothing on his tuffed lower half then the twins jumped ooo dawn cried something bit my calf and something bit my thigh eve said its the mites they are crawling up under our tights then all of them were jumping and trying to scratch we have to get them off jfraya said yanking down her own pants forrest turned away from her as a matter of courtesy but that turned him toward the twins who were yanking down theirs their bare legs were astonishingly nice but he tried not to notice in any event he was busy pulling down his own so as to be able to get at the biting mites in two thirds of a moment all o them were barelegged and scratching off the mites then ghina managed to fill the cave with her sleep spell and the remaining mites fell asleep and dropped off however the spell also affected the rest of them though more slowly because they were more massive so they lay down to sleep the last thing forrest remembered was imbris dreamlet now we know how to remember the stone columns she said when the mites go up the tites come down he groaned and tried to forget it after some time he woke and so did the others the mites seemed to have given up or maybe they remained stunned by the sleep spell but it was time to resume travel so they pulled their leggings back on tightened their jackets and braved the snow above it wasnt as bad as they remembered it it was worse the snow had piled up until it was chest high on forrest and it was dense and hard this promised to be absolutely awful say imbri said in a joint dreamlet why cant we use the snow the same way as we do the cave walls the others turned to her not understanding but then she made a dreamlet picture showing a path being trampled into the snowsidewise so that five of them could walk on it sidewise and the sixth jfraya could walk on the other side of it suddenly it made sense jfraya and dawn held each other their heads going in opposite directions and used their feet to stomp banks of snow to either side when they tired eve and forrest tried it she using her feet to stomp while using her hands to hold him in place so he could use his own hands to beat the snow into shape on the other side it worked to a degree imbri was able to walk on the sideways path her body scraping the snow of the center but it was too slow they needed not merely to use the path quickly but to make it quickly so they simplified it since only jfraya faced the other way her path was for her alone and she hardly needed it once she had made it so she became a brace instead stabilizing the others without wearing herself out that allowed the others to take turns with one tramping out the path while the others followed walking normally so their progress improved still they had a long way to go and the terrain was rough and their time was limited they needed to reach the gray wizards castle by dusk to be sure of their success when they encountered steep hills they were able to tramp their sidewise path more readily when they came to a frozen lake they slid rapidly across it but as the day passed it slowly became clear that they were not going to make it in time worse jfraya slipped and injured one foot now she had to hop following the path at the rear and leaning on imbri for support so do we plow on through the night hoping the wizard has not gotten the word about the other wizards forrest asked or do we take our time recover our strength and hope we can handle him anyway the others exchanged a circular glance we plow on jfraya said since she was the injured one that was enough they plowed on and in the night they finally spied the gray light of the wizards castle it was surrounded by snowcovered trees and looked peaceful maybe he doesnt know eve breathed but as they made their way to the castles outer wall passing the ring of trees eve stiffened she signaled dawn who brushed by the tree eve had just touched then came a joint dreamlet those are ore trees forrest felt a chill not of the landscape ore trees were actually huge vicious animals that resembled trees only when in repose they were the most dangerous of guardians they might be snoozing now but if they came alert they might pounce too suddenly for ghina to put to sleep it would be impossible for them to flee these monsters at any speed because of their sidewise orientation the party had to hope that the orcs were not alert so far that seemed to be the case they fetched up against the castle wall at last able to stand almost normally what a relief that was eve touched the stone with a finger there is no disturbance within she announced via dreamlet a number of living creatures are on the other side forrest nodded jjraya drew a door on the base of the castle wall and opened it they entered the dark chamber it looked as if they were going to win after all they found an inner wall to stand on jfraya still leaning on imbri suddenly lights came on they were surrounded by creatures and none of them looked friendly it was a trap so you come at last my pets a huge dark woman said but where is your last member this must be the wizardor wizardess it hadnt occurred to forrest that the wizard could be female but of course it was possible more than possible it hardly mattered they had walked into a trap with the orcs outside and the wizards guards inside all the wizard had had to do was wait last member forrest asked blankly it was reported that there were six in your party where is the last one hiding no one is hiding forrest said we are all here for ghina was visible in her heavy winter clothing the huge woman frowned so you think to deceive me we shall see about that cerci two servants pushed forward a large tank of water in it was a mermaid her tail in the water her head above the surface yes mistress the mermaid said change the wizard looked around that one she pointed to ghina the mermaid reached her arm toward ghina oink she said and ghina became a visible pig forrest was appalled so was ghina she squealed as her clothing dropped off she ran around the floor she was clearly horrified guards circled the pig and prodded it into a cage it looked out tears welling from its eyes understanding its plight the wizard turned back to forrest now i ask you again faun where is your sixth member where is she hiding but no one is hiding forrest said the wizard pointed to jfraya that one the mermaid gestured again olnk and jfraya became another pig she was just as chagrined as ghina it will be kinder if you tell me the wizard said otherwise after all of you are swine we shall just have to hunt her down and kill her now where is she suddenly dawn caught on she thinks imbris an animal she said in a dreamlet so one person is missing eve added and the wizard was going to turn them all into pigs trying to find that missing member of their party she was really taking this matter seriously but that gave him the key to victory imbri he said in the dreamlet locate the margins with your dreamlets tell them now then he spoke aloud to the wizard she is hidden where you will never think to look she will destroy your power you can turn us all into pigs but she will get you so now you are ready to deal the wizard said satisfied turn her over to me and i will let all of you live as prisoners he asked actually he knew she would kill them thus effectively banning them from this region but he was stalling for time perhaps the wizard said unless you agree to use your talents on my behalf so i can take over the provinces of the three lost wizards so that was why she even bothered to negotiate she wanted to increase her power yet more we wont do anything as pigs he said he glanced at jfrayas cageand saw that she had opened a door in it and was escaping neither the wizard nor the guard monsters had noticed that gave him another notion ghina he said in a dreamlet put the mermaid to sleep the wizard considered it will be double or nothing if you serve me you can have your natural forms back if you dont you can be fed to my hungry orcs how do i know you wont feed us to the orcs anyway youre stalling cerci that one the wizard pointed to dawn there was no response the meiryiaid had fallen asleep the wizard glanced at her cerci she snapped the mermaid was jolted awake she looked surprised the wizard squinted so one of you has the ability to induce sleep then we shall delay no more polly another young woman approached coming from the far chamber polly graph tell me the truth the wizard said she faced forrest again where is your sixth member pollys talent had to be to know when a person lied so forrest was careful she is here the wizard looked at polly its true polly said but polly couldnt read the whole truth in the subjects mind so as long as he told part of the truth while evading what the wizard wanted to know he could get away with it still stalling for time where is she here oops the wizard was too sharp what could he say he said nothing cerci that one this time the mermaid did it and dawn became a very pretty light colored pig the answer the wizard said now could imbri still communicate with the margins if she were changed into a pig probably so the wizard didnt realize that animals had intelligence but if he identified imbri the wizard might have her immediately killed he couldnt risk it i wont tell you he said that one and eve was a lovely dark pig now there was only forrest and imbri and only very limited time before they were finished if the wizard had them all killed now she would win maybe it was time to tell the truth he hoped that would give imbri the time she needed she is here he said she is this one he indicated the mare impossible thats just a beast of burden its true mistress polly said the wizard stared at her this beast yes mistress he is speaking the truth so i have them all none are still out there you have us all forrest said good now i need to know how you destroyed the other wiz s so she knew only the fact not the detail we stopped the margins true polly said idiot of course they stopped the margins but how we talked to them forrest said we told them the truth the wizard nodded so i think i know enough guards take all these creatures out to the orcs the guards closed in but then a strange look crossed the wizards face something was happening to her oh im shrinking im shrinking she wailed you horrible faun look what youve done in half a moment the wizard was the size of an elf imbri had gotten through and the margins had cut off their lines all the wizards stolen favors had been canceled and she had reverted to her original size youve destroyed the wizards power polly said amazed true forrest said she will never again be able to exert such magic hey thats great cerci said but who will rule in her place all of you who served her are now free he hoped they wanted to be free gee do you want your friends depigmented yes if you please then we shall have to go homeas i hope the rest of you will do actually once they left this world they would be able to form their natural shapes but ghina and jfraya wouldnt so it was better to get them changed back now they had won and it was time to return to ptero just a moment it was the former gray wizard who was now a gray elf polly had grabbed her before she could escape forrest looked at her you are hoping for better treatment than you accorded us yes because you are kinder people than i was true polly said why shouldnt we just have you changed into a piglet and put outside with the orcs because you are too soft hearted and i can be useful to you forrest looked around cerci had changed all his companions back to their original forms so no permanent damage had been done how can you be useful i can tell the orcs to obey the new mistress of the castle so you wont have any trouble mistress your green door opener she would like the cushy lifestyle available as mistress of the gray castle true polly said but i never jfraya protested the folk here are a unit the gray elf said they like working here they just dont like me if you treat them well they will serve you well true polly said but i assumed they were all captives forrest said true polly said you did so assume but it is false we were better off serving the gray wizard than we would have been out in the snow jfraya remained bemused you cerciyou dont want to go home to the sea well maybe for visits the mermaid said to see my parents cyrus and merci but the truth is that the water out there is cold and i am more comfortable here in the heated pool forrest realized that the elf was performing a useful service she had gotten huge by doing services for many people so was good at it even if she had stolen what she gave away how about ghina he asked i know where there is a winged male goblin of relatively sweet disposition on the blue face where she never would have found him ghinas outfit stood up straight how does he feel about appearanee it is a matter of indifference to him he is blind this has severely restricted his flight and his social life however if he had a companion willing to guide him he would be most grateful the elf was scoring what do you want in return forrest asked because we are not going to let you do too many favors and regain your size only to be returned to my home elf village where they have no idea of my career after departing forrest looked at the two women are you amenable yes they agreed almost together then i leave the premises in your charge jfraya provided you will see to ghinas trip to the blue face the gray elfs safe return to her village and any visits elsewhere that other members of this household desire gladly jfraya said true polly said he looked at the twins and imbri who were standing on the wall then lets return to pyramid but will you visit jfraya asked i havent known you long but it has been thrilling the twins exchanged a glance well try dawn said now that we know how to do it but that requires the good magicians bottle of soul dissolving elixir forrest said we didnt need it to return from torus imbri reminded him she was right he had never thought of using the bottle they had just expanded so it seemed it was needed only for the up loading not the down loading ill leave the bottle with you forrest said since it seems that imbri and i dont need it to return to xanth then they held hands and touched imbri and expanded their substance diffusing into vapor and thence into spirituality the castle shrank around them and they drifted out through its substance the world of ptero was below them or rather around them shrouded in night they headed for it expanding as they went pyramid became a trianglefaceted world behind them and the monstrous outline of idas bead became apparent before them they were more experienced at this than they had been and quickly zeroed in on the starlike candle that princess ida had set out to guide them there were their bodies in repose he was surprised to see that imbris was in girl form until he remembered that this was all that she had mass for here they went through the somewhat unpleasant business of reentering their bodies forrest wondered briefly what would happen if anyone tried to enter the wrong body by mistake would he find himself in dawns body or would eve be in imbris he hoped not surely there was some magical safeguard against it he opened his eyes and sat up the others were doing the same he glanced at the tapestry and saw that no lines were marked on it well were back dawn said which means the faun will soon be moving on eve agreed now that our mission with him is complete so we had better get to our other business before he escapes the two of them stood somewhat unsteadily and converged on forrest but we dont yet know the outcome he protested it wasnt that he objected to the sort of dalliance the girls had in mind but that this did not seem like the proper place for it fauns normally chased nymphs in pleasant glades not castles there is an outcome ida said follow me she stood and walked to the door they did so they went down the stairs and through the hall to the main ballroom ida opened the door the room was packed with people thank you they cried in one mighty voice forrest imbri and the twins stood amazed then the twins made twin shrieks of delight everyones back dawn said daddy eve cried they ran to embrace their father prince dolph you see your service was for the good magician ida said so none of the incidental beneficiaries owe you exchange services but they are nevertheless most grateful king ivy approached the rescued folk wish to meet you and thank you perhaps we should form a receiving line this way they followed her through the crowd to the stage section of the room forrest and imbri stood there while the line formed he still was having trouble getting used to her as a small dark woman rather than a dark horse king ivy snapped her fingers there was immediate silence forrest faun and mare imbrium will meet each of you in turn please introduce yourselves as you approach and do not dally unduly they are surely tired from their unusual journey there will be a banquet at she paused to look at her left wrist where a collection of eyes resided then she looked at her right wrist where a pack of tiny dogs were sitting at dawn according to my watch band and my watch dogs she concluded the first in the line was a young woman i am wigo daughter of hugo and wira my talent is draining magic but i could not prevail against the margins i am so grateful to you for doing it and rescuing us all uh sure thank you forrest said taken aback by such gratitude we were glad to do it imbri said in a dreamlet the next one approached a very small woman i am glitter golem daughter of grundy and rapunzel my talent is the sparkle she illustrated by issuing a shower of sparkles thank you so much for saving us uh forrest began it was so nice meeting you imbris dreamlet said next were two young folk one was a handsome young man in a gray suit i am prince grant with the talent of reading minds he said the other was a young woman with green eyes and brown hair in a green dress i am princess isabella emily carolyn with the talent of borrowing talents for an hour she said we are children of grey and ivy grant added but arent there already forrest began there are many of us in this realm of mightbe isabella explained and my riend arien has a similar talent mightbe covers a lot oh of course forrest knew that how stupid he had been to forget no we understand about the difference in your world grant said we would be similarly confused there isabella agreed uh you two remind me of our cousins dawn eve so nice to meet both of you imbris dreamlet cut in the two laughed and moved on forrest realized that imbri had a much better notion of how to meet people than he did she was preventing him from hopelessly embarrassing himself worse than he already was a child approached i am nora naga daughter of nina naga and briskil son of esk ogre and bria brassier she said i am twelve years old and my talent is to teleport folk or things anywhere i wish i had someone to play with maybe now that everyone is back ill find someone the next one came up a grown man i am trenris the son of magician trent and sorceress iris following their rejuvenation but they were rejuvenated only three or four years ago imbri said this time speaking directly in her surprise how can you be full grown well of course i can be on ptero where geography is time he said but i take it that you mean i should be no more than about fourteen years old at this particular site and the answer is that i am fourteen but that i age rapidly because they are both actually much older than they look my talent is that of reversing the effect of other talents thus making illusions literal or magical spots on the wall fade but i wish someone could reverse my aging before i become decrepit in my youth however that is neither here nor there i came to congratulate you on the success of your mission and to thank you for saving all of us from the dread marginalization wait imbri said have you met surprise i have been surprised by many things no i mean surprise golem daughter of grundy and rapunzel she has multiple talents each of which she can use only once maybe she would change your rate of aging if you helped her in some way this sounds interesting i will look for her we met her sister glitter forrest said she should know where to find surprise i do know glitter he said i will ask her thank you for something more youre welcome imbri said a severe looking woman approached i am misty meanor a curse fiend she said i come to thank you not merely for myself but for two who cannot be here directly gim and gine giant the children of girard and gina giant they are too big to enter the castle but i thought the marginalization affected only the regular human section forrest said the giants happened to be within it and were caught now they are free and hope to return a favor to you if they can forrest looked at imbri we will be traveling west that is to tomorrow if they could carry us some of the way im sure they would be glad to misty said moving on a dusky youth stepped up i am chaos son of d metria after but they were rejuvenated only three or four years ago imbri said this time speaking directly in her surprise how can you be full grown well of course i can be on ptero where geography is time he said but i take it that you mean i should be no more than about fourteen years old at this particular site and the answer is that i am

i thought the marginalization affected only the regular human section forrest said the giants happened to be within it and were caught now they are free and hope to return a favor to you if they can forrest looked at imbri we will be traveling west that is to tomorrow if they could carry us some of the way im sure they would be glad to misty said moving on a dusky youth stepped up i am chaos son of d metria after she discovered how to summon the stork effectively i turn things transparent the line continued until forrest lost track of all the names and talents the folk were all duly grateful but he wished that this could just end so that they could go to the banquet and then be on their way then suddenly the end of the line came there were two handsome young princes we are mourning knight one said the sons of prince naldo naga and mela merwoman the other added we dont have talents as such but we are extremely virile princes something jogged in forrests tired mind have you met the princesses dawn eve we havent had that pleasure but we did catch a glimpse of them from across the room when the four of you entered they look lovely i will send them a dreamlet imbri said it was effective in a moment the two princesses came up i thought you might want to meet princes mourning knight forrest said the sons of he broke off because they were no longer paying him any attention the two princes were gazing at the two princesses and steam was starting to rise from them the two princesses were glancing at the two princes and little hearts were floating out from them in about three quarters of a moment the four linked hands and walked away together i think we wont be seeing them again imbri murmured but we were going tothat is the girls and i did you really want to yes that is do you really feel you should no and he realized that along with his disdppointment was a significant admixture of relief after all they were princesses and he was just a faun their parents surely would not approve imbri took his arm its time for the banquet ill leave the bottle for them so they can visit pyramid again if they want to he said princess ida will surely keep it safe indeed i will ida said taking the bottle the banquet was formidable but forrest was distracted he remembered that all this was but a diversion from his main mission which was to find a faun for his neighbors tree he wasnt sure how much time had passed in xanth but surely a fair amount he needed to get on with it of course imbri murmured understanding his concern the giants are waiting outside so they were they were invisible but imbri located them by their minds the two of them climbed into gim or gines handit was a bit hard to tell the brother giants apartand were lifted high to the faun territory imbri told the giants in a dreamlet or as close to it as you can go our territory borders theirs a giant boomed but it will take a few hours because we must step carefully in human territory lest we squish somebody thats all right forrest said i need some rest anyway for after meeting all the people and the banquet he was quite tired sleep lmbri told him sitting down and taking his head into her lap i will send you sweet dreams she stroked his hair her dreams were very nice and he reveled in them this was the way to travel then the trip ended we are too old to take you farther a giant said indeed his hand was wrinkled but immediately to is the faun section we wish you success thank you forrest said sitting up and sliding off the huge old hand he felt much refreshed imbris lap and dream had helped greatly when his hoofs touched the ground he turned and reached up to help imbri down her slight girl form was pleasantly light they heard the shudder of the ground as the giants departed immediately west was a comic strip oh no if only the giants had been able to set them just beyond it there was nothing to do but plow through it they braced themselves and did that the first part of it was a paved section that looked deceptively innocent but as soon as they stepped on it there was a horrendous barking as of dozens of fierce dogs they jumped back and the noise stopped but i dont see any dogs forrest said imbri explored with her dream mind there dont seem to be any i so they tried againand the barking resumed no dogs just the sounds its a barking lot imbri cried catching on forrest groaned they should outlaw these zones but then the puns would be infesting everything else just as they do in xanth that made him pause maybe i can live with the comic strips after all as they came to the far edge of the lot there was a deep dark pool there was a narrow path around it but the path was blocked by a manytoothed monster can you guess my talent the monster enunciated precisely why should i forrest asked because i won t let you use this path otherwise then maybe ill just go around the other way or swim across the pond forrest said suit yourself if you can handle the rays they circled the pool in the other direction but blocking that path was a squat box with a grill on the front as they approached it shot out rays of bad music the closer they got the worse the music got until it was so utterly obnoxious that they had to fall back with their hands over their ears what is that thing forrest demanded as the music faded to merely annoying its a ray d stupid the monster called the rays letters stand for deafening andnoxious only teenagers can approach it so it seemed they returned to the monster whats your name forrest inquired airy can you guess my talent chomping folk one guess wrong you evidently cant find the right words evidently not forrest agreed sourly he looked again at the pool it seemed clear he touched the surface with a hoot immediately a ray slanted up almost catching his foot before he jerked it back whats that a ray airy said can you guess my talent what kind of ray is it a ray of sunshine forrest touched the water again the ray shot out and this time he saw that it came from a large flat creature deep under the surface was it safe to swim there he doubted it maybe the ray just liked to illuminate the depthsbut maybe that light was so it could better see its prey i think i know the monsters talent imbri said in a dreamlet did you notice how clearly it speaks its talent must be diction diction airy forrest cried thats your talent you pronounce words curses foiled again the monster said and retreated they walked on around the pond but they werent yet out of the comic strip there was a thicket ahead and as they tried to make their way through it two puny orange imps dropped onto their shoulders they were invisible but imbri made a dreamlet that showed them who are you forrest demanded trying to shake off his imp we are punkins the one on his shoulder replied we are pundits who live in the punk trees of the punkin patch and punch out anyone who dasts try to cross it until he groans from the punishment we are very punctual it figured at least the imps seemed reasonably harmless they plowed on ignoring the imps comments and finally lunged out of the comic strip the imps jumped off not caring to be carried out of their element but youll never know when we may strike again they called now at last they were in the region of the fauns but was there a suitable faun for his purpose forrest stared for there running up to meet them was something he tiad never seen or even imagined before it had goats hoofs a tail and the upper section of a human being but it was female hello she said bouncing to a stop she had a huge head of blond hair that flared out and down framing her upper torso to the waist without covering anything i am deanna fauna how may i help you visitor from afar fauna he echoed numbly yet it made sense fauns were crosses between humans and goats why shouldnt there be any female crosses he had never heard of any but this was the world of might hes and indeed there might be such creatures iam forrest faun from xanth i came to ask he faltered halfway mesmerized by her bare front as she breathed a true female of his species what a discovery yes her eyes were big and blue h need a faunor maybe a faunato come to be the spirit of the tree next to mine so it wont fade do youwould you consider to be with you she finished why of course thats what faunas do you must have been horribly unhappy with only nymphs to chase instead of the real thing forrest hadnt thought of it quite that way but realized that the case could be made this did seem to be the answer to his quest well then you can come to xanth and he paused realizing that he wasnt sure how she could do that since she didnt have a body already in xanth it is done by going back in time imbri said the good magician explained it to me he gave me a spell to enable me to take my spirit back to the conjugation of a faun and nymph to enable them to have their signal actually reach the stork works then the stork would deliver deanna as a baby fauna and in due course she would grow to her present age and appearance so she would be there waiting for deannas spirit to animate her at the same time as you return to reanimate your own body then she can become a real person forrest said bound to her tree remembering her past growing gracefully older ugh deanna exclaimed i didnt know there would be such penalties but this is the nature of life in xanth he said fauns and nymphs who adopt trees lose their shallowness and become real people yuck i couldnt stand it but you would be real you would have substance xanth has different rules than ptero for example time is not geography no one can change his or her age just by traveling i would be stuck at one age all the time i couldnt get old and wise or young and sexy any time i wanted not without youth elixir gross forrest stared at her this time seeing her nature rather than her front she was so shallow that she liked shallowness this was no fault in an ordinary faun or nymph but he discovered that he no longer cared for that type of association he had learned too much of full human ways to ever return to contented mindlessness i guess it wouldnt work out he said with real regret are there any other fauns or faunas here who might feel otherwise deanna considered theres faust faun hes a bit odd he chases fauns and hates trees she ran off her limited attention span exhausted that wouldnt do either then i guess what im looking for isnt here forrest said with regret he looked at imbri is there any point in remaining here any longer im afraid not she said im really sorry forrest yet the good magician said he paused again humfrey hadnt actually said anything because he had refused even to hear the question had this entire adventure been for nothing im sure he meant to help you imbri said consolingly he has a funny way of doing it he retorted bitterly and he even made you assist me wasting your time too he always knows what he is doing maybe he refused your question because there was no answer for you but he accepted mine and im sure he will deliver you want a new pasture to gallop in he said remembering maybe this is that pasture and you should stay here but i dont have enough mass to gallop she reminded him thats why im in nymph form well maybe on pyramid where you can be a full mare and leave most of my soul here on ptero i would be nervous about that as a permanent thing he sighed i guess so well i will be glad to have your company a while longer i hope the good magician has the very best pasture for you i hope so too she said but she seemed less than enthusiastic they dissolved their bodies becoming large vague shapes then clouds then growing blobs of thinning souls they drifted into the sky forrest saw the patchwork world of ptero spreading out below and felt nostalgia it had been a remarkable adventure and he had enjoyed much of it especially the interaction with dawn eve but he had known that that relationship wouldnt last and maybe it had been best that it had ended as abruptly as it had with their discovery of princes of their own world unfortunately they had left their mark on him leaving him forever disappointed with mere nymphs as the scene with deanna fauna had shown so this adventure had spoiled him he would never be satisfied with the type of existence he had known before thank you good magician he thought with irony now he saw princess idas huge face he continued to expand orienting on his reposing body in the tapestry chamber of castle roogna but he didnt see imbris body what had happened to it then he realized that she didnt have a body in xanth she had only her half soul imbri did not exist as a living person here the wonderful supportive guide who had traveled with him through three weird worlds could not truly do so in this one that was a loss of another nature he landed on his body and spread into it animating it but it was no glad homecoming what did he have to return to a failed quest and what promised to be an insoluble loneliness of intellect he opened his eyes and sat up oh you are back princess ida said do you have your answer no but how can that be im sure there was something there for you humfrey would not have sent you there otherwise he was too weary of it all to argue maybe not id better get on home now they went downstairs there was a commotion and two six year old children dashed around a corner spied them and skidded to a stop aunt ida dawn cried fofrest faun eve echoed then both girls looked intently at forrest and split a smile between them they looked eerily knowing could these children have any notion of their adult association with him on other worlds dont let them bother you ida murmured dawn cant really tell whats in your mind unless she touches you and eve cant tell where youve been unless she touches some object that was with you that was a reliel and in a moment the two dashed off each hurling back half of a byebye so he was safe from a potentially embarrassing scene ida saw him to the front door im sure you have your answer she said perhaps you just dont yet know it forrest shrugged thank you for the use of your worlds he said you must return and tell me all about it she said i am really curious to know what happened on ptero ill do that he said once i am sure that my tree is well then he faced outward and headed for home feeling desolate may i accompany you imbri he exclaimed i thought you were gone her faint human form appeared beside him no i prefer to see you safely to your tree i dont know when my assignment ends but i think its all right to do that much but dont you want to go to the good magician for your new pasture somehow that pasture has lost its appeal i know the feeling did the adventure on the little worlds spoil you for regular existence as it did me i fear it did forrest im sorry i never meant to ruin your life too i really dont have a life just half a soul so there wasnt much to be ruined he turned to her oh imbri i wish it hadnt happened i was satisfied until this i wasnt satisfied so my loss is less than yours i wish i could console you forrest if i could go back to ptero id let you console me in fact he hesitated surprised i wish i had played faun nymph with you on ptero when you offered now i never can but you wanted a real nymph no i wanted a real person and you are that imbri but im an animal in the same sense i am somewhere in my ancestry the human and caprine stocks got together so i am mostly human at the top and goat at the bottom you are equine in body but human in mind as your nice animation of the nymph form showed thank you she said sadly i would gladly have played with you when i had solidity they encountered two folk going along the path looking lost a young man and a short haired green eyed cat in fact they looked about the way forrest felt so he paused to address them are you looking for something the region of madness the man said im christophe joker justino i think im either coming from it or going to it im not sure which i thought bluejay knew the way but now i think shes lost youre from mundania forrest said i guess tell him to keep going the way theyre going imbri said the region of madness is shrinking but theres still plenty of it to the south forrest remembered that others couldnt see or hear imbri unless she planted a dreamlet in their minds so he relayed the message man and cat thanked him and moved on then forrest realized something theyre like us he exclaimed without bearings depressed not knowing or much caring where theyre going because they cant go back to where they were and wouldnt want to anyway imbri agreed oh forrest if it werent for your obligation to your tree i would truly wish we could go back to ptero maybe to keep company with cathryn centaur or on pyramid he agreed or even on torus if ida cared to share the isle of niffen she said dreamily as a day mare she was very good at dreams i remember how that odd beautiful woman chlorine with the ugly dragon ass said that when i got back i would be happier than i have ever been instead i am sadder you surely are she agreed at least i will be able to make jenny elf happier when i deliver vision centaurs message about the genetic to fix her vision oh yes i had forgotten about that thats nice something swirled ahead of them it coalesced into a familiar demoness so youre back but where is your fellow faun please dont tease me demoness he said tiredly im really not in the mood for it im sorry i didnt mean to he glanced sharply at her you are apologizing i am the demoness metria i have a quarter of a soul so i do care somewhat but it was the demoness mentia i talked to before yes my worser half shes babysitting demon ted while i stretch my substance so i came to check on you following her report what happened my quest failed oh no what then of the clog tree i dont know but didnt the good magician help you not that i know of u well i feel a quarter bad about this so ill help you slightly ill gve you a lift back to your tree that isnt necessary but she was already firming her hands under his elbows and lifting him up in a moment he was flying above the trees and then over the gap chasm actually this did help because he would have had a problem crossing the gap on his own he did need to get back to his sandalwood tree promptly because he wasnt sure how much time had passed there was no sense losing two trees instead of one she set him down in the glade between the trees where in the past he had celebrated with nymphs bye she said and faded out wait he cried she faded back in eyb she asked i met your son chaos his talent is to make things transparent but i dont have such a son not yet but i think hes on the way did you signal the stork again she toted up the count on her fingertips seven hundred and fifty times in the ast year p one of the signals must have gotten through fancy that she said pleased and faded out again that was nice of her giving you the lift imbri said shes a different creature since she got that half soul so am i since i got mine forrest ran to his tree it was all right the spell had maintained it he hugged it then nerved himself for the unpleasant chore where are you going imbri asked to tell the clog tree that i have failed i hate this but it wouldnt be right to let it fade without knowing youre a nice person no im a failed person the clog tree too was in good order thanks to the spell but forrest knew it wouldnt be after he told it his bad news so he dawdled feeling ashamed but unable to squeeze the unkind words out just yet imbri walked up to the tree i like your clogs she said then something strange happened misty colors flitted through the foliage of the tree forming into an image it looked like a woodland scene a lovely little glade in the morning flowers blossomed around its edges and water flowed into a pool in its center a lovely darkhaired nymph sat sunning herself on a slab of sandstone running a crystal comb through her lustrous tresses a figure appeared behind her it was a man no a faun he put his hands over the nymphs eyes then bent down and kissed her on the mouth then he brought out his panpipes and played a merry melody the little black notes rose up scattering across the scene some of them turned white assuming the form of little storks as he played he danced in a moment she got up and danced with him they moved around the glade in a mock chase kicking their feet high to the music but his dance was faster than hers and soon he caught up to her the panpipes disappeared as they joyously embraced and celebrated then they adjourned to the meal she had evidently prepared lemon herbal tea oatcakes and an assortment of creamy goat cheeses he teasingly offered her a horse nut but she declined any more after the first bite tiny hummingbirds flew in to perch on the stones and on the faun and nymph they were all colors scintillating like gems topaz ruby opal and lapis lazuli suddenly forrest recognized the figures they were himself and imbri in her nymph form but what were they doing in a picture in the foliage of the tree he tried to make sense of it imbrl had gone to stand close to the tree and then the scene had formed with the two of them in it loving each other as if the tree had somehow picked up imbris secret thoughts and animated them the dreams of a night mare a glorious suspicion washed through him he reached over his shoulder and plunged his hand into his knapsack he found the dear horn and hauled it out as he did so a fragment of paper fluttered down it must have been caught in the horn he reached down to pick it up could it be the lost notes of the good magician no it was a different piece royally embossed a single word was written on it in a princessly script imbri suddenly he remembered when dawn had touched them on torus and learned something she wouldnt tell she had talked with ida and then hugged and kissed forrest her special favor done but she had d what t was she must have slipped this note into his knapnever sal sack under the cover of her embrace her answer about the identity of the creature he was looking for but why hadnt she just told him now that came clear too if she had his quest would have ended right thereand his mission with dawn eve wasnt yet complete it might have been out of his control he and imbri might have dissolved into soul substance and gone back to xanth unable to stop themselves leaving the human section of ptero to its fate of marginalization so dawn couldnt tell him until after that was done but she wanted to tell him immediately so that her love for him would be equal to eves so she had done so in her fashion giving him a note that he would be sure to see eventually he lifted the dear horn and blew the delightful sound went out and echoed from imbri though she had no substance she was indeed the one she had turned and was looking at him not understanding imbrii saw your dream of you and me together the tree animated it oh she said blushing are you willing to become the spirit of the tree to share its fate until the end but i cant i have no substance yes you can and if you do the tree will lend you enough substance to make a solid body a nymphor a mare so you can gallop in new pastures spirits help trees trees help spirits they are bound together and you and i can be to either physically as in your dream but i never thought why did you do so much more for me than was required by your service to the good magician i wanted to be sure you succeeded what about when the twin princesses were seducing me you never interfered i wanted you to be happy but dont you seethats true love you were doing everything for me with no thought for yourself she blushed again unable to deny it and why didnt you return to the good magician for your answer when your service was done because it was done even if my part of it seemed unsuccessful i justdidnt want to leave you she said and you thought there was no way that the two of us could be together in xanth you didnt know about what trees offer i didnt know she agreed but the tree knew as soon as you came near it knew its spirit interacted with yours it was that interaction i saw she nodded but the good magician surely knew why didnt he tell me because i wasnt ready i thought that all i wanted was a faun for the tree but in the course of the adventure i learned some of the human breadth and depth of mind and emotion that left me forever unsatisfied with less the good magician wouldnt take my question because he knew it was the wrong one he knew that i was your answerfor you didnt know your real desire either it wasnt for a new pasture it was for true love and i could be that loveonce i learned how and now i know that neither nymph nor human woman is what is right for me what i need is a companion who has a similar length of life to my own who truly understands who i can love and be loved by and that is you imbri it was always you it just wasnt always me this is so hard to believe just adopt the clog tree then we will play out your dream scene while you learn to believe i will learn to love you i am already failing for he saw the little hearts forming orbiting his head like tiny moons they were shaping into gemlike hummingbirds she was perfect for him and not only because they had shared an experience like no other oh you mustnt fall and crash she said she turned to the tree stretching out her arms as she did so the foliage became brilliant and her body became solid in the form of a lovely nymph small but perfect then she turned back to forrest to catch him before he fell too far when i wrote this novel i was reminded of the fifth novel ogre ogre because that one introduced a wild new setting of xanth the world of dreams inside the gourd this twentyfirst xanth novel faun games introduces the wild new settings of idas moons i love them and i hope that my readers do too whether there will be more adventures there i dont know not immediately as the next novel will relate to zombies when i started on this one in jamboree i checked my list of reader sent notions and discovered there were and more were piling in it wasnt possible to use them all there are limits even to xanth and the story comes first readers seem to be unable to stifle their urge to emit puns but not all readers like puns so i try to maintain a healthy or at least tolerable balance the problem can be shown by this example which occurred while i was writing faun a reader wrote to suggest that too many puns were degrading xanth so i should slow them down then he concluded his letter with a page and a half of more puns any questions some readers send me multipage notions for future xanth stories i consider these but often they just dont fit in the framework i have its much easier to invent my own story than to work from notions suggested by others the idea most often suggested is the talent of borrowing talents from others i finally have reference to it in this novel and do give a credit but at the risk of alienating hundreds of readers who suggested it before and havent been credited this time i used reader notions dating from trying to give preference to older ones and managed to catch up on most of them through feblueberry and scattered ones thereafter so there are over waiting for the next novel im still making notes of good ones but this seems to be a losing race each novel i am further behind so for those of you who hoped to see your notions here and didnt maybe next time im really in the business of writing novels not publishing lists of names its not that your notions are bad just that there are too many of them meanwhile my dull mundane life continued as i wrote this novel i am not entirely sure why readers want to know about my personal existence but they complain when i dont mention it and on occasion ill get a letter inquiring whether i have died no not that i know of i gave a talk for the last lecture series at the university of south florida the theme of this series being that if you knew it was to be your last lecture ever what would you say i thought about it and concluded that i would want to let others know what i had learned in the course of my researches for my serious writingthe geodyssey historical fiction seriesabout the nature of mankind so i told of the evolution of our species from australopithecus to the present of the complications entailed by learning to walk twofooted of the triple ploy women use to capture and hold men and the true nature of dreams which are actually the brains downtime processing of the experiences of the day for crossreferencing and longterm memory the following month i talked at the american humanist convention in florida telling a love story adapted from the third geodyssey novel relating to the global crisis we face and the manner in which two communities survivalist and pacifist manage to work together to survive it despite their opposite philosophies no not many laughs in these talks both were deadly serious for laughs come to xanth this was the first novel i wrote completely on windows and word on my new pentium system these are powerful programs and slowly i am coming to like them and especially the ergonomic keyboard which looks like a salvador dali painting the programs were the least userfriendly to learn compared to cpm and dos and many applications thereon but the most powerful i remain irritated that i can no longer use the numberpad enter key to do my saves and that the keyboard cursor renamed the vaguely obscene insertion point is almost invisible and cant be made into a visible square as in dos and that there is no ongoing indication which files are saved or unsaved you have to do a special check on each which unsaves it only an idiot would set it up that way but other features are beautiful such as the autocorrect that fixes things as i type truetype that enables me to ensure that it will print exactly as it looks onscreen with a wide variety of fonts and the range of views and colors and sizes i can have onscreen for convenience so now i have green courier new print on a brown background for my novel text and yellow times new roman print for related notes so i know instantly what text im in revisions stand out in cyan and deletions in purple i made a keystroke macro that splits the screen puts postage stamp sized images of my pages in the upper pane and size type in the lower pane so i can see the whole page format at the same time as reading the comfortable magnified print with alternate views on tap when i want them aint magic wonderful some years back i had a problem with my tongue it got sore when it touched one place in my mouth a host of specialists could not fix the problem i remember one he listened carefully to my description then checked it by pulling my tongue about a foot from my face and poking his finger two inches through the bottom of my mouth okay so this is a subjective impression still it gives me a notion how a horse feels when the vet grabs its tongue i think my dentist thought the problem was elsewhere in my head but he made me a stint to protect my tongue from that place and it works i still use it once i was at a party and it came out when i was eating so i put it on the napkin then my wife threw the napkin away no it was an accident she went and fished through the garbage until she recovered it and yes i did wash it before i put it back in my mouth i do keep my mouth clean whatever critics may think i brush my teeth carefully three times a day use a special little brush shaped like a christmas tree once a day and toss once a week i also watch my diet staying generally clear of sweets and alcohol and of course i am a vegetarian yet still my gums recede making my teeth sensitive and at risk for decay during this novel it got worse my gum was festering in one place and the tooth and bone structure were deteriorating what was the matter so my dentist sent me to a periodontist who discovered that it was a specific problem in an otherwise healthy mouth one root of a root canal job had gotten unsealed and infection had weaseled in so he in turn is sending me on to an endodontist to see if it can be repaired it seems its easier to do a root canal than to repair a bad one thus my continuing adventures in dentistry strictly of the mundane kind i also exercise for over a decade i ran three miles cross country three times a week but finally the sandspurs floridas version of curseburrs sugar sand thorny blackberry bushes biting flies and vicissitudes of weather got to me and i moved it indoors i used a stationary cycle with connected handles to exercise the arms as well as the legs and i read publications like liberal opinion week and new scientist and several health newsletters while doing so so it didnt get dull but those machines wear out or break down and it happened again during this novel this time we bought a selfpowered treadmill with arm handles but how could i read so we bought a music stand to hold the magazines but it was too short so we set it up on a stool with a square of plywood on top but then it was too far away so my wife brought out her needlework stretcher frame stand which is a weird multijointed wooden device and clamped it below the top section of the music stand it was unbalanced so we put a small roll of fence wire on its feet to stabilize it and it worked now i can read again while exercising all it takes is a treadmill stool plywood fence wire needlework apparatus music stand and a magazine in other respects life had some unusual aspects the hottest year on record was followed by our coldest winter in some time as i finished the novel the comet hyakutake passed my wife and i went out at odd hours of the night to try to outsmart the ornery trees and clouds and moon so as to catch a glimpse of it i mean if the brightest comet in five centuries comes to celebrate the completion of my novel the least i can do is look at it folk also ask about jenny my paralyzed correspondent who had been hit at age twelve by a drunk driver as described in letters to jenny i still write to her every week at this writing shes nineteen and still mostly paralyzed but she can say several words in one breath can walk several steps when buttressed by leg braces and a wraparound walker and uses a computer to facilitate communication she hopes to go to college if it can be arranged but her life is complicated by continuing bouts of jaw surgery and the need for constant attendance all because one drunk just couldnt wait for schoolchildren with the right of way to get out of his way at this time i also read a book robert a heinleins grumbles from the grave heinlein was arguably the science fiction genres greatest writer its a collection of his letters mostly to his literary agent lurton blassingame who was also my agent describing his reactions to idiot editing critics who pretended to know what was in his mind the demands of fans who thought he should drop everything and give them his full time requests for attendance at numerous functions his travels and thoughts on life i relate to it very well having encountered the same problems its as if other folk believe that a writers novels spring fullblown from the head of zeus requiring no effort so that the writers time has no value one reader angrily stopped reading my novels when he learned that i normally work from am to pm seven days a week catching up on reading during meals and exercise always behind on the mail and whatever else is demanding my attention i love writing but it has been decades since i had actual free time the mail has taken all of it away i simply do the things i need to do and try to catch up after but that mail has its rewards i have been credited with saving a number of lives simply by responding to those who are suicidally depressive and with teaching a number of children the joys of reading because they found my funny fantasy the first interesting books i have grown because of what i have learned from my readers it is also clear that i will never run out of ideas my readers are eager to share theirs with me here at any rate is the list of credits for this novel roughly in order of appearance one of them i am unable to credit because it dates from a decade or so back and i no longer have the correspondence but it still deserves a mention it was a letter from a girl in the neighborhood of twelve who sent me a picture of her ideal planet for a fantasy setting a triangle i pointed out that probably it wasnt flat but three dimensional like a pyramid with four triangular faces and she agreed that was it she has since disappeared into adulthood im sure but the notion remained and finally i decided to use it so if by chance that vanished girl is still reading xanth this is my credit for the notion thank you for pyramid shorter shrift to the others though they are similarly deserving kara
