the aspern papers i i had taken mrs prest into my confidence in truth without her i should have made but little advance for the fruitful idea in the whole business dropped from her friendly lips it was she who invented the short cut who severed the gordian knot it is not supposed to be the nature of women to rise as a general thing to the largest and most liberal view i mean of a practical scheme but it has struck me that they sometimes throw off a bold conception such as a man would not have risen to with singular serenity simply ask them to take you in on the footing of a lodger i dont think that unaided i should have risen to that i was beating about the bush trying to be ingenious wondering by what combination of arts i might become an acquaintance when she offered this happy suggestion that the way to become an acquaintance was first to become an inmate her actual knowledge of the misses bordereau was scarcely larger than mine and indeed i had brought with me from england some definite facts which were new to her their name had been mixed up ages before with one of the greatest names of the century and they lived now in venice in obscurity on very small means unvisited unapproachable in a dilapidated old palace on an outoftheway canal this was the substance of my friends impression of them she herself had been established in venice for fifteen years and had done a great deal of good there but the circle of her benevolence did not include the two shy mysterious and as it was somehow supposed scarcely respectable americans they were believed to have lost in their long exile all national quality besides having had as their name implied some french strain in their origin who asked no favors and desired no attention in the early years of her residence she had made an attempt to see them but this had been successful only as regards the little one as mrs prest called the niece though in reality as i afterward learned she was considerably the bigger of the two she had heard miss bordereau was ill and had a suspicion that she was in want and she had gone to the house to offer assistance so that if there were suffering and american suffering she should at least not have it on her conscience the little one received her in the great cold tarnished venetian sala the central hall of the house paved with marble and roofed with dim crossbeams and did not even ask her to sit down this was not encouraging for me who wished to sit so fast and i remarked as much to mrs prest she however replied with profundity ah but theres all the difference i went to confer a favor and you will go to ask one if they are proud you will be on the right side and she offered to show me their house to begin with to row me thither in her gondola i let her know that i had already been to look at it half a dozen times but i accepted her invitation for it charmed me to hover about the place i had made my way to it the day after my arrival in venice it had been described to me in advance by the friend in england to whom i owed definite information as to their possession of the papers and i had besieged it with my eyes while i considered my plan of campaign jeffrey aspern had never been in it that i knew of but some note of his voice seemed to abide there by a roundabout implication a faint reverberation mrs prest knew nothing about the papers but she was interested in my curiosity as she was always interested in the joys and sorrows of her friends as we went however in her gondola gliding there under the sociable hood with the bright venetian picture framed on either side by the movable window i could see that she was amused by my infatuation the way my interest in the papers had become a fixed idea one would think you expected to find in them the answer to the riddle of the universe she said and i denied the impeachment only by replying that if i had to choose between that precious solution and a bundle of jeffrey asperns letters i knew indeed which would appear to me the greater boon she pretended to make light of his genius and i took no pains to defend him one doesnt defend ones god ones god is in himself a defense besides today after his long comparative obscuration he hangs high in the heaven of our literature for all the world to see he is a part of the light by which we walk the most i said was that he was no doubt not a womans poet to which she rejoined aptly enough that he had been at least miss bordereaus the strange thing had been for me to discover in england that she was still alive it was as if i had been told mrs siddons was or queen caroline or the famous lady hamilton for it seemed to me that she belonged to a generation as extinct why she must be tremendously old at least a hundred i had said but on coming to consider dates i saw that it was not strictly necessary that she should have exceeded by very much the common span nonetheless she was very far advanced in life and her relations with jeffrey aspern had occurred in her early womanhood that is her excuse said mrs prest halfsententiously and yet also somewhat as if she were ashamed of making a speech so little in the real tone of venice as if a woman needed an excuse for having loved the divine poet he had been not only one of the most brilliant minds of his day and in those years when the century was young there were as everyone knows many but one of the most genial men and one of the handsomest the niece according to mrs prest was not so old and she risked the conjecture that she was only a grandniece this was possible i had nothing but my share in the very limited knowledge of my english fellow worshipper john cumnor who had never seen the couple the world as i say had recognized jeffrey aspern but cumnor and i had recognized him most the multitude today flocked to his temple but of that temple he and i regarded ourselves as the ministers we held justly as i think that we had done more for his memory than anyone else and we had done it by opening lights into his life he had nothing to fear from us because he had nothing to fear from the truth which alone at such a distance of time we could be interested in establishing his early death had been the only dark spot in his life unless the papers in miss bordereaus hands should perversely bring out others there had been an impression about that he had treated her badly just as there had been an impression that he had served as the london populace says several other ladies in the same way each of these cases cumnor and i had been able to investigate and we had never failed to acquit him conscientiously of shabby behavior i judged him perhaps more indulgently than my friend certainly at any rate it appeared to me that no man could have walked straighter in the given circumstances these were almost always awkward half the women of his time to speak liberally had flung themselves at his head and out of this pernicious fashion many complications some of them grave had not failed to arise he was not a womans poet as i had said to mrs prest in the modern phase of his reputation but the situation had been different when the mans own voice was mingled with his song that voice by every testimony was one of the sweetest ever heard orpheus and the maenads was the exclamation that rose to my lips when i first turned over his correspondence almost all the maenads were unreasonable and many of them insupportable it struck me in short that he was kinder more considerate than in his place if i could imagine myself in such a place i should have been it was certainly strange beyond all strangeness and i shall not take up space with attempting to explain it that whereas in all these other lines of research we had to deal with phantoms and dust the mere echoes of echoes the one living source of information that had lingered on into our time had been unheeded by us every one of asperns contemporaries had according to our belief passed away we had not been able to look into a single pair of eyes into which his had looked or to feel a transmitted contact in any aged hand that his had touched most dead of all did poor miss bordereau appear and yet she alone had survived we exhausted in the course of months our wonder that we had not found her out sooner and the substance of our explanation was that she had kept so quiet the poor lady on the whole had had reason for doing so but it was a revelation to us that it was possible to keep so quiet as that in the latter half of the nineteenth century the age of newspapers and telegrams and photographs and interviewers and she had taken no great trouble about it either she had not hidden herself away in an undiscoverable hole she had boldly settled down in a city of exhibition the only secret of her safety that we could perceive was that venice contained so many curiosities that were greater than she and then accident had somehow favored her as was shown for example in the fact that mrs prest had never happened to mention her to me though i had spent three weeks in venice under her nose as it were five years before mrs prest had not mentioned this much to anyone she appeared almost to have forgotten she was there of course she had not the responsibilities of an editor it was no explanation of the old womans having eluded us to say that she lived abroad for our researches had again and again taken us not only by correspondence but by personal inquiry to france to germany to italy in which countries not counting his important stay in england so many of the too few years of asperns career were spent we were glad to think at least that in all our publishings some people consider i believe that we have overdone them we had only touched in passing and in the most discreet manner on miss bordereaus connection oddly enough even if we had had the material and we often wondered what had become of it it would have been the most difficult episode to handle the gondola stopped the old palace was there it was a house of the class which in venice carries even in extreme dilapidation the dignified name how charming its gray and pink my companion exclaimed and that is the most comprehensive description of it it was not particularly old only two or three centuries and it had an air not so much of decay as of quiet discouragement as if it had rather missed its career but its wide front with a stone balcony from end to end of the piano nobile or most important floor was architectural enough with the aid of various pilasters and arches and the stucco with which in the intervals it had long ago been endued was rosy in the april afternoon it overlooked a clean melancholy unfrequented canal which had a narrow riva or convenient footway on either side i dont know why there are no brick gables said mrs prest but this corner has seemed to me before more dutch than italian more like amsterdam than like venice its perversely clean for reasons of its own and though you can pass on foot scarcely anyone ever thinks of doing so it has the air of a protestant sunday perhaps the people are afraid of the misses bordereau i daresay they have the reputation of witches i forget what answer i made to this i was given up to two other reflections the first of these was that if the old lady lived in such a big imposing house she could not be in any sort of misery and therefore would not be tempted by a chance to let a couple of rooms i expressed this idea to mrs prest who gave me a very logical reply if she didnt live in a big house how could it be a question of her having rooms to spare if she were not amply lodged herself you would lack ground to approach her besides a big house here and especially in this quartier perdu proves nothing at all it is perfectly compatible with a state of penury dilapidated old palazzi if you will go out of the way for them are to be had for five shillings a year and as for the people who live in them no until you have explored venice socially as much as i have you can form no idea of their domestic desolation they live on nothing for they have nothing to live on the other idea that had come into my head was connected with a high blank wall which appeared to confine an expanse of ground on one side of the house blank i call it but it was figured over with the patches that please a painter repaired breaches crumblings of plaster extrusions of brick that had turned pink with time and a few thin trees with the poles of certain rickety trellises were visible over the top the place was a garden and apparently it belonged to the house it suddenly occurred to me that if it did belong to the house i had my pretext i sat looking out on all this with mrs prest it was covered with the golden glow of venice from the shade of our felze and she asked me if i would go in then while she waited for me or come back another time at first i could not decide it was doubtless very weak of me i wanted still to think i might get a footing and i was afraid to meet failure for it would leave me as i remarked to my companion without another arrow for my bow why not another she inquired as i sat there hesitating and thinking it over and she wished to know why even now and before taking the trouble of becoming an inmate which might be wretchedly uncomfortable after all even if it succeeded i had not the resource of simply offering them a sum of money down in that way i might obtain the documents without bad nights dearest lady i exclaimed excuse the impatience of my tone when i suggest that you must have forgotten the very fact surely i communicated it to you which pushed me to throw myself upon your ingenuity the old woman wont have the documents spoken of they are personal delicate intimate and she hasnt modern notions god bless her if i should sound that note first i should certainly spoil the game i can arrive at the papers only by putting her off her guard and i can put her off her guard only by ingratiating diplomatic practices hypocrisy duplicity are my only chance i am sorry for it but for jeffrey asperns sake i would do worse still first i must take tea with her then tackle the main job and i told over what had happened to john cumnor when he wrote to her no notice whatever had been taken of his first letter and the second had been answered very sharply in six lines by the niece miss bordereau requested her to say that she could not imagine what he meant by troubling them they had none of mr asperns papers and if they had should never think of showing them to anyone on any account whatever she didnt know what he was talking about and begged he would let her alone i certainly did not want to be met that way well said mrs prest after a moment provokingly perhaps after all they havent any of his things if they deny it flat how are you sure john cumnor is sure and it would take me long to tell you how his conviction or his very strong presumption strong enough to stand against the old ladys not unnatural fib has built itself up besides he makes much of the internal evidence of the nieces letter the internal evidence her calling him mr aspern i dont see what that proves it proves familiarity and familiarity implies the possession of mementoes or relics i cant tell you how that mr touches me how it bridges over the gulf of time and brings our hero near to me nor what an edge it gives to my desire to see juliana you dont say mr shakespeare would i any more if i had a box full of his letters yes if he had been your lover and someone wanted them and i added that john cumnor was so convinced and so all the more convinced by miss bordereaus tone that he would have come himself to venice on the business were it not that for him there was the obstacle that it would be difficult to disprove his identity with the person who had written to them which the old ladies would be sure to suspect in spite of dissimulation and a change of name if they were to ask him pointblank if he were not their correspondent it would be too awkward for him to lie whereas i was fortunately not tied in that way i was a fresh hand and could say no without lying but you will have to change your name said mrs prest juliana lives out of the world as much as it is possible to live but none the less she has probably heard of mr asperns editors she perhaps possesses what you have published i have thought of that i returned and i drew out of my pocketbook a visiting card neatly engraved with a name that was not my own you are very extravagant you might have written it said my companion this looks more genuine certainly you are prepared to go far but it will be awkward about your letters they wont come to you in that mask my banker will take them in and i will go every day to fetch them it will give me a little walk shall you only depend upon that asked mrs prest arent you coming to see me oh you will have left venice for the hot months long before there are any results i am prepared to roast all summer as well as hereafter perhaps youll say meanwhile john cumnor will bombard me with letters addressed in my feigned name to the care of the padrona she will recognize his hand my companion suggested on the envelope he can disguise it well youre a precious pair doesnt it occur to you that even if you are able to say you are not mr cumnor in person they may still suspect you of being his emissary certainly and i see only one way to parry that and what may that be i hesitated a moment to make love to the niece ah cried mrs prest wait till you see her ii i must work the garden i must work the garden i said to myself five minutes later as i waited upstairs in the long dusky sala where the bare scagliola floor gleamed vaguely in a chink of the closed shutters the place was impressive but it looked cold and cautious mrs prest had floated away giving me a rendezvous at the end of half an hour by some neighboring water steps and i had been let into the house after pulling the rusty bell wire by a little redheaded whitefaced maidservant who was very young and not ugly and wore clicking pattens and a shawl in the fashion of a hood she had not contented herself with opening the door from above by the usual arrangement of a creaking pulley though she had looked down at me first from an upper window dropping the inevitable challenge which in italy precedes the hospitable act as a general thing i was irritated by this survival of medieval manners though as i liked the old i suppose i ought to have liked it but i was so determined to be genial that i took my false card out of my pocket and held it up to her smiling as if it were a magic token it had the effect of one indeed for it brought her as i say all the way down i begged her to hand it to her mistress having first written on it in italian the words could you very kindly see a gentleman an american for a moment the little maid was not hostile and i reflected that even that was perhaps something gained she colored she smiled and looked both frightened and pleased i could see that my arrival was a great affair that visits were rare in that house and that she was a person who would have liked a sociable place when she pushed forward the heavy door behind me i felt that i had a foot in the citadel she pattered across the damp stony lower hall and i followed her up the high staircase stonier still as it seemed without an invitation i think she had meant i should wait for her below but such was not my idea and i took up my station in the sala she flitted at the far end of it into impenetrable regions and i looked at the place with my heart beating as i had known it to do in the dentists parlor it was gloomy and stately but it owed its character almost entirely to its noble shape and to the fine architectural doors as high as the doors of houses which leading into the various rooms repeated themselves on either side at intervals they were surmounted with old faded painted escutcheons and here and there in the spaces between them brown pictures which i perceived to be bad in battered frames were suspended with the exception of several strawbottomed chairs with their backs to the wall the grand obscure vista contained nothing else to minister to effect it was evidently never used save as a passage and little even as that i may add that by the time the door opened again through which the maidservant had escaped my eyes had grown used to the want of light i had not meant by my private ejaculation that i must myself cultivate the soil of the tangled enclosure which lay beneath the windows but the lady who came toward me from the distance over the hard shining floor might have supposed as much from the way in which as i went rapidly to meet her i exclaimed taking care to speak italian the garden the garden do me the pleasure to tell me if its yours she stopped short looking at me with wonder and then nothing here is mine she answered in english coldly and sadly oh you are english how delightful i remarked ingenuously but surely the garden belongs to the house yes but the house doesnt belong to me she was a long lean pale person habited apparently in a dullcolored dressing gown and she spoke with a kind of mild literalness she did not ask me to sit down any more than years before if she were the niece she had asked mrs prest and we stood face to face in the empty pompous hall well then would you kindly tell me to whom i must address myself im afraid youll think me odiously intrusive but you know i must have a garden upon my honor i must her face was not young but it was simple it was not fresh but it was mild she had large eyes which were not bright and a great deal of hair which was not dressed and long fine hands which were possibly not clean she clasped these members almost convulsively as with a confused alarmed look she broke out oh dont take it away from us we like it ourselves you have the use of it then oh yes if it wasnt for that and she gave a shy melancholy smile isnt it a luxury precisely thats why intending to be in venice some weeks possibly all summer and having some literary work some reading and writing to do so that i must be quiet and yet if possible a great deal in the open air thats why i have felt that a garden is really indispensable i appeal to your own experience i went on smiling now cant i look at yours i dont know i dont understand the poor woman murmured planted there and letting her embarrassed eyes wander all over my strangeness i mean only from one of those windows such grand ones as you have here if you will let me open the shutters and i walked toward the back of the house when i had advanced halfway i stopped and waited as if i took it for granted she would accompany me i had been of necessity very abrupt but i strove at the same time to give her the impression of extreme courtesy i have been looking at furnished rooms all over the place and it seems impossible to find any with a garden attached naturally in a place like venice gardens are rare its absurd if you like for a man but i cant live without flowers there are none to speak of down there she came nearer to me as if though she mistrusted me i had drawn her by an invisible thread i went on again and she continued as she followed me we have a few but they are very common it costs too much to cultivate them one has to have a man why shouldnt i be the man i asked ill work without wages or rather ill put in a gardener you shall have the sweetest flowers in venice she protested at this with a queer little sigh which might also have been a gush of rapture at the picture i presented then she observed we dont know you we dont know you you know me as much as i know you that is much more because you know my name and if you are english i am almost a countryman we are not english said my companion watching me helplessly while i threw open the shutters of one of the divisions of the wide high window you speak the language so beautifully might i ask what you are seen from above the garden was certainly shabby but i perceived at a glance that it had great capabilities she made no rejoinder she was so lost in staring at me and i exclaimed you dont mean to say you are also by chance american i dont know we used to be used to be surely you havent changed its so many years ago we are nothing so many years that you have been living here well i dont wonder at that its a grand old house i suppose you all use the garden i went on but i assure you i shouldnt be in your way i would be very quiet and stay in one corner we all use it she repeated after me vaguely not coming close to the window but looking at my shoes she appeared to think me capable of throwing her out i mean all your family as many as you are there is only one other she is very old she never goes down only one other in all this great house i feigned to be not only amazed but almost scandalized dear lady you must have space then to spare to spare she repeated in the same dazed way why you surely dont live two quiet women i see you are quiet at any rate in fifty rooms then with a burst of hope and cheer i demanded couldnt you let me two or three that would set me up i had not struck the note that translated my purpose and i need not reproduce the whole of the tune i played i ended by making my interlocutress believe that i was an honorable person though of course i did not even attempt to persuade her that i was not an eccentric one i repeated that i had studies to pursue that i wanted quiet that i delighted in a garden and had vainly sought one up and down the city that i would undertake that before another month was over the dear old house should be smothered in flowers i think it was the flowers that won my suit for i afterward found that miss tita for such the name of this high tremulous spinster proved somewhat incongruously to be had an insatiable appetite for them when i speak of my suit as won i mean that before i left her she had promised that she would refer the question to her aunt i inquired who her aunt might be and she answered why miss bordereau with an air of surprise as if i might have been expected to know there were contradictions like this in tita bordereau which as i observed later contributed to make her an odd and affecting person it was the study of the two ladies to live so that the world should not touch them and yet they had never altogether accepted the idea that it never heard of them in tita at any rate a grateful susceptibility to human contact had not died out and contact of a limited order there would be if i should come to live in the house we have never done anything of the sort we have never had a lodger or any kind of inmate so much as this she made a point of saying to me we are very poor we live very badly the rooms are very bare that you might take they have nothing in them i dont know how you would sleep how you would eat with your permission i could easily put in a bed and a few tables and chairs cest la moindre des choses and the affair of an hour or two i know a little man from whom i can hire what i should want for a few months for a trifle and my gondolier can bring the things round in his boat of course in this great house you must have a second kitchen and my servant who is a wonderfully handy fellow this personage was an evocation of the moment can easily cook me a chop there my tastes and habits are of the simplest i live on flowers and then i ventured to add that if they were very poor it was all the more reason they should let their rooms they were bad economists i had never heard of such a waste of material i saw in a moment that the good lady had never before been spoken to in that way with a kind of humorous firmness which did not exclude sympathy but was on the contrary founded on it she might easily have told me that my sympathy was impertinent but this by good fortune did not occur to her i left her with the understanding that she would consider the matter with her aunt and that i might come back the next day for their decision the aunt will refuse she will think the whole proceeding very louche mrs prest declared shortly after this when i had resumed my place in her gondola she had put the idea into my head and now so little are women to be counted on she appeared to take a despondent view of it her pessimism provoked me and i pretended to have the best hopes i went so far as to say that i had a distinct presentiment that i should succeed upon this mrs prest broke out oh i see whats in your head you fancy you have made such an impression in a quarter of an hour that she is dying for you to come and can be depended upon to bring the old one round if you do get in youll count it as a triumph i did count it as a triumph but only for the editor in the last analysis not for the man who had not the tradition of personal conquest when i went back on the morrow the little maidservant conducted me straight through the long sala it opened there as before in perfect perspective and was lighter now which i thought a good omen into the apartment from which the recipient of my former visit had emerged on that occasion it was a large shabby parlor with a fine old painted ceiling and a strange figure sitting alone at one of the windows they come back to me now almost with the palpitation they caused the successive feelings that accompanied my consciousness that as the door of the room closed behind me i was really face to face with the juliana of some of asperns most exquisite and most renowned lyrics i grew used to her afterward though never completely but as she sat there before me my heart beat as fast as if the miracle of resurrection had taken place for my benefit her presence seemed somehow to contain his and i felt nearer to him at that first moment of seeing her than i ever had been before or ever have been since yes i remember my emotions in their order even including a curious little tremor that took me when i saw that the niece was not there with her the day before i had become sufficiently familiar but it almost exceeded my courage much as i had longed for the event to be left alone with such a terrible relic as the aunt she was too strange too literally resurgent then came a check with the perception that we were not really face to face inasmuch as she had over her eyes a horrible green shade which for her served almost as a mask i believed for the instant that she had put it on expressly so that from underneath it she might scrutinize me without being scrutinized herself at the same time it increased the presumption that there was a ghastly deathshead lurking behind it the divine juliana as a grinning skull the vision hung there until it passed then it came to me that she was tremendously old so old that death might take her at any moment before i had time to get what i wanted from her the next thought was a correction to that it lighted up the situation she would die next week she would die tomorrow then i could seize her papers meanwhile she sat there neither moving nor speaking she was very small and shrunken bent forward with her hands in her lap she was dressed in black and her head was wrapped in a piece of old black lace which showed no hair my emotion keeping me silent she spoke first and the remark she made was exactly the most unexpected iii our house is very far from the center but the little canal is very comme il faut its the sweetest corner of venice and i can imagine nothing more charming i hastened to reply the old ladys voice was very thin and weak but it had an agreeable cultivated murmur and there was wonder in the thought that that individual note had been in jeffrey asperns ear please to sit down there i hear very well she said quietly as if perhaps i had been shouting at her and the chair she pointed to was at a certain distance i took possession of it telling her that i was perfectly aware that i had intruded that i had not been properly introduced and could only throw myself upon her indulgence perhaps the other lady the one i had had the honor of seeing the day before would have explained to her about the garden that was literally what had given me courage to take a step so unconventional i had fallen in love at sight with the whole place she herself probably was so used to it that she did not know the impression it was capable of making on a stranger and i had felt it was really a case to risk something was her own kindness in receiving me a sign that i was not wholly out in my calculation it would render me extremely happy to think so i could give her my word of honor that i was a most respectable inoffensive person and that as an inmate they would be barely conscious of my existence i would conform to any regulations any restrictions if they would only let me enjoy the garden moreover i should be delighted to give her references guarantees they would be of the very best both in venice and in england as well as in america she listened to me in perfect stillness and i felt that she was looking at me with great attention though i could see only the lower part of her bleached and shriveled face independently of the refining process of old age it had a delicacy which once must have been great she had been very fair she had had a wonderful complexion she was silent a little after i had ceased speaking then she inquired if you are so fond of a garden why dont you go to terra firma where there are so many far better than this oh its the combination i answered smiling and then with rather a flight of fancy its the idea of a garden in the middle of the sea its not in the middle of the sea you cant see the water i stared a moment wondering whether she wished to convict me of fraud cant see the water why dear madam i can come up to the very gate in my boat she appeared inconsequent for she said vaguely in reply to this yes if you have got a boat i havent any its many years since i have been in one of the gondolas she uttered these words as if the gondolas were a curious faraway craft which she knew only by hearsay let me assure you of the pleasure with which i would put mine at your service i exclaimed i had scarcely said this however before i became aware that the speech was in questionable taste and might also do me the injury of making me appear too eager too possessed of a hidden motive but the old woman remained impenetrable and her attitude bothered me by suggesting that she had a fuller vision of me than i had of her she gave me no thanks for my somewhat extravagant offer but remarked that the lady i had seen the day before was her niece she would presently come in she had asked her to stay away a little on purpose because she herself wished to see me at first alone she relapsed into silence and i asked myself why she had judged this necessary and what was coming yet also whether i might venture on some judicious remark in praise of her companion i went so far as to say that i should be delighted to see her again she had been so very courteous to me considering how odd she must have thought me a declaration which drew from miss bordereau another of her whimsical speeches she has very good manners i bred her up myself i was on the point of saying that that accounted for the easy grace of the niece but i arrested myself in time and the next moment the old woman went on i dont care who you may be i dont want to know it signifies very little today this had all the air of being a formula of dismissal as if her next words would be that i might take myself off now that she had had the amusement of looking on the face of such a monster of indiscretion therefore i was all the more surprised when she added with her soft venerable quaver you may have as many rooms as you like if you will pay a good deal of money i hesitated but for a single instant long enough to ask myself what she meant in particular by this condition first it struck me that she must have really a large sum in her mind then i reasoned quickly that her idea of a large sum would probably not correspond to my own my deliberation i think was not so visible as to diminish the promptitude with which i replied i will pay with pleasure and of course in advance whatever you may think is proper to ask me well then a thousand francs a month she rejoined instantly while her baffling green shade continued to cover her attitude the figure as they say was startling and my logic had been at fault the sum she had mentioned was by the venetian measure of such matters exceedingly large there was many an old palace in an outoftheway corner that i might on such terms have enjoyed by the year but so far as my small means allowed i was prepared to spend money and my decision was quickly taken i would pay her with a smiling face what she asked but in that case i would give myself the compensation of extracting the papers from her for nothing moreover if she had asked five times as much i should have risen to the occasion so odious would it have appeared to me to stand chaffering with asperns juliana it was queer enough to have a question of money with her at all i assured her that her views perfectly met my own and that on the morrow i should have the pleasure of putting three months rent into her hand she received this announcement with serenity and with no apparent sense that after all it would be becoming of her to say that i ought to see the rooms first this did not occur to her and indeed her serenity was mainly what i wanted our little bargain was just concluded when the door opened and the younger lady appeared on the threshold as soon as miss bordereau saw her niece she cried out almost gaily he will give three thousand three thousand tomorrow miss tita stood still with her patient eyes turning from one of us to the other then she inquired scarcely above her breath do you mean francs did you mean francs or dollars the old woman asked of me at this i think francs were what you said i answered smiling that is very good said miss tita as if she had become conscious that her own question might have looked overreaching what do you know you are ignorant miss bordereau remarked not with acerbity but with a strange soft coldness yes of money certainly of money miss tita hastened to exclaim i am sure you have your own branches of knowledge i took the liberty of saying genially there was something painful to me somehow in the turn the conversation had taken in the discussion of the rent she had a very good education when she was young i looked into that myself said miss bordereau then she added but she has learned nothing since i have always been with you miss tita rejoined very mildly and evidently with no intention of making an epigram yes but for that her aunt declared with more satirical force she evidently meant that but for this her niece would never have got on at all the point of the observation however being lost on miss tita though she blushed at hearing her history revealed to a stranger miss bordereau went on addressing herself to me and what time will you come tomorrow with the money the sooner the better if it suits you i will come at noon i am always here but i have my hours said the old woman as if her convenience were not to be taken for granted you mean the times when you receive i never receive but i will see you at noon when you come with the money very good i shall be punctual and i added may i shake hands with you on our contract i thought there ought to be some little form it would make me really feel easier for i foresaw that there would be no other besides though miss bordereau could not today be called personally attractive and there was something even in her wasted antiquity that bade one stand at ones distance i felt an irresistible desire to hold in my own for a moment the hand that jeffrey aspern had pressed for a minute she made no answer and i saw that my proposal failed to meet with her approbation she indulged in no movement of withdrawal which i halfexpected she only said coldly i belong to a time when that was not the custom i felt rather snubbed but i exclaimed good humoredly to miss tita oh you will do as well i shook hands with her while she replied with a small flutter yes yes to show its all arranged shall you bring the money in gold miss bordereau demanded as i was turning to the door i looked at her for a moment arent you a little afraid after all of keeping such a sum as that in the house it was not that i was annoyed at her avidity but i was really struck with the disparity between such a treasure and such scanty means of guarding it whom should i be afraid of if i am not afraid of you she asked with her shrunken grimness ah well said i laughing i shall be in point of fact a protector and i will bring gold if you prefer thank you the old woman returned with dignity and with an inclination of her head which evidently signified that i might depart i passed out of the room reflecting that it would not be easy to circumvent her as i stood in the sala again i saw that miss tita had followed me and i supposed that as her aunt had neglected to suggest that i should take a look at my quarters it was her purpose to repair the omission but she made no such suggestion she only stood there with a dim though not a languid smile and with an effect of irresponsible incompetent youth which was almost comically at variance with the faded facts of her person she was not infirm like her aunt but she struck me as still more helpless because her inefficiency was spiritual which was not the case with miss bordereaus i waited to see if she would offer to show me the rest of the house but i did not precipitate the question inasmuch as my plan was from this moment to spend as much of my time as possible in her society i only observed at the end of a minute i have had better fortune than i hoped it was very kind of her to see me perhaps you said a good word for me it was the idea of the money said miss tita and did you suggest that i told her that you would perhaps give a good deal what made you think that i told her i thought you were rich and what put that idea into your head i dont know the way you talked dear me i must talk differently now i declared im sorry to say its not the case well said miss tita i think that in venice the forestieri in general often give a great deal for something that after all isnt much she appeared to make this remark with a comforting intention to wish to remind me that if i had been extravagant i was not really foolishly singular we walked together along the sala and as i took its magnificent measure i said to her that i was afraid it would not form a part of my quartiere were my rooms by chance to be among those that opened into it not if you go above on the second floor she answered with a little startled air as if she had rather taken for granted i would know my proper place and i infer that thats where your aunt would like me to be she said your apartments ought to be very distinct that certainly would be best and i listened with respect while she told me that up above i was free to take whatever i liked that there was another staircase but only from the floor on which we stood and that to pass from it to the gardenstory or to come up to my lodging i should have in effect to cross the great hall this was an immense point gained i foresaw that it would constitute my whole leverage in my relations with the two ladies when i asked miss tita how i was to manage at present to find my way up she replied with an access of that sociable shyness which constantly marked her manner perhaps you cant i dont see unless i should go with you she evidently had not thought of this before we ascended to the upper floor and visited a long succession of empty rooms the best of them looked over the garden some of the others had a view of the blue lagoon above the opposite roughtiled housetops they were all dusty and even a little disfigured with long neglect but i saw that by spending a few hundred francs i should be able to convert three or four of them into a convenient habitation my experiment was turning out costly yet now that i had all but taken possession i ceased to allow this to trouble me i mentioned to my companion a few of the things that i should put in but she replied rather more precipitately than usual that i might do exactly what i liked she seemed to wish to notify me that the misses bordereau would take no overt interest in my proceedings i guessed that her aunt had instructed her to adopt this tone and i may as well say now that i came afterward to distinguish perfectly as i believed between the speeches she made on her own responsibility and those the old lady imposed upon her she took no notice of the unswept condition of the rooms and indulged in no explanations nor apologies i said to myself that this was a sign that juliana and her niece disenchanting idea were untidy persons with a low italian standard but i afterward recognized that a lodger who had forced an entrance had no locus standi as a critic we looked out of a good many windows for there was nothing within the rooms to look at and still i wanted to linger i asked her what several different objects in the prospect might be but in no case did she appear to know she was evidently not familiar with the view it was as if she had not looked at it for years and i presently saw that she was too preoccupied with something else to pretend to care for it suddenly she said the remark was not suggested i dont know whether it will make any difference to you but the money is for me the money the money you are going to bring why youll make me wish to stay here two or three years i spoke as benevolently as possible though it had begun to act on my nerves that with these women so associated with aspern the pecuniary question should constantly come back that would be very good for me she replied smiling you put me on my honor she looked as if she failed to understand this but went on she wants me to have more she thinks she is going to die ah not soon i hope i exclaimed with genuine feeling i had perfectly considered the possibility that she would destroy her papers on the day she should feel her end really approach i believed that she would cling to them till then and i think i had an idea that she read asperns letters over every night or at least pressed them to her withered lips i would have given a good deal to have a glimpse of the latter spectacle i asked miss tita if the old lady were seriously ill and she replied that she was only very tired she had lived so very very long that was what she said herself she wanted to die for a change besides all her friends were dead long ago either they ought to have remained or she ought to have gone that was another thing her aunt often said she was not at all content but people dont die when they like do they miss tita inquired i took the liberty of asking why if there was actually enough money to maintain both of them there would not be more than enough in case of her being left alone she considered this difficult problem a moment and then she said oh well you know she takes care of me she thinks that when im alone i shall be a great fool i shall not know how to manage i should have supposed that you took care of her im afraid she is very proud why have you discovered that already miss tita cried with the glimmer of an illumination in her face i was shut up with her there for a considerable time and she struck me she interested me extremely it didnt take me long to make my discovery she wont have much to say to me while im here no i dont think she will my companion averred do you suppose she has some suspicion of me miss titas honest eyes gave me no sign that i had touched a mark i shouldnt think so letting you in after all so easily oh so easily she has covered her risk but where is it that one could take an advantage of her i oughtnt to tell you if i knew ought i and miss tita added before i had time to reply to this smiling dolefully do you think we have any weak points thats exactly what im asking you would only have to mention them for me to respect them religiously she looked at me at this with that air of timid but candid and even gratified curiosity with which she had confronted me from the first and then she said there is nothing to tell we are terribly quiet i dont know how the days pass we have no life i wish i might think that i should bring you a little oh we know what we want she went on its all right there were various things i desired to ask her how in the world they did live whether they had any friends or visitors any relations in america or in other countries but i judged such an inquiry would be premature i must leave it to a later chance well dont you be proud i contented myself with saying dont hide from me altogether oh i must stay with my aunt she returned without looking at me and at the same moment abruptly without any ceremony of parting she quitted me and disappeared leaving me to make my own way downstairs i remained a while longer wandering about the bright desert the sun was pouring in of the old house thinking the situation over on the spot not even the pattering little serva came to look after me and i reflected that after all this treatment showed confidence iv perhaps it did but all the same six weeks later toward the middle of june the moment when mrs prest undertook her annual migration i had made no measurable advance i was obliged to confess to her that i had no results to speak of my first step had been unexpectedly rapid but there was no appearance that it would be followed by a second i was a thousand miles from taking tea with my hostesses that privilege of which as i reminded mrs prest we both had had a vision she reproached me with wanting boldness and i answered that even to be bold you must have an opportunity you may push on through a breach but you cant batter down a dead wall she answered that the breach i had already made was big enough to admit an army and accused me of wasting precious hours in whimpering in her salon when i ought to have been carrying on the struggle in the field it is true that i went to see her very often on the theory that it would console me i freely expressed my discouragement for my want of success on my own premises but i began to perceive that it did not console me to be perpetually chaffed for my scruples especially when i was really so vigilant and i was rather glad when my derisive friend closed her house for the summer she had expected to gather amusement from the drama of my intercourse with the misses bordereau and she was disappointed that the intercourse and consequently the drama had not come off theyll lead you on to your ruin she said before she left venice theyll get all your money without showing you a scrap i think i settled down to my business with more concentration after she had gone away it was a fact that up to that time i had not save on a single brief occasion had even a moments contact with my queer hostesses the exception had occurred when i carried them according to my promise the terrible three thousand francs then i found miss tita waiting for me in the hall and she took the money from my hand so that i did not see her aunt the old lady had promised to receive me but she apparently thought nothing of breaking that vow the money was contained in a bag of chamois leather of respectable dimensions which my banker had given me and miss tita had to make a big fist to receive it this she did with extreme solemnity though i tried to treat the affair a little as a joke it was in no jocular strain yet it was with simplicity that she inquired weighing the money in her two palms dont you think its too much to which i replied that that would depend upon the amount of pleasure i should get for it hereupon she turned away from me quickly as she had done the day before murmuring in a tone different from any she had used hitherto oh pleasure pleasure theres no pleasure in this house after this for a long time i never saw her and i wondered that the common chances of the day should not have helped us to meet it could only be evident that she was immensely on her guard against them and in addition to this the house was so big that for each other we were lost in it i used to look out for her hopefully as i crossed the sala in my comings and goings but i was not rewarded with a glimpse of the tail of her dress it was as if she never peeped out of her aunts apartment i used to wonder what she did there week after week and year after year i had never encountered such a violent parti pris of seclusion it was more than keeping quiet it was like hunted creatures feigning death the two ladies appeared to have no visitors whatever and no sort of contact with the world i judged at least that people could not have come to the house and that miss tita could not have gone out without my having some observation of it i did what i disliked myself for doing reflecting that it was only once in a way i questioned my servant about their habits and let him divine that i should be interested in any information he could pick up but he picked up amazingly little for a knowing venetian it must be added that where there is a perpetual fast there are very few crumbs on the floor his cleverness in other ways was sufficient if it was not quite all that i had attributed to him on the occasion of my first interview with miss tita he had helped my gondolier to bring me round a boatload of furniture and when these articles had been carried to the top of the palace and distributed according to our associated wisdom he organized my household with such promptitude as was consistent with the fact that it was composed exclusively of himself he made me in short as comfortable as i could be with my indifferent prospects i should have been glad if he had fallen in love with miss bordereaus maid or failing this had taken her in aversion either event might have brought about some kind of catastrophe and a catastrophe might have led to some parley it was my idea that she would have been sociable and i myself on various occasions saw her flit to and fro on domestic errands so that i was sure she was accessible but i tasted of no gossip from that fountain and i afterward learned that pasquales affections were fixed upon an object that made him heedless of other women this was a young lady with a powdered face a yellow cotton gown and much leisure who used often to come to see him she practiced at her convenience the art of a stringer of beads these ornaments are made in venice in profusion she had her pocket full of them and i used to find them on the floor of my apartment and kept an eye on the maiden in the house it was not for me of course to make the domestics tattle and i never said a word to miss bordereaus cook it seemed to me a proof of the old ladys determination to have nothing to do with me that she should never have sent me a receipt for my three months rent for some days i looked out for it and then when i had given it up i wasted a good deal of time in wondering what her reason had been for neglecting so indispensable and familiar a form at first i was tempted to send her a reminder after which i relinquished the idea against my judgment as to what was right in the particular case on the general ground of wishing to keep quiet if miss bordereau suspected me of ulterior aims she would suspect me less if i should be businesslike and yet i consented not to be so it was possible she intended her omission as an impertinence a visible irony to show how she could overreach people who attempted to overreach her on that hypothesis it was well to let her see that one did not notice her little tricks the real reading of the matter i afterward perceived was simply the poor old womans desire to emphasize the fact that i was in the enjoyment of a favor as rigidly limited as it had been liberally bestowed she had given me part of her house and now she would not give me even a morsel of paper with her name on it let me say that even at first this did not make me too miserable for the whole episode was essentially delightful to me i foresaw that i should have a summer after my own literary heart and the sense of holding my opportunity was much greater than the sense of losing it there could be no venetian business without patience and since i adored the place i was much more in the spirit of it for having laid in a large provision that spirit kept me perpetual company and seemed to look out at me from the revived immortal face in which all his genius shone of the great poet who was my prompter i had invoked him and he had come he hovered before me half the time it was as if his bright ghost had returned to earth to tell me that he regarded the affair as his own no less than mine and that we should see it fraternally cheerfully to a conclusion it was as if he had said poor dear be easy with her she has some natural prejudices only give her time strange as it may appear to you she was very attractive in meanwhile are we not in venice together and what better place is there for the meeting of dear friends see how it glows with the advancing summer how the sky and the sea and the rosy air and the marble of the palaces all shimmer and melt together my eccentric private errand became a part of the general romance and the general glory i felt even a mystic companionship a moral fraternity with all those who in the past had been in the service of art they had worked for beauty for a devotion and what else was i doing that element was in everything that jeffrey aspern had written and i was only bringing it to the light i lingered in the sala when i went to and fro i used to watch as long as i thought decent the door that led to miss bordereaus part of the house a person observing me might have supposed i was trying to cast a spell upon it or attempting some odd experiment in hypnotism but i was only praying it would open or thinking what treasure probably lurked behind it i hold it singular as i look back that i should never have doubted for a moment that the sacred relics were there never have failed to feel a certain joy at being under the same roof with them after all they were under my hand they had not escaped me yet and they made my life continuous in a fashion with the illustrious life they had touched at the other end i lost myself in this satisfaction to the point of assuming in my quiet extravagance that poor miss tita also went back went back as i used to phrase it she did indeed the gentle spinster but not quite so far as jeffrey aspern who was simply hearsay to her quite as he was to me only she had lived for years with juliana she had seen and handled the papers and even though she was stupid some esoteric knowledge had rubbed off on her that was what the old woman represented esoteric knowledge and this was the idea with which my editorial heart used to thrill it literally beat faster often of an evening when i had been out as i stopped with my candle in the reechoing hall on my way up to bed it was as if at such a moment as that in the stillness after the long contradiction of the day miss bordereaus secrets were in the air the wonder of her survival more palpable these were the acute impressions i had them in another form with more of a certain sort of reciprocity during the hours that i sat in the garden looking up over the top of my book at the closed windows of my hostess in these windows no sign of life ever appeared it was as if for fear of my catching a glimpse of them the two ladies passed their days in the dark but this only proved to me that they had something to conceal which was what i had wished to demonstrate their motionless shutters became as expressive as eyes consciously closed and i took comfort in thinking that at all events through invisible themselves they saw me between the lashes i made a point of spending as much time as possible in the garden to justify the picture i had originally given of my horticultural passion and i not only spent time but hang it as i said i spent money as soon as i had got my rooms arranged and could give the proper thought to the matter i surveyed the place with a clever expert and made terms for having it put in order i was sorry to do this for personally i liked it better as it was with its weeds and its wild rough tangle its sweet characteristic venetian shabbiness i had to be consistent to keep my promise that i would smother the house in flowers moreover i formed this graceful project that by flowers i would make my way i would succeed by big nosegays i would batter the old women with lilies i would bombard their citadel with roses their door would have to yield to the pressure when a mountain of carnations should be piled up against it the place in truth had been brutally neglected the venetian capacity for dawdling is of the largest and for a good many days unlimited litter was all my gardener had to show for his ministrations there was a great digging of holes and carting about of earth and after a while i grew so impatient that i had thoughts of sending for my bouquets to the nearest stand but i reflected that the ladies would see through the chinks of their shutters that they must have been bought and might make up their minds from this that i was a humbug so i composed myself and finally though the delay was long perceived some appearances of bloom this encouraged me and i waited serenely enough till they multiplied meanwhile the real summer days arrived and began to pass and as i look back upon them they seem to me almost the happiest of my life i took more and more care to be in the garden whenever it was not too hot i had an arbor arranged and a low table and an armchair put into it and i carried out books and portfolios i had always some business of writing in hand and worked and waited and mused and hoped while the golden hours elapsed and the plants drank in the light and the inscrutable old palace turned pale and then as the day waned began to flush in it and my papers rustled in the wandering breeze of the adriatic considering how little satisfaction i got from it at first it is remarkable that i should not have grown more tired of wondering what mystic rites of ennui the misses bordereau celebrated in their darkened rooms whether this had always been the tenor of their life and how in previous years they had escaped elbowing their neighbors it was clear that they must have had other habits and other circumstances that they must once have been young or at least middleaged there was no end to the questions it was possible to ask about them and no end to the answers it was not possible to frame i had known many of my countrypeople in europe and was familiar with the strange ways they were liable to take up there but the misses bordereau formed altogether a new type of the american absentee indeed it was plain that the american name had ceased to have any application to them i had seen this in the ten minutes i spent in the old womans room you could never have said whence they came from the appearance of either of them wherever it was they had long ago dropped the local accent and fashion there was nothing in them that one recognized and putting the question of speech aside they might have been norwegians or spaniards miss bordereau after all had been in europe nearly threequarters of a century it appeared by some verses addressed to her by aspern on the occasion of his own second absence from america verses of which cumnor and i had after infinite conjecture established solidly enough the date that she was even then as a girl of twenty on the foreign side of the sea there was an implication in the poem i hope not just for the phrase that he had come back for her sake we had no real light upon her circumstances at that moment any more than we had upon her origin which we believed to be of the sort usually spoken of as modest cumnor had a theory that she had been a governess in some family in which the poet visited and that in consequence of her position there was from the first something unavowed or rather something positively clandestine in their relations i on the other hand had hatched a little romance according to which she was the daughter of an artist a painter or a sculptor who had left the western world when the century was fresh to study in the ancient schools it was essential to my hypothesis that this amiable man should have lost his wife should have been poor and unsuccessful and should have had a second daughter of a disposition quite different from julianas it was also indispensable that he should have been accompanied to europe by these young ladies and should have established himself there for the remainder of a struggling saddened life there was a further implication that miss bordereau had had in her youth a perverse and adventurous albeit a generous and fascinating character and that she had passed through some singular vicissitudes by what passions had she been ravaged by what sufferings had she been blanched what store of memories had she laid away for the monotonous future i asked myself these things as i sat spinning theories about her in my arbor and the bees droned in the flowers it was incontestable that whether for right or for wrong most readers of certain of asperns poems poems not as ambiguous as the sonnets scarcely more divine i think of shakespeare had taken for granted that juliana had not always adhered to the steep footway of renunciation there hovered about her name a perfume of reckless passion an intimation that she had not been exactly as the respectable young person in general was this a sign that her singer had betrayed her had given her away as we say nowadays to posterity certain it is that it would have been difficult to put ones finger on the passage in which her fair fame suffered an imputation moreover was not any fame fair enough that was so sure of duration and was associated with works immortal through their beauty it was a part of my idea that the young lady had had a foreign lover and an unedifying tragical rupture before her meeting with jeffrey aspern she had lived with her father and sister in a queer oldfashioned expatriated artistic bohemia in the days when the aesthetic was only the academic and the painters who knew the best models for a contadina and pifferaro wore peaked hats and long hair it was a society less furnished than the coteries of today in its ignorance of the wonderful chances the opportunities of the early bird with which its path was strewn with tatters of old stuff and fragments of old crockery so that miss bordereau appeared not to have picked up or have inherited many objects of importance there was no enviable bricabrac with its provoking legend of cheapness in the room in which i had seen her such a fact as that suggested bareness but nonetheless it worked happily into the sentimental interest i had always taken in the early movements of my countrymen as visitors to europe when americans went abroad in there was something romantic almost heroic in it as compared with the perpetual ferryings of the present hour when photography and other conveniences have annihilated surprise miss bordereau sailed with her family on a tossing brig in the days of long voyages and sharp differences she had her emotions on the top of yellow diligences passed the night at inns where she dreamed of travelers tales and was struck on reaching the eternal city with the elegance of roman pearls and scarfs there was something touching to me in all that and my imagination frequently went back to the period if miss bordereau carried it there of course jeffrey aspern at other times had done so a great deal more it was a much more important fact if one were looking at his genius critically that he had lived in the days before the general transfusion it had happened to me to regret that he had known europe at all i should have liked to see what he would have written without that experience by which he had incontestably been enriched but as his fate had ordered otherwise i went with him i tried to judge how the old world would have struck him it was not only there however that i watched him the relations he had entertained with the new had even a livelier interest his own country after all had had most of his life and his muse as they said at that time was essentially american that was originally what i had loved him for that at a period when our native land was nude and crude and provincial when the famous atmosphere it is supposed to lack was not even missed when literature was lonely there and art and form almost impossible he had found means to live and write like one of the first to be free and general and not at all afraid to feel understand and express everything v i was seldom at home in the evening for when i attempted to occupy myself in my apartments the lamplight brought in a swarm of noxious insects and it was too hot for closed windows accordingly i spent the late hours either on the water the moonlight of venice is famous or in the splendid square which serves as a vast forecourt to the strange old basilica of saint mark i sat in front of florians cafe eating ices listening to music talking with acquaintances the traveler will remember how the immense cluster of tables and little chairs stretches like a promontory into the smooth lake of the piazza the whole place of a summers evening under the stars and with all the lamps all the voices and light footsteps on marble the only sounds of the arcades that enclose it is like an openair saloon dedicated to cooling drinks and to a still finer degustation that of the exquisite impressions received during the day when i did not prefer to keep mine to myself there was always a stray tourist disencumbered of his baedeker to discuss them with or some domesticated painter rejoicing in the return of the season of strong effects the wonderful church with its low domes and bristling embroideries the mystery of its mosaic and sculpture looking ghostly in the tempered gloom and the sea breeze passed between the twin columns of the piazzetta the lintels of a door no longer guarded as gently as if a rich curtain were swaying there i used sometimes on these occasions to think of the misses bordereau and of the pity of their being shut up in apartments which in the venetian july even venetian vastness did not prevent from being stuffy their life seemed miles away from the life of the piazza and no doubt it was really too late to make the austere juliana change her habits but poor miss tita would have enjoyed one of florians ices i was sure sometimes i even had thoughts of carrying one home to her fortunately my patience bore fruit and i was not obliged to do anything so ridiculous one evening about the middle of july i came in earlier than usual i forget what chance had led to this and instead of going up to my quarters made my way into the garden the temperature was very high it was such a night as one would gladly have spent in the open air and i was in no hurry to go to bed i had floated home in my gondola listening to the slow splash of the oar in the narrow dark canals and now the only thought that solicited me was the vague reflection that it would be pleasant to recline at ones length in the fragrant darkness on a garden bench the odor of the canal was doubtless at the bottom of that aspiration and the breath of the garden as i entered it gave consistency to my purpose it was delicious just such an air as must have trembled with romeos vows when he stood among the flowers and raised his arms to his mistresss balcony i looked at the windows of the palace to see if by chance the example of verona verona being not far off had been followed but everything was dim as usual and everything was still juliana on summer nights in her youth might have murmured down from open windows at jeffrey aspern but miss tita was not a poets mistress any more than i was a poet this however did not prevent my gratification from being great as i became aware on reaching the end of the garden that miss tita was seated in my little bower at first i only made out an indistinct figure not in the least counting on such an overture from one of my hostesses it even occurred to me that some sentimental maidservant had stolen in to keep a tryst with her sweetheart i was going to turn away not to frighten her when the figure rose to its height and i recognized miss bordereaus niece i must do myself the justice to say that i did not wish to frighten her either and much as i had longed for some such accident i should have been capable of retreating it was as if i had laid a trap for her by coming home earlier than usual and adding to that eccentricity by creeping into the garden as she rose she spoke to me and then i reflected that perhaps secure in my almost inveterate absence it was her nightly practice to take a lonely airing there was no trap in truth because i had had no suspicion at first i took for granted that the words she uttered expressed discomfiture at my arrival but as she repeated them i had not caught them clearly i had the surprise of hearing her say oh dear im so very glad youve come she and her aunt had in common the property of unexpected speeches she came out of the arbor almost as if she were going to throw herself into my arms i hasten to add that she did nothing of the kind she did not even shake hands with me it was a gratification to her to see me and presently she told me why because she was nervous when she was outofdoors at night alone the plants and bushes looked so strange in the dark and there were all sorts of queer sounds she could not tell what they were like the noises of animals she stood close to me looking about her with an air of greater security but without any demonstration of interest in me as an individual then i guessed that nocturnal prowlings were not in the least her habit and i was also reminded i had been struck with the circumstance in talking with her before i took possession that it was impossible to overestimate her simplicity you speak as if you were lost in the backwoods i said laughing how you manage to keep out of this charming place when you have only three steps to take to get into it is more than i have yet been able to discover you hide away mighty well so long as i am on the premises i know but i had a hope that you peeped out a little at other times you and your poor aunt are worse off than carmelite nuns in their cells should you mind telling me how you exist without air without exercise without any sort of human contact i dont see how you carry on the common business of life she looked at me as if i were talking some strange tongue and her answer was so little of an answer that i was considerably irritated we go to bed very early earlier than you would believe i was on the point of saying that this only deepened the mystery when she gave me some relief by adding before you came we were not so private but i never have been out at night never in these fragrant alleys blooming here under your nose ah said miss tita they were never nice till now there was an unmistakable reference in this and a flattering comparison so that it seemed to me i had gained a small advantage as it would help me to follow it up to establish a sort of grievance i asked her why since she thought my garden nice she had never thanked me in any way for the flowers i had been sending up in such quantities for the previous three weeks i had not been discouraged there had been as she would have observed a daily armful but i had been brought up in the common forms and a word of recognition now and then would have touched me in the right place why i didnt know they were for me they were for both of you why should i make a difference miss tita reflected as if she might by thinking of a reason for that but she failed to produce one instead of this she asked abruptly why in the world do you want to know us i ought after all to make a difference i replied that question is your aunts it isnt yours you wouldnt ask it if you hadnt been put up to it she didnt tell me to ask you miss tita replied without confusion she was the oddest mixture of the shrinking and the direct well she has often wondered about it herself and expressed her wonder to you she has insisted on it so that she has put the idea into your head that i am insufferably pushing upon my word i think i have been very discreet and how completely your aunt must have lost every tradition of sociability to see anything out of the way in the idea that respectable intelligent people living as we do under the same roof should occasionally exchange a remark what could be more natural we are of the same country and we have at least some of the same tastes since like you i am intensely fond of venice my interlocutress appeared incapable of grasping more than one clause in any proposition and she declared quickly eagerly as if she were answering my whole speech i am not in the least fond of venice i should like to go far away has she always kept you back so i went on to show her that i could be as irrelevant as herself she told me to come out tonight she has told me very often said miss tita it is i who wouldnt come i dont like to leave her is she too weak is she failing i demanded with more emotion i think than i intended to show i judged this by the way her eyes rested upon me in the darkness it embarrassed me a little and to turn the matter off i continued genially do let us sit down together comfortably somewhere and you will tell me all about her miss tita made no resistance to this we found a bench less secluded less confidential as it were than the one in the arbor and we were still sitting there when i heard midnight ring out from those clear bells of venice which vibrate with a solemnity of their own over the lagoon and hold the air so much more than the chimes of other places we were together more than an hour and our interview gave as it struck me a great lift to my undertaking miss tita accepted the situation without a protest she had avoided me for three months yet now she treated me almost as if these three months had made me an old friend if i had chosen i might have inferred from this that though she had avoided me she had given a good deal of consideration to doing so she paid no attention to the flight of time never worried at my keeping her so long away from her aunt she talked freely answering questions and asking them and not even taking advantage of certain longish pauses with which they inevitably alternated to say she thought she had better go in it was almost as if she were waiting for something something i might say to her and intended to give me my opportunity i was the more struck by this as she told me that her aunt had been less well for a good many days and in a way that was rather new she was weaker at moments it seemed as if she had no strength at all yet more than ever before she wished to be left alone that was why she had told her to come out not even to remain in her own room which was alongside she said her niece irritated her made her nervous she sat still for hours together as if she were asleep she had always done that musing and dozing but at such times formerly she gave at intervals some small sign of life of interest liking her companion to be near her with her work miss tita confided to me that at present her aunt was so motionless that she sometimes feared she was dead moreover she took hardly any food one couldnt see what she lived on the great thing was that she still on most days got up the serious job was to dress her to wheel her out of her bedroom she clung to as many of her old habits as possible and she had always little company as they had received for years made a point of sitting in the parlor i scarcely knew what to think of all this of miss titas sudden conversion to sociability and of the strange circumstance that the more the old lady appeared to decline toward her end the less she should desire to be looked after the story did not hang together and i even asked myself whether it were not a trap laid for me the result of a design to make me show my hand i could not have told why my companions as they could only by courtesy be called should have this purpose why they should try to trip up so lucrative a lodger at any rate i kept on my guard so that miss tita should not have occasion again to ask me if i had an arrierepensee poor woman before we parted for the night my mind was at rest as to her capacity for entertaining one she told me more about their affairs than i had hoped there was no need to be prying for it evidently drew her out simply to feel that i listened that i cared she ceased wondering why i cared and at last as she spoke of the brilliant life they had led years before she almost chattered it was miss tita who judged it brilliant she said that when they first came to live in venice years and years before i saw that her mind was essentially vague about dates and the order in which events had occurred there was scarcely a week that they had not some visitor or did not make some delightful passeggio in the city they had seen all the curiosities they had even been to the lido in a boat she spoke as if i might think there was a way on foot they had had a collation there brought in three baskets and spread out on the grass i asked her what people they had known and she said oh very nice ones the cavaliere bombicci and the contessa altemura with whom they had had a great friendship also english people the churtons and the goldies and mrs stockstock whom they had loved dearly she was dead and gone poor dear that was the case with most of their pleasant circle this expression was miss titas own though a few were left which was a wonder considering how they had neglected them she mentioned the names of two or three venetian old women of a certain doctor very clever who was so kind he came as a friend he had really given up practice of the avvocato pochintesta who wrote beautiful poems and had addressed one to her aunt these people came to see them without fail every year usually at the capo danno and of old her aunt used to make them some little present her aunt and she together small things that she miss tita made herself like paper lampshades or mats for the decanters of wine at dinner or those woolen things that in cold weather were worn on the wrists the last few years there had not been many presents she could not think what to make and her aunt had lost her interest and never suggested but the people came all the same if the venetians liked you once they liked you forever there was something affecting in the good faith of this sketch of former social glories the picnic at the lido had remained vivid through the ages and poor miss tita evidently was of the impression that she had had a brilliant youth she had in fact had a glimpse of the venetian world in its gossiping homekeeping parsimonious professional walks for i observed for the first time that she had acquired by contact something of the trick of the familiar softsounding almost infantile speech of the place i judged that she had imbibed this invertebrate dialect from the natural way the names of things and people mostly purely local rose to her lips if she knew little of what they represented she knew still less of anything else her aunt had drawn in her failing interest in the table mats and lampshades was a sign of that and she had not been able to mingle in society or to entertain it alone so that the matter of her reminiscences struck one as an old world altogether if she had not been so decent her references would have seemed to carry one back to the queer rococo venice of casanova i found myself falling into the error of thinking of her too as one of jeffrey asperns contemporaries this came from her having so little in common with my own it was possible i said to myself that she had not even heard of him it might very well be that juliana had not cared to lift even for her the veil that covered the temple of her youth in this case she perhaps would not know of the existence of the papers and i welcomed that presumption it made me feel more safe with her until i remembered that we had believed the letter of disavowal received by cumnor to be in the handwriting of the niece if it had been dictated to her she had of course to know what it was about yet after all the effect of it was to repudiate the idea of any connection with the poet i held it probable at all events that miss tita had not read a word of his poetry moreover if with her companion she had always escaped the interviewer there was little occasion for her having got it into her head that people were after the letters people had not been after them inasmuch as they had not heard of them and cumnors fruitless feeler would have been a solitary accident when midnight sounded miss tita got up but she stopped at the door of the house only after she had wandered two or three times with me round the garden when shall i see you again i asked before she went in to which she replied with promptness that she should like to come out the next night she added however that she should not come she was so far from doing everything she liked you might do a few things that i like i said with a sigh oh you i dont believe you she murmured at this looking at me with her simple solemnity why dont you believe me because i dont understand you that is just the sort of occasion to have faith i could not say more though i should have liked to as i saw that i only mystified her for i had no wish to have it on my conscience that i might pass for having made love to her nothing less should i have seemed to do had i continued to beg a lady to believe in me in an italian garden on a midsummer night there was some merit in my scruples for miss tita lingered and lingered i perceived that she felt that she should not really soon come down again and wished therefore to protract the present she insisted too on making the talk between us personal to ourselves and altogether her behavior was such as would have been possible only to a completely innocent woman i shall like the flowers better now that i know they are also meant for me how could you have doubted it if you will tell me the kind you like best i will send a double lot of them oh i like them all best then she went on familiarly shall you study shall you read and write when you go up to your rooms i dont do that at night at this season the lamplight brings in the animals you might have known that when you came i did know it and in winter do you work at night i read a good deal but i dont often write she listened as if these details had a rare interest and suddenly a temptation quite at variance with the prudence i had been teaching myself associated itself with her plain mild face ah yes she was safe and i could make her safer it seemed to me from one moment to another that i could not wait longer that i really must take a sounding so i went on in general before i go to sleep very often in bed its a bad habit but i confess to it i read some great poet in nine cases out of ten its a volume of jeffrey aspern i watched her well as i pronounced that name but i saw nothing wonderful why should i indeed was not jeffrey aspern the property of the human race oh we read him we have read him she quietly replied he is my poet of poets i know him almost by heart for an instant miss tita hesitated then her sociability was too much for her oh by heart thats nothing she murmured smiling my aunt used to know him to know him she paused an instant and i wondered what she was going to say to know him as a visitor as a visitor i repeated staring he used to call on her and take her out i continued to stare my dear lady he died a hundred years ago well she said mirthfully my aunt is a hundred and fifty mercy on us i exclaimed why didnt you tell me before i should like so to ask her about him she wouldnt care for that she wouldnt tell you miss tita replied i dont care what she cares for she must tell me its not a chance to be lost oh you should have come twenty years ago then she still talked about him and what did she say i asked eagerly i dont know that he liked her immensely and she didnt she like him she said he was a god miss tita gave me this information flatly without expression her tone might have made it a piece of trivial gossip but it stirred me deeply as she dropped the words into the summer night it seemed such a direct testimony fancy fancy i murmured and then tell me this please has she got a portrait of him they are distressingly rare a portrait i dont know said miss tita and now there was discomfiture in her face well good night she added and she turned into the house i accompanied her into the wide dusky stonepaved passage which on the ground floor corresponded with our grand sala it opened at one end into the garden at the other upon the canal and was lighted now only by the small lamp that was always left for me to take up as i went to bed an extinguished candle which miss tita apparently had brought down with her stood on the same table with it good night good night i replied keeping beside her as she went to get her light surely you would know shouldnt you if she had one if she had what the poor lady asked looking at me queerly over the flame of her candle a portrait of the god i dont know what i wouldnt give to see it i dont know what she has got she keeps her things locked up and miss tita went away toward the staircase with the sense evidently that she had said too much i let her go i wished not to frighten her and i contented myself with remarking that miss bordereau would not have locked up such a glorious possession as that a thing a person would be proud of and hang up in a prominent place on the parlor wall therefore of course she had not any portrait miss tita made no direct answer to this and candle in hand with her back to me ascended two or three stairs then she stopped short and turned round looking at me across the dusky space do you write do you write there was a shake in her voice she could scarcely bring out what she wanted to ask do i write oh dont speak of my writing on the same day with asperns do you write about him do you pry into his life ah thats your aunts question it cant be yours i said in a tone of slightly wounded sensibility all the more reason then that you should answer it do you please i thought i had allowed for the falsehoods i should have to tell but i found that in fact when it came to the point i had not besides now that i had an opening there was a kind of relief in being frank lastly it was perhaps fanciful even fatuous i guessed that miss tita personally would not in the last resort be less my friend so after a moments hesitation i answered yes i have written about him and i am looking for more material in heavens name have you got any santo dio she exclaimed without heeding my question and she hurried upstairs and out of sight i might count upon her in the last resort but for the present she was visibly alarmed the proof of it was that she began to hide again so that for a fortnight i never beheld her i found my patience ebbing and after four or five days of this i told the gardener to stop the flowers vi one afternoon as i came down from my quarters to go out i found miss tita in the sala it was our first encounter on that ground since i had come to the house she put on no air of being there by accident there was an ignorance of such arts in her angular diffident directness that i might be quite sure she was waiting for me she informed me of the fact and told me that miss bordereau wished to see me she would take me into the room at that moment if i had time if i had been late for a love tryst i would have stayed for this and i quickly signified that i should be delighted to wait upon the old lady she wants to talk with you to know you miss tita said smiling as if she herself appreciated that idea and she led me to the door of her aunts apartment i stopped her a moment before she had opened it looking at her with some curiosity i told her that this was a great satisfaction to me and a great honor but all the same i should like to ask what had made miss bordereau change so suddenly it was only the other day that she wouldnt suffer me near her miss tita was not embarrassed by my question she had as many little unexpected serenities as if she told fibs but the odd part of them was that they had on the contrary their source in her truthfulness oh my aunt changes she answered its so terribly dull i suppose shes tired but you told me that she wanted more and more to be alone poor miss tita colored as if she found me overinsistent well if you dont believe she wants to see you i havent invented it i think people often are capricious when they are very old thats perfectly true i only wanted to be clear as to whether you have repeated to her what i told you the other night what you told me about jeffrey aspern that i am looking for materials if i had told her do you think she would have sent for you thats exactly what i want to know if she wants to keep him to herself she might have sent for me to tell me so she wont speak of him said miss tita then as she opened the door she added in a lower tone i have told her nothing the old woman was sitting in the same place in which i had seen her last in the same position with the same mystifying bandage over her eyes her welcome was to turn her almost invisible face to me and show me that while she sat silent she saw me clearly i made no motion to shake hands with her i felt too well on this occasion that that was out of place forever it had been sufficiently enjoined upon me that she was too sacred for that sort of reciprocity too venerable to touch there was something so grim in her aspect it was partly the accident of her green shade as i stood there to be measured that i ceased on the spot to feel any doubt as to her knowing my secret though i did not in the least suspect that miss tita had not just spoken the truth she had not betrayed me but the old womans brooding instinct had served her she had turned me over and over in the long still hours and she had guessed the worst of it was that she looked terribly like an old woman who at a pinch would burn her papers miss tita pushed a chair forward saying to me this will be a good place for you to sit as i took possession of it i asked after miss bordereaus health expressed the hope that in spite of the very hot weather it was satisfactory she replied that it was good enough good enough that it was a great thing to be alive oh as to that it depends upon what you compare it with i exclaimed laughing i dont compare i dont compare if i did that i should have given everything up long ago i liked to think that this was a subtle allusion to the rapture she had known in the society of jeffrey aspern though it was true that such an allusion would have accorded ill with the wish i imputed to her to keep him buried in her soul what it accorded with was my constant conviction that no human being had ever had a more delightful social gift than his and what it seemed to convey was that nothing in the world was worth speaking of if one pretended to speak of that but one did not miss tita sat down beside her aunt looking as if she had reason to believe some very remarkable conversation would come off between us its about the beautiful flowers said the old lady you sent us so many i ought to have thanked you for them before but i dont write letters and i receive only at long intervals she had not thanked me while the flowers continued to come but she departed from her custom so far as to send for me as soon as she began to fear that they would not come any more i noted this i remembered what an acquisitive propensity she had shown when it was a question of extracting gold from me and i privately rejoiced at the happy thought i had had in suspending my tribute she had missed it and she was willing to make a concession to bring it back at the first sign of this concession i could only go to meet her i am afraid you have not had many of late but they shall begin again immediately tomorrow tonight oh do send us some tonight miss tita cried as if it were an immense circumstance what else should you do with them it isnt a manly taste to make a bower of your room the old woman remarked i dont make a bower of my room but i am exceedingly fond of growing flowers of watching their ways there is nothing unmanly in that it has been the amusement of philosophers of statesmen in retirement even i think of great captains i suppose you know you can sell them those you dont use miss bordereau went on i daresay they wouldnt give you much for them still you could make a bargain oh i have never made a bargain as you ought to know my gardener disposes of them and i ask no questions i would ask a few i can promise you said miss bordereau and it was the first time i had heard her laugh i could not get used to the idea that this vision of pecuniary profit was what drew out the divine juliana most come into the garden yourself and pick them come as often as you like come every day they are all for you i pursued addressing miss tita and carrying off this veracious statement by treating it as an innocent joke i cant imagine why she doesnt come down i added for miss bordereaus benefit you must make her come you must come up and fetch her said the old woman to my stupefaction that odd thing you have made in the corner would be a capital place for her to sit the allusion to my arbor was irreverent it confirmed the impression i had already received that there was a flicker of impertinence in miss bordereaus talk a strange mocking lambency which must have been a part of her adventurous youth and which had outlived passions and faculties nonetheless i asked wouldnt it be possible for you to come down there yourself wouldnt it do you good to sit there in the shade in the sweet air oh sir when i move out of this it wont be to sit in the air and im afraid that any that may be stirring around me wont be particularly sweet it will be a very dark shade indeed but that wont be just yet miss bordereau continued cannily as if to correct any hopes that this courageous allusion to the last receptacle of her mortality might lead me to entertain i have sat here many a day and i have had enough of arbors in my time but im not afraid to wait till im called miss tita had expected some interesting talk but perhaps she found it less genial on her aunts side considering that i had been sent for with a civil intention than she had hoped as if to give the conversation a turn that would put our companion in a light more favorable she said to me didnt i tell you the other night that she had sent me out you see that i can do what i like do you pity her do you teach her to pity herself miss bordereau demanded before i had time to answer this appeal she has a much easier life than i had when i was her age you must remember that it has been quite open to me to think you rather inhuman inhuman thats what the poets used to call the women a hundred years ago dont try that you wont do as well as they juliana declared there is no more poetry in the world that i know of at least but i wont bandy words with you she pursued and i well remember the oldfashioned artificial sound she gave to the speech you have made me talk talk it isnt good for me at all i got up at this and told her i would take no more of her time but she detained me to ask do you remember the day i saw you about the rooms that you offered us the use of your gondola and when i assented promptly struck again with her disposition to make a good thing of being there and wondering what she now had in her eye she broke out why dont you take that girl out in it and show her the place oh dear aunt what do you want to do with me cried the girl with a piteous quaver i know all about the place well then go with him as a cicerone said miss bordereau with an effort of something like cruelty in her implacable power of retort an incongruous suggestion that she was a sarcastic profane cynical old woman havent we heard that there have been all sorts of changes in all these years you ought to see them and at your age i dont mean because youre so young you ought to take the chances that come youre old enough my dear and this gentleman wont hurt you he will show you the famous sunsets if they still go on do they go on the sun set for me so long ago but thats not a reason besides i shall never miss you you think you are too important take her to the piazza it used to be very pretty miss bordereau continued addressing herself to me what have they done with the funny old church i hope it hasnt tumbled down let her look at the shops she may take some money she may buy what she likes poor miss tita had got up discountenanced and helpless and as we stood there before her aunt it would certainly have seemed to a spectator of the scene that the old woman was amusing herself at our expense miss tita protested in a confusion of exclamations and murmurs but i lost no time in saying that if she would do me the honor to accept the hospitality of my boat i would engage that she should not be bored or if she did not want so much of my company the boat itself with the gondolier was at her service he was a capital oar and she might have every confidence miss tita without definitely answering this speech looked away from me out of the window as if she were going to cry and i remarked that once we had miss bordereaus approval we could easily come to an understanding we would take an hour whichever she liked one of the very next days as i made my obeisance to the old lady i asked her if she would kindly permit me to see her again for a moment she said nothing then she inquired is it very necessary to your happiness it diverts me more than i can say you are wonderfully civil dont you know it almost kills me how can i believe that when i see you more animated more brilliant than when i came in that is very true aunt said miss tita i think it does you good isnt it touching the solicitude we each have that the other shall enjoy herself sneered miss bordereau if you think me brilliant today you dont know what you are talking about you have never seen an agreeable woman dont try to pay me a compliment i have been spoiled she went on my door is shut but you may sometimes knock with this she dismissed me and i left the room the latch closed behind me but miss tita contrary to my hope had remained within i passed slowly across the hall and before taking my way downstairs i waited a little my hope was answered after a minute miss tita followed me thats a delightful idea about the piazza i said when will you go tonight tomorrow she had been disconcerted as i have mentioned but i had already perceived and i was to observe again that when miss tita was embarrassed she did not as most women would have done turn away from you and try to escape but came closer as it were with a deprecating clinging appeal to be spared to be protected her attitude was perpetually a sort of prayer for assistance for explanation and yet no woman in the world could have been less of a comedian from the moment you were kind to her she depended on you absolutely her selfconsciousness dropped from her and she took the greatest intimacy the innocent intimacy which was the only thing she could conceive for granted she told me she did not know what had got into her aunt she had changed so quickly she had got some idea i replied that she must find out what the idea was and then let me know we would go and have an ice together at florians and she should tell me while we listened to the band oh it will take me a long time to find out she said rather ruefully and she could promise me this satisfaction neither for that night nor for the next i was patient now however for i felt that i had only to wait and in fact at the end of the week one lovely evening after dinner she stepped into my gondola to which in honor of the occasion i had attached a second oar we swept in the course of five minutes into the grand canal whereupon she uttered a murmur of ecstasy as fresh as if she had been a tourist just arrived she had forgotten how splendid the great waterway looked on a clear hot summer evening and how the sense of floating between marble palaces and reflected lights disposed the mind to sympathetic talk we floated long and far and though miss tita gave no highpitched voice to her satisfaction i felt that she surrendered herself she was more than pleased she was transported the whole thing was an immense liberation the gondola moved with slow strokes to give her time to enjoy it and she listened to the plash of the oars which grew louder and more musically liquid as we passed into narrow canals as if it were a revelation of venice when i asked her how long it was since she had been in a boat she answered oh i dont know a long time not since my aunt began to be ill this was not the only example she gave me of her extreme vagueness about the previous years and the line which marked off the period when miss bordereau flourished i was not at liberty to keep her out too long but we took a considerable girl before going to the piazza i asked her no questions keeping the conversation on purpose away from her domestic situation and the things i wanted to know i poured treasures of information about venice into her ears described florence and rome discoursed to her on the charms and advantages of travel she reclined receptive on the deep leather cushions turned her eyes conscientiously to everything i pointed out to her and never mentioned to me till sometime afterward that she might be supposed to know florence better than i as she had lived there for years with miss bordereau at last she asked with the shy impatience of a child are we not really going to the piazza thats what i want to see i immediately gave the order that we should go straight and then we sat silent with the expectation of arrival as some time still passed however she said suddenly of her own movement i have found out what is the matter with my aunt she is afraid you will go what has put that into her head she has had an idea you have not been happy that is why she is different now you mean she wants to make me happier well she wants you not to go she wants you to stay i suppose you mean on account of the rent i remarked candidly miss titas candor showed itself a match for my own yes you know so that i shall have more how much does she want you to have i asked laughing she ought to fix the sum so that i may stay till its made up oh that wouldnt please me said miss tita it would be unheard of your taking that trouble but suppose i should have my own reasons for staying in venice then it would be better for you to stay in some other house and what would your aunt say to that she wouldnt like it at all but i should think you would do well to give up your reasons and go away altogether dear miss tita i said its not so easy to give them up she made no immediate answer to this but after a moment she broke out i think i know what your reasons are i daresay because the other night i almost told you how i wish you would help me to make them good i cant do that without being false to my aunt what do you mean being false to her why she would never consent to what you want she has been asked she has been written to it made her fearfully angry then she has got papers of value i demanded quickly oh she has got everything sighed miss tita with a curious weariness a sudden lapse into gloom these words caused all my pulses to throb for i regarded them as precious evidence for some minutes i was too agitated to speak and in the interval the gondola approached the piazzetta after we had disembarked i asked my companion whether she would rather walk round the square or go and sit at the door of the cafe to which she replied that she would do whichever i liked best i must only remember again how little time she had i assured her there was plenty to do both and we made the circuit of the long arcades her spirits revived at the sight of the bright shop windows and she lingered and stopped admiring or disapproving of their contents asking me what i thought of things theorizing about prices my attention wandered from her her words of a while before oh she has got everything echoed so in my consciousness we sat down at last in the crowded circle at florians finding an unoccupied table among those that were ranged in the square it was a splendid night and all the world was outofdoors miss tita could not have wished the elements more auspicious for her return to society i saw that she enjoyed it even more than she told she was agitated with the multitude of her impressions she had forgotten what an attractive thing the world is and it was coming over her that somehow she had for the best years of her life been cheated of it this did not make her angry but as she looked all over the charming scene her face had in spite of its smile of appreciation the flush of a sort of wounded surprise she became silent as if she were thinking with a secret sadness of opportunities forever lost which ought to have been easy and this gave me a chance to say to her did you mean a while ago that your aunt has a plan of keeping me on by admitting me occasionally to her presence she thinks it will make a difference with you if you sometimes see her she wants you so much to stay that she is willing to make that concession and what good does she consider that i think it will do me to see her i dont know she thinks its interesting said miss tita simply you told her you found it so so i did but everyone doesnt think so no of course not or more people would try well if she is capable of making that reflection she is capable of making this further one i went on that i must have a particular reason for not doing as others do in spite of the interest she offers for not leaving her alone miss tita looked as if she failed to grasp this rather complicated proposition so i continued if you have not told her what i said to you the other night may she not at least have guessed it i dont know she is very suspicious but she has not been made so by indiscreet curiosity by persecution no no it isnt that said miss tita turning on me a somewhat troubled face i dont know how to say it its on account of something ages ago before i was born in her life something what sort of thing i asked as if i myself could have no idea oh she has never told me miss tita answered and i was sure she was speaking the truth her extreme limpidity was almost provoking and i felt for the moment that she would have been more satisfactory if she had been less ingenuous do you suppose its something to which jeffrey asperns letters and papers i mean the things in her possession have reference i daresay it is my companion exclaimed as if this were a very happy suggestion i have never looked at any of those things none of them then how do you know what they are i dont said miss tita placidly i have never had them in my hands but i have seen them when she has had them out does she have them out often not now but she used to she is very fond of them in spite of their being compromising compromising miss tita repeated as if she was ignorant of the meaning of the word i felt almost as one who corrupts the innocence of youth i mean their containing painful memories oh i dont think they are painful you mean you dont think they affect her reputation at this a singular look came into the face of miss bordereaus niece a kind of confession of helplessness an appeal to me to deal fairly generously with her i had brought her to the piazza placed her among charming influences paid her an attention she appreciated and now i seemed to let her perceive that all this had been a bribe a bribe to make her turn in some way against her aunt she was of a yielding nature and capable of doing almost anything to please a person who was kind to her but the greatest kindness of all would be not to presume too much on this it was strange enough as i afterward thought that she had not the least air of resenting my want of consideration for her aunts character which would have been in the worst possible taste if anything less vital from my point of view had been at stake i dont think she really measured it do you mean that she did something bad she asked in a moment heaven forbid i should say so and its none of my business besides if she did i added laughing it was in other ages in another world but why should she not destroy her papers oh she loves them too much even now when she may be near her end perhaps when shes sure of that she will well miss tita i said its just what i should like you to prevent how can i prevent it couldnt you get them away from her and give them to you this put the case very crudely though i am sure there was no irony in her intention oh i mean that you might let me seey should go out before the rest for they should not be sentenced according to the real intention with which they went out but according to the supposals of the accusers and of the judges but now a multitude of germans had surrounded the theater with their swords drawn all the spectators looked for nothing but death and at every one coming in a fear seized upon them as if they were to be cut in pieces immediately and in great distress they were as neither having courage enough to go out of the theater nor believing themselves safe from dangers if they tarried there and when the germans came upon them the cry was so great that the theater rang again with the entreaties of the spectators to the soldiers pleading that they were entirely ignorant of every thing that related to such seditious contrivances and that if there were any sedition raised they knew nothing of it they therefore begged that they would spare them and not punish those that had not the least hand in such bold crimes as belonged to other persons while they neglected to search after such as had really done whatsoever it be that hath been done thus did these people appeal to god and deplore their infelicity with shedding of tears and beating their faces and said every thing that the most imminent danger and the utmost concern for their lives could dictate to them this brake the fury of the soldiers and made them repent of what they minded to do to the spectators which would have been the greatest instance of cruelty and so it appeared to even these savages when they had once fixed the heads of those that were slain with asprenas upon the altar at which sight the spectators were sorely afflicted both upon the consideration of the dignity of the persons and out of a commiseration of their sufferings nay indeed they were almost in as great disorder at the prospect of the danger themselves were in seeing it was still uncertain whether they should entirely escape the like calamity whence it was that such as thoroughly and justly hated caius could yet no way enjoy the pleasure of his death because they were themselves in jeopardy of perishing together with him nor had they hitherto any firm assurance of surviving there was at this time one euaristus arruntius a public crier in the market and therefore of a strong and audible voice who vied in wealth with the richest of the romans and was able to do what he pleased in the city both then and afterward this man put himself into the most mournful habit he could although he had a greater hatred against caius than any one else his fear and his wise contrivance to gain his safety taught him so to do and prevailed over his present pleasure so he put on such a mournful dress as he would have done had he lost his dearest friends in the world this man came into the theater and informed them of the death of caius and by this means put an end to that state of ignorance the men had been in arruntius also went round about the pillars and called out to the germans as did the tribunes with him bidding them put up their swords and telling them that caius was dead and this proclamation it was plainly which saved those that were collected together in the theater and all the rest who any way met the germans for while they had hopes that caius had still any breath in him they abstained from no sort of mischief and such an abundant kindness they still had for caius that they would willingly have prevented the plot against him and procured his escape from so sad a misfortune at the expense of their own lives but they now left off the warm zeal they had to punish his enemies now they were fully satisfied that caius was dead because it was now in vain for them to show their zeal and kindness to him when he who should reward them was perished they were also afraid that they should be punished by the senate if they should go on in doing such injuries that is in case the authority of the supreme governor should revert to them and thus at length a stop was put though not without difficulty to that rage which possessed the germans on account of caiuss death but cherea was so much afraid for minucianus lest he should light upon the germans now they were in their fury that he went and spike to every one of the soldiers and prayed them to take care of his preservation and made himself great inquiry about him lest he should have been slain and for clement he let minucianus go when he was brought to him and with many other of the senators affirmed the action was right and commended the virtue of those that contrived it and had courage enough to execute it and said that tyrants do indeed please themselves and look big for a while upon having the power to act unjustly but do not however go happily out of the world because they are hated by the virtuous and that caius together with all his unhappiness was become a conspirator against himself before these other men who attacked him did so and by becoming intolerable in setting aside the wise provision the laws had made taught his dearest friends to treat him as an enemy insomuch that although in common discourse these conspirators were those that slew caius yet that in reality he lies now dead as perishing by his own self now by this time the people in the theatre were arisen from their seats and those that were within made a very great disturbance the cause of which was this that the spectators were too hasty in getting away there was also one aleyon a physician who hurried away as if to cure those that were wounded and under that pretense he sent those that were with him to fetch what things were necessary for the healing of those wounded persons but in reality to get them clear of the present dangers they were in now the senate during this interval had met and the people also assembled together in the accustomed form and were both employed in searching after the murderers of caius the people did it very zealously but the senate in appearance only for there was present valerius of asia one that had been consul this man went to the people as they were in disorder and very uneasy that they could not yet discover who they were that had murdered the emperor he was then earnestly asked by them all who it was that had done it he replied i wish i had been the man the consuls also published an edict wherein they accused caius and gave order to the people then got together and to the soldiers to go home and gave the people hopes of the abatement of the oppressions they lay under and promised the soldiers if they lay quiet as they used to do and would not go abroad to do mischief unjustly that they would bestow rewards upon them for there was reason to fear lest the city might suffer harm by their wild and ungovernable behavior if they should once betake themselves to spoil the citizens or plunder the temples and now the whole multitude of the senators were assembled together and especially those that had conspired to take away the life of caius who put on at this time an air of great assurance and appeared with great magnanimity as if the administration of the public affairs were already devolved upon them chapter how the senators determined to restore the democracy but the soldiers were for preserving the monarchy concerning the slaughter of caiuss wife and daughter a character of caiuss morals when the public affairs were in this posture claudius was on the sudden hurried away out of his house for the soldiers had a meeting together and when they had debated about what was to be done they saw that a democracy was incapable of managing such a vast weight of public affairs and that if it should be set up it would not be for their advantage and in case any one of those already in the government should obtain the supreme power it would in all respects be to their grief if they were not assisting to him in this advancement that it would therefore be right for them while the public affairs were unsettled to choose claudius emperor who was uncle to the deceased caius and of a superior dignity and worth to every one of those that were assembled together in the senate both on account of the virtues of his ancestors and of the learning he had acquired in his education and who if once settled in the empire would reward them according to their deserts and bestow largesses upon them these were their consultations and they executed the same immediately claudius was therefore seized upon suddenly by the soldiery but cneas sentins saturninns although he understood that claudius was seized and that he intended to claim the government unwillingly indeed in appearance but in reality by his own free consent stood up in the senate and without being dismayed made an exhortatory oration to them and such a one indeed as was fit for men of freedom and generosity and spake thus although it be a thing incredible o romans because of the great length of time that so unexpected an event hath happened yet are we now in possession of liberty how long indeed this will last is uncertain and lies at the disposal of the gods whose grant it is yet such it is as is sufficient to make us rejoice and be happy for the present although we may soon be deprived of it for one hour is sufficient to those that are exercised in virtue wherein we may live with a mind accountable only to ourselves in our own country now free and governed by such laws as this country once flourished under as for myself i cannot remember our former time of liberty as being born after it was gone but i am beyond measure filled with joy at the thoughts of our present freedom i also esteem those that were born and bred up in that our former liberty happy men and that those men are worthy of no less esteem than the gods themselves who have given us a taste of it in this age and i heartily wish that this quiet enjoyment of it which we have at present might continue to all ages however this single day may suffice for our youth as well as for us that are in years it will seem an age to our old men if they might die during its happy duration it may also be for the instruction of the younger sort what kind of virtue those men from whose loins we are derived were exercised in as for ourselves our business is during the space of time to live virtuously than which nothing can be more to our advantage which course of virtue it is alone that can preserve our liberty for as to our ancient state i have heard of it by the relations of others but as to our later state during my lifetime i have known it by experience and learned thereby what mischiefs tyrannies have brought upon this commonwealth discouraging all virtue and depriving persons of magnanimity of their liberty and proving the teachers of flattery and slavish fear because it leaves the public administration not to be governed by wise laws but by the humor of those that govern for since julius caesar took it into his head to dissolve our democracy and by overbearing the regular system of our laws to bring disorders into our administration and to get above right and justice and to be a slave to his own inclinations there is no kind of misery but what hath tended to the subversion of this city while all those that have succeeded him have striven one with another to overthrow the ancient laws of their country and have left it destitute of such citizens as were of generous principles because they thought it tended to their safety to have vicious men to converse withal and not only to break the spirits of those that were best esteemed for their virtue but to resolve upon their utter destruction of all which emperors who have been many in number and who laid upon us insufferable hardships during the times of their government this caius who hath been slain today hath brought more terrible calamities upon us than did all the rest not only by exercising his ungoverned rage upon his fellow citizens but also upon his kindred and friends and alike upon all others and by inflicting still greater miseries upon them as punishments which they never deserved he being equally furious against men and against the gods for tyrants are not content to gain their sweet pleasure and this by acting injuriously and in the vexation they bring both upon mens estates and their wives but they look upon that to be their principal advantage when they can utterly overthrow the entire families of their enemies while all lovers of liberty are the enemies of tyranny nor can those that patiently endure what miseries they bring on them gain their friendship for as they are conscious of the abundant mischiefs they have brought on these men and how magnanimously they have borne their hard fortunes they cannot but be sensible what evils they have done and thence only depend on security from what they are suspicious of if it may be in their power to take them quite out of the world since then we are now gotten clear of such great misfortunes and are only accountable to one another which form of government affords us the best assurance of our present concord and promises us the best security from evil designs and will be most for our own glory in settling the city in good order you ought every one of you in particular to make provision for his own and in general for the public utility or on the contrary they may declare their dissent to such things as have been proposed and this without any hazard of danger to come upon them because they have now no lord set over them who without fear of punishment could do mischief to the city and had an uncontrollable power to take off those that freely declared their opinions nor has any thing so much contributed to this increase of tyranny of late as sloth and a timorous forbearance of contradicting the emperors will while men had an overgreat inclination to the sweetness of peace and had learned to live like slaves and as many of us as either heard of intolerable calamities that happened at a distance from us or saw the miseries that were near us out of the dread of dying virtuously endured a death joined with the utmost infamy we ought then in the first place to decree the greatest honors we are able to those that have taken off the tyrant especially to cherea cassius for this one man with the assistance of the gods hath by his counsel and by his actions been the procurer of our liberty nor ought we to forget him now we have recovered our liberty who under the foregoing tyranny took counsel beforehand and beforehand hazarded himself for our liberties but ought to decree him proper honors and thereby freely declare that he from the beginning acted with our approbation and certainly it is a very excellent thing and what becomes freemen to requite their benefactors as this man hath been a benefactor to us all though not at all like cassius and brutus who slew caius julius caesar for those men laid the foundations of sedition and civil wars in our city but this man together with his slaughter of the tyrant hath set our city free from all those sad miseries which arose from the tyranny and this was the purport of sentiuss oration which was received with pleasure by the senators and by as many of the equestrian order as were present and now one trebellius maximus rose up hastily and took off sentiuss finger a ring which had a stone with the image of caius engraven upon it and which in his zeal in speaking and his earnestness in doing what he was about as it was supposed he had forgotten to take off himself this sculpture was broken immediately but as it was now far in the night cherea demanded of the consuls the watchword who gave him this word liberty these facts were the subjects of admiration to themselves and almost incredible for it was a hundred years since the democracy had been laid aside when this giving the watchword returned to the consuls for before the city was subject to tyrants they were the commanders of the soldiers but when cherea had received that watchword he delivered it to those who were on the senates side which were four regiments who esteemed the government without emperors to be preferable to tyranny so these went away with their tribunes the people also now departed very joyful full of hope and of courage as having recovered their former democracy and were no longer under an emperor and cherea was in very great esteem with them and now cherea was very uneasy that caiuss daughter and wife were still alive and that all his family did not perish with him since whosoever was left of them must be left for the ruin of the city and of the laws moreover in order to finish this matter with the utmost zeal and in order to satisfy his hatred of caius he sent julius lupus one of the tribunes to kill caiuss wife and daughter they proposed this office to lupus as to a kinsman of clement that he might be so far a partaker of this murder of the tyrant and might rejoice in the virtue of having assisted his fellow citizens and that he might appear to have been a partaker with those that were first in their designs against him yet did this action appear to some of the conspirators to be too cruel as to this using such severity to a woman because caius did more indulge his own illnature than use her advice in all that he did from which illnature it was that the city was in so desperate a condition with the miseries that were brought on it and the flower of the city was destroyed but others accused her of giving her consent to these things nay they ascribed all that caius had done to her as the cause of it and said she had given a potion to caius which had made him obnoxious to her and had tied him down to love her by such evil methods insomuch that she having rendered him distracted was become the author of all the mischiefs that had befallen the romans and that habitable world which was subject to them so that at length it was determined that she must die nor could those of the contrary opinion at all prevail to have her saved and lupus was sent accordingly nor was there any delay made in executing what he went about but he was subservient to those that sent him on the first opportunity as desirous to be no way blameable in what might be done for the advantage of the people so when he was come into the palace he found cesonia who was caiuss wife lying by her husbands dead body which also lay down on the ground and destitute of all such things as the law allows to the dead and all over herself besmeared with the blood of her husbands wounds and bewailing the great affliction she was under her daughter lying by her also and nothing else was heard in these her circumstances but her complaint of caius as if he had not regarded what she had often told him of beforehand which words of hers were taken in a different sense even at that time and are now esteemed equally ambiguous by those that hear of them and are still interpreted according to the different inclinations of people now some said that the words denoted that she had advised him to leave off his mad behavior and his barbarous cruelty to the citizens and to govern the public with moderation and virtue lest he should perish by the same way upon their using him as he had used them but some said that as certain words had passed concerning the conspirators she desired caius to make no delay but immediately to put them all to death and this whether they were guilty or not and that thereby he would be out of the fear of any danger and that this was what she reproached him for when she advised him so to do but he was too slow and tender in the matter and this was what cesonia said and what the opinions of men were about it but when she saw lupus approach she showed him caiuss dead body and persuaded him to come nearer with lamentation and tears and as she perceived that lupus was in disorder and approached her in order to execute some design disagreeable to himself she was well aware for what purpose he came and stretched out her naked throat and that very cheerfully to him bewailing her case like one that utterly despaired of her life and bidding him not to boggle at finishing the tragedy they had resolved upon relating to her so she boldly received her deaths wound at the hand of lupus as did the daughter after her so lupus made haste to inform cherea of what he had done this was the end of caius after he had reigned four years within four months he was even before he came to be emperor illnatured and one that had arrived at the utmost pitch of wickedness a slave to his pleasures and a lover of calumny greatly affected by every terrible accident and on that account of a very murderous disposition where he durst show it he enjoyed his exorbitant power to this only purpose to injure those who least deserved it with unreasonable insolene and got his wealth by murder and injustice he labored to appear above regarding either what was divine or agreeable to the laws but was a slave to the commendations of the populace and whatsoever the laws determined to be shameful and punished that he esteemed more honorable than what was virtuous he was unmindful of his friends how intimate soever and though they were persons of the highest character and if he was once angry at any of them he would inflict punishment upon them on the smallest occasions and esteemed every man that endeavored to lead a virtuous life his enemy and whatsoever he commanded he would not admit of any contradiction to his inclinations whence it was that he had criminal conversation with his own sister from which occasion chiefly it was also that a bitter hatred first sprang up against him among the citizens that sort of incest not having been known of a long time and so this provoked men to distrust him and to hate him that was guilty of it and for any great or royal work that he ever did which might be for the present and for future ages nobody can name any such but only the haven that he made about rhegium and sicily for the reception of the ships that brought corn from egypt which was indeed a work without dispute very great in itself and of very great advantage to the navigation yet was not this work brought to perfection by him but was the one half of it left imperfect by reason of his want of application to it the cause of which was this that he employed his studies about useless matters and that by spending his money upon such pleasures as concerned no ones benefit but his own he could not exert his liberality in things that were undeniably of great consequence otherwise he was an excellent orator and thoroughly acquainted with the greek tongue as well as with his own country or roman language he was also able offhand and readily to give answers to compositions made by others of considerable length and accuracy he was also more skillful in persuading others to very great things than any one else and this from a natural affability of temper which had been improved by much exercise and painstaking for as he was the grandson of the brother of tiberius whose successor he was this was a strong inducement to his acquiring of learning because tiberius aspired after the highest pitch of that sort of reputation and caius aspired after the like glory for eloquence being induced thereto by the letters of his kinsman and his emperor he was also among the first rank of his own citizens but the advantages he received from his learning did not countervail the mischief he brought upon himself in the exercise of his authority so difficult it is for those to obtain the virtue that is necessary for a wise man who have the absolute power to do what they please without control at the first he got himself such friends as were in all respects the most worthy and was greatly beloved by them while he imitated their zealous application to the learning and to the glorious actions of the best men but when he became insolent towards them they laid aside the kindness they had for him and began to hate him from which hatred came that plot which they raised against him and wherein he perished chapter how claudius was seized upon and brought out of his house and brought to the camp and how the senate sent an embassage to him now claudius as i said before went out of that way along which caius was gone and as the family was in a mighty disorder upon the sad accident of the murder of caius he was in great distress how to save himself and was found to have hidden himself in a certain narrow place though he had no other occasion for suspicion of any dangers besides the dignity of his birth for while he was a private man he behaved himself with moderation and was contented with his present fortune applying himself to learning and especially to that of the greeks and keeping himself entirely clear from every thing that might bring on any disturbance but as at this time the multitude were under a consternation and the whole palace was full of the soldiers madness and the very emperors guards seemed under the like fear and disorder with private persons the band called pretorian which was the purest part of the army was in consultation what was to be done at this juncture now all those that were at this consultation had little regard to the punishment caius had suffered because he justly deserved such his fortune but they were rather considering their own circumstances how they might take the best care of themselves especially while the germans were busy in punishing the murderers of caius which yet was rather done to gratify their own savage temper than for the good of the public all which things disturbed claudius who was afraid of his own safety and this particularly because he saw the heads of asprenas and his partners carried about his station had been on a certain elevated place whither a few steps led him and whither he had retired in the dark by himself but when gratus who was one of the soldiers that belonged to the palace saw him but did not well know by his countenance who he was because it was dark though he could well judge that it was a man who was privately there on some design he came nearer to him and when claudius desired that he would retire be discovered who he was and owned him to be claudius so he said to his followers this is a germanicus come on let us choose him for our emperor but when claudius saw they were making preparations for taking him away by force and was afraid they would kill him as they had killed caius he besought them to spare him putting them in mind how quietly he had demeaned himself and that he was unacquainted with what had been done hereupon gratus smiled upon him and took him by the right hand and said leave off sir these low thoughts of saving yourself while you ought to have greater thoughts even of obtaining the empire which the gods out of their concern for the habitable world by taking caius out of the way commit to thy virtuous conduct go to therefore and accept of the throne of thy ancestors so they took him up and carried him because he was not then able to go on foot such was his dread and his joy at what was told him now there was already gathered together about gratus a great number of the guards and when they saw claudius carried off they looked with a sad countenance as supposing that he was carried to execution for the mischiefs that had been lately done while yet they thought him a man who never meddled with public affairs all his life long and one that had met with no contemptible dangers under the reign of caius and some of them thought it reasonable that the consuls should take cognizance of these matters and as still more and more of the soldiery got together the crowd about him ran away and claudius could hardly go on his body was then so weak and those who carried his sedan upon an inquiry that was made about his being carried off ran away and saved themselves as despairing of their lords preservation but when they were come into the large court of the palace which as the report goes about it was inhabited first of all the parts of the city of rome and had just reached the public treasury many more soldiers came about him as glad to see claudiuss face and thought it exceeding right to make him emperor on account of their kindness for germanicus who was his brother and had left behind him a vast reputation among all that were acquainted with him they reflected also on the covetous temper of the leading men of the senate and what great errors they had been guilty of when the senate had the government formerly they also considered the impossibility of such an undertaking as also what dangers they should be in if the government should come to a single person and that such a one should possess it as they had no hand in advancing and not to claudius who would take it as their grant and as gained by their goodwill to him and would remember the favors they had done him and would make them a sufficient recompense for the same these were the discourses the soldiers had one with another by themselves and they communicated them to all such as came in to them now those that inquired about this matter willingly embraced the invitation that was made them to join with the rest so they carried claudius into the camp crowding about him as his guard and encompassing him about one chairman still succeeding another that their vehement endeavors might not be hindered but as to the populace and senators they disagreed in their opinions the latter were very desirous to recover their former dignity and were zealous to get clear of the slavery that had been brought on them by the injurious treatment of the tyrants which the present opportunity afforded them but for the people who were envious against them and knew that the emperors were capable of curbing their covetous temper and were a refuge from them they were very glad that claudius had been seized upon and brought to them and thought that if claudius were made emperor he would prevent a civil war such as there was in the days of pompey but when the senate knew that claudius was brought into the camp by the soldiers they sent to him those of their body which had the best character for their virtues that they might inform him that he ought to do nothing by violence in order to gain the government that he who was a single person one either already or hereafter to be a member of their body ought to yield to the senate which consisted of so great a number that he ought to let the law take place in the disposal of all that related to the public order and to remember how greatly the former tyrants had afflicted their city and what dangers both he and they had escaped under caius and that he ought not to hate the heavy burden of tyranny when the injury is done by others while he did himself willfully treat his country after a mad and insolent manner that if he would comply with them and demonstrate that his firm resolution was to live quietly and virtuously he would have the greatest honors decreed to him that a free people could bestow and by subjecting himself to the law would obtain this branch of commendation that he acted like a man of virtue both as a ruler and a subject but that if he would act foolishly and learn no wisdom by caiuss death they would not permit him to go on that a great part of the army was got together for them with plenty of weapons and a great number of slaves which they could make use of that good hope was a great matter in such cases as was also good fortune and that the gods would never assist any others but those that undertook to act with virtue and goodness who can be no other than such as fight for the liberty of their country now these ambassadors veranius and brocchus who were both of them tribunes of the people made this speech to claudius and falling down upon their knees they begged of him that he would not throw the city into wars and misfortunes but when they saw what a multitude of soldiers encompassed and guarded claudius and that the forces that were with the consuls were in comparison of them perfectly inconsiderable they added that if he did desire the government he should accept of it as given by the senate that he would prosper better and be happier if he came to it not by the injustice but by the goodwill of those that would bestow it upon him chapter what things king agrippa did for claudius and how claudius when he had taken the government commanded the murderers of caius to be slain now claudius though he was sensible after what an insolent manner the senate had sent to him yet did he according to their advice behave himself for the present with moderation but not so far that he could not recover himself out of his fright so he was encouraged to claim the government partly by the boldness of the soldiers and partly by the persuasion of king agrippa who exhorted him not to let such a dominion slip out of his hands when it came thus to him of its own accord now this agrippa with relation to caius did what became one that had been so much honored by him for he embraced caiuss body after he was dead and laid it upon a bed and covered it as well as he could and went out to the guards and told them that caius was still alive but he said that they should call for physicians since he was very ill of his wounds but when he had learned that claudius was carried away violently by the soldiers he rushed through the crowd to him and when he found that he was in disorder and ready to resign up the government to the senate he encouraged him and desired him to keep the government but when he had said this to claudius he retired home and upon the senates sending for him he anointed his head with ointment as if he had lately accompanied with his wife and had dismissed her and then came to them he also asked of the senators what claudius did who told him the present state of affairs and then asked his opinion about the settlement of the public he told them in words that he was ready to lose his life for the honor of the senate but desired them to consider what was for their advantage without any regard to what was most agreeable to them for that those who grasp at government will stand in need of weapons and soldiers to guard them unless they will set up without any preparation for it and so fall into danger and when the senate replied that they would bring in weapons in abundance and money and that as to an army a part of it was already collected together for them and they would raise a larger one by giving the slaves their libertyagrippa made answer o senators may you be able to compass what you have a mind to yet will i immediately tell you my thoughts because they tend to your preservation take notice then that the army which will fight for claudius hath been long exercised in warlike affairs but our army will be no better than a rude multitude of raw men and those such as have been unexpectedly made free from slavery and ungovernable we must then fight against those that are skillful in war with men who know not so much as how to draw their swords so that my opinion is that we should send some persons to claudius to persuade him to lay down the government and i am ready to be one of your ambassadors upon this speech of agrippa the senate complied with him and he was sent among others and privately informed claudius of the disorder the senate was in and gave him instructions to answer them in a somewhat commanding strain and as one invested with dignity and authority accordingly claudius said to the ambassadors that he did not wonder the senate had no mind to have an emperor over them because they had been harassed by the barbarity of those that had formerly been at the head of their affairs but that they should taste of an equitable government under him and moderate times while he should only he their ruler in name but the authority should be equally common to them all and since he had passed through many and various scenes of life before their eyes it would be good for them not to distrust him so the ambassadors upon their hearing this his answer were dismissed but claudius discoursed with the army which was there gathered together who took oaths that they would persist in their fidelity to him upon which he gave the guards every man five thousand drachmae apiece and a proportionable quantity to their captains and promised to give the same to the rest of the armies wheresoever they were and now the consuls called the senate together into the temple of jupiter the conqueror while it was still night but some of those senators concealed themselves in the city being uncertain what to do upon the hearing of this summons and some of them went out of the city to their own farms as foreseeing whither the public affairs were going and despairing of liberty nay these supposed it much better for them to be slaves without danger to themselves and to live a lazy and inactive life than by claiming the dignity of their forefathers to run the hazard of their own safety however a hundred and no more were gotten together and as they were in consultation about the present posture of affairs a sudden clamor was made by the soldiers that were on their side desiring that the senate would choose them an emperor and not bring the government into ruin by setting up a multitude of rulers so they fully declared themselves to be for the giving the government not to all but to one but they gave the senate leave to look out for a person worthy to be set over them insomuch that now the affairs of the senate were much worse than before because they had not only failed in the recovery of their liberty which they boasted themselves of but were in dread of claudius also yet were there those that hankered after the government both on account of the dignity of their families and that accruing to them by their marriages for marcus minucianus was illustrious both by his own nobility and by his having married julia the sister of caius who accordingly was very ready to claim the government although the consuls discouraged him and made one delay after another in proposing it that minucianus also who was one of caiuss murderers restrained valerius of asia from thinking of such things and a prodigious slaughter there had been if leave had been given to these men to set up for themselves and oppose claudius there were also a considerable number of gladiators besides and of those soldiers who kept watch by night in the city and rowers of ships who all ran into the camp insomuch that of those who put in for the government some left off their pretensions in order to spare the city and others out of fear for their own persons but as soon as ever it was day cherea and those that were with him came into the senate and attempted to make speeches to the soldiers however the multitude of those soldiers when they saw that they were making signals for silence with their hands and were ready to begin to speak to them grew tumultuous and would not let them speak at all because they were all zealous to be under a monarchy and they demanded of the senate one for their ruler as not enduring any longer delays but the senate hesitated about either their own governing or how they should themselves be governed while the soldiers would not admit them to govern and the murderers of caius would not permit the soldiers to dictate to them when they were in these circumstances cherea was not able to contain the anger he had and promised that if they desired an emperor he would give them one if any one would bring him the watchword from eutychus now this eutychus was charioteer of the greenband faction styled pra
