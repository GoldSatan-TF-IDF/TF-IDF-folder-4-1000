the matter carl asked the air hostess harald said shes sitting down talking to those two men carl looked up and saw the young air hostess she was sitting in a seat at the front of the plane with two young men they looked worried and nervous suddenly one of the young men picked up a bag and walked into the pilots cabin the other man and the air hostess followed him thats strange said carl what are they doing i dont know its very strange said harald i dont like it at all he began to get out of his seat but then stopped and sat down again for one or two minutes nothing happened none of the other passengers moved or spoke they had seen the young men too it became very quiet in the plane a bell rang and for a moment they could hear two voices arguing then the pilot spoke ladies and gentlemen this is the captain speaking please do not be afraid there is a change of plan we have to land at another airport before we finish our journey theres no danger we will land in fifteen minutes please stay in your seats and keep calm thank you then the air hostess came out of the cabin she looked very different now because she had a machine gun in her hand she stood at the front of the plane and watched the passengers carefully chapter three here we are madam the big black car stopped and a police officer opened the black door thank you helen sandberg smiled at him as she got out another police officer opened the front door of her house inside the house it was quiet her daughter was reading she put the book down hello mummy youre late you said youd be home by ten oclock i wanted to

a strong wind blowing twenty minutes later she was sitting in the back of her big black car drinking a cup of coffee and talking to the chief of airport police on the car telephone it was raining heavily chapter four carl looked out of the plane window it was very dark and rainy it was a small airport with only one or two other planes but there were three police cars near the airport building i dont understand said quietly in haralds ear why are we here harald looked worried dont ask me he whispered back ask them no thanks carl looked at the hijackers the young air hostess was still standing at the front of the plane with her machine gun one of the young men also with machine gun was standing at the back of the plane the other hijacker was in the captains cabin all the passengers sat very quietly in their seats a bell rang and mans voice spoke ladies and gentelmen listen to me this is the peoples liberation army this plane is ours now and are you our prisoners we do not want to hurt you but as you can see we have our guns and we know how to shoot so please sit quietly in yours seats and do what we say we will be here for one or two hours the government of this country has two of our brothers in a prison near this airport we are asking the government to bring our two brothers to this plane when our brothers are free you will be free we think this will take one of two hours but not very long as you know the prime minister of this country is only a woman she will do what we say so do not worry just sit very still and wait a little while goodnight carl looked at harald oh dear he whispered i think were in trouble my young friend big trouble harald agreed we certainly are the government wont set two men free they tried to put a bomb on a plane last year didnt they sir theyre in prison for thirty years i know carl whispered no one could set them free so what about us what about you you mean whispered harald im not important look sir youd better give your passport what why ssh harald put his hand on the older mans arm and stopped talking carl looked up and saw the young air hostess starting at them her machine gun was pointing at them too he stopped talking and looked out of the window after a few minutes she stopped watching them give me the passport sir harald whispered very quietly very slow and carefully carl took it our of this pocket and gave it to him there was still come coffee in carls cup very carefully harald put the passport on his tray and poured the coffee onto it when passport was very wet he tore it slowly into little pieces he was a strong young man and because the passport was wet it did not make a sound then one by one he out the pieces of wet paper into his mouth and ate them in ten minutes the passport had disappered i dont understand whispered carl why did you do that youll see whispered harald but when they ask questions let me answer sir ok you say nothing ok carl looked away out of the window a large black car was just driving up to airport building chapter five the black car stopped outside the airport building and a police officer opened the door helen sandberg got out and went quickly inside upstairs in the control room the chief of airport police inspector holm was waiting with a soldier helens secretary michael was there too good evening prime minister said inspector holm this is colonel carter of the special commando section good evening colonel helen shook hands with the soldier and looked at him he was a thin toughlooking man about forty years old with a brown face his hand was hard and strong i hope you know your job she thought i may need you she looked out of the window there was a large plane on the tarmac about two hundred meters away all its lights were on is that the plane she asked thats it prime minister right give me the facts how many people are on it inspector holm answered one hundred and eight passengers five crew what nationalities are they there are twentynine americans fifteen british two brazilian and one chinese the others are from this country i see there are a lot of americans and british then said helen quietly that means trouble yes prime minister answered michael im afraid their ambassadors are on their way here now helen smiled at him quickly he was a good secretary he usually knew what she was thinking both the american ambassador and the british ambassador were difficult people she turned back to inspector holm tell me about the hijackers what do they want we dont know how many hijackers there are prime minister but they have guns we know that they say they are from the peoples liberation army and they want three things inspector holm paused and looked down at her he was a very tall man and he looked very important in his uniform helen didnt like him much yes well what three things she asked quickly firstly they say we must set free their two brothers from prison you remember prime minister two men tried to put a bomb on a plane last year they are in prison near here i remember helen answered softly theyre in prison for thirty years arent they i think so something like that the man paused secondly they say we must refuel the plane because they want to fly to another country thirdly they say we must put this in all our newspapers it says they are fighting for freedom for their people they are freedom fighters they want to liberate their people he gave her a sheet of paper helen put in on the table she did not read it and what about the passengers she asked when will the hijackers set them free they say they will set most of the passengers free when their brothers to fly away with them they will set them free when they arrive i see theres one other thing prime minister colonel carter spoke for the first time his voice was very almost gentle they say we must bring the prisoners to the airport in two hours if not they will kill a passenger they said his one hour ago so we have one hour left thats right prime minister just one hour then they will kill the first passenger i see helen walked slowly to the window and stared out at the plane it was still raining and a strong wind was blowing she turned round thank you gentlemen i will have to talk to them but first i need a few minutes to room colonel carter inspector please go to the other room tell the hijackers i will talk to them in five minutes michael stay here but yes madam inspector holm looked unhappy but he went out slowly with the colonel michael sat quietly looking at her he knew what she was thinking have you got the passenger list michael yes prime minister here you are she picked up the list of names and looked at it carefully oh my god his name was near the beginning she dropped the list sat down at the table and ran her hands through the hair for a long minute she said nothing then she looked up this is going to be very difficult isnt it michael im afraid so prime minister very difficult indeed helen stood up and walked to the window thinking hard outside in the rain the american ambassadors car stopped by the door chapter six carl looked through the window and watched the cars arrive at the airport building there were a lot of cars now and a lot of lights in the building inside the plane it was hot and quiet there was nothing to do he remembered other times when he had been in a plane at night with wife and daughter that was been fun because they were excited and going on holiday his daughter had always asked lots questions in the plane now no one said anything at all carl sat and thought and felt his face becoming wet with sweat your passport please what he turned suddenly one of the hijackers a young man in a black shirt was just behind them he had a bag in his hand and he was taking everyones passports and putting them in it why be quiet harald whispered let me talk sir remember your passport please the young man stood by their seats here you are harald gave the man his passport thank you and his he has no passport i am a police officer and he is my prisoner i am taking him to prison in my country i see the young man looked at them both in surprise stand up you carl stood up and the young man searched his pockets but he found nothing he told carl to sit down then he opened haralds passport and looked inside police pig he said now you are our prisoner then he hit harald in the face looked at carl and laughed and perhaps we will set him free harald said nothing the hijacker was about the same age as him but not so big the young hijacker laughed again and moved on to the nest seat thank you harald carl whispered when the man was at the front of the plane that was very brave but i wont let you die for me you know be quiet sir carl whispered when the man was standing in the door of the captains cabin he was talking to the other two he was a strong man with a black beard he looked angry and waved his arms carl listened carefully he could hear one or two words but not many nothing nothing at all stupid woman she needs time she says all the hijackers were angry now they looked at the passport and then started to walk down the aisle pointing their guns at the passengers harald sat very still in his seat dont look at them carl he whispered sit very still and dont look at them suddenly the big hijacker pulled a passenger out of his seat the passenger was a short fat man in a grey suit he shouted angrily in a voice that sounded american but the hijacker hit him and then pushed him to the front of the plane with his machine gun turn towards the door he shouted put your hands on the door above your head higher thats it the air hostess pointed her gun at the americans back the hijacker in the black shirt stood at the front of the plane and pointed his gun at the passengers dont move he shouted stay in your seats and dont look back then the big bearded hijacker went back into the captains cabin the bell rang the hijackers voice spoke passengers listen to me you know we are here to set our brothers free i have spoken to the prime minister of this country i told her she must bring our brothers here by two oclock that is plenty of time because the prison is only ten kilometres from here she says she needs more time but we know she is lying we have no time the passenger at the front of the plane is an american spy who lives in our country all americans who live in our country are spies if our brothers are not at two oclock he will die if you try to help him you will die too jesus carl said quietly he looked at his watch the time was am he looked out of the window across the rainy tarmac to the airport building in one of those rooms was the prime minister what would she do what could she do come on honey he said softly start thinking think fast honey and think hard chapter seven helen sandberg sat at radio in the control room michael inspector holm and colonel carter sat behind her they could all see the plane two hundred meters away and they could all hear the voice of the hijacker on the radio it was loud excited our brothers have done nothing wrong they are innocent they are fighters for the freedom of our people we need them with us on this plane now helen kept her voice low and calm look i understand what you say but those men are criminals theyre in prison i cant bring them here and remember the passengers on the plane are innocent people too with families and children please set them free we will not hurt you we the voice on the radio interrupted her mrs sandberg i do not want to talk any more it is now am do you have our brothers here at the airport no i told you then watch the front door of the plane you can see it well i hope yes helens voice was quiet now almost a whisper then watch there is an american spy behind it and remember we have many american spies and many important business people on this plane in half an hour i will ask you again about my brothers helen stared out at the plane its front door was very small and far away colonel carter touched her arm here are some binoculars prime minister you will be able to see clearly with these she did not want to look but she had to she had decided not to free the prisoners so now she had to see what happened to the passengers she picked up the binoculars and stared at the front door of the plane the door opened slowly there were no steps outside the door so it was four meters above the ground standing in the door was a short fat man his hands above his head his face was white and he looked very frightened then he jumped but as he jumped a girl came to the door and shot him some bullets hit him in the air and more bullets hit him as he lay on the ground one of his arms moved a little and blood ran out of the side of his arms onto tarmac the girl continued shooting him for ten maybe fifteen seconds then someone pulled her back into the plane and door closed for a long time everyone was silent then colonel carter spoke inspector why didnt your men shoot that girl was in the doorway fir nearly fifteen seconds why isnt she dead we are police officers not soldiers i but the colonel interrupted him prime minister let my men deal with this problem they have killed a man now and theyll kill another one in half an hour we must attack that plane we are commandos we know how to do it helen was still watching the dead body of the man on the tarmac she thought a hand moved for a moment but no he must be dead by now there was a pool of blood on the tarmac now around his head he could not possibly be alive for a moment she did not hear the voices around her in half an hour prime minister yes she turned towards them yes colonel carter bring your men here immediately meet me in ten minutes with your plan but i warn you it must be a good one i dont want any more dead passengers yes prime minister at once the colonel turned to go inspector yes madam i want those two prisoners brought here from the prison at once you have twenty five minutes no more do you understand but prime minister you cant do that the inspector and the colonel stared at her in surprise i can and i will but these men are dangerous criminals terrorist they tried to put a bomb on a plane they are in prison for for thirty years colonel i know but they are only two men and there are over a hundred innocent people on that plane my job is to save their lives and i need time to do it the inspector stood up very tall and straight in his uniform prime minister i strongly advise you not to do this you dont understand helen interrupted him her voice icecold and angry i understand very well indeed inspector and i thank you for your advice but i think i must make the decisions and you must obey my oders you now have only twentyfour minutes bring those prisoners here please yes madam the inspector and the colonel left the room looking very unhappy prime minister yes michael she turned and saw that michael was smiling quietly the american and british ambassadors are here do you want to see them she groaned and sat down suddenly do i want to of course i dont but i must talk to them because that man was an american send them in they can have five minutes with me thats all yes prime minister michael picked up a telephone chapter eight when the girl came back into the cabin she was shaking her hands were shaking and she was crying and smoke was coming out of her gun one of the passengers an american stood up and shouted at her youre a murderer he shouted youre a dirty murdering b she turned and pointed the gun at him and fired the man sat down in his seat and the bullets went above the seats all along the plane and out through the roof after ten seconds the girl stopped firing and shouted youre shut up you shut up and sit down or ill kill you all i am a soldier of the peoples liberation army and ill kill you all of you but she was crying too and the young man in the black shirt put his arm around her and held her she leaned against him crying and he whispered something in her ear it was then that harald moved he got out of his seat bent low and ran very fast along the aisle towards the front of the plane the young man and the girl did not see him coming and he caught them both around their legs and knocked them onto the floor harald fell on top of them and he tried to take one of the guns but girl pulled his hair and the young man held his arms then the bearded man came out of the captains cabin and hit harald hard on the head with his gun harald fell on the floor and lay still the bearded man pointed his gun at the passengers and shouted sit still very loud indeed none of the passengers had moved except carl and he was too slow he stood very still in the middle of the aisle five metres away from the bearded mans gun the other two hijackers were still on the floor and carl saw the captain move in the cabin behind the bearded man but the young man i the black shirt saw him too and stood up and pointed his gun at the captain both carl and the captain were too late i am getting old carl thought when i was young i could move as fast as harald but not now carl sat down in his seat very slowly the bearded man watched him all the time he pushed harald with his foot search him he said to the girl then handcuff him to the door he will be the next one the girl pulled harald to the door she found some handcuffs in his pocket and handcuffed him to the door then she searched his other pockets in one of his pockets she found a newspaper she looked at it and saw the photo of harald and carl she stood up slowly and showed it to the bearded man he looked at the photo and then he looked at carl carefully and for a long time very slowly appeared on the faces of the two hijackers and they began to laugh chapter nine helen sandberg stood up to welcome the american and british ambassadors the two men were very different the american ambassador was a short round man with a loud voice which helen disliked very much he often wore opennecked shirts and he had a very hairy chest she disliked that too the british ambassador a tall thin scotsman from edinburgh was always quiet polite and welldressed but she did not always believe what he said once a year ago he had lied to her and she could never forget that but most of all she disliked them because they went were both military men and their countries were much bigger than hers they wanted military bases for their soldiers in her country and she did not want them so gentlemen what can i do for you the american spoke first well maam an american passenger is dead yes i know i am very sorry about that i hope no more will die i hope so too maam there are twentyeight us passengers on that plane and my government wants them all alive helen answered quietly but the ambassador did not listen so the us government is going to help you maam we have fifty us marines at the us embassy and they can be here in one hour from now then theyll just take that goddam plane apart the scotsman smiled excuse me ambassador but perhaps one hour from now will be too late one man is already dead but er perhaps you dont know this prime minister but this week six sas soldier are visiting the british embassy and theyre waiting outside in my car now these men know a lot about hijacks much more than the us marines or probably your own soldiers prime minister they know exactly what to do so now just a moment the american interrupted the us marines are gentlemen helens clear hard voice stopped them theres no time to argue firstly i didnt know about sas soldier in the british embassy and i am very surprised about it very surprise indeed ambassador secondly i do not think it is a good idea to attack a plane with a hundred and seven in it and take in apart as you say i want these people to live not die so i thank you for your ideas but remember that this small country is ours not yours we will manage this problem in our own way with our own people thank you very much now you must excuse me i am busy at the door the scotsman turned back prime minister i know you want to save lives he said i understand that but these hijackers must not go free my government does not want that no government in the world wants that i know that ambassador helen answered quietly i know that very well as they went out the phone rang michael picked it up helen sat down at the table and watched him his face was very serious he wrote on a piece of paper and then put the phone down for a moment he did not look at her what is it michael tell me it was a radio message from the plane prime minister well what did they say didnt they want to talk to me no prime minister just the message it says we love our brothers we hope the prime minister loves her husband he is on the plane just behind the door for a long moment she stared at michael but she did not speak a picture of the american passenger appeared in her head she saw him jumping out of the door and the girl shooting him shooting him for ten maybe fifteen seconds im sorry prime minister said michael softly what yes so am i i thought perhaps perhaps the hijackers didnt know carl was my husband but they do know she ran her hand trough her hair and then looked at her watch but her hand was shaking so much that she could not tell the time the phone rang again michael picked it up colonel carter is outside prime minister he watched her waiting for an answer ill tell him to wait shall i she put her hands flat on the table and stood up yes yes michael tell him to wait two minutes thats all she walked to the window and stared out at the plane she pressed her forehead against the cool glass and for two minutes she did not move then she turned round and smiled at michael lets just hope colonel carters plan is a good one shall we show him in chapter ten in the plane carl and harald sat on the floor by the door they were handcuffed together with haralds handcuffs the girl hijacker stood watching them with her gun the bearded man in the captains cabin and the young man in the black shirt was watching the other passengers harald touched his head with his hand there was blood in his hair how do you feel my young friend carl asked it hurts harald answered and i cant see well this man needs a doctor carl said to the girl angrily she laughed that is your wifes problem not mine she said if our brothers come he will get a doctor if they dont come he wont need one she pointed her gun at haralds head and laughed again she wasnt at all nervous now carl felt angry he was angry with the hijackers and he was angry with himself because he had not moved fast enough to help harald it was good to be angry when he was angry he did not feel so afraid how old are you he asked the girl i asked you a question he said how old are you eighteen nineteen youre not very old really are you youre just a child the girls face went red im twenty she said angrily im not a child you look like a child carl said youre only two years older than my daughter why are you doing this the girl laughed she didnt look at his eyes why you wouldnt understand i dont think you understand what youre doing carl said none of the people in this plane has hurt you we are all innocent that man you killed he wasnt a spy he was just an american businessman youve never seen any of us before why do you want to kill us the girl looked worried and angry she pointed the gun straight at carls head i dont want to kill you she said i want your government your wife to set our brothers free yes i know said carl carefully he watched the gun and the girls face but he was not really afraid because he was still angry he argued with the girl as trough he was arguing with his daughter but remember what your brothers did they tried to put a bomb on a plane they wanted to kill innocent people like us why you are not innocent said the girl no one is innocent people like you and your wife and that american you have money and power and you take it from my people from us do you know now i lived when i was a child ten people in one room with no bath no water nothing my parents had no jobs no passports no country nothing we lived i a town with ten thousand others but ten kilometres away there were rich people like you with big beautiful house fine cars fine clothes and they were all innocent people like you i tell you no one is innocent she was shouting now and nearly crying there were tears in her eyes carl and harald watched the gun carefully poor girl carl thought poor little murderess the bearded man came out of the captains cabin and put his hand on the girls arm stop it little flower he said dont talk to them thats not your job then he hit carl in the face keep your mouth shut he said think about your wife instead do you see the time i think she has forgotten you carl groaned and held his mouth with his hand there was blood in his mouth and one of his teeth was broken then he looked at his watch it was seven minutes left then the half hour was over im sorry my friend he whispered to harald you tried fighting and i tried talking but it didnt work i think this may be our last journey chapter eleven helen sandberg decided she liked colonel carter he spoke clearly he explained his ideas carefully and he listened to what she said he did not try to be difficult because she was a woman best of all they had made a plan together a good plan she thought it could really work perhaps she looked at her watch right colonel get your men ready ill send the first prisoner down to you when they arrive yet no prime minister not yet then where the hell are they can you get inspector holm on the car radio theyre trying prime minister michael spoke into the telephone colonel carter left the room and helen walked up and down slowly watching the clock theyve got him prime minister he says he says one of the cars has had an accident in the rain he thinks he can be here in ten minutes michael looked up there was no smile on his face at all now ten minutes whats he driving a police car or a bicycle helen banged her fist on the table were got four minutes left ok i want to talk to the hijackers get them on the radio she sat down at the table while michael called the plane colonel carter came in and stood behind her a voice came on the radio well mrs sandberg where are our brothers theyre coming said helen theyll be here in ten minutes that is too late i gave you half an hour your husband will die in four minutes helen pressed her hands flat on the table so hard that the ends of her fingers went white please dont to that she said i am sorry mrs sandberg but if my brothers are not here in four minutes your husband will die dont you want to see your brothers she asked quickly i promise you if you kill my husband youll never see them again there was a pause while no one spoke then the radio answered four minutes mrs sandberg helen spoke clearly slowly and loudly she filled her voice with all the anger she had in her body listen you murderer i need just ten minutes to get your brothers to this airport then i will send them to the plane but if you kill my husband or anyone else then i promise you that your brothers will die on the tarmac in front of that plane is that what you want or will you wait ten minutes there was another longer pause helen started out into the night she did not see anything all right ten more minutes thank you now there is one more thing the passengers what about them you must set them free before i send your brothers to the plane the voice on the radio laughed because you are a woman do you think all men are stupid like your husband send me our brothers then refuel the plane and then i will send you the passengers no answered helen she looked at colonel carter this is how we will do it i will send you one of our brothers and then you must send me the passengers when we have all the passengers then we will refuel the plane and send you your other brothers the voice laughed again do you think you are buying cheap fish from a child in the market send us one brother then and we will send you one hundred passengers refuel the plane and send us the other brother and we will send you the other passenger but the pilot and your husband must come with us to another country we will set them free later helen looked at colonel carter there was the beginning of a smile on her face she could see that he agreed with her she waited for a moment longer to worry the hijacker is it agreed woman or do i kill your husband now i agree i will send your first brother to you in ten minutes chapter twelve carl felt his broken tooth with his tongue the door of the captains cabin was open and he could see the bearded hijacker sitting inside he had a long nose and dark hair and his eyes looked green from the light of the instruments in the dark cabin he held his gun near his mouth and touched it gently with his lips as he waited carl had heard half of the conversation eight of the ten minutes had gone now that he could do nothing he felt afraid he could feel his hand in the handcuffs shaking harald felt it too and held carls hand with his own dont worry mr sandberg harald whispered well get out of here perhaps carl answered and perhaps not but i dont want these murderers to go free ssh harald whispered carl looked up and saw the girl watching them then suddenly the bearded man shouted theyre coming look get ready the girl went into the captains cabin harald and carl stood up and looked through a window they saw three men pushing some steps across the tarmac the men put the steps outside the plane door and then went back again then two more men came out of the building they were wearing bright yellow coats because of the rain one man walked towards the plane come away from the door quick the girl unlocked the handcuffs and pushed harald and carl back to their seats then she started to open the door wait turn the lights out and stand back from the door said the bearded man they will try to shoot us in the light room from the door the door opened and the man in the yellow coat came into the plane he was thin with very short hair the girl shut the door the lights came on and the man shut his eyes in the bright light the girl and the bearded man put their arms around him laughing free you are free now brother and the other one is he safe come into the cabin lets talk carl and harald watched sadly so now she will give them what they want because of me said carl quietly we will be safe but they will go free to bomb another plane because of me he held his head in his hands wait mr sandberg said harald your wife isnt stupid you know this game has not ended yet sit still and be ready the other passengers sat quietly waiting to be free chapter thirteen helen sandberg stood by the control room window staring at the plane come on she said why is that door shut where are the passengers the hijackers wont set them free said inspector holm i told you prime minister this is serious mistake be quiet man said colonel carter i think weve got something on the radio beside him a soldier was turning the controls of a small army radio suddenly the voice of one of the hijackers and the prisoner came into the room so how many soldiers are there in the airport building my brother i didnt see any soldiers only police thats strange no soldiers at all i did not see any brother very strange but these are not military people they do not have many soldiers perhaps the woman do what she says then what happening colonel helen asked those are the hijackers voices how can we hear them the colonel laughed well madam you can see its raining cant you we didnt want our poor prisoner to get wet so we gave him a nice yellow raincoat you see but it was an expensive raincoat because one of its buttons is a small transmitter so now we can hear everything they say and we know where are on the plane helen smiled good idea colonel i hope it helps prime minister michael interrupted theyre coming helen looked through the window the door of the plane was open and people were coming down the steps one after another some of them started to run towards the airport building and few knelt down on the wet tarmac what are they doing helen asked praying perhaps said michael to thank god that theyre alive police and doctors came out of the building to help the passengers helen stood and watched through binoculars she did not see carl ninetynine a hundred thats it then said colonel carter the plane door closed now we move on to the next step of our plan goodbye prime minister helen turned and saw that the colonel was putting

mans arm went up and he threw the grenade through the open door there was a very loud bang at the front of the plane and a flash of white light that burned carls eyes almost immediately there was an even louder bang bang and two more flashes of white light carl could not move the noise was so loud and the light so bright that he sat still as a stone he saw the girl hijacker and the bearded man

move the hijacker in the black shirt came out of the captains cabin behind the man in white came through the door and shot him too the two prisoners in their yellow raincoats tried to get the door but the men in white knocked them to the floor and handcuffed their behind their backs carl looked down the girl was lying on the floor of the aisle beside him he though he saw her hand move towards her machine gun but then one of the soldiers in white ran down the aisle and shot her again through the head another soldier pulled her away by her legs and her long hair left blood along the floor
