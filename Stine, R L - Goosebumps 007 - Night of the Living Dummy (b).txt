mmmmm mmmm mmmmm kris powell struggled to get her twin sisters attention lindy powell glanced up from the book she was reading to see what the problem was instead of her sisters pretty face lindy saw a round pink bubble nearly the size of kriss head nice one lindy said without much enthusiasm with a sudden move she poked the bubble and popped it hey kris cried as the pink bubble gum exploded onto her cheeks and chin lindy laughed gotcha kris angrily grabbed lindys paperback and slammed it shut whoops lost your place she exclaimed she knew her sister hated to lose her place in a book lindy grabbed the book back with a scowl kris struggled to pull the pink gum off her face that was the biggest bubble i ever blew she said angrily the gum wasnt coming off her chin ive blown much bigger than that lindy said with a superior sneer i dont believe you two their mother muttered making her way into their bedroom and dropping a neatly folded pile of laundry at the foot of kriss bed you even compete over bubble gum were not competing lindy muttered she tossed back her blonde ponytail and returned her eyes to her book both girls had straight blonde hair but lindy kept hers long usually tying it behind her head or on one side in a ponytail and kris had hers cut very short it was a way for people to tell the twins apart for they were nearly identical in every other way both had broad foreheads and round blue eyes both had dimples in their cheeks when they smiled both blushed easily large pink circles forming on their pale cheeks both thought their noses were a little too wide both wished they were a little taller lindys best friend alice was nearly three inches taller even though she hadnt turned twelve yet did i get it all off kris asked rubbing her chin which was red and sticky not all lindy told her glancing up theres some in your hair oh great kris muttered she grabbed at her hair but couldnt find any bubble gum gotcha again lindy said laughing youre too easy kris uttered an angry growl why are you always so mean to me me mean lindy looked up in wideeyed innocence im an angel ask anyone exasperated kris turned back to her mother who was stuffing socks into a dresser drawer mom when am i going to get my own room on the twelfth of never mrs powell replied grinning kris groaned thats what you always say her mother shrugged you know we dont have a spare inch kris she turned to the bedroom window bright sunlight streamed through the filmy curtains its a beautiful day what are you two doing inside mom were not little girls lindy said rolling her eyes were twelve were too old to go out and play did i get it all kris asked still scraping pink patches of bubble gum off her chin leave it it improves your complexion lindy told her i wish you girls would be nicer to each other mrs powell said with a sigh they suddenly heard shrill barking coming from downstairs whats barky excited about now mrs powell fretted the little black terrier was always barking about something why not take barky for a walk dont feel like it lindy muttered nose in her book what about those beautiful new bikes you got for your birthdays mrs powell said hands on hips those bikes you just couldnt live without you know the ones that have been sitting in the garage since you got them okay okay you dont have to be sarcastic mom lindy said closing her book she stood up stretched and tossed the book onto her bed you want to kris asked lindy want to what go for a bike ride we could ride to the playground see if anyones hanging out at school you just want to see if robby is there lindy said making a face so kris said blushing go on get some fresh air mrs powell urged ill see you later im off to the supermarket kris peered into the dresser mirror she had gotten most of the gum off she brushed her short hair back with both hands come on lets go out she said last one out is a rotten egg she darted to the doorway beating her sister by half a step as they burst out the back door with barky yipping shrilly behind them the afternoon sun was high in a cloudless sky the air was still and dry it felt more like summer than spring both girls were wearing shorts and sleeveless tshirts lindy bent to pull open the garage door then stopped the house next door caught her eye look theyve got the walls up she told kris pointing across their back yard that new house is going up so quickly its amazing kris said following her sisters gaze the builders had knocked down the old house during the winter the new concrete foundation had been put down in march lindy and kris had walked around on it when no workers were there trying to figure out where the different rooms would go and now the walls had been built the construction suddenly looked like a real house rising up in the midst of tall stacks of lumber a big mound of redbrown dirt a pile of concrete blocks and an assortment of power saws tools and machinery no ones working today lindy said they took a few steps toward the new house who do you think will move in kris wondered maybe some greatlooking guy our age maybe greatlooking twin guys yuck lindy made a disgusted face twin guys how drippy can you get i cant believe you and i are in the same family kris was used to lindys sarcasm both girls liked being twins and hated being twins at the same time because they shared nearly everything their looks their clothing their room they were closer than most sisters ever get but because they were so much alike they also managed to drive each other crazy a lot of the time no ones around lets check out the new house lindy said kris followed her across the yard a squirrel halfway up the wide trunk of a maple tree watched them warily they made their way through an opening in the low shrubs that divided the two yards then walking past the stacks of lumber and the tall mound of dirt they climbed the concrete stoop a sheet of heavy plastic had been nailed over the opening where the front door would go kris pulled one end of the plastic up and they slipped into the house it was dark and cool inside and had a fresh wood smell the plaster walls were up but hadnt been painted careful lindy warned nails she pointed to the large nails scattered over the floor if you step on one youll get lockjaw and die you wish kris said i dont want you to die lindy replied just get lockjaw she snickered haha kris said sarcastically this must be the living room she said making her way carefully across the front room to the fireplace against the back wall a cathedral ceiling lindy said staring up at the dark exposed wooden beams above their heads neat this is bigger than our living room kris remarked peering out the large picture window to the street it smells great lindy said taking a deep breath all the sawdust it smells so piney they made their way through the hall and explored the kitchen are those wires on kris asked pointing to a cluster of black electrical wires suspended from the ceiling beams why dont you touch one and find out lindy suggested you first kris shot back the kitchen isnt very big lindy said bending down to stare into the holes where the kitchen cabinets would go she stood up and was about to suggest they check out the upstairs when she heard a sound huh her eyes widened in surprise is someone in here kris froze in the middle of the kitchen they both listened silence then they heard soft rapid footsteps close by inside the house lets go lindy whispered kris was already ducking under the plastic heading out the doorway opening she leapt off the back stoop and started running toward their back yard lindy stopped at the bottom of the stoop and turned back to the new house hey look she called a squirrel came flying out a side window it landed on the dirt with all four feet moving and scrambled toward the maple tree in the powells yard lindy laughed just a dumb squirrel kris stopped near the low shrubs you sure she hesitated watching the windows of the new house that was a pretty loud squirrel when she turned back from the house she was surprised to find that lindy had disappeared hey whered you go over here lindy called i see something it took kris a while to locate her sister lindy was halfhidden behind a large black trash dumpster at the far end of the yard kris shielded her eyes with one hand to see better lindy was bent over the side of the dumpster she appeared to be rummaging through some trash whats in there kris called lindy was tossing things around and didnt seem to hear her what is it kris called taking a few reluctant steps toward the dumpster lindy didnt reply then slowly she pulled something out she started to hold it up its arms and legs dangled down limply kris could see a head with brown hair a head arms and legs oh no kris cried aloud raising her hands to her face in horror a child kris uttered a silent gasp staring in horror as lindy lifted him out of the trash dumpster she could see his face frozen in a wideeyed stare his brown hair stood stiffly on top of his head he seemed to be wearing some sort of gray suit his arms and legs dangled lifelessly lindy kris called her throat tight with fear is it is he alive her heart pounding kris started to run to her sister lindy was cradling the poor thing in her arms is he alive kris repeated breathlessly she stopped short when her sister started to laugh no not alive lindy called gleefully and then kris realized that it wasnt a child after all a dummy she shrieked lindy held it up a ventriloquists dummy she said someone threw him out do you believe it hes in perfect shape it took lindy a while to notice that kris was breathing hard her face bright red kris whats your problem oh wow did you think he was a real kid lindy laughed scornfully no of course not kris insisted lindy held the dummy up and examined his back looking for the string to pull to make his mouth move i am a real kid lindy made him say she was speaking in a highpitched voice through gritted teeth trying not to move her lips dumb kris said rolling her eyes i am not dumb youre dumb lindy made the dummy say in a high squeaky voice when she pulled the string in his back the wooden lips moved up and down clicking as they moved she moved her hand up his back and found the control to make his painted eyes shift from side to side hes probably filled with bugs kris said making a disgusted face throw him back lindy no way lindy insisted rubbing her hand tenderly over the dummys wooden hair im keeping him shes keeping me she made the dummy say kris stared suspiciously at the dummy his brown hair was painted on his head his blue eyes moved only from side to side and couldnt blink he had bright red painted lips curved up into an eerie smile the lower lip had a chip on one side so that it didnt quite match the upper lip the dummy wore a gray doublebreasted suit over a white shirt collar the collar wasnt attached to a shirt instead the dummys wooden chest was painted white big brown leather shoes were attached to the ends of his thin dangling legs my name is slappy lindy made the dummy say moving his grinning mouth up and down dumb kris repeated shaking her head why slappy come over here and ill slap you lindy made him say trying not to move her lips kris groaned are we going to ride our bikes to the playground or not lindy afraid poor robby misses you lindy made slappy ask put that ugly thing down kris replied impatiently im not ugly slappy said in lindys squeaky voice sliding his eyes from side to side youre ugly your lips are moving kris told lindy youre a lousy ventriloquist ill get better lindy insisted you mean youre really keeping it kris cried i like slappy hes cute lindy said cuddling the dummy against the front of her tshirt im cute she made him say and youre ugly shut up kris snapped to the dummy you shut up slappy replied in lindys tight highpitched voice what do you want to keep him for kris asked following her sister toward the street i always liked puppets lindy recalled remember those marionettes i used to have i played with them for hours at a time i made up long plays with them i always played with the marionettes too kris remembered you got the strings all tangled up lindy said frowning you werent any good at it but what are you going to do with this dummy kris demanded i dont know maybe ill work up an act lindy said thoughtfully shifting slappy to her other arm ill bet i could earn some money with him you know appear at kids birthday parties put on shows happy birthday she made slappy declare hand over some money kris didnt laugh the two girls walked along the street in front of their house lindy cradled slappy in her arms one hand up his back i think hes creepy kris said kicking a large pebble across the street you should put him back in the dumpster no way lindy insisted no way she made slappy say shaking his head his glassy blue eyes moving from side to side ill put you in the dumpster slappy sure is mean kris remarked frowning at lindy lindy laughed dont look at me she teased complain to slappy kris scowled youre jealous lindy said because i found him and you didnt kris started to protest but they both heard voices kris looked up to see the two marshall kids from down the block running toward them they were cute redheaded kids that lindy and kris sometimes babysat for whats that amy marshall asked pointing at slappy does he talk her younger brother ben asked staying several feet away an uncertain expression on his freckled face hi im slappy lindy made the dummy call out she cradled slappy in one arm making him sit up straight his arms dangling at his sides whered you get him amy asked do his eyes move ben asked still hanging back do your eyes move slappy asked ben both marshall kids laughed ben forgot his reluctance he stepped up and grabbed slappys hand ouch not so hard slappy cried ben dropped the hand with a gasp then he and amy collapsed in gleeful laughter hahahaha lindy made slappy laugh tilting his head back and opening his mouth wide the two kids thought that was a riot they laughed even harder pleased by the response she was getting lindy glanced at her sister kris was sitting on the curb cradling her head in her hands a dejected look on her face shes jealous lindy realized kris sees that the kids really like slappy and that im getting all the attention and shes totally jealous im definitely keeping slappy lindy told herself secretly pleased at her little triumph she stared into the dummys bright blue painted eyes to her surprise the dummy seemed to be staring back at her a twinkle of sunlight in his eyes his grin wide and knowing who was that on the phone mr powell asked shoveling another forkful of spaghetti into his mouth lindy slipped back into her place at the table it was mrs marshall down the block does she want you to babysit mrs powell asked reaching for the salad bowl she turned to kris dont you want any salad kris wiped spaghetti sauce off her chin with her napkin maybe later no lindy answered she wants me to perform at amys birthday party with slappy your first job mr powell said a smile crossing his slender face amy and ben liked slappy so much they insisted on him lindy said mrs marshall is going to pay me twenty dollars thats great their mother exclaimed she passed the salad bowl across the table to her husband it had been a week since lindy rescued slappy from the trash dumpster every day after school she had spent hours up in her room rehearsing with him working on his voice practicing not moving her lips thinking up jokes to perform with him kris kept insisting the whole thing was dumb i cant believe youre being such a nerd she told her sister she refused to be an audience for lindys routines but when lindy brought slappy into school on friday kriss attitude began to change a group of kids had gathered around lindy outside her locker as lindy made slappy talk for them kris watched from down the hall shes going to make a total fool of herself kris thought but to her surprise the kids hooted and howled they thought slappy was a riot even robby martin the guy kris had had a crush on for two years thought lindy was terrific watching robby laugh along with the other kids made kris think hard becoming a ventriloquist might be fun and profitable lindy was going to earn twenty dollars at the marshalls birthday party and when word got around shed probably perform at a lot of parties and earn even more money after dinner that evening lindy and kris washed and dried the dishes then lindy asked her parents if she could practice her new comedy routine on them she hurried up to her room to get slappy mr and mrs powell took a seat on the living room couch maybe lindy will be a tv star mrs powell said maybe mr powell agreed settling back on the couch a pleased smile on his face barky yapped and climbed between mr and mrs powell his tiny stub of a tail wagging furiously you know youre not allowed on the couch mrs powell said sighing but she made no move to push barky off kris sat down away from the others on the floor by the steps cradling her chin in her hands youre looking glum this evening her father remarked can i get a dummy too kris asked she hadnt really planned to say it the question just popped out of her mouth lindy came back into the room carrying slappy around the waist ready she asked she pulled a dining room chair into the center of the living room and sat down on it well can i kris repeated you really want one too mrs powell asked surprised want what lindy asked confused kris says she wants a dummy too mrs powell reported no way lindy said heatedly why do you want to be such a copycat it looks like fun kris replied her cheeks turning bright pink if you can do it i can do it too she added shrilly you always copy everything i do lindy protested angrily why dont you find something of your own for once go upstairs and work on your junk jewelry collection thats your hobby let me be the ventriloquist girls mr powell started raising a hand for quiet please dont fight over a dummy i really think id be better at it kris said i mean lindy isnt very funny everyone thinks im funny lindy insisted thats not very nice kris mrs powell scolded well i just think if lindy has one i should be able to have one too kris said to her parents copycat lindy repeated shaking her head youve been putting me down all week you said it was nerdy but i know why you changed your mind youre upset because im going to earn some money and youre not i really wish you two wouldnt argue about everything mr powell said disgustedly well can i have a dummy kris asked him theyre expensive mr powell replied glancing at his wife a good one will cost more than a hundred dollars i really dont think we can afford to buy one now why dont you both share slappy mrs powell suggested huh lindys mouth dropped open in protest you two always share everything mrs powell continued so why dont you share slappy but mom lindy whined unhappily excellent idea mr powell interrupted he motioned to kris try it out after you share him for a while im sure one of you will lose interest in him maybe even both of you kris climbed to her feet and walked over to lindy she reached out for the dummy i dont mind sharing she said quietly searching her sisters eyes for approval of the idea can i hold him for just a second lindy held onto slappy tightly suddenly the dummys head tilted back and his mouth opened wide beat it kris he snarled in a harsh raspy voice get lost you stupid moron before kris could back away slappys wooden hand shot up and he slapped her hard across the face ow kris screamed and raised her hand to her cheek which was bright pink she stepped back stop it lindy that hurt me lindy cried i didnt do it slappy did dont be dumb kris protested rubbing her cheek you really hurt me but i didnt do it lindy cried she turned slappys face toward her why were you so rude to kris mr powell jumped up from the couch stop acting dumb and apologize to your sister he ordered lindy bowed slappys head im sorry she made the dummy say no in your own voice mr powell insisted crossing his arms in front of his chest slappy didnt hurt kris you did okay okay lindy muttered blushing she avoided kriss angry stare im sorry here she dumped slappy into kriss arms kris was so surprised she nearly dropped the dummy slappy was heavier than shed imagined now what am i supposed to do with him kris asked lindy lindy shrugged and crossed the room to the couch where she dropped down beside her mother whyd you make such a fuss mrs powell whispered leaning close to lindy that was so babyish lindy blushed slappy is mine why cant something be mine for once sometimes you girls are so nice to each other and sometimes mrs powells voice trailed off mr powell took a seat on the padded arm of the chair across the room how do i make his mouth work kris asked tilting the dummy upside down to examine its back theres a string in his back inside the slit in his jacket lindy told her grudgingly you just pull it i dont want kris to work slappy lindy thought unhappily i dont want to share slappy why cant i have something that just belongs to me why do i have to share everything with her why does kris always want to copy me she gritted her teeth and waited for her anger to fade later that night kris sat straight up in bed shed had a bad dream i was being chased she remembered her heart still pounding chased by what by whom she couldnt remember she glanced around the shadowy room waiting for her heartbeat to return to normal the room felt hot and stuffy even though the window was open and the curtains were fluttering lindy lay sound asleep on her side in the twin bed next to kriss she was snoring softly her lips slightly parted her long hair falling loose about her face kris glanced at the clockradio on the bed table between the two twin beds it was nearly three in the morning even though she was now wide awake the nightmare wouldnt completely fade away she still felt uncomfortable a little frightened as if she were still being chased by someone or something the back of her neck felt hot and prickly she turned and fluffed up her pillow propping it higher on the headboard as she lay back on it something caught her eye someone sitting in the chair in front of the bedroom window someone staring at her after a sharp intake of breath she realized it was slappy yellow moonlight poured over him making his staring eyes glow he was sitting up in the chair tilted to the right at a slight angle one arm resting on the slender arm of the chair his mouth locked in a wide mocking grin his eyes seemed to be staring right at kris kris stared back studying the dummys expression in the eerie yellow moonlight then without thinking without even realizing what she was doing she climbed silently out of bed her foot got tangled in the bedsheet and she nearly tripped kicking the sheet away she made her way quickly across the room to the window slappy stared up at her as her shadow fell over him his grin seemed to grow wider as kris leaned closer a gust of wind made the soft curtains flutter against her face kris pushed them away and peered down at the dummys painted head she reached a hand out and rubbed his wooden hair shining in the moonlight his head felt warm warmer than shed imagined kris quickly jerked her hand away what was that sound had slappy snickered had he laughed at her no of course not kris realized she was breathing hard why am i so freaked out by this stupid dummy she thought in the bed behind her lindy made a gurgling sound and rolled onto her back kris stared hard into slappys big eyes gleaming in the light from the window she waited for him to blink or to roll his eyes from side to side she suddenly felt foolish hes just a stupid wooden dummy she told herself she reached out and pushed him over the stiff body swung to the side the hard head made a soft clonk as it hit the wooden arm of the chair kris stared down at him feeling strangely satisfied as if shed somehow taught him a lesson the curtains rustled against her face again she pushed them away feeling sleepy she started back to bed she had only gone one step when slappy reached up and grabbed her wrist oh as the hand tightened around her wrist kris cried out and spun around to her surprise lindy was crouched beside her lindy had a tight grip on kriss wrist kris jerked her hand from lindys grasp moonlight through the window lit up lindys devilish grin gotcha again she declared you didnt scare me kris insisted but her voice came out a trembling whisper you jumped a mile lindy exclaimed gleefully you really thought the dummy grabbed you did not kris replied she hurried to her bed what were you doing up anyway lindy demanded were you messing with slappy no i uh had a bad dream kris told her i just went to look out the window lindy snickered you shouldve seen the look on your face im going back to sleep leave me alone kris snapped she pulled the covers up to her chin lindy pushed the dummy back to a sitting position then she returned to her bed still chuckling over the scare shed given her sister kris rearranged her pillows then glanced across the room to the window the dummys face was half covered in shadow now but the eyes glowed as if he were alive and they stared into hers as if they were trying to tell her something why does he have to grin like that kris asked herself trying to rub away the prickly feeling on the back of her neck she pulled up the sheet settled into the bed and turned on her side away from the wide staring eyes but even with her back turned she could feel them gazing at her even with her eyes closed and the covers pulled up to her head she could picture the shadowy distorted grin the unblinking eyes staring at her staring staring she drifted into an uncomfortable sleep drifted into another dark nightmare someone was chasing her someone very evil was chasing her but who on monday afternoon lindy and kris both stayed after school to rehearse for the spring concert it was nearly five when they arrived home and they were surprised to see their dads car in the driveway youre home so early kris exclaimed finding him in the kitchen helping their mother prepare dinner im leaving tomorrow for a sales conference in portland mr powell explained peeling an onion over the sink with a small paring knife so i only worked half a day today whats for dinner lindy asked meat loaf mrs powell replied if your father ever gets the onion peeled theres a trick to not crying when you peel an onion mr powell said tears rolling down his cheeks wish i knew it how was chorus rehearsal mrs powell asked kneading a big ball of red ground beef in her hands boring lindy complained opening the refrigerator and taking out a can of coke yeah were doing all these russian and yugoslavian songs kris said theyre so sad theyre all about sheep or something we dont really know what theyre about theres no translation mr powell rushed to the sink and began splashing cold water on his red runny eyes i cant take this he wailed he tossed the halfpeeled onion back to his wife crybaby she muttered shaking her head kris headed up the stairs to drop her backpack in her room she tossed it onto the desk she shared with lindy then turned to go back downstairs but something by the window caught her eye spinning around she gasped oh no the startled cry escaped her lips kris raised her hands to her cheeks and stared in disbelief slappy was propped up in the chair in front of the window grinning at her with his usual wideeyed stare and seated beside him was another dummy also grinning at her and they were holding hands whats going on here kris cried aloud do you like him at first kris thought that slappy had asked the question she gaped in stunned disbelief well what do you think of him it took kris a long moment to realize that the voice was coming from behind her she turned to find her father standing in the doorway still dabbing at his eyes with a wet dishtowel the the new dummy kris stammered hes for you mr powell said stepping into the room the wet towel pressed against both eyes really kris hurried over to the chair and picked the new dummy up to examine him theres a tiny pawnshop on the corner across from my office mr powell said lowering the towel i was walking past and believe it or not this guy was in the window he was cheap too i think the pawnbroker was glad to get rid of him hes cute kris said searching for the right word he looks just like lindys dummy except his hair is bright red not brown probably made by the same company mr powell said his clothes are better than slappys kris said holding the dummy out at arms length to get a good view i hate that stupid gray suit on lindys dummy the new dummy wore blue denim jeans and a redandgreen flannel shirt and instead of the formallooking shiny brown shoes he had white hightop sneakers on his feet so you like him mr powell asked smiling i love him kris cried happily she crossed the room and gave her dad a hug then she picked up the dummy and ran out of the room down the stairs and into the kitchen hey everybody meet mr wood she declared happily holding the grinning dummy up in front of her barky yapped excitedly leaping up to nip at the dummys sneakers kris pulled her dummy away hey lindy cried in surprise whered you get that from daddy kris said her grin wider than the dummys im going to start practicing with him after dinner and im going to be a better ventriloquist than you kris mrs powell scolded everything isnt a competition you know i already have a job with slappy lindy said with a superior sneer and youre just getting started youre just a beginner mr wood is much betterlooking than slappy kris said mirroring her twins sneer mr wood is coollooking that gray suit on your dummy is the pits you think that ratty old shirt is coollooking lindy scoffed making a disgusted face yuck that old dummy probably has worms you have worms kris exclaimed your dummy wont be funny lindy said nastily because you dont have a sense of humor oh yeah kris replied tossing mr wood over her shoulder i must have a sense of humor i put up with you dont i copycat copycat lindy cried angrily out of the kitchen mrs powell ordered with an impatient shriek out get out you two are impossible the dummies have better personalities than either of you thanks mom kris said sarcastically call me for dinner lindy called back im going upstairs to practice my act with slappy for the birthday party on saturday it was the next afternoon and kris was sitting at the dressing table she shared with lindy kris rummaged in the jewelry box and pulled out another string of brightly colored beads she slipped them over her head and untangled them from the other three strands of beads she was wearing then she gazed at herself in the mirror shaking her head to better see the long dangly earrings i love my junk jewelry collection she thought digging into the depths of the wooden jewelry box to see what other treasures she could pull out lindy had no interest in the stuff but kris could spend hours trying on the beads fingering the dozens of little charms running her fingers over the plastic bracelets jangling the earrings her jewelry collection always cheered her up she shook her head again making the long earrings jangle a knock on the bedroom door made her spin around hey kris hows it going her friend cody matthews stepped into the room he had straight whiteblond hair and pale gray eyes in a slender serious face cody always looked as if he were deep in thought you ride your bike over kris asked removing several strands of beads at once and tossing them into the jewelry box no walked cody replied whyd you call you just want to hang out no kris jumped to her feet she walked over to the chair by the window and grabbed up mr wood i want to practice my act cody groaned im the guinea pig no the audience come on she led him out to the bent old maple tree in the middle of her back yard the afternoon sun was just beginning to lower itself in the clear springblue sky she raised one foot against the tree trunk and propped mr wood on her knee cody sprawled on his back in the shade tell me if this is funny she instructed okay shoot cody replied narrowing his eyes in concentration kris turned mr wood to face her how are you today she asked him pretty good knock wood she made the dummy say she waited for cody to laugh but he didnt was that funny she asked kinda he replied without enthusiasm keep going okay kris lowered her head so that she was facetoface with her dummy mr wood she said why were you standing in front of the mirror with your eyes closed well answered the dummy in a highpitched squeaky voice i wanted to see what i look like when im asleep kris tilted the dummys head back and made him look as if he were laughing how about that joke she asked cody cody shrugged better i guess aw youre no help kris screamed angrily she lowered her arms and mr wood crumpled onto her lap youre supposed to tell me if its funny or not i guess not cody said thoughtfully kris groaned i need some good joke books she said thats all some good joke books with some really funny jokes then id be ready to perform because im a pretty good ventriloquist right i guess cody replied pulling up a handful of grass and letting the moist green blades sift through his fingers well i dont move my lips very much do i kris demanded not too much cody allowed but you dont really throw your voice no one can throw her voice kris told him its just an illusion you make people think youre throwing your voice you dont really throw it oh cody said pulling up another handful of grass kris tried out several more jokes what do you think she asked cody i think i have to go home cody said he tossed a handful of grass at her kris brushed the green blades off mr woods wooden head she rubbed her hand gently over the dummys painted red hair youre hurting mr woods feelings she told cody cody climbed to his feet why do you want to mess with that thing anyway he asked pushing his whiteblond hair back off his forehead because its fun kris replied is that the real reason cody demanded well i guess i want to show lindy that im better at it than she is you two are weird cody declared see you in school he gave her a little wave then turned and headed for his home down the block kris pulled down the blankets and climbed into bed pale moonlight filtered in through the bedroom window yawning she glanced at the clockradio nearly ten she could hear lindy brushing her teeth in the bathroom across the hall why does lindy always hum when she brushes her teeth kris wondered how can one twin sister do so many annoying things she gave mr wood one last glance he was propped in the chair in front of the window his hands carefully placed in his lap his white sneakers hanging over the chair edge he looks like a real person kris thought sleepily tomorrow im going to check out some good joke books from the library at school i can be funnier than lindy i know i can she settled back sleepily on her pillow ill be asleep as soon as we turn off the lights she thought a few seconds later lindy entered the room wearing her nightshirt and carrying slappy under one arm you asleep she asked kris almost kris replied yawning loudly ive been studying for the math final all night whereve you been over at alices lindy told her setting slappy down in the chair beside mr wood some kids were over and i practiced my act for them they laughed so hard i thought theyd split a gut when slappy and i did our rap routine alice spit her chocolate milk out her nose what a riot thats nice kris said without enthusiasm guess you and slappy are ready for amys birthday party on saturday yeah lindy replied she placed slappys arm around mr woods shoulder they look so cute together she said then she noticed the clothing neatly draped over the desk chair whats that she asked kris kris raised her head from the pillow to see what her sister was pointing at my outfit for tomorrow she told her were having a dressup party in miss finchs class its a farewell party for margot you know the student teacher lindy stared at the clothes your betsey johnson skirt your silk blouse were supposed to get really dressed up kris said yawning can we go to sleep now yeah sure lindy made her way to her bed sat down and clicked off the bedtable lamp are you getting any better with mr wood she asked climbing between the sheets kris was stung by the question it was such an obvious putdown yeah im getting really good i did some stuff for cody out in the back yard cody laughed so hard he couldnt breathe really he was holding his sides he said mr wood and i should be on tv really lindy replied after a long moments hesitation thats weird i never thought cody had much of a sense of humor hes always so grim i dont think ive ever seen him laugh well he was laughing at mr wood and me kris insisted wishing she were a better liar awesome lindy muttered i cant wait to see your act neither can i kris thought glumly a few seconds later they were both asleep their mothers voice calling from downstairs awoke them at seven the next morning bright morningorange sunlight poured in through the window kris could hear birds chirping happily in the old maple tree rise and shine rise and shine every morning mrs powell shouted up the same words kris rubbed the sleep from her eyes then stretched her arms high over her head she glanced across the room then uttered a quiet gasp hey whats going on she reached across to lindys bed and shook lindy by the shoulder whats going on huh lindy startled sat straight up whats the joke where is he kris demanded huh kris pointed to the chair across the room sitting straight up in the chair slappy grinned back at them bathed in morning sunlight but mr wood was gone kris blinked several times and pushed herself up in bed with both hands her left hand tingled she must have been sleeping on it she realized what whats wrong lindy asked her voice fogged with sleep wheres mr wood kris demanded impatiently whered you put him huh put him lindy struggled to focus her eyes she saw slappy sitting stiffly on the chair across the room by himself its not funny kris snapped she climbed out of bed pulled down the hem of her nightshirt and made her way quickly to the chair in front of the window dont you ever get tired of playing stupid jokes jokes huh lindy lowered her feet to the floor kris bent down to search the floor under the chair then she moved to the foot of the bed and got down on her knees to search under both twin beds where is he lindy she asked angrily on her knees at the foot of the bed i dont think this is funny i really dont well neither do i lindy insisted standing up and stretching kris climbed to her feet her eyes went wide as she spotted the missing dummy oh lindy followed her sisters startled gaze mr wood grinned at them from the doorway he appeared to be standing his skinny legs bent at an awkward angle he was wearing kriss dressup clothes the betsey johnson skirt and the silk blouse her mouth wide open in surprise kris made her way quickly to the doorway she immediately saw that the dummy wasnt really standing on his own he had been propped up the doorknob shoved into the opening in his back she grabbed the dummy by the waist and pulled him away from the door my blouse its all wrinkled she cried holding it so lindy could see she narrowed her eyes angrily at her sister this was so obnoxious of you lindy me lindy shrieked i swear kris i didnt do it i slept like a rock last night i didnt move i didnt bet up till you woke me i didnt do it really kris stared hard at her sister then lowered her eyes to the dummy in her blouse and skirt mr wood grinned up at her as if enjoying her bewilderment well mr wood kris said aloud i guess you put on my clothes and walked to the door all by yourself lindy started to say something but their mothers voice from downstairs interrupted are you girls going to school today where are you youre late coming kris called down casting an angry glance at lindy she carefully set mr wood down on his back on her bed and pulled her skirt and blouse off him she looked up to see lindy making a mad dash across the hall to be first in the bathroom sighing kris stared down at mr wood the dummy grinned up at her a mischievous grin well whats going on she asked the dummy i didnt dress you up and move you and lindy swears she didnt do it but if we didnt do it she thought who did tilt his head forward lindy instructed thats it if you bounce him up and down a little itll make it look like hes laughing kris obediently bounced mr wood on her lap making him laugh dont move his mouth so much lindy told her i think youre both crazy lindys friend alice said so what else is new cody joked all four of them were sitting in a small patch of shade under the bent old maple tree in the powells back yard it was a hot saturday afternoon the sun high in a pale blue sky streaks of yellow light filtering down through the shifting leaves above their heads barky sniffed busily around the yard his little tail wagging nonstop kris sat on a folding chair which leaned back against the gnarled tree trunk she had mr wood on her lap lindy and alice stood at the edge of the shade their hands crossed over their chests watching kriss performance with frowns of concentration on their faces alice was a tall skinny girl with straight black hair down to her shoulders a snub nose and a pretty heartshaped mouth she was wearing white shorts and a bright blue midriff top cody was sprawled on his back in the grass his hands behind his head a long blade of grass between his teeth kris was trying to show off her ventriloquist skills but lindy kept interrupting with helpful suggestions when she wasnt making suggestions lindy was nervously glancing at her watch she didnt want to be late for her job at amys birthday party at two oclock i think youre way weird alice told lindy hey no way lindy replied slappy is a lot of fun and im going to make a lot of money with him and maybe ill be a comedy star or something when im older she glanced at her watch again well everyone at school thinks that both of you are weird alice said swatting a fly off her bare arm who cares lindy replied sharply theyre all weird too and so are you kris made mr wood say i could see your lips move lindy told kris kris rolled her eyes give me a break youve been giving me a hard time all morning just trying to help lindy said you dont have to be so defensive do you kris uttered an angry growl was that your stomach she made mr wood say cody laughed at least one person thinks youre funny lindy said dryly but if you want to do parties you really should get some better jokes kris let the dummy slump to her lap i cant find any good joke books she said dejectedly where do you find your jokes a superior sneer formed on lindys face she tossed her long hair behind her shoulder i make up my own jokes she replied snootily you are a joke cody said haha remind me to laugh later lindy said sarcastically i cant believe you dont have your dummy out here alice told lindy i mean dont you want to rehearse for the party no need lindy replied ive got my act down i dont want to overrehearse kris groaned loudly some of the other parents are staying at the birthday party to watch slappy and me lindy continued ignoring kriss sarcasm if the kids like me their parents might hire me for their parties maybe you and kris should do an act together alice suggested that could be really awesome yeah what an act then thered be four dummies cody joked alice was the only one to laugh lindy made a face at cody that might actually be fun she said thoughtfully and then she added when kris is ready kris drew in her breath and prepared to make an angry reply but before she could say anything lindy grabbed mr wood from her hands let me give you a few pointers lindy said putting one foot on kriss folding chair and arranging mr wood on her lap you have to hold him up straighter like this hey give him back kris demanded reaching for her dummy as she reached up mr wood suddenly lowered his head until he was staring down at her youre a jerk he rasped in kriss face speaking in a low throaty growl huh kris pulled back in surprise youre a stupid jerk mr wood repeated nastily in the same harsh growl lindy stop it kris cried cody and alice both stared in openmouthed surprise stupid moron get lost get lost stupid jerk the dummy rasped in kriss face whoa cody exclaimed make him stop kris screamed at her sister i cant lindy cried in a trembling voice her face became pale her eyes wide with fear i cant make him stop kris he hes speaking for himself the dummy glared at kris its grin ugly and evil i i cant make him stop im not doing it lindy cried tugging with all her might she pulled mr wood out of kriss face cody and alice flashed each other bewildered glances frightened kris raised herself from the folding chair and backed up against the tree trunk he hes talking on his own she stared hard at the grinning dummy i i think so im all mixed up lindy declared her cheeks bright pink barky yipped and jumped on lindys legs trying to get her attention but she kept her gaze on kriss frightened face this is a joke right cody asked hopefully whats going on alice demanded her arms crossed in front of her chest ignoring them lindy handed mr wood back to kris here take him hes yours maybe you can control him but lindy kris started to protest lindy glared at her watch oh no the party im late shaking her head she took off toward the house later she called without looking back but lindy kris called the kitchen door slammed behind lindy holding mr wood by the shoulders kris lowered her eyes to his face he grinned up at her a devilish grin his eyes staring intently into hers kris swung easily leaning back and raising her feet into the air the chains squeaked with every swing the old back yard swingset half covered with rust hadnt been used much in recent years the early evening sun was lowering itself behind the house the aroma of a roasting chicken floated out from the kitchen window kris could hear her mother busy in the kitchen preparing dinner barky yapped beneath her kris dropped her feet to the ground and stopped the swing to avoid kicking him dumb dog dont you know you could get hurt she looked up to see lindy come running up the driveway holding slappy under her arm from the smile on lindys face kris knew at once that the birthday party had been a triumph but she had to ask anyway howd it go it was awesome lindy exclaimed slappy and i were great kris pulled herself off the swing and forced a smile to her face thats nice she offered the kids thought we were a riot lindy continued she pulled slappy up didnt they slappy they liked me hated you slappy declared in lindys highpitched voice kris forced a laugh im glad it went okay she said trying hard to be a good sport i did a singalong with slappy and it went over really well then slappy and i did our rap routine what a hit lindy gushed shes spreading it on a little thick kris thought bitterly kris couldnt help feeling jealous the kids all lined up to talk to slappy lindy continued didnt they slappy everyone loved me she made the dummy say wheres my share of the loot so you got paid twenty dollars kris asked kicking at a clump of weeds twentyfive lindy replied amys mom said i was so good shed pay me extra oh and guess what else you know mrs evans the woman who always wears the leopardskin pants you know annas mom she asked me to do annas party next sunday shes going to pay me thirty dollars im going to be rich wow thirty dollars kris muttered shaking her head i get twenty you get ten lindy made slappy say i have to go tell mom the good news lindy said what have you been doing all afternoon well after you left i was pretty upset kris replied following lindy to the house you know about mr wood i i put him upstairs alice and cody went home then mom and i went to the mall his tail wagging furiously barley ran right over their feet nearly tripping both of them barley look out lindy yelled oh i nearly forgot kris said stopping on the back stoop something good happened lindy stopped too something good yeah i ran into mrs berman at the mall mrs berman was their music teacher and organizer of the spring concert thrills lindy replied sarcastically and mrs berman asked if mr wood and i wanted to be master of ceremonies for the spring concert kris smiled at her sister lindy swallowed hard she asked you to host the concert yeah i get to perform with mr wood in front of everyone kris gushed happily she saw a flash of jealousy on lindys face which made her even happier lindy pulled open the screen door well good luck she said dryly with that weird dummy of yours youll need it dinner was spent talking about lindys performance at amy marshalls birthday party lindy and mrs powell chatted excitedly kris ate in silence at first i thought the whole thing was strange i have to admit mrs powell said scooping ice cream into bowls for dessert i just couldnt believe youd be interested in ventriloquism lindy but i guess you have a flair for it i guess you have some talent lindy beamed mrs powell normally wasnt big on compliments i found a book in the school library about ventriloquism lindy said it had some pretty good tips in it it even had a comedy routine to perform she glanced at kris but i like making up my own jokes better you should watch your sisters act mrs powell told kris handing her a bowl of ice cream i mean you could probably pick up some pointers for the concert at school maybe kris replied trying to hide how annoyed she was after dinner mr powell called from portland and they all talked with him lindy told him about her success with slappy at the birthday party kris told him about being asked to host the concert with mr wood her father promised he wouldnt schedule any road trips so that he could attend the concert after watching a video their mother had rented at the mall the two sisters went up to their room it was a little after eleven kris clicked on the light lindy followed her in they both glanced across the room to the chair where they kept the two dummies and gasped oh no lindy cried raising one hand to her wide open mouth earlier that night the dummies had been placed side by side in a sitting position but now slappy was upside down falling out of the chair his head on the floor his brown shoes had been pulled off his feet and tossed against the wall his suit jacket had been pulled halfway down his arms trapping his hands behind his back llook kris stammered although her sister was already staring in horror at the scene mr wood hes kriss voice caught in her throat mr wood was sprawled on top of slappy his hands were wrapped around slappys throat as if he were strangling him i i dont believe this kris managed to whisper she turned and caught the frightened expression on lindys face whats going on lindy cried both sisters hurried across the room kris grabbed mr wood by the back of the neck and pulled him off the other dummy she felt as if she were separating two fighting boys she held mr wood up in front of her examining him carefully staring at his face as if halfexpecting him to talk to her then she lowered the dummy and tossed it facedown onto her bed her face was pale and taut with fear lindy stooped and picked up slappys brown shoes from the floor she held them up and studied them as if they would offer a clue as to what had happened kris did you do this lindy asked softly huh me kris reacted with surprise i mean i know youre jealous of slappy and me lindy started whoa wait a minute kris replied angrily in a shrill trembling voice i didnt do this lindy dont accuse me lindy glared at her sister studying her face then her expression softened and she sighed i dont get i just dont get it look at slappy hes nearly been torn apart she set the shoes down on the chair and picked the dummy up gently as if picking up a baby holding him in one hand she struggled to pull his suit jacket up with the other kris heard her sister mutter something it sounded like your dummy is evil what did you say kris demanded nothing lindy replied still struggling with the jacket im uh im kind of scared about this lindy confessed blushing avoiding kriss eyes me too kris admitted something weird is going on i think we should tell mom lindy buttoned the jacket then she sat down on the bed with slappy on her lap and started to replace the dummys shoes yeah i guess we should she replied it its just so creepy their mother was in bed reading a stephen king novel her bedroom was dark except for a tiny reading lamp on her headboard that threw down a narrow triangle of yellow light mrs powell uttered a short cry as her two daughters appeared out of the shadows oh you startled me this is such a scary book and i think i was just about to fall asleep can we talk to you kris asked eagerly in a low whisper something weird is going on lindy added mrs powell yawned and closed her book whats wrong its about mr wood kris said hes been doing a lot of strange things huh mrs powells eyes opened wide she looked pale and tired under the harsh light from the reading lamp he was strangling slappy lindy reported and this afternoon he said some really gross things and stop mrs powell ordered raising one hand just stop but mom kris started give me a break girls their mother said wearily im tired of your silly competitions you dont understand lindy interrupted yes i do understand mrs powell said sharply you two are even competing with those ventriloquist dummies mom please i want it to stop right now mrs powell insisted tossing the book onto her bed table i mean it i dont want to hear another word from either of you about those dummies if you two have problems settle it between yourselves mom listen and if you cant settle it ill take the dummies away both of them im serious mrs powell reached above her head and clicked off the reading light throwing the room into darkness good night she said the girls had no choice but to leave the room they slunk down the hall in silence kris hesitated at the doorway to their bedroom she expected to find mr wood strangling slappy again she breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the two dummies on the bed where they had been left mom wasnt too helpful lindy said dryly rolling her eyes she picked up slappy and started to arrange him in the chair in front of the window i think she was asleep and we woke her up kris replied she picked up mr wood and started toward the chair with him then stopped you know what i think im going to put him in the closet tonight she said thoughtfully good idea lindy said climbing into bed kris glanced down at the dummy halfexpecting him to react to complain to start calling her names but mr wood grinned up at her his painted eyes dull and lifeless kris felt a chill of fear im becoming afraid of a stupid ventriloquists dummy she thought im shutting him up in the closet tonight because im afraid she carried mr wood to the closet then with a groan she raised him high above her head and slid him onto the top shelf carefully closing the closet door listening for the click she made her way to her bed she slept fitfully tossing on top of the covers her sleep filled with disturbing dreams she awoke to find her nightshirt completely twisted cutting off the circulation to her right arm she struggled to straighten it then fell back to sleep she awoke early drenched in sweat the sky was still dawngray outside the window the room felt hot and stuffy she sat up slowly feeling weary as if she hadnt slept at all blinking away the sleep her eyes focused on the chair in front of the window there sat slappy exactly where lindy had placed him and beside him sat mr wood his arm around slappys shoulder grinning triumphantly at kris as if he had just pulled off a wonderful joke now mr wood do you go to school of course i do do you think im a dummy and whats your favorite class wood shop of course what project are you building in shop class mr wood im building a girl dummy what else haha think i want to spend the rest of my life on your lap kris sat in front of the dressing table mirror with mr wood on her lap studying herself as she practiced her routine for the school concert mr wood had been wellbehaved for two days no frightening mysterious incidents kris was beginning to feel better maybe everything would go okay from now on she leaned close to the mirror watching her lips as she made the dummy talk the bs and the ms were impossible to pronounce without moving her lips shed just have to avoid those sounds as best she could im getting better at switching from mr woods voice back to mine she thought happily but ive got to switch faster the faster he and i talk the funnier it is lets try it again mr wood she said pulling her chair closer to the mirror work work work she made the dummy grumble before she could begin the routine lindy came rushing breathlessly into the room kris watched her sister in the mirror as she came up behind her her long hair flying loosely over her shoulders an excited smile on her face guess what lindy asked kris started to reply but lindy didnt give her a chance mrs petrie was at amy marshalls birthday party lindy gushed excitedly she works for channel three you know the tv station and she thinks im good enough to go on talent search the show they have every week huh really was all kris could manage in reply lindy leapt excitedly in the air and cheered slappy and i are going to be on tv she cried isnt that fabulous staring at her sisters jubilant reflection in the mirror kris felt a stab of jealousy ive got to tell mom lindy declared hey mom mom she ran from the room kris heard her shouting all the way down the stairs aaaaaargh kris couldnt hold it in she uttered an angry cry why does everything good happen to lindy kris screamed aloud im hosting a stupid concert for maybe a hundred parents and shes going to be on tv im just as good as she is maybe better in a rage she raised mr wood high over her head and slammed him to the floor the dummys head made a loud clonk as it hit the hardwood floor the wide mouth flew open as if about to scream oh kris struggled to regain her composure mr wood crumpled at her feet stared up at her accusingly kris lifted him up and cradled the dummy against her there there mr wood she whispered soothingly did i hurt you did i im so sorry i didnt mean to the dummy continued to stare up at her his painted grin hadnt changed but his eyes seemed cold and unforgiving it was a still night no breeze the curtains in front of the open bedroom window didnt flutter or move pale silver moonlight filtered in creating long purple shadows that appeared to creep across the girls bedroom lindy had been sleeping fitfully a light sleep filled with busy colorful dreams she was startled awake by a sound a gentle thud huh she raised her head from the damp pillow and turned someone was moving in the darkness the sounds shed heard were footsteps hey she whispered wide awake now who is it the figure turned in the doorway a shadow against even blacker shadows its only me came a whispered reply kris yeah something woke me up my throat is sore kris whispered from the doorway im going down to the kitchen for a glass of water she disappeared into the shadows her head still raised off the pillow lindy listened to her footsteps padding down the stairs when the sounds faded lindy shut her eyes and lowered her head to the pillow a few seconds later she heard kriss scream of horror her heart pounding lindy struggled out of bed the sheet tangled around her legs and she nearly fell kriss bloodcurdling scream echoed in her ears she practically leapt down the dark stairway her bare feet thudding hard on the thin carpet of the steps it was dark downstairs except for a thin sliver of yellow light from the kitchen kris kris are you okay lindy called her voice sounding small and frightened in the dark hallway kris lindy stopped at the kitchen doorway what was that eerie light it took her a while to focus then she realized she was staring at the dim yellow light from inside the refrigerator the refrigerator door was wide open and the refrigerator was empty what whats going on here she took a step into the kitchen then another something cold and wet surrounded her foot lindy gasped and looking down saw that she had stepped into a wide puddle an overturned milk carton beside her foot revealed that the puddle was spilled milk she raised her eyes to kris who was standing in darkness across the room her back against the wall her hands raised to her face in horror kris what on earth the scene was coming into focus now it was all so weird so wrong it was taking lindy a long time to see the whole picture but now following kriss horrified stare lindy saw the mess on the floor and realized why the refrigerator was empty everything inside it had been pulled out and dumped on the kitchen floor an orange juice bottle lay on its side in a puddle of orange juice eggs were scattered everywhere fruits and vegetables were strewn over the floor ohh lindy moaned in utter disbelief everything seemed to sparkle and gleam what was all that shiny stuff among the food kriss jewelry there were earrings and bracelets and strands of beads tossed everywhere mixed with the spilled strewn food like some kind of bizarre salad oh no lindy shrieked as her eyes came to rest on the figure on the floor sitting upright in the middle of the mess was mr wood grinning gleefully at her he had several strands of beads around his neck long dangling earrings hanging from his ears and a platter of leftover chicken on his lap kris are you okay lindy cried turning her eyes away from the grinning jewelrycovered dummy kris didnt seem to hear her are you okay lindy repeated the question whwhats going on kris stammered her back pressed against the wall her expression taut with terror who who did this did mr wood lindy started to reply but their mothers howl of surprise from the doorway cut off her words mom lindy cried spinning around mrs powell clicked on the ceiling light the kitchen seemed to flare up all three of them blinked struggling to adjust to the sudden brightness what on earth mrs powell cried she started to call to her husband then remembered he wasnt home i i dont believe this barky came bounding into the room his tail wagging he lowered his head and started to lick up some spilled milk out you go mrs powell said sternly she picked up the dog carried him out and closed the kitchen door then she strode into the center of the room shaking her head her bare feet narrowly missing the puddle of milk i came down for a drink and i i found this mess kris said in a trembling voice the food my jewelry everything mr wood did it lindy accused look at him stop it stop it mrs powell screamed ive had enough mrs powell surveyed the mess frowning and tugging at a strand of blonde hair her eyes stopped on mr wood and she uttered a groan of disgust i knew it she said in a low voice raising her eyes accusingly to the two girls i knew this had something to do with those ventriloquist dummies mr wood did it mom kris said heatedly stepping away from the wall her hands tensed into fists i know it sounds dumb but stop it mrs powell ordered narrowing her eyes this is just sick sick she stared hard at the jewelbedecked dummy who grinned up at her over the big platter of chicken im going to take the dummies away from you both mrs powell said turning back to lindy and kris this whole thing has just gotten out of control no kris cried thats not fair lindy declared im sorry they have to be put away mrs powell said firmly she let her eyes move over the cluttered floor and let out another weary sigh look at my kitchen but i didnt do anything lindy screamed i need mr wood for the spring concert kris protested everyone is counting on me mom mrs powell glanced from one to the other her eyes stayed on kris thats your dummy on the floor right yeah kris told her but i didnt do this i swear you both swear you didnt do it right mrs powell said suddenly looking very tired under the harsh ceiling light yes lindy answered quickly then you both lose your dummies im sorry mrs powell said one of you is lying i i really cant believe this a heavy silence blanketed the room as all three powells stared down in dismay at the mess on the floor kris was the first to speak mom what if lindy and i clean everything up lindy caught on quickly her face brightened yeah what if we put everything back right now make the kitchen just like normal make it spotless can we keep our dummies mrs powell shook her head no i dont think so look at this mess all the vegetables are spoiled and the milk well replace it all kris said quickly with our allowance and well clean it up perfectly please if we do that give us one more chance mrs powell twisted her face in concentration debating with herself she stared at her daughters eager faces okay she replied finally i want the kitchen spotless when i come down in the morning all the food all the jewelry everything back where it goes okay both girls said in unison and i dont want to see either of those dummies down here in my kitchen again mrs powell demanded if you can do that ill give you one more chance great both girls cried at once and i dont want to hear any more arguments about those dummies mrs powell continued no more fights no more competing no more blaming everything on the dummies i dont want to hear anything about them ever you wont kris promised glancing at her sister thanks mom lindy said you go to bed well clean up she gave her mother a gentle shove toward the doorway not another word mrs powell reminded them right mom the twins agreed their mother disappeared toward her room they began to clean up kris pulled a large garbage bag from the drawer and held it while lindy tossed in empty cartons and spoiled food kris carefully collected her jewelry and carried it upstairs neither girl spoke they worked in silence picking up cleaning and mopping until the kitchen was clean lindy closed the refrigerator door she yawned loudly kris inspected the floor on her hands and knees making sure it was spotless then she picked up mr wood he grinned back at her as if it was all a big joke this dummy has been nothing but trouble kris thought nothing but trouble she followed lindy out of the kitchen clicking off the light as she left the two girls climbed the stairs silently neither of them had spoken a word pale moonlight filtered into their room through the open window the air felt hot and steamy kris glanced at the clock it was a little past three in the morning slappy sat slumped in the chair in front of the window moonlight shining on his grinning face lindy yawning climbed into bed pushed down the blanket and pulled up the sheet she turned her face away from her sister kris lowered mr wood from her shoulder youre nothing but trouble she thought angrily holding him in front of her and staring at his grinning face nothing but trouble mr woods wide leering grin seemed to mock her a chill of fear mixed with her anger im beginning to hate this dummy she thought fear him and hate him angrily she pulled open the closet door and tossed the dummy into the closet it fell in a crumpled heap on the closet floor kris slammed the closet door shut her heart thudding she climbed into bed and pulled up the covers she suddenly felt very tired her entire body ached from weariness she buried her face in the pillow and shut her eyes she had just about fallen asleep when she heard the tiny voice let me out let me out of here it cried a muffled voice coming from inside the closet let me out let me out the highpitched voice called angrily kris sat up with a jolt her entire body convulsed in a shudder of fear her eyes darted to the other bed lindy hadnt moved did did you hear it kris stammered hear what lindy asked sleepily the voice kris whispered in the closet huh lindy asked sleepily what are you talking about its three in the morning cant we get some sleep but lindy kris lowered her feet to the floor her heart was thudding in her chest wake up listen to me mr wood was calling to me he was talking lindy raised her head and listened silence i dont hear anything kris really maybe you were dreaming no kris shrieked feeling herself lose control it wasnt a dream im so scared lindy im just so scared suddenly kris was trembling all over and hot tears were pouring down her cheeks lindy stood up and moved to the edge of her sisters bed something hhorrible is going on here lindy kris stammered through her tears and i know whos doing it lindy whispered leaning over her twin putting a comforting hand on her quivering shoulder huh yes i know whos been doing it all lindy whispered i know who it is who kris asked breathlessly who kris repeated letting the tears run down her cheeks who i have lindy said her smile spread into a grin almost as wide as slappys she closed her eyes and laughed huh kris didnt understand what did you say i said i have been doing it lindy repeated me lindy it was all a joke kris i gotcha again she nodded her head as if confirming her words kris gaped at her twin in disbelief it was all a joke lindy kept nodding you moved mr wood during the night you dressed him in my clothes and made him say those gross things to me you put him in the kitchen you made that horrible mess lindy chuckled yeah i really scared you didnt i kris balled her hands into angry fists but but she sputtered why for fun lindy replied dropping back onto her bed still grinning fun i wanted to see if i could scare you lindy explained it was just a joke you know i cant believe you fell for that voice in the closet just now i must be a really good ventriloquist but lindy you really believed mr wood was alive or something lindy said laughing enjoying her victory youre such a nit nit half a nitwit lindy burst into wild laughter it isnt funny kris said softly i know lindy replied its a riot you shouldve seen the look on your face when you saw mr wood downstairs in your precious beads and earrings how how did you ever think of such a mean joke kris demanded it just came to me lindy answered with some pride when you got your dummy you didnt want me to get a dummy kris said thoughtfully youre right lindy quickly agreed i wanted something that would be mine for a change im so tired of you being a copycat so so you thought of this mean joke kris accused lindy nodded kris strode angrily to the window and pressed her forehead against the glass i i cant believe i was so stupid she muttered neither can i lindy agreed grinning again you really made me start thinking that mr wood was alive or something kris said staring out the window to the back yard below you really made me afraid of him arent i brilliant lindy proclaimed kris turned to face her sister im never speaking to you again she said angrily lindy shrugged it was just a joke no kris insisted it was too mean to be just a joke im never speaking to you again never fine lindy replied curtly i thought you had a sense of humor fine she slid into bed her back to kris and pulled the covers up over her head ive got to find a way to pay her back for this kris thought but how after school a few days later kris walked home with cody it was a hot humid afternoon the trees were still and seemed to throw little shade on the sidewalk the air above the pavement shimmered in the heat wish we had a swimming pool kris muttered pulling her backpack off her shoulder i wish you had one too cody said wiping his forehead with the sleeve of his red tshirt id like to dive into an enormous pool of iced tea kris said like in the tv commercials it always looks so cold and refreshing cody made a face swim in iced tea with ice cubes and lemon forget it kris muttered they crossed the street a couple of kids they knew rode by on bikes two men in white uniforms were up on ladders leaning against the corner house painting the gutters bet theyre hot cody remarked lets change the subject kris suggested how are you doing with mr wood cody asked not bad kris said i think ive got some pretty good jokes i should be ready for the concert tomorrow night they stopped at the corner and let a large blue van rumble past are you talking to your sister cody asked as they crossed the street the bright sunlight made his whiteblond hair glow a little kris said making a face im talking to her but i havent forgiven her that was such a dumb stunt she pulled cody said sympathetically he wiped the sweat off his forehead with the sleeve of his tshirt it just made me feel like such a dork kris admitted i mean i was so stupid she really had me believing that mr wood was doing all that stuff kris shook her head thinking about it made her feel embarrassed all over again her house came into view she unzipped the back compartment of her backpack and searched for the keys did you tell your mom about lindys practical joke cody asked kris shook her head mom is totally disgusted were not allowed to mention the dummies to her dad got home from portland last night and mom told him what was going on so were not allowed to mention the dummies to him either she found the keys and started up the drive thanks for walking home with me yeah sure cody gave her a little wave and continued on toward his house up the street kris pushed the key into the front door lock she could hear barky jumping and yipping excitedly on the other side of the door im coming barky she called in hold your horses she pushed open the door barky began leaping on her whimpering as if shed been away for months okay okay she cried laughing it took several minutes to calm the dog down then kris got a snack from the kitchen and headed up to her room to practice with mr wood she hoisted the dummy up from the chair where it had spent the day beside lindys dummy a can of coke in one hand the dummy over her shoulder she headed to the dressing table and sat down in front of the mirror this was the best time of day to rehearse kris thought no one was home her parents were at work lindy was at some afterschool activity she arranged mr wood on her lap time to go to work she made him say reaching into his back to move his lips she made his eyes slide back and forth a button on his plaid shirt had come unbuttoned kris leaned him down against the dressing table and started to fasten it something caught her eye something yellow inside the pocket weird kris said aloud i never noticed anything in there slipping two fingers into the slender pocket she pulled out a yellowed sheet of paper folded up probably just the receipt for him kris thought she unfolded the sheet of paper and held it up to read it it wasnt a receipt the paper contained a single sentence handwritten very cleanly in bold black ink it was in a language kris didnt recognize did someone send you a love note mr wood she asked the dummy it stared up at her lifelessly kris lowered her eyes to the paper and read the strange sentence out loud karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano what language is that kris wondered she glanced down at the dummy and uttered a low cry of surprise mr wood appeared to blink but that wasnt possible was it kris took a deep breath then let it out slowly the dummy stared up at her his painted eyes as dull and wide open as ever lets not get paranoid kris scolded herself time to work mr wood she told him she folded up the piece of yellow paper and slipped it back into his shirt pocket then she raised him to a sitting position searching for the eye and mouth controls with her hand how are things around your house mr wood not good kris ive got termites i need termites like i need another hole in my head haha lindy kris could you come downstairs please mr powell called from the foot of the stairs it was after dinner and the twins were up in their room lindy was sprawled on her stomach on the bed reading a book for school kris was in front of the dressing table mirror rehearsing quietly with mr wood for tomorrow nights concert what do you want dad lindy shouted down rolling her eyes were kind of busy kris shouted shifting the dummy on her lap the millers are here and theyre dying to see your ventriloquist acts their father shouted up lindy and kris both groaned the millers were the elderly couple who lived next door they were very nice people but very boring the twins heard mr powells footsteps on the stairs a few seconds later he poked his head into their room come on girls just put on a short show for the millers they came over for coffee and we told them about your dummies but i have to rehearse for tomorrow night kris insisted rehearse on them her father suggested come on just do five minutes theyll get a real kick out of it sighing loudly the girls agreed carrying their dummies over their shoulders they followed their father down to the living room mr and mrs miller were side by side on the couch coffee mugs in front of them on the low coffee table they smiled and called out cheerful greetings as the girls appeared kris was always struck by how much the millers looked alike they both had slender pink faces topped with spongy white hair they both wore silverframed bifocals which slipped down on nearly identical pointy noses they both had the same smile mr miller had a small gray mustache lindy always joked that he grew it so the millers could tell each other apart is that what happens to you when youve been married a long time kris found herself thinking you start to look exactly alike the millers were even dressed alike in loosefitting tan bermuda shorts and white cotton sports shirts lindy and kris took up ventriloquism a few weeks ago mrs powell was explaining twisting herself forward to see the girls from the armchair she motioned them to the center of the room and they both seem to have some talent for it have you girls ever heard of bergen and mccarthy mrs miller asked smiling who lindy and kris asked in unison before your time mr miller said chuckling they were a ventriloquist act can you do something for us mrs miller asked picking up her coffee mug and setting it in her lap mr powell pulled a dining room chair into the center of the room here lindy why dont you go first he turned to the millers theyre very good youll see he said lindy sat down and arranged slappy on her lap the millers applauded mrs miller nearly spilled her coffee but she caught the mug just in time dont applaud just throw money lindy made slappy say everyone laughed as if theyd never heard that before kris watched from the stairway as lindy did a short routine lindy was really good she had to admit very smooth the millers were laughing so hard their faces were bright red an identical shade of red mrs miller kept squeezing her husbands knee when she laughed lindy finished to big applause the millers gushed about how wonderful she was lindy told them about the tv show she might be on and they promised they wouldnt miss it well tape it mr miller said kris took her place on the chair and sat mr wood up in her lap this is mr wood she told the millers were going to be the hosts of the spring concert at school tomorrow night so ill give you a preview of what were going to say thats a nicelooking dummy mrs miller said quietly youre a nicelooking dummy too mr wood declared in a harsh raspy growl of a voice kriss mother gasped the millers smiles faded mr wood leaned forward on kriss lap and stared at mr miller is that a mustache or are you eating a rat he asked nastily mr miller glanced uncomfortably at his wife then forced a laugh they both laughed dont laugh so hard you might drop your false teeth mr wood shouted and how do you get your teeth that disgusting shade of yellow does your bad breath do that kris mrs powell shouted thats enough the millers faces were bright red now their expressions bewildered thats not funny apologize to the millers mr powell insisted crossing the room and standing over kris i i didnt say any of it kris stammered really i kris apologize her father demanded angrily mr wood turned to the millers im sorry he rasped im sorry youre so ugly im sorry youre so old and stupid too the millers stared at each other unhappily i dont get her humor mrs miller said its just crude insults mr miller replied quietly kris what is wrong with you mrs powell demanded she had crossed the room to stand beside her husband apologize to the millers right now i dont believe you i i gripping mr wood tightly around the waist kris rose to her feet i i she tried to utter an apology but no words would come out sorry she finally managed to scream then with an embarrassed cry she turned and fled up the stairs tears streaming down her face you have to believe me kris cried in a trembling voice i really didnt say any of those things mr wood was talking by himself lindy rolled her eyes tell me another one she muttered sarcastically lindy had followed kris upstairs down in the living room her parents were still apologizing to the millers now kris sat on the edge of her bed wiping tears off her cheeks lindy stood with her arms crossed in front of the dressing table i dont make insulting jokes like that kris said glancing at mr wood who lay crumpled in the center of the floor where kris had tossed him you know that isnt my sense of humor so whyd you do it lindy demanded whyd you want to make everyone mad but i didnt kris shrieked tugging at the sides of her hair mr wood said those things i didnt how can you be such a copycat lindy asked disgustedly i already did that joke kris cant you think of something original its not a joke kris insisted why dont you believe me no way lindy replied shaking her head her arms still crossed in front of her chest no way im going to fall for the same gag lindy please kris pleaded im frightened im really frightened yeah sure lindy said sarcastically im shaking all over too wow you really fooled me kris guess you showed me you can play funny tricks too shut up kris snapped more tears formed in the corners of her eyes very good crying lindy said but it doesnt fool me either and it wont fool mom and dad she turned and picked up slappy maybe slappy and i should practice some jokes after your performance tonight mom and dad might not let you do the concert tomorrow night she slung slappy over her shoulder and stepping over the crumpled form of mr wood hurried from the room it was hot and noisy backstage in the auditorium kriss throat was dry and she kept walking over to the water fountain and slurping mouthfuls of the warm water the voices of the audience on the other side of the curtain seemed to echo off all four walls and the ceiling the louder the noise became as the auditorium filled the more nervous kris felt how am i ever going to do my act in front of all those people she asked herself pulling the edge of the curtain back a few inches and peering out her parents were off to the side in the third row seeing them brought memories of the night before flooding back to kris her parents had grounded her for two weeks as punishment for insulting the millers they almost hadnt let her come to the concert kris stared at the kids and adults filing into the large auditorium recognizing a lot of faces she realized her hands were ice cold her throat was dry again dont think of it as an audience she told herself think of it as a bunch of kids and parents most of whom you know somehow that made it worse she let go of the curtain hurried to get one last drink from the fountain then retrieved mr wood from the table she had left him on it suddenly grew quiet on the other side of the curtain the concert was about to begin break a leg lindy called across to her as she hurried to join the other chorus members thanks kris replied weakly she pulled up mr wood and straightened his shirt your hands are clammy she made him say no insults tonight kris told him sternly to her shock the dummy blinked hey she cried she hadnt touched his eye controls she had a stab of fear that went beyond stage fright maybe i shouldnt go on with this she thought staring intently at mr wood watching for him to blink again maybe i should say im sick and not perform with him are you nervous a voice whispered huh at first she thought it was mr wood but then she quickly realized that it was mrs berman the music teacher yeah a little kris admitted feeling her face grow hot youll be terrific mrs berman gushed squeezing kriss shoulder with a sweaty hand she was a large heavyset woman with several chins a red lipsticked mouth and flowing black hair she was wearing a long loosefitting dress of redandblue flower patterns here goes she said giving kriss shoulder one more squeeze then she stepped onstage blinking against the harsh white light of the spotlight to introduce kris and mr wood am i really doing this kris asked herself can i do this her heart was pounding so hard she couldnt hear mrs bermans introduction then suddenly the audience was applauding and kris found herself walking across the stage to the microphone carrying mr wood in both hands mrs berman her flowery dress flowing around her was heading offstage she smiled at kris and gave her an encouraging wink as they passed each other squinting against the bright spotlight kris walked to the middle of the stage her mouth felt as dry as cotton she wondered if she could make a sound a folding chair had been set up for her she sat down arranging mr wood on her lap then realized that the microphone was much too high this drew titters of soft laughter from the audience embarrassed kris stood up and holding mr wood under one arm struggled to lower the microphone are you having trouble mrs berman called from the side of the stage she hurried over to help kris but before the music teacher got halfway across the stage mr wood leaned into the microphone what time does the blimp go up he rasped nastily staring at mrs bermans dress what she stopped in surprise your face reminds me of a wart i had removed mr wood growled at the startled woman her mouth dropped open in horror kris if we count your chins will it tell us your age there was laughter floating up from the audience but it was mixed with gasps of horror kris thats enough mrs berman cried the microphone picking up her angry protest youre more than enough youre enough for two mr wood declared nastily if you got any bigger youd need your own zip code kris really im going to ask you to apologize mrs berman said her face bright red mrs berman i im not doing it kris stammered im not saying these things please apologize to me and to the audience mrs berman demanded mr wood leaned into the microphone apologize for this he screamed the dummys head tilted back his jaw dropped his mouth opened wide and a thick green liquid came spewing out yuck someone screamed it looked like pea soup it spurted up out of mr woods open mouth like water rushing from a fire hose voices screamed and cried out their surprise as the thick green liquid showered over the people in the front rows stop it help somebody turn it off it stinks kris froze in horror staring as more and more of the disgusting substance poured from her dummys gaping mouth a putrid stench the smell of sour milk of rotten eggs of burning rubber of decayed meat rose up from the liquid it puddled over the stage and showered over the front seats blinded by the spotlight kris couldnt see the audience in front of her but she could hear the choking and the gagging the frantic cries for help clear the auditorium clear the auditorium mrs berman was shouting kris heard the rumble and scrape of people shoving their way up the aisles and out the doors it stinks im sick somebody help kris tried to clamp her hand over the dummys mouth but the force of the putrid green liquid frothing and spewing out was too strong it pushed her hand away suddenly she realized she was being shoved from behind off the stage away from the shouting people fleeing the auditorium out of the glaring spotlight she was backstage before she realized that it was mrs berman who was pushing her i i dont know how you did that or why mrs berman shouted angrily frantically wiping splotches of the disgusting green liquid off the front of her dress with both hands but im going to see that youre suspended from school kris and if i have my way she sputtered youll be suspended for life thats right close the door mr powell said sternly glaring with narrowed eyes at kris he stood a few inches behind her arms crossed in front of him making sure she followed his instructions she had carefully folded mr wood in half and shoved him to the back of her closet shelf now she closed the closet making sure it was completely shut as he ordered lindy watched silently from her bed her expression troubled does the closet door lock mr powell asked no not really kris told him lowering her head well that will have to do he said on monday im taking him back to the pawn shop do not take him out until then but dad he raised a hand to silence her we have to talk about this kris pleaded you have to listen to me what happened tonight it wasnt a practical joke i her father turned away from her a scowl on his face kris im sorry well talk tomorrow your mother and i were both too angry and too upset to talk now but dad ignoring her he stormed out of the room she listened to his footsteps hard and hurried down the stairs then kris slowly turned to lindy now do you believe me i i dont know what to believe lindy replied it was just so unbelievably gross lindy i i daddys right lets talk tomorrow lindy said im sure everything will be clearer and calmer tomorrow but kris couldnt sleep she shifted from side to side uncomfortable wide awake she pulled the pillow over her face held it there for a while welcoming the soft darkness then tossed it to the floor im never going to sleep again she thought every time she closed her eyes she saw the hideous scene in the auditorium once again she heard the astonished cries of the audience the kids and their parents and she heard the cries of shock turn to groans of disgust as the putrid gunk poured out over everyone sickening so totally sickening and everyone blamed her my life is ruined kris thought i can never go back there again i can never go to school i can never show my face anywhere ruined my whole life ruined by that stupid dummy in the next bed lindy snored softly in a slow steady rhythm kris turned her eyes to the bedroom window the curtains hung down over the window filtering the pale moonlight from outside slappy sat in his usual place in the chair in front of the window bent in two his head between his knees stupid dummies kris thought bitterly so stupid and now my life is ruined she glanced at the clock onetwenty outside the window she heard a low rumbling sound a soft whistle of brakes probably a large truck going by kris yawned she closed her eyes and saw the gross green gunk spewing out of mr woods mouth will i see that every time i close my eyes she wondered what on earth was it how could everyone blame me for something so so the rumbling of the truck faded into the distance but then kris heard another sound a rustling sound a soft footstep someone was moving she sucked in her breath and held it listening hard silence now silence so heavy she could hear the loud thudding of her heart then another soft footstep a shadow moved the closet door swung open or was it just shadows shifting no someone was moving moving from the open closet someone was creeping toward the bedroom door creeping so softly so silently her heart pounding kris pulled herself up trying not to make a sound realizing that shed been holding her breath she let it out slowly silently she took another breath then sat up the shadow moved slowly to the door kris lowered her feet to the floor staring hard into the darkness her eyes staying with the silent moving figure whats happening she wondered the shadow moved again she heard a scraping sound the sound of a sleeve brushing the doorframe kris pushed herself to her feet her legs felt shaky as she crept to the door following the moving shadow out into the hallway even darker out here because there were no windows toward the stairway the shadow moved more quickly now kris followed her bare feet moving lightly over the thin carpet whats happening whats happening she caught up to the shadowy figure on the landing hey she called her voice a tight whisper she grabbed the shoulder and turned the figure around and stared into the grinning face of mr wood mr wood blinked then hissed at her an ugly sound a menacing sound in the darkness of the stairwell his painted grin became a threatening leer in her fright kris squeezed the dummys shoulder wrapping her fingers around the harsh fabric of his shirt this this is impossible she whispered he blinked again he giggled his mouth opened making his grin grow wider he tried to tug out of kriss grasp but she hung on without even realizing she was holding him but youre a dummy she squealed he giggled again so are you he replied his voice was a deep growl like the angry snarl of a large dog you cant walk kris cried her voice trembling the dummy giggled its ugly giggle again you cant be alive kris exclaimed let go of me now the dummy growled kris held on tightening her grip im dreaming kris told herself aloud i have to be dreaming im not a dream im a nightmare the dummy exclaimed and tossed back his wooden head laughing still gripping the shoulder of the shirt kris stared through the darkness at the grinning face the air seemed to grow heavy and hot she felt as if she couldnt breathe as if she were suffocating what was that sound it took her a while to recognize the strained gasps of her own breathing let go of me the dummy repeated or ill throw you down the stairs he tried once again to tug out of her grasp no kris insisted holding tight i im putting you back in the closet the dummy laughed then pushed his painted face close to kriss face you cant keep me there im locking you in im locking you in a box in something kris declared panic clouding her thoughts the darkness seemed to descend over her choking her weighing her down let go of me the dummy pulled hard kris reached out her other hand and grabbed him around the waist let go of me he snarled in his raspy deep rumble of a voice im in charge now you will listen to me this is my house now he pulled hard kris encircled his waist they both fell onto the stairs rolling down a few steps let go the dummy ordered he rolled on top of her his wild eyes glaring into hers she pushed him off tried to pin his arms behind his back he was surprisingly strong he pulled back one arm then shoved a fist hard into the pit of her stomach ohhh kris groaned feeling the breath knocked out of her the dummy took advantage of her momentary weakness and pulled free grasping the banister with one hand he tried to pull himself past her and down the stairs but kris shot out a foot and tripped him still struggling to breathe she pounced onto his back then she pulled him away from the banister and pushed him down hard onto a step oh kris gasped loudly as the overhead hall light flashed on she closed her eyes against the sudden harsh intrusion the dummy struggled to pull out from under her but she pushed down on his back with all her weight kris what on earth lindys startled voice called down from the top step its mr wood kris managed to cry up to her hes alive she pushed down hard sprawled over the dummy keeping him pinned beneath her kris what are you doing lindy demanded are you okay no kris exclaimed im not okay please lindy go get mom and dad mr wood hes alive its just a dummy lindy called down taking a few reluctant steps toward her sister get up kris have you lost your mind listen to me kris shrieked at the top of her lungs get mom and dad before he escapes but lindy didnt move she stared down at her sister her long hair falling in tangles about her face her features twisted in horror get up kris she urged please get up lets go back to bed im telling you hes alive kris cried desperately youve got to believe me lindy youve got to the dummy lay lifelessly beneath her his face buried in the carpet his arms and legs sprawled out to the sides you had a nightmare lindy insisted climbing down step by step holding her long nightshirt up above her ankles until she was standing right above kris come back to bed kris it was just a nightmare the horrible thing that happened at the concert it gave you a nightmare thats all gasping for breath kris lifted herself up and twisted her head to face her sister grabbing the banister with one hand she raised herself a little the instant she lightened up on him the dummy grabbed the edge of the stair with both hands and pulled himself out from under her halffalling halfcrawling he scrambled down the rest of the stairs no no i dont believe it lindy shrieked seeing the dummy move go get mom and dad kris said hurry her mouth wide open in shocked disbelief lindy turned and headed back up the stairs screaming for her parents kris dived off the step thrusting her arms in front of her she tackled mr wood from behind wrapping her arms around his waist his head hit the carpet hard as they both crumpled to the floor he uttered a low throaty cry of pain his eyes closed he didnt move dazed her chest heaving her entire body trembling kris slowly climbed to her feet she quickly pressed a foot on the dummys back to hold him in place mom and dad where are you she cried aloud hurry the dummy raised its head he let out an angry growl and started to thrash his arms and legs wildly kris pressed her foot hard against his back let go he growled viciously kris heard voices upstairs mom dad down here she called up to them both of her parents appeared at the upstairs landing their faces filled with worry look kris cried frantically pointing down to the dummy beneath her foot look at what mr powell cried adjusting his pajama top kris pointed down to the dummy under her foot he hes trying to get away she stammered but mr wood lay lifeless on his stomach is this supposed to be a joke mrs powell demanded angrily hands at the waist of her cotton nightgown i dont get it mr powell said shaking his head mr wood he ran down the stairs kris said frantically hes been doing everything he this isnt funny mrs powell said wearily running a hand back through her blonde hair it isnt funny at all kris waking everyone up in the middle of the night i really think youve lost your mind im very worried about you mr powell added i mean after what happened at school tonight listen to me kris shrieked she bent down and pulled mr wood up from the floor holding him by the shoulders she shook him hard he moves he runs he talks he hes alive she stopped shaking the dummy and let go he slumped lifelessly to the floor falling in an unmoving heap at her feet i think maybe you need to see a doctor mr powell said his face tightening with concern no i saw him too lindy said coming to kriss aid kris is right the dummy did move but then she added i mean i think it moved youre a big help lindy kris thought suddenly feeling weak drained is this just another stupid prank mrs powell asked angrily after what happened at school tonight id think that would be enough but mom kris started staring down at the lifeless heap at her feet back to bed mrs powell ordered theres no school tomorrow well have plenty of time to discuss punishments for you two me lindy cried outraged what did i do mom were telling the truth kris insisted i still dont get the joke mr powell said shaking his head he turned to his wife were we supposed to believe her or something get to bed both of you now their mother snapped she and their father disappeared from the upstairs landing heading angrily back down the hall to their room lindy remained one hand on the top of the banister staring down regretfully at kris you believe me dont you kris called up to her yeah i guess lindy replied doubtfully lowering her eyes to the dummy at kriss feet kris looked down too she saw mr wood blink he started to straighten up whoa she uttered an alarmed cry and grabbed him by the neck lindy hurry she called hes moving again whwhat should we do lindy stammered making her way hesitantly down the stairs i dont know kris replied as the dummy thrashed his arms and legs against the carpet trying desperately to free himself from her twohanded grip on his neck weve got to theres nothing you can do mr wood snarled you will be my slaves now im alive once again alive but how kris demanded staring at him in disbelief i mean youre a dummy how the dummy snickered you brought me back to life he told her in his raspy voice you read the ancient words the ancient words what was he talking about and then kris remembered she had read the strangesounding words from the sheet of paper in the dummys shirt pocket i am back thanks to you the dummy growled and now you and your sister will serve me as she stared in horror at the grinning dummy an idea popped into kriss mind the paper she had tucked it back into his pocket if i read the words again kris thought it will put him back to sleep she reached out and grabbed him he tried to jerk away but she was too quick the folded sheet of yellow paper was in her hand give me that he cried he swiped at it but kris swung it out of reach she unfolded it quickly and before the dummy could grab the paper out of her hands she read the strange words aloud karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano both sisters stared at the dummy waiting for him to collapse but he gripped the banister and tossed his head back in an amused scornful laugh those are the words of the ancient sorcerer to bring me to life he proclaimed those arent the words to kill me kill him yes kris thought frantically she tossed down the yellow paper disgustedly we have no choice we have to kill him lindy huh her sisters face filled with surprise kris grabbed the dummy by the shoulders and held on tightly ill hold him you pull his head off lindy was beside her now she had to duck away from mr woods thrashing feet ill hold him still kris repeated grab his head pull it off you youre sure lindy hesitated her features tight with fear just do it kris screamed she let her hands slide down around mr woods waist lindy grabbed his head in both hands let go of me the dummy rasped pull kris cried to her terrified sister holding the dummy tightly around the waist she leaned back pulling him away from her sister lindys hands were wrapped tightly around the dummys head with a loud groan she pulled hard the head didnt come off mr wood uttered a highpitched giggle stop youre tickling me he rasped pull harder kris ordered her sister lindys face was bright red she tightened her grip on the head and pulled again tugging with all her strength the dummy giggled his shrill unpleasant giggle it it wont come off lindy said sighing in defeat twist it off kris suggested frantically the dummy thrashed out with his feet kicking kris in the stomach but she held on twist the head off she cried lindy tried to turn the head the dummy giggled it wont twist lindy cried in frustration she let go of the head and took a step back mr wood raised his head stared up at lindy and grinned you cant kill me i have powers what do we do lindy cried raising her eyes to kris this is my house now the dummy rasped grinning at lindy as it struggled to wriggle out of kriss arms you will do as i say now put me down what do we do lindy repeated take him upstairs well cut his head off kris replied mr wood swung his head around his eyes stretched open in an evil glare ow kris cried out in surprise as the dummy snapped his jaws over her arm biting her she pulled her arm away and without thinking slapped the dummys wooden head with the palm of her hand the dummy giggled in response violence violence he said in a mock scolding tone get those sharp scissors in your drawer kris instructed her sister ill carry him up to our room her arm throbbed where he had bitten her but she held onto him tightly and carried him up to their bedroom lindy had already pulled the long metal scissors from the drawer her hand trembled as she opened and closed the blades below the neck kris said holding mr wood tightly by the shoulders he hissed furiously at her she dodged as he tried to kick her with both sneakered feet holding the scissors with two hands lindy tried cutting the head off at the neck the scissors didnt cut so she tried a sawing motion mr wood giggled i told you you cant kill me it isnt going to work lindy cried tears of frustration running down her cheeks now what well put him in the closet then we can think kris replied you have no need to think you are my slaves the dummy rasped you will do whatever i ask i will be in charge from now on no way kris muttered shaking her head what if we wont help you lindy demanded the dummy turned to her casting her a hard angry stare then ill start hurting the ones you love he said casually your parents your friends or maybe that disgusting dog thats always yapping at me he tossed back his head and a dry evil laugh escaped his wooden lips lock him in the closet lindy suggested till we figure out how to get rid of him you cant get rid of me mr wood insisted dont make me angry i have powers im warning you im starting to get tired of your stupid attempts to harm me the closet doesnt lock remember kris cried struggling to hold onto the wriggling dummy oh wait how about this lindy hurried to the closet she pulled out an old suitcase from the back perfect kris said im warning you mr wood threatened you are becoming very tiresome with a hard tug he pulled himself free of kris she dove to tackle him but he darted out from under her she fell facedown onto her bed the dummy ran to the center of the room then turned his eyes to the doorway as if trying to decide where to go you must do as i tell you he said darkly raising a wooden hand toward lindy i will not run from you two you are to be my slaves no kris cried pushing herself up she and her sister both dove at the dummy lindy grabbed his arms kris ducked to grab his ankles working together they stuffed him into the open suitcase you will regret this he threatened kicking his legs struggling to hit them you will pay dearly for this now someone will die he continued screaming after kris latched the suitcase and shoved it into the closet she quickly closed the closet door then leaned her back against it sighing wearily now what she asked lindy well bury him kris said huh lindy stifled a yawn they had been whispering together for what seemed like hours as they tried to come up with a plan they could hear the dummys muffled cries from inside the closet well bury him under that huge mound of dirt kris explained her eyes going to the window you know next door at the side of the new house yeah okay i dont know lindy replied im so tired i cant think straight she glanced at the bed table clock it was nearly threethirty in the morning i still think we should wake up mom and dad lindy said fear reflected in her eyes we cant kris told her weve been over that a hundred times they wont believe us if we wake them up well be in even bigger trouble how could we be in bigger trouble lindy demanded gesturing with her head to the closet where mr woods angry cries could still be heard get dressed kris said with renewed energy well bury him under all that dirt then well never have to think about him again lindy shuddered and turned her eyes to her dummy folded up in the chair i cant bear to look at slappy anymore im so sorry i got us interested in dummies ssshhh just get dressed kris said impatiently a few minutes later the two girls crept down the stairs in the darkness kris carried the suitcase in both arms trying to muffle the sound of mr woods angry protests they stopped at the bottom of the stairs and listened for any sign that they had awakened their parents silence lindy pulled open the front door and they slipped outside the air was surprisingly cool and wet a heavy dew had begun to fall making the front lawn glisten under the light of a halfmoon blades of wet grass clung to their sneakers as they made their way to the garage as kris held onto the suitcase lindy slowly quietly pulled open the garage door when it was halfway up she ducked and slipped inside a few seconds later she emerged carrying a large snow shovel this should do it she said whispering even though no one was around kris glanced down the street as they headed across the yard to the lot next door the heavy morning dew misted the glow of the streetlamps making the pale light appear to bend and flicker like candles everything seemed to shimmer under the dark purple sky kris set the suitcase down beside the tall mound of dirt well dig right down here she said pointing toward the bottom of the mound well shove him in and cover him im warning you mr wood threatened listening inside the suitcase your plan wont work i have powers you dig first kris told her sister ignoring the dummys threat then ill take a turn lindy dug into the pile and heaved up a shovelful of dirt kris shivered the heavy dew felt cold and damp a cloud floated over the moon darkening the sky from purple to black let me out mr wood called let me out now and your punishment wont be too severe dig faster kris whispered impatiently im going as fast as i can lindy replied she had dug a pretty goodsized squareshaped hole at the base of the mound how much deeper do you think deeper kris said here watch the suitcase ill take a turn she changed places with lindy and started to dig something scampered heavily near the low shrubs that separated the yards kris looked up saw a moving shadow and gasped raccoon i think lindy said with a shudder are we going to bury mr wood in the suitcase or are we going to take him out think mom will notice the suitcase is gone kris asked tossing a shovelful of wet dirt to the side lindy shook her head we never use it well bury him in the suitcase kris said itll be easier youll be sorry the dummy rasped the suitcase shook and nearly toppled onto its side im so sleepy lindy moaned tossing her socks onto the floor then sliding her feet under the covers im wide awake kris replied sitting on the edge of her bed i guess its because im so happy so happy we got rid of that awful creature its all so weird lindy said adjusting her pillow behind her head i dont blame mom or dad for not believing it im not sure i believe it either you put the shovel back where you found it kris asked lindy nodded yeah she said sleepily and you closed the garage door ssshhh im asleep lindy said at least theres no school tomorrow we can sleep late i hope i can fall asleep kris said doubtfully im just so pumped its all like some kind of hideously gross nightmare i just think lindy lindy are you still awake no her sister had fallen asleep kris stared up at the ceiling she pulled the blankets up to her chin she still felt chilled she couldnt shake the cold dampness of the early morning air after a short while with thoughts of everything that had happened that night whirring crazily in her head kris fell asleep too the rumble of machines woke her up at eightthirty the next morning stretching trying to rub the sleep from her eyes kris stumbled to the window leaned over the chair holding slappy and peered out it was a gray cloudy day two enormous yellow steamrollers were rolling over the lot next door behind the newly constructed house flattening the land i wonder if theyre going to flatten that big mound of dirt kris thought staring down at them that would really be excellent kris smiled she hadnt slept very long but she felt refreshed lindy was still sound asleep kris tiptoed past her pulled her robe on and headed downstairs morning mom she called brightly tying the belt to her robe as she entered the kitchen mrs powell turned from the sink to face her kris was surprised to see an angry expression on her face she followed her mothers stare to the breakfast counter oh kris gasped when she saw mr wood he was seated at the counter his hands in his lap his hair was matted with redbrown dirt and he had dirt smears on his cheeks and forehead kris raised her hands to her face in horror i thought you were told never to bring that thing down here mrs powell scolded what do i have to do kris she turned angrily back to the sink the dummy winked at kris and flashed her a wide evil grin as kris stared in horror at the grinning dummy mr powell suddenly appeared in the kitchen doorway ready he asked his wife mrs powell hung the dishtowel on the rack and turned around brushing a lock of hair off her forehead ready ill get my bag she brushed past him into the front hallway where are you going kris cried her voice revealing her alarm she kept her eyes on the dummy at the counter just doing a little shopping at the garden store her father told her stepping into the room peering out the kitchen window looks like rain dont go kris pleaded huh he turned toward her dont go please kris cried her fathers eyes landed on the dummy he walked over to him hey whats the big idea her father asked angrily i thought you wanted to take him back to the pawn shop kris replied thinking quickly not till monday her father replied today is saturday remember the dummy blinked mr powell didnt notice do you have to go shopping now kris asked in a tiny voice before her father could answer mrs powell reappeared in the doorway here catch she called and tossed the car keys to him lets go before it pours mr powell started to the door why dont you want us to go he asked the dummy kris started but she knew it was hopeless theyd never listen theyd never believe her never mind she muttered a few seconds later she heard their car back down the driveway they were gone and she was alone in the kitchen with the grinning dummy mr wood turned toward her slowly swiveling the tall counter stool his big eyes locked angrily on kriss i warned you he rasped barky came trotting into the kitchen his toenails clicking loudly on the linoleum he sniffed the floor as he ran searching for breakfast scraps someone might have dropped barky whereve you been kris asked glad to have company the dog ignored her and sniffed under the stool mr wood sat on he was upstairs waking me up lindy said rubbing her eyes as she walked into the kitchen she was wearing white tennis shorts and a sleeveless magenta tshirt stupid dog barky licked at a spot on the linoleum lindy cried out as she spotted mr wood oh no im back the dummy rasped and im very unhappy with you two slaves lindy turned to kris her mouth open in surprise and terror kris kept her eyes trained on the dummy what does he plan to do she wondered how can i stop him burying him under all that dirt hadnt kept him from returning somehow he had freed himself from the suitcase and pulled himself out wasnt there any way to defeat him any way at all grinning his evil grin mr wood dropped down to the floor his sneakers thudding hard on the floor im very unhappy with you two slaves he repeated in his growly voice what are you going to do lindy cried in a shrill frightened voice i have to punish you the dummy replied i have to prove to you that i am serious wait kris cried but the dummy moved quickly he reached down and grabbed barky by the neck with both hands as the dummy tightened his grip the frightened terrier began to howl in pain i warned you mr wood snarled over the howls of the little black terrier you will do as i say or one by one those you love will suffer no kris cried barky let out a highpitched whelp a bleat of pain that made kris shudder let go of barky kris screamed the dummy giggled barky uttered a hoarse gasp kris couldnt stand it any longer she and lindy leapt at the dummy from two sides lindy tackled his legs kris grabbed barky and tugged lindy dragged the dummy to the floor but his wooden hands held a tight grip on the dogs throat barkys howls became a muffled whimper as he struggled to breathe let go let go kris shrieked i warned you the dummy snarled as lindy held tight to his kicking legs the dog must die now no kris let go of the gasping dog she slid her hands down to the dummys wrists then with a fierce tug she pulled the wooden hands apart barley dropped to the floor wheezing he scampered to the corner his paws sliding frantically over the smooth floor youll pay now mr wood growled jerking free from kris he swung his wooden hand up landing a hard blow on kriss forehead she cried out in pain and raised her hands to her head she heard barley yipping loudly behind her let go of me mr wood demanded turning back to lindy who still held onto his legs no way lindy cried kris grab his arms again her head still throbbing kris lunged forward to grab the dummys arms but he lowered his head as she approached and clamped his wooden jaws around her wrist owww kris howled in pain and pulled back lindy lifted the dummy up by the legs then slammed his body hard against the floor he uttered a furious growl and tried to kick free of her kris lunged again and this time grabbed one arm then the other he lowered his head to bite once more but she dodged away and pulled his arms tight behind his back im warning you he bellowed im warning you barky yipped excitedly hopping up on kris what do we do with him lindy cried shouting over the dummys angry threats outside kris yelled pressing the arms more tightly behind mr woods back she suddenly remembered the two steamrollers she had seen moving over the yard next door flattening the ground come on she urged her sister well crush him im warning you i have powers the dummy screamed ignoring him kris pulled open the kitchen door and they carried their wriggling captive outside the sky was charcoalgray a light rain had begun to fall the grass was already wet over the low shrubs that separated the yards the girls could see the two enormous yellow steamrollers one in the back one at the side of the nextdoor lot they looked like huge lumbering animals their giant black rollers flattening everything in their path this way hurry kris shouted to her sister holding the dummy tightly as she ran toss him under that one let me go let me go slaves the dummy screamed this is your last chance he swung his head hard trying to bite kriss arm thunder rumbled low in the distance the girls ran at full speed slipping on the wet grass as they hurried toward the fastmoving steamroller they were just a few yards away from the enormous machine when they saw barky his tail wagging furiously he scampered ahead of them oh no howd he get out lindy cried gazing back at them his tongue hanging out of his mouth prancing happily in the wet grass the dog was running right into the path of the rumbling bulldozer no barky kris shrieked in horror no barky no letting go of mr wood both girls dove toward the dog hands outstretched they slid on their stomachs on the wet grass unaware of any problem enjoying the game of tag barky scampered away lindy and kris rolled out of the path of the steamroller hey get away from there the angry operator shouted through the high window of the steamroller are you girls crazy they leapt to their feet and turned back to mr wood the rain began to come down a little harder a jagged streak of white lightning flashed high in the sky im free the dummy cried hands raised victoriously above his head now you will pay get him kris shouted to her sister the rain pelted their hair and shoulders the two girls lowered their heads leaned into the rain and began to chase after the dummy mr wood turned and started to run he never saw the other steamroller the gigantic black wheel rolled right over him pushing him onto his back then crushing him with a loud crunch a loud hiss rose up from under the machine like air escaping from a large balloon the steamroller appeared to rock back and forth a strange green gas spurted up from beneath the wheel into the air spreading out in an eerie mushroomshaped cloud barley stopped scampering and stood frozen in place his eyes following the green gas as it floated up against the nearly black sky lindy and kris stared in open mouthed wonder pushed by the wind and the rain the green gas floated over them yuck it stinks lindy declared it smelled like rotten eggs barley uttered a low whimper the steamroller backed up the driver jumped out and came running toward them he was a short stocky man with big muscular arms bulging out from the sleeves of his tshirt his face was bright red under a short blond flattop his eyes wide with horror a kid he cried i i ran over a kid no he was a dummy kris told him he wasnt alive he stopped his face faded from red to flourwhite he uttered a loud grateful sigh oh man he moaned oh man i thought it was a kid he took a deep breath and let it out slowly then he bent to examine the area beneath his wheel as the girls came near they saw the remains of the dummy crushed flat inside its jeans and flannel shirt hey im real sorry the man said wiping his forehead with his tshirt sleeve as he straightened up to face them i couldnt stop in time thats okay kris said a wide smile forming on her face yeah really its okay lindy quickly agreed barky moved close to sniff the crushed dummy the man shook his head im so relieved it looked like it was running i really thought it was a kid i was so scared no just a dummy kris told him whew the man exhaled slowly close one his expression changed what are you girls doing out in the rain anyway lindy shrugged kris shook her head just walking the dog the man picked up the crushed dummy the head crumbled to powder as he lifted it you want this thing you can throw it in the trash kris told him better get out of the rain he told them and dont scare me like that again the girls apologized then headed back to the house kris cast a happy grin at her sister lindy grinned back i may grin forever kris thought im so happy so relieved they wiped their wet sneakers on the mat then held the kitchen door open for barky wow what a morning lindy declared they followed the dog into the kitchen outside a flash of bright lightning was followed by a roar of thunder im drenched kris said im going up to get changed me too lindy followed her up the stairs they entered their bedroom to find the window wide open the curtains slapping wildly rain pouring in oh no kris hurried across the room to shut the window as she leaned over the chair to grab the window frame slappy reached up and grabbed her arm hey slave is that other guy gone the dummy asked in a throaty growl i thought hed never leave
