empire part between thy sons that shall be emperors and every one commander of a world zenocrate sweet tamburlaine when wilt thou leave these arms and save thy sacred person free from scathe and dangerous chances of the wrathful war tamburlaine when heaven shall cease to move on both the poles and when the ground whereon my soldiers march shall rise aloft and touch the horned moon and not before my sweet zenocrate sit up and rest thee like a lovely queen so now she sits in pomp and majesty when these my sons more precious in mine eyes than all the wealthy kingdoms i subdud placd by her side look on their mothers face but yet methinks their looks are amorous not martial as the sons of tamburlaine water and air being symbolizd in one argue their want of courage and of wit their hair as white as milk and soft as down which should be like the quills of porcupines as black as jet and hard as iron or steel bewrays they are too dainty for the wars their fingers made to quaver on a lute their arms to hang about a ladys neck their legs to dance and caper in the air would make me think them bastards not my sons but that i know they issud from thy womb that never lookd on man but tamburlaine zenocrate my gracious lord they have their mothers looks but when they list their conquering fathers heart this lovely boy the youngest of the three not long ago bestrid a scythian steed trotting the ring and tilting at a glove which when he tainted with his slender rod he reind him straight and made him so curvet as i cried out for fear he should have faln tamburlaine well done my boy thou shalt have shield and lance armour of proof horse helm and curtleaxe and i will teach thee how to charge thy foe and harmless run among the deadly pikes if thou wilt love the wars and follow

be termd the scourge and terror of the world tamburlaine be all a scourge and terror to the world or else you are not sons of tamburlaine calyphas but while my brothers follow arms my lord let me accompany my gracious mother they are enough to conquer all the world and you have won enough for me to keep tamburlaine bastardly boy sprung from some cowards loins and not the issue of great tamburlaine of all the provinces i have subdud thou shalt not have a foot unless thou bear a mind courageous and invincible for he shall wear the crown of persia whose head hath deepest scars whose breast most wounds which being wroth sends lightning from his eyes and in the furrows of his frowning brows harbours revenge war death and cruelty for in a field whose superficies is coverd with a liquid purple veil and sprinkled with the brains of slaughterd men my royal chair of state shall be advancd and he that means to place himself therein must armed wade up to the chin in blood zenocrate my lord such speeches to our princely sons dismay their minds before they come to prove the wounding troubles angry war affords celebinus no madam these are speeches fit for us for if his chair were in a sea of blood i would prepare a ship and sail to it ere i would lose the title of a king amyras and i would strive to swim through pools of blood or make a bridge of murderd carcasses whose arches should be framd with bones of turks ere i would lose the title of a king tamburlaine well lovely boys ye shall be emperors both stretching your conquering arms from east to west and sirrah if you mean to wear a crown when we shall meet the turkish deputy and all his viceroys snatch it from his head and cleave his pericranion with thy sword calyphas if any man will hold him i will strike and cleave

castles on the shore tamburlaine well said argier receive thy crown again enter usumcasane and techelles kings of morocco and of fez welcome usumcasane magnificent and peerless tamburlaine i and my

unpeopled for thy sake tamburlaine thanks king of fez take here thy crown again your presence loving friends and fellowkings makes me to surfeit in conceiving joy if all the crystal gates of joves high court were opend wide and i might enter in to see the state and majesty of heaven it could not more delight me than your sight now will we banquet on these plains a while and after march to turkey with our camp in number more than are the drops that fall when boreas rents a thousand swelling clouds and proud orcanes of natolia with all his viceroys shall be so afraid that though the stones as at deucalions flood were turnd to men he should be overcome such lavish will i make of turkish blood that jove shall send his winged messenger to bid me sheathe my sword and leave the field the sun unable to sustain the sight shall hide his head in thetis watery lap and leave his steeds to fair bootes charge for half the world shall perish in this fight but now my friends let me examine ye how have ye spent your absent time from me usumcasane my lord our men of barbary have marchd four hundred miles with armour on their backs and lain in leaguer fifteen months and more for since we left you at the soldans court we have subdud the southern guallatia and all the land unto the coast of spain we kept the narrow strait of jubalter and made canaria call us kings and lords yet never did they recreate themselves or cease one day from war and hot alarms and therefore let them rest a while my lord tamburlaine they shall casane and tis time ifaith techelles and i have marchd along the river nile to machda where the mighty christian priest calld john the great sits in a milkwhite robe whose triple mitre i did take by force and made him swear obedience to my crown from thence unto cazates did i march where amazonians met me in the field with whom being women i vouchsafd a league and with my power did march to zanzibar the western part of afric where i viewd the ethiopian sea rivers and lakes but neither man nor child in all the land therefore i took my course to manico where unresisted i removd my camp and by the coast of byather at last i came to cubar where the negroes dwell and conquering that made haste to nubia there having sackd borno the kingly seat i took the king and led him bound in chains unto damascus where i stayd before tamburlaine well done techelles what saith theridamas theridamas i left the confines and the bounds of afric and made a voyage into europe where by the river tyras i subdud stoka podolia and codemia then crossd the sea and came to oblia and nigra silva where the devils dance which in despite of them i set on fire from thence i crossd the gulf calld by the name mare majore of the inhabitants yet shall my soldiers make no period until natolia kneel before your feet tamburlaine then will we triumph banquet and carouse cooks shall have pensions to provide us cates and glut us with the dainties of the world lachryma christi and calabrian wines shall common soldiers drink in quaffing bowls ay liquid gold when we have conquerd him mingled with coral and with orient pearl come let us banquet and carouse the whiles exeunt act ii scene i enter sigismund frederick and baldwin with their train sigismund now say my lords of buda and bohemia what motion is it that inflames your thoughts and stirs your valours to such sudden arms frederick your majesty remembers i am sure what cruel slaughter of our christian bloods these heathenish turks and pagans lately made betwixt the city zula and danubius how through the midst of varna and bulgaria and almost to the very walls of rome they have not long since massacred our camp it resteth now then that your majesty take all advantages of time and power and work revenge upon these infidels your highness knows for tamburlaines repair that strikes a terror to all turkish hearts natolia hath dismissd the greatest part of all his army pitchd against our power betwixt cutheia and orminius mount and sent them marching up to belgasar acantha antioch and caesarea to aid the kings of soria and jerusalem now then my lord advantage take thereof and issue suddenly upon the rest that in the fortune of their overthrow we may discourage all the pagan troop that dare attempt to war with christians sigismund but calls not then your grace to memory the league we lately made with king orcanes confirmd by oath and articles of peace and calling christ for record of our truths this should be treachery and violence against the grace of our profession baldwin no whit my lord for with such infidels in whom no faith nor true religion rests we are not bound to those accomplishments the holy laws of christendom enjoin but as the faith which they profanely plight is not by necessary policy to be esteemd assurance for ourselves so that we vow to them should not infringe our liberty of arms and victory sigismund though i confess the oaths they undertake breed little strength to our security yet those infirmities that thus defame their faiths their honours and religion should not give us presumption to the like our faiths are sound and must be consummate religious righteous and inviolate frederick assure your grace tis superstition to stand so strictly on dispensive faith and should we lose the opportunity that god hath given to venge our christians death and scourge their foul blasphemous paganism as fell to saul to balaam and the rest that would not kill and curse at gods command so surely will the vengeance of the highest and jealous anger of his fearful arm be pourd with rigour on our sinful heads if we neglect this offerd victory sigismund then arm my lords and issue suddenly giving commandment to our general host with expedition to assail the pagan and take the victory our god hath given exeunt scene ii enter orcanes gazellus and uribassa with their train orcanes gazellus uribassa and the rest now will we march from proud

his martial tools makes earthquakes in the hearts of men and heaven gazellus and now come we to make his sinews shake with greater power than erst his pride hath felt an hundred kings by scores will bid him arms and hundred thousands subjects to each score which if a shower of wounding thunderbolts should break out of the bowels of the clouds and fall as thick as hail upon our heads in partial aid of that proud scythian yet should our courages and steeled crests and numbers more than infinite of men be able to withstand and conquer him uribassa methinks i see how glad the christian king is made for joy of our admitted truce that could not but before be terrified with unacquainted power of our host enter a messenger messenger arm dread sovereign and my noble lords the treacherous army of

so little for their prophet christ orcanes can there be such deceit in christians or treason in the fleshly heart of man whose shape is figure of the highest god then if there be a christ as christians say but in their deeds deny him for their christ if he be son to everliving jove and hath the power of his outstretched arm if he be jealous of his name and honour as is our holy prophet

shall breathe through shady leaves of every senseless tree murmurs and hisses for his heinous sin now scalds his soul in the tartarian streams and feeds upon the baneful tree of hell that zoacum that fruit of bitterness that in the midst of fire is ingraffd yet flourisheth as flora in her pride with apples like the heads of damned fiends the devils there in chains of quenchless flame shall lead

the inhabitants over my zenith hang a blazing star that may endure till heaven be dissolvd fed with the fresh supply of earthly dregs threatening a dearth and famine to this land flying dragons lightning fearful thunderclaps singe these fair plains and make them seem as black as is the island where the furies mask compassd with lethe styx and phlegethon because my dear zenocrate is dead calyphas this pillar placd in memory of her where in arabian hebrew greek is writ this town being burnt by tamburlaine the great forbids the world to build it up again amyras and here this mournful streamer shall be placd wrought with the persian and th egyptian arms to signify she was a princess born and wife unto the monarch of the east celebinus and here this table as a register of all her virtues and perfections tamburlaine and here the picture of zenocrate to shew her beauty which the world admird sweet picture of divine zenocrate that hanging here will draw the gods from heaven and

beautify larissaplains but keep within the circle of mine arms at every town and castle i besiege thou shalt be set upon my royal tent and when i meet an army in the field those looks will shed such

hunger and thirst right adjuncts of the war and after this to scale a castlewall besiege a fort to undermine a town and make whole cities caper in the air then next the way to fortify your men in champion grounds what figure serves you best for which the quinqueangle form is meet because the corners there may fall more flat whereas the fort may fittest be assaild and sharpest where th assault is desperate the ditches must be deep the counterscarps narrow and steep the walls made high and broad the bulwarks and the rampires large and strong with cavalieros and thick counterforts and room within to lodge six thousand men it must have privy ditches countermines and secret issuings to defend the ditch it must have high argins and coverd ways to keep the bulwarkfronts from battery and parapets to hide the musketeers casemates to place the great artillery and store of ordnance that from every flank may scour the outward curtains of the fort dismount the cannon of the adverse part murder the foe and save the walls from breach when this is learnd for service on the land by plain and easy demonstration ill teach you how to make the water mount that you may dryfoot march through lakes and pools deep rivers havens creeks and little seas and make a fortress in the raging waves fencd with the concave of a monstrous rock invincible by nature of the place when this is done then

first physician pleaseth your majesty to drink this potion which will abate the fury of your fit and cause some milder spirits govern you tamburlaine tell me what think you of my sickness now first physician i viewd your urine and the hypostasis thick and obscure doth make your danger great your veins are full of accidental heat whereby the moisture of your blood is dried the humidum and calor which some hold is not a parcel of the elements but of a substance more divine and pure is almost clean extinguished and spent which being the cause of life imports your death besides my lord this day is critical dangerous to those whose crisis is as yours your artiers which alongst the veins convey the lively spirits which the heart engenders are parchd and void of spirit that the soul wanting those organons by which it moves cannot endure by argument of art yet if your majesty may escape this day no doubt but you shall soon recover all tamburlaine then will i comfort all my vital parts and live in spite of death above a day alarms within enter a messenger messenger my lord young callapine that lately fled from your majesty hath now gathered a fresh army and hearing your absence in the field offers to set upon us presently tamburlaine see my physicians now how jove hath sent a present medicine to recure my pain my looks shall make them fly and might i follow there should not one of all the villains power live to give offer of another fight usumcasane i joy my lord your highness is so strong that can endure so well your royal presence which only will dismay the enemy tamburlaine i know it will casane draw you slaves in spite of death i will go shew my face alarms exit tamburlaine with all the rest except the physicians and reenter presently tamburlaine thus are the villain cowards fled for fear like summers vapours vanishd by the sun and could i but a while pursue the field that callapine should be my slave again but i perceive my martial strength is spent in vain i strive and rail against those powers that mean t invest me in a higher throne as much too high for this disdainful earth give me a map then let me see how much is left for me to conquer all the world that these my boys may finish all my wants one brings a map here i began to march towards persia along armenia and the caspian sea and thence unto bithynia where i took the turk and his great empress prisoners then marchd i into egypt and arabia and here not far from alexandria whereas the terrene and the red sea meet being distant less than full a hundred leagues i meant to cut a channel to them both that men might quickly sail to india from thence to nubia near bornolake and so along the aethiopian sea cutting the tropic line of capricorn i conquerd all as far as zanzibar then by the northern part of africa i came at last to graecia and from thence to asia where i stay against my will which is from scythia where i first began backwards and forwards near five thousand leagues look here my boys see what a world of ground lies westward from the midst of cancers line unto the rising of this earthly globe whereas the sun declining from our sight begins the day with our antipodes and shall i die and this unconquered lo here my sons are all the golden mines inestimable drugs and precious stones more worth than asia and the world beside and from th antarctic pole eastward behold as much more land which never was descried wherein are rocks of pearl that shine as bright as all the lamps that beautify the sky and shall i die and this unconquered here lovely boys what death forbids my life that let your lives command in spite of death amyras alas my lord how should our bleeding hearts wounded and broken with your highness grief retain a thought of joy or spark of life your soul gives essence to our wretched subjects whose matter is incorporate in your flesh celebinus your pains do pierce our souls no hope survives for by your life we entertain our lives tamburlaine but sons this subject not of force enough to hold the fiery spirit it contains must part imparting his impressions by equal portions into both your breasts my flesh divided in your precious shapes shall still retain my spirit though i die and live in all your seeds immortally then now remove me that i may resign my place and proper title to my son first take my scourge and my imperial crown and mount my royal chariot of estate that i may see thee crownd before i die help me my lords to make my last remove they assist tamburlaine to descend from the chariot theridamas a woful change my lord

breath of life and burden of my soul if not resolvd into resolved pains my bodys mortified lineaments should exercise the motions of my heart piercd with the joy of any dignity o father if the unrelenting ears of death and hell be shut against my prayers and that the spiteful influence of heaven deny my soul fruition of her joy how should i step or stir my hateful feet against the inward powers of my heart leading a life that only strives to die and plead in vain unpleasing sovereignty tamburlaine let not thy love exceed thine honour son nor bar thy mind that magnanimity that nobly must admit necessity sit up my boy and with these silken reins bridle the steeled stomachs of these jades theridamas my lord you must obey his majesty since fate commands and proud necessity amyras heavens witness me with what a broken heart mounting the chariot and damned spirit i ascend this seat and send my soul before my father die his anguish and his burning agony they crown amyras tamburlaine now fetch the hearse of fair zenocrate let it be placd by this my fatal chair and serve as parcel of my funeral usumcasane then feels your majesty no sovereign ease nor may our hearts all drownd in tears of blood joy any hope of your recovery tamburlaine casane no the monarch of the earth and eyeless monster that torments my soul cannot behold the tears ye shed for me and therefore still augments his cruelty techelles then let some god oppose his holy power against the wrath and tyranny of death that his tearthirsty and unquenched hate may be upon himself reverberate they bring in the hearse of zenocrate tamburlaine now eyes enjoy your latest benefit and when my soul hath virtue of your sight pierce through the coffin and the sheet of gold and glut your longings with a heaven of joy so reign my son scourge and control those slaves guiding thy chariot with thy fathers hand as precious is the charge thou undertakst as that which clymenes brainsick son did guide when wandering phoebes ivory cheeks were scorchd and all the earth like aetna breathing fire be warnd by him then learn with awful eye to sway a throne as dangerous as his for if thy body thrive not full of thoughts as pure and fiery as phyteus beams the nature of these proud rebelling jades will take occasion by the slenderest hair and draw thee piecemeal like hippolytus through rocks more steep and sharp than caspian cliffs the nature of thy chariot will not bear a guide of baser temper than myself more than heavens coach the pride of phaeton farewell my boys my dearest friends farewell my body feels my soul doth weep to see your sweet desires deprivd my company for tamburlaine the scourge of god must die dies amyras meet heaven and earth and here let all things end for earth hath spent the
