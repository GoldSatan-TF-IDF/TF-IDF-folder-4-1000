chapter ghost quest ivy was restricted for no reason at all to castle roogna and of course it was overwhelmingly boring her mother irene had recently gotten quite fat in the tummy but kept right on eating and pretending it was wonderful and didnt seem to have much time for ivy any more to make things worse her father king dor had ordered a baby brother for her ivy did not need or want a baby brother how could they have been so thoughtless as to order something like that without consulting the one most concerned what good was a baby anywayespecially a boy but now the infernal thing had arrived and irene had evidently celebrated by using a thinning spell because she was suddenly back to normal weight but she still had next to no time for ivy to heck and damation with all cabbage leaves even drear mundania she decided could not be worse than this for a time she played with the items sent by her pun pal rapunzel who had very long hair and was similarly confined to her castle ivy was still too young to read and write so they exchanged small objects and that usually worked well enough but there was only so much a person could do with puncils and hotcross puns and ivy soon tired of them she found herself watching the magic tapestry in her room for hours on end and more hours sidewise the idiot cloth had become her amusement of last resort its moving pictures showed everything that had ever happened in the land of xanth but the pictures were fuzzy and she wasnt much interested in history anyway it was so much crewel lye more fun in the jungle playing with clouds and tanglers and gourds as the tapestry played over a sequence several hundred years in the past ivy became aware of company one of the castle ghosts was in the room in fact it was watching the tapestry ghosts did not bother ivy of course in fact it tended to be the other way around ghosts avoided her because trouble seemed to follow only half a footstep behind her and the haunts of castle roogna like others of their kind were basically settled creatures so the presence of this one surprised ivy yet hardly alarmed her she peered at it but the outlines were fuzzy and she could not make out which one it was so she asked who are you jordan the ghost replied faintly it was hard for ghosts to speak with any volume because their volume was mostly vapor but they could do it when they con centrated oh yes jordan was the one who had helped mare imbri save castle roogna from the horseman oodles of time ago before she arrived on the scene what are you doing watching my history the ghost became clearer as she concentrated on it shifting from amorphous cloud shape to humped sheet shape which was an improve ment ivy suffered a flicker of interest your history thats xanth history silly i lived in xanth four hundred years ago jordan said becoming a vague human form was it as dull as it is now no it was exciting the ghost said with greater an imation than before it was a terrific adventurei think you think ivy wanted to nail this down because if there was anything interesting in castle roogna she wanted to find it well died from it oh im about to die from boredom ivy asserted oh no jordan protested youre a sorceress you will grow up to be king of xanth crewel lye this was nothing new but ivys interest increased now jordan was a fully formed man partly white partly translucent fairly large young and handsome a white lock of hair fell down partway over his right eye which was also white most ghosts were white ivy wasnt sure why how did you die jordan shook his head i cant quite seem to remem ber ive been dead a long time but thats easy to remember ivy exclaimed dying is a big deal like getting born do you remember getting born of course not animals get born was found under a cabbage leaf i should have kicked over the cabbage behind me because now theyve found dolph under it and theyre making him my baby brother she pouted as the memory rankled if id been smart id have sneaked out at night and thrown all the cabbages into the moat before dolph arrived its probably all his fault im grounded yes boys are a lot of trouble the ghost agreed almost as much trouble as girls what the ghost drifted away from her realizing that he had said something provocative and unwarranted everybody knew that boys were much worse than girls but ivy de cided to forgive him his transgression because even ghostly company was better than none tell me the ad venture of your life well i dont quite remember that either i know it was exciting and that there were monsters and magicians and swords and sorcery and beautiful women but the details have fogged out then how do you know your life is playing on the tapestry now ivy asked alertly i recognize bits of my life when i see them played fighting a dragon kissing a womanit begins to come back i know i was there fighting a dragon ivy asked not the gap dragon i think i avoided that one jordan said its alive today isnt it so i couldnt have slain it crewel lye good because the gap dragon had become ivys friend she didnt want anything bad to have happened to him even four hundred years ago the gap was now being patrolled by stacey steamer the female of his kind eventually stanley would grow up and return to the gap but that was long ago in the future and she didnt worry about it whod you kiss the ghost concentrated several beautiful women i think but the last was most there was a cruel lie and i died so i hate her but i found a better woman after i died so maybe its all right after all this was getting downright fascinating how can you find a woman after youre dead a dead woman naturally a ghost like me ivy had always known the ghosts of castle roogna but hadnt thought to question them about their lives what happened to her shes still here of course shes renee oh renee i hear her singing sometimes faint sad songs yes she is often sad but shes a wonderful person if i were alive again id marry her silly ghosts cant live again ivy chided him what about millie millie the ghost had been a resident of castle roogna for eight centuries until restored to life she had married the zombie master and now had twin teenaged children hiatus and lacuna who on occasion babysat for ivy that was prehistoric ivy said shortly back when good magician humfrey was still practicing as an old man he helped bring her back to life everybody knows that but magician humfrey isnt animating ghosts any more and nobody else knows how how can you live again well my talent is healing jordan said so if my bones were found and brought together maybe where are your bones ive forgotten if i ever knew the ghost confessed abashed crewel lye so jordan represented a mystery ivy was now fully intrigued this cruel liewhat was it jordan spread his hands i dont remember that ei ther i thought if i watched it replayed on the tapestry maybe why not ivy agreed they focused on the tapestry it showed a towering wall of rock the face of an almost vertical cliff down this cliff a huge snail was crawling and a man clung to the snails shell oh yes the snail jordan said thats me riding it ivy had never thought of snailriding but of course she had never encountered a snail big enough where are you going i dont remember but it was somewhere i had to get to why are you riding it instead of walking there your self that snails pretty slow i dont remember that either but i think i had no choice maybe if we could see more detail they peered closely and the picture enhanced itself somewhat as things did when ivy paid attention to them they made out a shadow as of some monstrous bird but they could not tell where the cliff was or how extensive the progress of the giant snail was tediously slow it was evident they would have to wait for an hour to see sig nificant progress that was the problem with the tapestry it ran scenes through at regular speed it was possible to reset it but that tended to jump the picture to some quite different scene and the original one could be lost for days so it was necessary simply to let it play through at its own rate if a person wanted to see how a particular scene ended this was no good for a bored child but ivys curiosity once fairly aroused did not accept denial we must find out she declared i want to know all about that snailand your life and especially about the cruel lie she put her hands on her hips in the manner her mother did to show the severity of her resolve im sure i could remember if the pictures were clearer jordan said crewel lye ivy contemplated the tapestry its gotten sort of grubby over the centuries she said and i guess my using it to wipe off my hands before dinner doesnt help much either adults always had these pointless rules about clean hands for eating so ivy knew it really wasnt her fault but now she wished she had wiped her hands somewhere else maybe if we can clean it off it will have better pictures they tried ivy fetched a bucket and water but found she couldnt scrub the tapestry clean the pictures were permanently dull even when wet we need something better to clean it she said frustrated they tested everything they could think of but nothing helped ivy was getting dangerously close to annoyance which was another mood she had inherited from her mother but she was determined to find a way good magician humfrey would know cept hes pretty young now she said still hes probably better than nothing but how was she to get to the good magicians castle when she wasnt allowed out of castle roogna certainly her folks wouldnt take her there right now not when they were so confoundedly absorbed with the idiotic new baby but she just couldnt wait till she was ungrounded that would be forever or three more days whichever was longer fortunately jordan had a notion theres an old night mare shoe in the cellar he said with that you could get in and out of the gourd ivy clapped her hands delighted the gourd had turned out to be a pretty interesting place but the problem of getting out of it made her cautious she hadnt realized that it was the horse shoes that enabled the night mares to do it but of course that made sense one of the mares must have lost a shoe when trying to flee an awakening sleeper because night mares were never supposed to be seen by awake folk show me jordan guided her down to the cellar crevice where the shoe lay and ivy pulled it out the thing was made of old rusty metal and was bent in the shape of a u no crewel lye wonder the mare had left it behind ooo ick ivy ex claimed shaking the gook off it how does it work you have to go into a gourd jordan said then you travel through the gourd world until you come to one thats near your destination and i know that dummy i mean how do i get the mare shoe should make the rind pervious so wheres a gourd ivy was edgy and impatient be cause she was getting nervous about this business so she was rushing things before she could make the mistake of thinking about the matter sensibly theres one growing at the castle wall jordan said its not supposed to be there but its hidden so no living person has spotted it yet take me to it ivy ordered she had to go somewhere fast for her knees were threatening to knock the gourd world was after all the place of bad dreams and she suspected there were more hideous things in there than the night mares ever let ordinary people see jordan took her to it it was just outside a large crevice at ground level she reached through caught hold of the vine and hauled the gourd in but dont look at the peephole the ghost warned i know ivy had learned about peepholes recently it seemed her mother had been perturbed to learn that grandpa trent had been into one and somehow had thought it was ivys fault possibly the grounding had something to do with that now how does she ex tended the bent shoe toward the gourd wait jordan cautioned in the manner adults had i think you need a map to the shoe touched the surface of the gourdand sank in ivy expecting resistance lost her balance and fell forward her arm passed in and the rest of her did too though the gourd was much smaller than she was sud denly she was inside and falling she started to scream but before she could work it up properly she landed on something soft it was a huge marshmallow so she filed the scream away for later ref crewel lye erence got up and looked about this wasnt nearly as bad as she had feared she was in a candy garden lollipops grew from the ground and the weeds were licorice she started to pick a pop then hesitated she was inside the gourd if she ate anything would she be able to leave she wasnt sure the gourd had funny rules so she exerted supreme control well beyond the call of littlegirl duty and left the candy alone she had a feeling she would regret this the rest of her life but she couldnt take the chance the night mares traveled through xanth by going in one gourd and out another there was always a gourd close by a sleeper who needed a bad dream she had gone in at castle roogna she needed to come out at the good magicians castle but where was it jordan was right she needed a mapand she didnt have one well she would just have to find her own way she walked down the hard chocolate path past all the deliciouslooking and smelling confections her mouth watering painfully until she came to a house made of wood she knocked on the door but there was no answer except a faint chittering so she turned the knob opened the door and stepped inside the door swung closed behind her suddenly the chit tering became loud things rustled over her feet as her eyes adjusted to the interior gloom she discovered that the room was filled with insects ooo ugh she ex claimed with girlish distaste this is a bughouse indeed it was bugs of every description crawled on the floor the walls the ceiling and the door behind her others fluttered in the air one bugeyed monster buzzed up to her waving its purple antennae ivy used the scream she had saved she tried to use the mare shoe to fend off the bug but the shoe missed and struck the wall instead shoe and hand sank through the wall and ivy stumbled after stepping through as a ghost might she blinked in bright sunlight she stood on a beach just outside a gourd across the water she saw a large island and near the island was a raft with a centaur stand crewet lye ing on it that must be centaur isle down at the south of xanth she had come a long way but that wasnt where she was going so she nerved herself and touched the mare shoe to the gourd she was getting the hang of this she fell right into the bughouse again hastily she opened the door and plunged outside she remained in the gourd since she hadnt used the shoe this time but now the garden was not candy it had changed radically for the worse awful spinach grew all about along with turnips and radishes and onions and other terrible stuff the kind that existed only to nauseate children at mealtimes there were evenhorrorscab bages she held her nose and hurried along the garden path until it came to a lake of placid brownish fluid what could this be surely not anything worse than mashed squash she touched her finger to it and tasted a drop her curiosity leading her unerringly into mischief instantly she spat it out this was the worst yet it was castor oilthe stuff used to lubricate rolling castors the bane of all children she looked about how could she get out of the gourd for another peek at reallife xanth she might be close to humfreys castle and didnt want to pass it by but with no walls to touch then she had a notion carefully she touched the mare shoe to the surface of the stinking oil lake it sank through drawing her along with it she held her nose and her breath closed her eyes tightly and passed painlessly through the surface to come to rest on firm ground she opened her eyes and found herself standing in front of a gourd in sight of the good magicians castle she had nerved herself to take the most obnoxious route which naturally was the proper one and she was there well almost there was the little matter of getting in she was standing outside the moat there was no draw bridge and the walls looked most forbidding first she had to cross the moat she looked around under a spreading tree she found several small stones stepping stones she exclaimed recognizing the type crewei lye she picked them up but they were hard to hold all together so she reached for a big green leaf to wrap them in but o it was not a leaf it was the wing of a giant luna moth the creature was motionless and just dangled when she picked it up she realized reluctantly that it was dead a tear squeezed from her eye she hated to see pretty things die she found some blanket moss set the stones moth and mare shoe on it and carefully drew up the corners of the blanket so she could carry it as a bundle she saw herself as a fairly resourceful child so of course she was then she walked to the moat held the bundle in one arm and used her free hand to cast the first stone the steppfng stone plopped onto the surface hobbled expanded somewhat and settled firmly the top of it just above the water she tossed a second one a little farther out and it settled similarly on the surface when she had a somewhat irregular line of severalfor stepping stones never settled regularly no matter how accurately they were placedshe stepped carefully on the first it gave slightly but supported her weight that was after all its nature enhanced by her talent incorrectly placed a step ping stone could become a stumbling block but she had set these down properly she stepped on the second and the third then tossed out a couple more this was nervous business especially when she stepped across deep water but she had enough stones and she made it all the way across with one to spare that was excellent management if she did say so herself now she was on a narrow bank between the moat and the castle wall on one side the bank narrowed until there was no space between the wall and the water so she couldnt go there on the other side it curved around the castle she was sure there was a door somewhere so she started walking she passed an alcove that was absolutely dark no light penetrated its depths at all that was interesting but not very she moved on then she rounded a corner and en countered bunding brightness she shaded her tender eyes crewel lye but the light squeezed through the crevices between her fingers and pierced her eyelids anyway it was just too bright she retreated around the comer and the day returned to normal with only a dull red spot that played tag with her peripheral vision how could she pass that region if the door she wanted was there she would be unable to see it she might even blunder into the moat and get her feet all wet that would be awkward to explain to her mother irene might have no time for ivy when ivy wanted attention but she would appear like magic the moment those little feet and shoes got wet that was the way mothers were also ivy wasnt sure just how fast her sight might recover after too great an exposure to that light how awful it would be to be blind if she came home blind they would feed her nothing butscreaming horrors carrots because they had a magic yellow ingredient that was good for vision there was no question about it she had to find a different way come on ivy she chided herself youre smart enough to figure out how to get through a little light whereupon she became smart enough confidence was wonderful stuff especially when abetted by magic ivy returned to the dark alcove and reached inside sure enough there was a dark lantern she brought it out and its darkness spread all around her converting day to night fortunately she was able to see a little dim light ahead around the comer and she headed for that as she rounded the comer the effulgence surrounded herand was met by the darkness radiating from the dark lamp the two struggled and canceled out and an ap proximation of normal daylight returned a small globe of darkness remained about the lantern itself into which her arm disappeared while the bright lantern remained too bright to gaze upon but in between were the shades ranging from night to day if ivy had been of a more philosophical bent she might have realized that life itself was like that with the impossible extremes of good and bad at either side and many gradients between through which normal folk navigated with indifferent success but crewel lye crewel lye she was as yet too young for such a thought so she shoved it aside and proceeded through the shades of gray until she rounded another corner then the dark lamp became too dark blotting out everything she set it in an empty alcove and went on but a new threat materialized a small winged cat screeched and circled above her when she tried to take a step the cat circled lower claws extended this was too little to be a catbird it was a kittyhawk and it would not let her pass she looked in her blanket bag where there was one stone the dead moth and the mare shoe she might throw the stone at the creature but she doubted she could score the throwing arm of a fiveyearold girl wasnt strong so she left that stone unturned she needed another way as she pondered the kittyhawk circled lower ivy was right at the edge of its attack range and the creature hes itated probably it didnt want to get too close to the brilliance around the corner as that would blind the kitty hawk as readily as it blinded her so this was a safe place to pause ivy watched the creature noting the separate com ponents of its body the hawkwings were of the bird kingdom with brown feathers and there was a feathered tail to match the head and legs were of the cat kingdom with white teeth and claws she wondered which kingdom was dominant did the creature lay eggs or give live birth animals had more direct and crude ways of reproducing themselves than people did maybe cabbages didnt grow for animals she blushed to be thinking such naughty thoughts but still she was curious she knew that some creatures birthed and others hatched or maybe it was the other way around and people arrived under cabbage leaves and then there was the matter of the storks ivy frowned because that reminded her of baby brother dolph again too bad the stork hadnt brought him be cause then there would have been a chance of dropping the bundle into a nest of cockatrices or maybe onto a badtempered needlecactus she could almost see the needles flying out striking the littlecockatrices who nat urally glared balefully about turning everything around them to sludge or was it stone anyway the little bird brained lizards were getting stabbed by flying stone needles and it served them right ivy caught a flicker of something just off the edge of her vision it looked like a swishing horses tail the day mare imbri had brought her the nice violent daydream but now the mare had to gallop off to her next delivery there was a yowl ivy looked up the kittyhawk had come quite close to her and was having some kind of problem the parts of it had intensified the cathead and feet becoming more feline and the birdwings and tail more avian now they were fighting for dominance the head was reaching around to bite at the wings and the wings were pounding on the head ivy watched closely so of course the intensification of separate qualities continued the fight got worse feathers and tufts of fur flew out finally the kittyhawk spun out of control crashed into the moat and was gone this was one experiment of nature that didnt seem to have worked out the sharpening of its facets as it had approached ivy and her violent daydream had caused the creature to fragment and destroy itself ivy walked on glad to be past the kittyhawk but sad how that had happened she was still looking for the door into the castle she came to a small plot that contained a single headstone it was in the shape of the head of an old man with sparse stonegray hair and white whiskers it looked almost alive and became more so as she con templated it its stony gaze was fixed on her slowly one mineral eye closed in a wink you are alive she exclaimed startled no snippet im just cold stone it said i take the form of the head of whoever is buried near me that is my nature im a headstone you mean you look like she began glancing at the oblong of dirt in front of it exactly peanut like the loudmouthed old man who is buried here actually he sounded to ivy like a loud mouthed goiem but maybe all loudmouths were similar crewel lye thats interesting ivy said this headstone didnt seem like much of a threat last year i was planted near a lovely dead young woman you should have seen me then my surface was like polished alabaster and my shape was beautiful thats nice ivy said losing interest ive got to go now ah but if you try to pass me ill yell and youll get the brushoff the headstone warned oh pooh she said you cant do anything rock head she walked on defiantly intruder alert the headstone yelled loudly undis ciplined child probably a real brat give her the brush off from around the castle flew the most awesomely ter rible object ivy could imagine a huge hairbrush she scooted back the way she had come covering her behind that headstone hadnt been bluffing ivy backed up against the wall so that her tender pos terior wouldnt be exposed what was she to do now she couldnt face thator turn her back on it either the brush hovered a moment then spying no naughty posterior it flew back the way it had come ivy relaxed she had escaped this time but she knew with sick certainty that the moment she passed the headstone again it would cry another warning and that horrendous brush would return she was stuck she was a fairly selfassured little girl but that brush she had to figure out a way to be rid of it then she had another notion for her mind was filled with notions some of them almost as cute as she was suppose she nullified the headstone instead if she could just stop that loudmouth from blabbing somehow silenc ing it she looked in her bag again maybe she could get cre ative stone mare shoe dead moth nothing here to then a creative bulb lit up for an instant flashing as brightly as the brightside effulgence she had so recently negotiated with the dark lamp yes there was a way maybe crewel lye she marched up to the headstone hi rockbrain she said boldly the stone eye eyed her stonily you again twerp if you try to pass this point ill see that you get the brush off for sure you wont be able to sit down without blis tering the chair ive got something for you she said taking out the dead luna moth let me just scrape out some dirt beside you here she dug a little hole that doesnt look like much the headstone said if you dig too deep you may encounter something you dont like sweetiepie i just want to bury this closer to you than that ivy said and dropped the dead moth in the hole then she swept the dirt over and patted it firm she stood and watched if what the headstone had told her was true it was the headstone began to change the human features weathered into anonymity and assumed a green ish cast then a new form took shape it was the head of a luna moth with furry antennae and lovely color thats very pretty ivy said and walked on by the stonemoths antennae waved frantically but there was no sound for moths did not make sounds in the human range the giant brush was not roused and ivy passed the dread region without hindrance she had nav igated the final hurdle thanks to her creativity she had used a dead moth in a way no one had thought of before she walked around to the castle door and pushed it open a young and pretty woman came to meet her why hello ivyyou surprised me why didnt you use the carpet to fly in as you usually do ivy didnt care to explain about being grounded zora was very nice but no adult could be completely trusted in a matter like that this is business zora she ex plained i have to see good magician humfrey zora shrugged she was a zombie but it was almost impossible to tell for no flesh fell from her she had been babysitting the good magician for two years because it was her talent to make people age faster she was married crewel lye but when she turned on her talent other people became nervous fearing they were aging too ivy didnt under stand why anyone should object to getting older maybe they had all forgotten what it was like to be a child but it seemed they did fear age and the older they were the more they feared it so zoras husband xavier tended to absent himself when zora turned on ivy understood the practical aspects of all this if not the emotional ones and wasnt worried she often visited the good magician herself enhancing zoras talent with her own so that humfrey aged at several times the normal rate it would not be long as such things went before he was an adult again meanwhile he seemed to be enjoying his second childhood zora escorted her to humfreys playroom the good magician was now about ivys size which meant he had averaged about three years for one for he was small for his age hi ivy he said come to put some more years on me no this is a business call ivy repeated humfrey she had to trust even if she didnt want to he knew everything anyway or seemed to that being his talent physically he was now a child so perhaps would not be inclined to betray her to the grownups im grounded for no reason and had to sneak out humfrey smiled in a tooknowing way no reason as you define it being the leading of your grandfather in a merry chase through tangler jungle and gourd all be cause you didnt stay on course or heed his warnings and causing the night stallion to shoot fire from his nostrils when he saw the damage to his haunted house set thats what i said ivy agreed uncomfortably no reason at all so lets make this quick before i get in trouble for even less reason if they discover im gone i need an answer that will be one years service he informed her in advance well ive already added more than that to your life by enhancing zora when she ages you so were even and if i do it much more youll owe me another answer crewel lye humfrey stared at her belligerently what kind of logic is that woman female logic of course she informed him want to make something of it ivy already had a fair notion how to handle men even those who could not readily be charmed um no humfrey said some distant day youre going to be king of xanth may the demon have mercy on that day i already know that dummy so watch your step she had learned about firmness from her mother just as she had learned about pedestals from her father it would never do to let any man get the upper hand as irene had muttered ominously there was no telling where he might put it okay okay wheres your question humfrey asked grumpily i need something to clean up the magic tapestry so jordan the ghost can remember another person might have had difficulty grasping this but humfrey young as he was was the magician of in formation he had had over a century of experience be fore being accidentally youthened back to babyhood along with stanley steamer now his power was returning as was his irascible nature humfrey pondered a moment then brightened the big book should have it he exclaimed ivy knew that some people claimed there was no such thing as a big book of answers for all questions but those people had never seen humfreys study the good magician went over to a table where a huge tome rested and he scram bled up on the high stool to reach it he turned the ancient pages good thing ive learned to read again he grumped as he pored over the fine print tables tadpoles tailspins talismen tangle trees tapestry nature of history of present location of abuse ofaha cleaning of thats it ivy exclaimed quiet woman while im researching he snapped ivy opened her mouth to retort suitably but decided crewel lye crewel lye to restrain herself until humfrey produced the answer timing was important when dealing with men as her mother had said anyway it was no insult to be called woman she was glad he hadnt paused to read the entry under abuse of because that very well might mention the wipingoff or layingon of hands on its surface which would be awkward to explain use crewel lye he read recipe as follows half a tumbler of wait i cant remember a whole recipe ivy pro tested i have trouble remembering the recipe for hard boiling an egg i need a written copyand no big words ivy was learning to read but preferred words like fun and joy to ones like delinquent or punishment humfrey blew air through his cheeks exactly as he would when a century or so older then fetch me that copycat ivy looked where he pointed in a corner sat a creature like a contracted caterpillar with only four legs one tail and several long whiskers it looked rounded furry and soft but evinced an attitude of independence and aloof ness she went and tried to pick up the creature but it sort of slid through her hands and remained on its soft pillar she tried to haul it up by the tail but its eyes glowed in yellow slits claws sprang out from its paws and it yowled so she desisted it certainly was a strange animal then ivy tried another system she walked in front of it here copy copy copy copy she called and the copycat came walking exactly the way ivy was walking when they reached the table she pointed to its surface jump copy she jumped herself to show how it was done and the copycat jumped but it jumped just the way she did up and down on the floor so ivy scrambled up on the table herself to the good magicians annoyance up she called and the copy cat scrambled up beside her dont stand on the pages humfrey cried grabbing the copycat and plunking it down on the page copy that copy cat the cat sat on the crewel lye recipe it purred in a moment it opened its mouth and extruded its tongue which was a sheet of paper humfrey tore off the paperan act that startled ivy and handed it to her theres your copy now go away naturally ivy got ready to argue but realized that she wanted to go away now that she had what she wanted so she kept silent sometimes the directives of men had to be obeyed when they chanced to be correct annoying as that was she scrambled down off the table and left the little good magician to his reading he had become entirely distracted by the text before him which happened to be taxidermy while the copycat continued to extrude copies of the crewel lye recipe a copy fell down before him obscuring his text at which he stared at the cat speculatively very interesting techniques here hum frey murmured i wonder but at that point the cat hastily jumped clear of the text not having the same in terest in studying or in being a subject for taxidermy that humfrey had the gorgon greeted ivy as she departed the gorgon was an elegant tau veiled woman with snake hair the good magicians wife and the mother of hugo ivys friend wont you stay for a cookie dear she asked ivy started to decline but the gorgon produced the biggest loveliest most aromatic punwheel cookie imag inable and ivy was overwhelmed she realized that the gorgon was probably lonely for living female company so it would be only proper to visit for a while she decided to stay for one cookie in due time ivy returned to castle roogna with the recipe retracing her route through the gourd no one had missed her except the ghostswhich of course was part of her problem all anyone paid attention to these days was the confounded baby shed like to drop him into the peephole of a gourd without the mare shoe but now she could clean the tapestry and get jordans complete story all she had to do was use the recipe to make the cleaner fortunately the ghosts knew where all the supplies were ivy got a pot and some lye and some crewel lye fat and stuff and cooked them together according to in structions the lye was strong stuff that tried to bum her little hands but the recipe told her how to be careful jordans friend renee ghost helped ivy to read the more difficult parts of the instructions so that she made no mistakes she had to say several spells along the way to tune the lye into the crewel but finally she had a bottle of the elixir she got a sponge soaked it with her lye mix and wiped it across the surface of the tapestry the result was star tling there was a swath of much brighter and clearer images the stuff was working ivy went carefully over the entire tapestry until it fairly shone the moving pictures looked so real she almost believed she could walk into them oh yes jordan exclaimed i can see every detail the memories are flooding back now tell me your story ivy ordered him she settled back before the tapestry watching while jordan concentrated on the beginning of his story with ivys help because the ghost could not make the tapestry respond by himself he got the correct sequence of pic tures to form then as the pictures showed the action jordan narrated the story as he remembered it he skipped over the dull parts such as sleeping and lingered on the good parts such as fighting monsters and kissing fair maidens and encountering strange magic it was a genuine tale of swords and sorceries and goods and evils and treacheries and ivy was entranced she loved tales with guts she watched and heard the caustic yarn as if she were there herself she thrilled to the thud and blunder f it and suffered fervently with the revelation tf the un kind untruth chapter pooka i believe it really started when i came of age it was the fashion in those days for a young man to prove himself by indulging in some fantastic exploit then he could marry and settle down having earned his fame i had a wonderful girlfriend elsie who could turn water into fine wine just by touching it with her little finger and she was pretty and sensible and she wanted to get married and start a family right away i just wasnt ready for that yet it sounded so dull i wanted adventure this was getting very difficult elsie really wanted me to stay and she didnt care about heroic tradition and she was certainly attractive we were having some awk ward scenes i promised her that after i had my adventure and became a hero i would return to her but this was really a lie because we both knew i would never get tired of adventure she promised me that after we started a family she would let me go out and travel in xanth and maybe slay a dragon or two but we both knew that was also a lie for a family never lets go of a man i wanted to sow my wild oats first that way i would be sure of them elsie really wasnt very keen on wild oats im not sure why so finally we made a deal elsie would have one night to show me how nice tame oats could be and dem onstrate the advantages of family living to persuade me to stay if she couldnt then i would travel it seemed fair enough little did i know what kind of night she planned i was really pretty naive in those days and knew a lot less about a lot of things than i thought i did i supposed she was crewel lye going to feed me good food and treat me well and talk to me convincingly about the advantages of the settled life instead shewell im not sure i should say much about this toin fact i think wed better just skim the pictures on past that night andno but i could get in trouble with your folks if i said too much aboutwell all right ill describe just a little of it elsie met me wearing a gown thatwell i had known she was pretty but hadnt quite realized how pretty she could be when she really tried i found myself staring at at the way she breathed and the way she sat then she took me inside her uh bedroom and i followed her and found myself staring at the way she walked then she this is really pretty dull so maybe we should skip this sceneno um well she showed me how to send a message to the stork and i agreed that this was all the adventure i ever needed and we finally fell asleep but in the morning i remembered about the other type of adventure exploring strange places and fighting strange creatures and i knew i had to try that first elsie was still asleep half smiling and i felt really terrible as i dressed and buckled on my sword but i didnt even kiss her i just sneaked out of the house like a grounded child and started walking south toward the center of xanth where the real action was supposed to be guilt followed me like a lowering cloud because my promise during the evening had turned out to be another cruel lie and i almost turned back again but the lure of the adventurous wilds drew me on and it was stronfer than my guilt somehow i didnt feel very bold or heroic at the mo ment i felt more like a coward for i had not had the courage to wake elsie and tell her honestly im going gal sorry about that she would havewell women can be very difficult about that sort of thing and once i was fairly on my way i lacked the courage to return and apologize some heroes arent very courageous or heroic inside but now i was committed and i had to look forward instead of back already i had learned a lesson of life crewel lye that the sweetest saddest thing is whatmighthavebeen i suspected i was doing wrong and would pay some hid eous price for it but still i kept doing it ashamed to confess that wrong the wilds of xanth were wilder in those days than they are today i think and many strange creatures and magics existed that no longer exist today the plants had not yet learned the proper respect for man and the dragons came even to our village of fen to gobble people that was why we had a warrior tradition we needed bold young men to fend off stray monsters we were near the north east border of xanth beside what was later to become known as the ogre fen but at that time the ogres were far away still migrating clumsily northward my boots tended to bog down in the interminable reaches of the fen and i soon realized that it was a long way to the heart of xanth where the fabulous castle roogna stood it would take me forever or so to get there by foot and i found i really didnt like walking i needed a ride that was a problem there werent any centaurs in our isolated region of xanth and dragons did not make good steedsthey tended to conspire to carry their pas sengers inside their bodies instead of outsideand i was afraid to fly with a flying creature never could be quite sure where one of those might drop you off i knew there were seahorses in the sea but i was trekking inland there was a man in fen village who made hobbyhorses but i hadnt thought to cheek with him before starting off in any event his horses didnt really carry people they just seemed to what was i to do i knew what i had to toughen my legs so i could walk all day without getting so fatigued that i lost the pleasure in the adventure so far adventure wasnt really much fun there was a lot to be said for staying home and starting a family i almost turned aboutbut again found i could not to turn back then i would have to admit my errorthat i had been wrong to leave elsie that was more difficult to do than fighting a dragon if i had not been wrong i think i could have turned back but since i was wrong i could not do it crewel lye i think now after four hundred years as a ghost to reflect on philosophical mattersghosts are better with intangibles than they are with tangibles because they are intangible themselvesthat women are more practical than are men and the reason that women have most of the sex appeal is to enable them to lure men away from the foolishness they are otherwise prone to seek cer tainly my adventure when considered as a whole was a consummate exercise in folly and would have been even if it hadnt cost me my life i could have had night after night with elsie instead i courtedand wondisaster if vanity be the name of woman folly is the name of man so i walked onand fate came to me undeserving as i was at first it didnt seem good but that is often the way of things the bad seems good like a pleasant path leading to the tentacles and maw of a tangle tree and the good seems bad like the pooka it was dusk and i had scrounged up some sugar sand and tapped a beerbarrel tree for beer the true barbarian beverage my head was spinning pleasantly detaching my mind from my tired feet when i heard the sinister rattling of a chain now i was young and foolish and a coward about personal relations but very little of the physical world scared me yet this rattle didand that brought me alert if that sound sent a cold shiver along my spine it had to be because it was meant toand that meant magic therefore i was intrigued for strange magic was part of what i sought i had the sword i needed the sorcery i quickly got up drew my sword and stalked the rattle i heard it again farther away so i hurried to catch up but still it was distant leading me through the wildest and most desolate landscape the trees were silhouetted by fuzzy moonlight and looked like gnarled giants frozen in place but one was not frozen when i brushed against it its tentacles grabbed for me and i realized that i had blundered into the clutches of a tangler one of the most fearsome vegetables ofxanth so i slashed about me with my blade severing the tentacles and the tree quickly let me go my sword was not magic precisely but it was crewel lye good and sharp and i wielded it well i really did not fear a tangle tree either to a barbarian cold steel is the answer to most problems and you know its a pretty effective answer i suppose i might have felt otherwise if my magic talent had been different i actually could afford quite a bit of foolishness after that i realized that the rattling chain was only leading me into mischief i was playing its game but i remained intrigued by it the sound had become a chal lenge a minor adventure in itself so i decided to get smart and make it play my game i returned to my camping spot sure enough the rattle followed me coming closer but on the way i foraged in the darkness for some rustleweeds and centipede grass and i set them at my place under a chocolatesmelling cocoanut shell naturally they rustled and scrambled faintly so that it sounded as if a person were lying there somewhat restlessly as he would if disturbed by a rattling chain then i sneaked silently awayi was good at that sort of thingand circled widely around behind the chain rattle sure enough i fooled it barbarians are very cunning about such things i watched as it approached my camp site wondering why i no longer spooked spooks dont like to be ignored it came over a ridge and i saw it in silhouette against the moonlightand it was a night mare no not a mare i realized after a moment for several reasons the mares did not tease sleepers with distant sounds they came right in to deliver their bad dreams then trotted on to the next they did not have time to fool around for there were many dreams to deliver be sides which i wasnt asleep and this was no mare it was a colt maybe a stallion a shaggy wild thing hung with chains that was how it rattled it was in fact a pookaa ghost horse a horse my barbarian brain began to percolate i could use that horse but how could i catch it i was sure that it was at least halfway solid because its chains rattled so they were solid and it had to be solid enough to carry them but it could simply outrun mewhich was one crewel lye reason i wanted it not only would travel be easier with a horse but would be faster and i would be able to carry more besides the challenge interested me as far as i knew no one had ever captured a pooka before so this was exactly the sort of adventure i sought think of the amazement if i rode back into fen village on a ghost horse but i was very tired now contrary to carefully fostered myth barbarians do get tired on occasion it would be better to get a nights rest and commence the pursuit in the morning on the other hand the creature could be long gone by then so i didnt dare wait i sighed it would have to be now fortunately i was a robust young man so my fatigue was an inconvenience not a crippling thing i organized for the chase first i used my sword to cut some supple long vines to serve as rope for a lariat since i wanted to capture not kill this creature that was a more difficult matter i wasnt sure it was possible to kill a ghost horse but i didnt want to take the chance naturally i had practiced with ropes in the course of my preparations for herodom and had a pretty good touch it is one of the basic uncivi lized skills then i started off of course the pooka realized almost immediately that i was pursuing him ghost horses are quite alert about such things with a rattle of chains he took off i could not come close to matching his pace but i could see his hoofprints in the moonlight and the continual clink of the chains enabled me to follow him more readily by ear i plodded on giving short shrift to whatever got in my way s didnt like traveling by night for the only class of menaces that is worse than that of the daywildemess is that of the nightwilderness but maybe the nighthorrors realized that i was tired and irritable and not to be trifled with for none attacked me maybe i was just lucky some fools have phenomenal luck and of course they need it so i kept the clink of the chains just within audible range for the pooka had not expected me to persist in the pursuit and kept pausing to forage that confirmed that it was solid true ghosts didnt have to eat at that crewel lye point in my mind the pooka changed from it to he it is a ghost he is a living creature i dont claim that this was deep thinking on my part it was just the way i saw things i realized that the pooka had teased me simply because i was there it had been a chance encounter now i was overreacting and the ghost horse was uncertain he didnt know that i intended to capture him he would stand for a while in silence thinking i would lose him without the rattle but i always walked directly toward the last chain sound i had heard using my unerring primitive sense of direction inevitably he would move again he couldnt walk or run without those chains sounding off that was his curse if this had not been the case i never would have been able to track him either by night or by day at least not so readily morning dawned and the pooka had led me generally southwest at that point as the sun got ready to heave itself up into the sky he found a hidden thicket and froze i couldnt hear him and i couldnt see him and the brush was so thick i knew i would make so much noise searching it that the pooka might escape his chain clinks drowned out so i waited and it became a siege i knew he was near but had to make him move and of course he was determined not to move having tired of this game i made good use of the wait i snoozed i really needed that sleep but i woke instantly at the clink of the chain the pooka was trying to sneak out he thought i was one of the civilized sleepers who wallow so deep in dreams they cant break free for six hours at a time not me i knew when i planned to go adventuring that i could never afford to tune out the wilderness so i had learned to wake the moment anything threatened and to sleep again the mo ment the threat was gone wild creatures sleep that way and i was pretty wild myself so that single little clink of a link alerted me and i unkinked my legs and set off in renewed pursuit now the pooka bolted i followed feeling better though i really hadnt had enough sleep i had held the trail through crewel lye the night and gotten just as much rest as the pooka had i grabbed edible berries from bushes as i walked feeding myself there again i had an advantage for the pooka had to pause to graze and could not do that while running he was probably getting really hungry now i realized now that i thought about it that anything solid enough to carry heavy chains had to take in energyfood i passed a region where the bushes had twice as many berries for each was double i was about to pop the first twinberries into my mouth when i hesitated i had of course familiarized myself with many natural things so that i could safely forage in the wilderness but these were strange something nagged something about twinberries paired berries doubleberries i froze berryberries they were poisonous causing weakness paralysis and wasting away but the effects were slow so that a person could eat a lot of them before being affectedand that would be too late of course my magic talent would protect me from serious damage but while it was acting the pooka could have gotten away better not to get into trouble to begin with however i had a cunning primitive thought i might be able to use those berryberries for my own advantage sometime so i harvested a number and put them in my bag i noticed there were no bs buzzing around the plants that still had flowers perhaps that had helped alert me bs stayed strictly away from berryberries so that the berries could even be used as a b repellent then i plowed on after the pooka who obviously had had the sense not to nibble on these berries had he led me through here deliberately i wasnt sure animals arent supposed to be too smartbut then neither are barbarian swordsmen prejudices can be deceiving i came to hoofprints leading clearly to a lineand beyond that line was nothing not a cliff not a wall just nothing now i always did get a little nervous about things i didnt understand such as marriage and family and i certainly didnt understand this was it magic i had heard of magic mirrors that a person could step into and be in crewel lye the reverse land beyond and i knew better than to look into the peephole of a hypnogourd but it looked as if the pooka had crossed this line and disappeared so it seemed i would have to follow if i wanted to catch him then again those berryberriesexactly how cunning was this creature i decided to doublecheck a little caution seldom hurts anyone another myth about barbarians is that they charge straight ahead heedlessly into danger in truth it is the ignorant civilized man blundering in the jungle who does that no barbarian ever walked blithely into a tangle tree well yes i did do that at night but that was a special situation and i had my sword ready i retraced the suspiciously clear hoofprintsand dis covered another set diverging behind some bushes this occurred on turf where the traces wouldnt have been visible to the average person but of course i had a keen wilderness eye the pooka had walked up to the line stopped then carefully backtracked setting each hoof in its own print so as to make it seem he had crossed that was warning enough for me i would not cross that line later i learned how smart my decision was the line was the boundary of the void from which no creature returned the pooka had led me to a pretty trap indeed this however showed how clever an animal he was now more than ever i wanted him for my steed i fol lowed the new trail and soon spooked the ghost horse back into motion he had been standing in another thicket watching me approach the devil now i was twice as determined to capture him i pur sued him with such determination that i hardly felt my fatigue when he paused so that i could neither hear nor see him in some location where the trail was confused i paused too napping when he moved again i moved i could tell he was getting nervousand ravenous he was now fleeing southeast this took me through a pleasant region filled with birds of every size and de scription some of them were pretty big in fact i saw a rocbird circling overhead but i wasnt too nervous be cause i knew i was too small to interest it the pooka crewel lye was another matter though i saw the roc swoop down and realized with horror that it was going for the ghost horse quickly i unslung my bow and charged forward i crested a ridge just in time to see the big bird lifting the pooka in its claws but the chains added to the weight of the horse offbalancing the bird and it hesitated quickly i loosed a shaft it sped directly to the birds feathered rump of course my arrow was no more than a little thorn to a creature that size but the thorn must have lodged in a tender spot because the bird let out an indignant shaped squawk and dropped the pooka the pooka galloped away with a loud rattle and scooted past a tangle tree where the roc couldnt follow the big bird screamed in furyand oriented on me have you ever seen an angry roc you never want to the thing launched itself toward me and its wings spread so wide they blotted out the light of the sun i raised my sword but i knew it was hopeless this creature was simply too big for me to fight the talons came down grasping for mebut they were so huge and spread so wide that they missed me i passed right through their mesh perceiving this the roc grabbed again this time plunging its claws into the ground around me they hooked into dirt rock turf and a medium sized tree and swept all up together with me in the center i laid desperately about me with my sword as the bird took off i struck at the nearest talon which was as thick as my thigh and severed it with a single mightythewed blow blood spurted out of the artery in its center and the ground that talon had supported crumbled blood soaked the divot further weakening the structure the scoopedup tree fell through and i tumbled through with it we plunged in a messy mass to the ground from the height of a standing tree it was a bad fall made worse by the gory dirt i was knocked half silly and my condition was not improved when several fairsized rocks landed on me crushing my legs i dont know how other heroes manage to escape injury when caught in horrendous situations certainly i crewel lye had no such charm i did the sensible thingi lost con sciousness i recovered an hour later my crushed leg healed oh didnt i mention this my magic talent is healing myself if i am cut it will seal up immediately if small and in minutes if large if i lose a finger it regrows if i lose a foot it takes about an hour to regenerate if i am killed by an arrow through the heart i will recover in a day longer if no one pulls out the arrow so my crushed leg was a job for an hour and i was as fit as ever maybe fitter because the restored leg wasnt tired the way the other one was evidently the big bird had left me for dead that was a natural mistake similar confusions had happened be fore i was in fact practically indestructible in any per manent sense that was one reason i liked adventure i had good magic for a hero so now i resumed the pursuit the ghost horse hadnt gone far thinking me out of it he was grazing nearby yes he was hungry i yelled and bore down on him he looked up star tledand reacted as if hed seen someone risen from the dead terrified he took off leaving half a munch of grass to drop to the ground behind one might think a ghost horse would not be afraid of other ghosts but thats not so even ghosts fear what they dont understand and the average ghost is a pretty timid creature i ought to know and of course a pooka isnt a complete ghost because of that solidity its sort of in a halfway state much the way a zombie is halfway between life and death if the pooka ever slipped his chains hed fade into full spirit status but the chains hold him to life so he must graze and do most of the other things living creatures do how ever inconvenient some of them may be there are a number of things like that in xanth neither this nor that but partaking of some of this and other of that the chase was on again the pooka fled southeast and led me into griffin country i could tell by the old spoor the claw marks on the trunks of trees and the griffin manure i kept alert for griffins can be aggressive crewel lye creatures i figured i could handle one griffin but some times they traveled in prides and that could be trouble the roc had left me because i was too small a morsel to bother with and it would have gotten dirt on its beak just scooping up my body but griffins would eat me and i wasnt sure how easy it would be for me to recover if that happened maybe if one of them ate most of me id be able to collect myself together againbut i didnt care to risk it for one thing injuries hurt me just the same as they do other folk until they heal why endure all that pain if i didnt have to so i was careful maybe barbar ians were supposed to laugh at scars as if they never felt a wound but the humor of that escaped me the pooka hungry and tired was less careful he charged right through a griffinretreat where there was a big nest in a lowbranching tree a griffiness was on the nest incubating an egg or somethingim not quite clear on that aspect as griffins are fussy creatures with royal lineages and dont tolerate much snoopingand she let out an awful squawk at this intrusion the male griffin had been snoozing on a branch up higher in the tree his wings folded while his claws gripped the bark startled he jumped right off the branch and plunged like a rock or maybe i mean a roc before he spread his wings and pulled out of the dive he wasnt one bit pleased i sus pect i wouldnt be either waking up like that with a woman screaming at me about some creature violating her privacy maybe thats another reason i was wary of marriage like the boundary to the void its apt to be a oneway trip into whoknowswhat it took only a moment for the male griffin to catch on that the pooka had started this he wheeled in the air and swooped after the ghost horse who had recovered sense enough to gallop out of there at top speed i followed as fast as i could the pooka was fast despite the chains when he ran fullout but so was the griffin in flight and he wasnt carrying any extra weight i think if the pooka had been fresh or had better running turf he could have escaped but the ground was getting marshy here and there were crewel lye many trees so the terrain hampered the ghost horse some what the griffin was able to swoop efficiently around the trees so he gained the griffin pulled up above the pooka and pounced and i was too far away to do anything i could only run after them and watch even if i had been within arrow range im not sure i would have used my bow because if i killed the griffin it would have left the griffiness alone on her nest unable to forage without leaving her egg or whatever and i really didnt like to do that meeting a griffin in battle is one thing messing up nesting arrange ments is another yes i know this sounds foolish but you cant live in the wilderness long without developing a solid respect for the creatures there these griffins had not been looking for trouble the pooka had started it because i was chasing him which really made the whole thing my fault i can kill creatures when im right but not when im wrong so i was really pretty well helpless regardless the griffin landed on the pookas back and his beak pecked downand struck one of the chains ouch the griffin dazed by the pain tried to fly up and couldnt because one of his claws was caught in another chain the pooka bucked trying to throw off the griffin the griffin wanted to go but could not then the pooka charged under an overhanging branch and that scraped the griffin off the hard way he fluttered turning over in the air and bounced on his back on the ground little stars and planets of discomfort radiated out from him as he bounced he scrambled upright and took to the air again unstead ily trailing lingering squiggles of confusion and dismay he had forgotten about the pooka who did not linger to remind him the griffin lurched back toward the nest tree radiating evanescent wattles of sweat one hardly ever sees a griffin sweat i ran on after the ghost horse the marsh grew marshier as such things tend to do and my boots squished in it i didnt like this but had to keep after the pooka the ghost horse didnt like it either he veered south heading for higher ground but it became apparent that the mountains visible to the south were too crewel lye far away to do much good for some time so he turned west and i followed and we slogged up toward a bright wall evidently this region was outside the pookas nor mal range he wasnt quite certain where he was going the closer we got to the wall to the west the brighter it becameand the worse the land got now it was a virtual bogand triangular colored fins appeared in it traveling at high speed a green one came near me and rose up out of the muck i saw that it was a big fish with a mouthful of teeth the fish leaped at me teethfirst so i whipped out my trusty sword and stabbed the creature in the snout ooo ouch the fish cried plopping back into the muck you didnt have to do that all i wanted was to loan you something didnt trust talking fish what did you expect in return only an arm and a leg it replied well im not interested leave me alone or thats what im trying to do leave you a loan im a loan shark i dont care if youre a lone shark or a hundred sharks i dont want to see your green back near me take off or ill lop off your fin the thought of losing its finback discouraged the fish and it swam rapidly away but the pooka was having more trouble three of the fins red blue and yellow were circling him hungrily and he was mudded down in the bog he slogged through the slough toward the west wall but now i could see that it was a wall of fire that was no good i forged toward him waving my sword to scare away the fish move off i cried at them or ill saw your bucks in half the fish hesitated not wanting to expe rience this sawbuck but the pooka saw my waving weapon and was scared away himself he plunged for the firewall no wait i cried im trying to help you but he continued more afraid of me than of either the fins or the firewall and soon he reached the latter now the heat stopped him he couldnt pass that fire but the crewel lye fish hemmed him in behind the red and blue fins were spiraling closer the yellow more fearful circled farther out the pooka wrenched a forefoot out of the bog and struck at the red fin but the effort mired the other three legs deeper he was in real trouble i shoved toward him and now he couldnt flee me but i wasnt sure how i could save him let alone capture him the blue shark forged in at the pookas side and tried to take a bite its teeth crunched on chains i saw little sparks fly up as enamel met metal that must have hurt the fish retreated but did not depart now at last i got there the pooka was afraid of me but so badly mired he couldnt move look pook i said all i want is to ride you when i get where im going ill let you go its not a fate worse than death and death is what youll get here if you dont drown the sharks will skin you alive wouldnt you rather travel with me the pooka just looked at me as if i were halfway tetched im not sure he understood me animals vary in xanth some are smarter than people but most are not maybe my voice reassured him that and the fact that i wasnt trying to kill him maybe he was just so mired he couldnt budge the red fin launched itself at me i chopped at it with my blade severing the fin from the body exactly as i had warned the greenback i would and this redneck swam raggedly away now the water was red too but the blood attracted more fins from all over the bog they converged the colored light reflecting in what someone in a less precarious situation might have con sidered pretty pook were in trouble i said i slogged right up against him he tried to flinch away from me but could not i climbed on his back and my weight shoved him deeper into the muck then the first fin ar rived i lashed at it with my sword and cut it off the fish immediately six other sharks pounced on the wounded one and tore it to pieces an arm and a leg these mon sters were out for anything they could get crewel lye another came at us and i served it likewiseand so did its companions and a third supported as i was i could reach a full circle with my sword not one fin got close enough to bite before being severed soon the muck around us was a morass of gore after a time so many sharks had been eaten that the remaining ones were gorged the circle of fins widened and fell apart they were no longer interested in us as i have said brute force and swordplay may not be the answer to every problem but there are times when they are good enough the pooka was now up to his shoulders in muck be fore long the stuff would reach his head and he would drown in dirty blood i had to do something look pook i told him im on your side i want to help you i saved you from the fins i helped you escape the roc and the griffin before now ive got to get you out of herebut i dont know how so ill try to find a way you just hang on here ill be back as soon as i can keep your chin up i dismounted and stood in the muck beside him well could i pull his feet out one by one i reached down along one hind leg gripped it as deep as i could and hauled it did not come up i sank down that was no good i looked at the firewall it was not as hot as i had first thought and i could see vague shapes through it was it thin i decided to find out i took a deep breath closed my eyes ducked under the bloodwater and pushed toward the firewall when i hoped had gone far enough i came upand found myself in a burnedout forest the firewall was behind me and evidently the fire had recently left this spot but strangely green shoots were already appearing on the charred trees they were burned but not dead to the west the muck soon dehydrated into a baked flat dried out by the fire the pooka would be able to walk hereif he could get across the firewall well i had done it he could use the same device ducking under the water if he could unmuck enough to move crewel lye he would need help i contemplated the smoldering sprouting trunks and had a notion i could haul him under ducked under the firewall again and came up in the bloodbath there was the pooka unchanged except a little deeper mired he was keeping his chin up he had to to keep his nose clear of the bloodstream that sur rounded him i need a chain i said i put my hands on one of the chains that wrapped him and tugged at it the thing was tied in with no free end i wondered who had fastened these chains on him and why but this was not the time for idle speculation many things in xanth dont have sensible explanations anyway they just are ill have to do this the hard way i said steady now i stretched out a loop of chain so that it projected into the water beside him then hefted my sword lifting it above my head with both hands and bringing it down ferociously the pooka neighed with terror but was unable to flinch away then the blade caught the loop of chain and sliced through it i had a good sword it had been dipped in dragons blood and so the blade was magically hard and sharp and could cut through almost anything i took one of the severed ends passed it down around the muckburied barrel of the ghost horse and drew it up on the other side i kept working unraveling the chain until had what i needed then i made sure the rest was securely anchored about the barrel and forelimbs of the animal so it could not slip free now pook im going to haul you under the firewall i said to get you out of this mess but youll have to help when you feel the pull try to walk with it you should be able to with that help when you reach the firewall get your body as close to it as possible duck your head down under it so you wont get burned and ill haul you across got that the pooka did not react i couldnt tell whether he understood well no help for it i had to do it if this worked i would save the ghost horse if not i slogged back to the firewall hauling the chain i dived crewel lye under on the other side i picked a suitable scorched tree and strung the chain over a low horizontal branch then i hauled on the end there was resistance of course that muck didnt want to let go of its prey i hauled harder hanging my whole weight on it gradually there was give slowly the chain moved i took a new grip and hauled some more and more came now it got easier the pooka was helping heave by heave and step by step i hauled the animal toward the firewall though i could not see him on the other side if he failed to duck his head at the critical moment then the taut chain dipped into the muck and i knew the ghost horse was following my orders i increased my effort and in a moment his head appeared on my side after that it was easier i got the pooka past the fire wall and into the shallow muck and finally onto the baked mud i removed the chain from the tree and rewrapped it about the animal he needed that chain to remain in existence as far as i knew but i did not let go of it when i finished i mounted him willing or not youre giving me a ride i informed him the poor thing was so bedraggled and tired he didnt say neigh i had my steed at lastor so i thought chapter callicantzari i rode pook to a region where the trees had grown back considerably and i prepared to spend the night im going to let you go i told him but you can see how the firewall surrounds this region you cant get out with out my help so theres no point in running from me you crewel lye might as well just relax and graze i dismountedand the ghost horse took off at a gallop i sighed i had hopedbut of course i was just a back woods lunk not understanding the true motives of people or creatures however much i tried i foraged for some fruit for my mealit was amazing how fast these trees progressed after being burnedthen settled down to sleep i didnt worry about predators here they wouldnt pass through the firewall smoke roused me night remainedbut the horizon was bright fire was sweeping across the plain i cast about knowing i was in trouble secure against animate menaces i had overlooked the inanimate the fire had me halfway surrounded and was moving faster than i could run the green grass and foliage had turned brown apparently the accelerated cycle of growth did not stop with maturity but continued through the season pall had come to this regionand with it the fire to clean away the husks and set things up for the spring in the morning maybe i could bury myself in the ground until it passed but the turf was hard it would take hours to dig myself in properly and all i had were minutes i heard a rattle there was the pooka running terrified before the flame get over here i yelled ill guide you out naturally he paid no attention but i cut across to herd him toward the advancing flame where there was a culdesac then used my rope to snag him i hauled him to me and climbed onto his back and gripped the chain i had my steed againjust in time it wasnt comfortable sitting on the chains when the ghost horse had been in the muck i had not felt the chains as much but now i did but i had no choice the fire provided no time for comfort i steered the horse by kick ing the side i wanted him to move away from we galloped for the closing gap in the ring of fire my posterior bounc ing intemperately on the hard chains we reached the gapand discovered that beyond it was only another closing ring no escape here now what was i to do i had promised to find a way out but i saw that part of the new ring was in fact the crewel lye outer firewall that was the boundary no fire beyond that we could dive under it and there was no water or muck here to use to get under the fire there was also no time the bum was avidly pursuing us weve got to go through i cried close your eyes and hold your breath and i whammed the end of the rope against the horses flank causing him to leap wildly forward in midair we sailed through that firewall i felt the band of heat flash past my body singeing my whiskers and clothing then we were through we had had the advan tage of firm turf and high velocity this time that had made it possible but i was not eager to return to the realm of fire if i had any choice in the matter we were on a plain before the southern mountain range we had been unable to reach before i was pleased south was the way i wanted to go and i preferred mountains to either bog or bum i think pook did too we moved on toward the mountains as the sun came up then paused for breakfast i let pook graze but this time i did not dismount knowing he would bolt i simply pulled down a dainty feminine fruit from an overhanging branch and bit into it i was surprised it was not fruit but meatevidently a misssteak grown there by error sometimes spells got befuddled it made a good solid meal however though i would have preferred to cook it in due course we walked south againand encoun tered goblin traces pook snorted nervously and i groaned we both knew that goblins were trouble but we werent about to go back the way we had come so we continued south much more warily it did us no good a party of goblins spotted us the chase was on with goblins you see you didnt parley not in those days anyway maybe goblins have moderated over the centuries you fought or you ran or you got tromped that was the extent of your options since there were about ten of them armed with sticks and stones to break crewel lye our bones and only one of me and one ghost horse plus my good swordwell i was young and foolish but not that foolish i was no dragon to chomp goblins by the dozen or ogre to hurl them to the moon so i took the sensible optioni ran pook of course was right with me under me tech nically chains and all he galloped ghost horses dont like getting eaten by goblins either the goblins gave chase they were afoot and they had stubbly little legs big feet and gross ugly heads but they moved along pretty well also one of them sounded a blast on a horn summoning the other goblins it was a stink horn and it made a foulsmelling noise the kind that instantly attracted that kind of creature so though we handily outran that bunch we did not get free of gob lins they poured like hot lava out of the mountain today i understand there are not great numbers of goblins res ident on the surface though it may be a different story in the dank deep caverns but in my day there were more they surrounded us in a putrid mass grabbing at my legs yelling obscenely goblins are about as obscene as any creature except the harpies naturally i slashed with my sword cutting off their hands or anything else that came within range fingers noses scalps and other items flew out from our contacts oh you should have heard those goblins yell but there were always more glaring faces more hands more sticks and stones it is never a pleasant business fighting off goblins because they just keep coming thicker than be fore we tried to veer right away from the goblin mountain but encountered the firewall it blazed up brightly ready for us this time as if daring us to try to get through it alive so we had to veer leftand discovered that we really hadnt cleared the bog yet an arm of it came down almost to the mountain and a leg of it extended north of the mountain that was no good either the loan sharks were waiting in it to take my arm and leg so we charged straight for the mountainwhere most of the goblins were pook bowled them over in his galloping fright but i knew we would soon be buried in goblins we plowed straight ahead because we didnt dare turn or stop that was directly toward the mountain which loomed ever larger as we drew nigh the goblins sur rounded it like a warty blanket as we got close i saw that parts of it were terraced with narrow winding paths following the contours and this gave me a notion i nudged pook to the side where a lancetree grew i severed a lance with a passing sweep of my sword then we looped back and slowed momentarilythe ghost horse afraid of the massed goblins was now obeying my every hint with marvelous alacrity since i seemed to know what i was doingso i could flip up the lance with the point of my sword and catch it with my free hand i have pretty good coordination with weapons its another barbarian specialty then we resumed speed and i sheathed my sword and used both hands to hold the lance firm it was a good long one with the point extending well ahead of pooks head now we reached the base of the mountain i guided my steed to the nearest convenient path and we swerved onto it churning out divots of turf as pooks hooves made the turn the lance swept about knocking goblins off the path they tumbled heads overfeets down the slope their heads were big and hard as rocks and dented the mountain slope where they struck but their feet were soft when the feet struck the goblins let out angry yells gobs of goblins were crowding around the mountain and the bowling ones knocked over the standing ones like eight nine or tenpins we charged east along the path the point of the lance leading and the goblins ahead dived out of the way they couldnt get at us as long as we kept moving i began to relax my impromptu ploy was working and we were es caping this pesthole all we needed was to follow this path right out of the goblin territory it turned out to be a trifle more complicated than that the path curved wondrously as if seeking to confuse us it included a hairpin curve and a few nasty jags and jigs and it branched and intersected other paths as the convolutions of the mountain permitted there were small goblin caves along the way each with its messy little front yard strewn with fruit peels animal bones and other garbage the gob lins in these poked sticks out to try to trip us and threw rocks from their cover fortunately neither their timing nor their aim was very good and we escaped injury but it was ner vous business being bombarded from passing caves more enterprising goblins rolled rocks down the inter secting paths most of these were small enough to be mere nuisances so that pook could hurdle them but some were large enough to be threats we were also conscious of the sheer malignance of the massed goblins there was not one of them who wouldnt rejoice at our misfortune simply be cause we were strangers the goblins were the ultimate big ots of xanth hating all creatures who were not like themselves and not feeling too positive about themselves either i had heard that goblin females were different but all i saw here were males no doubt the females were smart enough not to indulge in this sort of quarrel then the path slid down the curving mountain as if tired and into the crevice between it and the next mountain too late i saw that this was a dead end the path did not go up the next slope instead it led directly into a large cave whose depths were dark ominous and dreadful no good ever comes of caves like that the goblins were massed and charging behind us some carrying crude wooden shields and several operated to gether to support a lance like mine we could not turn about and go back that way we would be trying to charge uphill against a prepared enemy formation neither could we turn aside the slopes of the crevice were too steep for us to nav igate glancing up i saw goblins making ready to roll a boulder down on us already it was nudging over the brink they were leering with anticipation of the squash it would make of us i had no choicei guided pook directly into the men acing tunnel he didnt like this and i didnt like it but it was the only route left behind i heard the malignant rum ble of the boulder coming down then there was a sinister shudder as it crashed into the tunnel lodging there with gruesome finality and blocking the entrance some debris shook loose from the ceiling to shower down around us but the passage didnt collapse that was a relief i knew that if the tunnel had survived this long it was probably pretty stable but doubts are easy to come by in the deep dark we halted but knew before we checked that we were trapped even if we managed to push or pry out the boul der we would encounter an army of vicious goblins beyond it eager to hurt us with sticks stones and names once again we had no choice but to go forward i have always had a distinct dislike of such unchoices they generally led to mischief and even if they didnt i still preferred to get into trouble in my own fashion rather than the forcedpath way it was good and gloomy in that cave light seeped in around the ragged edges of the boulder but in the deeper reaches it was foreboding indeed pook was a ghost horse he could see pretty well since ghosts normally did their work at night but i had trouble pook i said were just going to have to follow this cave into the mountain fastness it must go somewhere be cause the path led right to it and maybe the other end will let us out the other side of the hill but i felt a chill of ner vousness coursing along my spine and hovering in that one region it is impossible ever quite to scratch because i knew that not all paths that led in to things led out again the path to a tangle tree was a good example but there was no point in negative thinking at the moment so im going to have to trust you to follow it through and not drop us into some deep fissure i know you dont like having me ride you but were in this together and maybe we can get out together once were safely out we can worry about who gets to ride whom where pook made no response but i hoped he understood the situation i aimed him for the black hole ahead and nudged him with my heels he moved forward at a walk his hooves sounding sharply on the stone in fact there were little echoesand i realized that my ears could serve in lieu of eyes to some extent barbarians have keen hearing though it cant compare with that of most animals the echoes told me that the walls were close beside us but not ahead of us the tunnel trended down as such things tend to do i didnt like that i wanted to travel up and out of the moun tain but one must go where ones road leads even when its a distressing road after what seemed like an interminable time i began to see a little there were small fungi growing in cracks in the wall casting a magic pastel glow as we progressed water dripped and the air got cooler and damper the fungi grew larger and brighter until it was possible for me to make out most of the passage some fungi were yellow and some green or blue in fact they were all the colors of the rainbow though faint it was really rather pretty the tunnel expanded becoming a series of galleries each lined with the rainbow fungi this was finebut now there were branching passages and i didnt know which ones to follow life is simpler when you dont have many choices even if you dont like the route youre stuck on so i didnt choose i let pook have his head and we proceeded more or less straight ahead then pook paused to sniff the air i could see his head only in silhouette where it blocked the faint illumination of the fungi but i knew his nostrils were flaring he smelled something then i smelled it tooa fetid odor the stench of some large and thoroughly unpleasant creature we were not alone wed better try to avoid that thing i murmured to pook it stinks a little like goblin but worse i still had my lance but wasnt sure how useful it would be in the con fines of the cave i might run the point directly into a dead end wall and jar myself right off my mount we backed out of this chamber as quietly as we could and tried an alternate one but the smell only got stronger then i realized that we werent approaching the monster the monster was approaching us it had heard our footfalls our hooffalls and was coming to investigate lets get out of here i said urgently yielding with a certain relief to panic oh i knowbarbarian warriors arent supposed crewel lye to experience such emotion barbarian warriors dont be long in deep dark caves with stinking monsters either pook picked up speed moving as fast as he dared along the passage it wasnt fast enough still the silent stink in tensified we were deep in monster territory and not getting out maybe the goblins had been herding us here all alons knowing what would happen to any creature who fearfully braved these dank depths suddenly the monster loomed before us it was a gross manlike thing with horrible distorted features the worst monsters are always manlike ive never been quite clear why this is so but it definitely is so fur covered this things face from the fur a grotesque and bulbous nose poked out and under the fur two great ugly eyeslits peered as from behind a dirty veil at the bottom of the face several twisted tusks projected there must have been a mouth some where the creature seemed to be malethe worst spec imens of anything are always male except for harpies his arms were hairy extremities on which the muscles seemed to be attached backward and his torso had several bones in the wrong places in some ways he was like an unusually large and grotesque goblin but in other ways he was worsehis breath for one thing his exhalations sur rounded him like a putrid cloud pook and i were gagging later i learned that this was one of the callicantzari a race of monsters who lived mostly underground and undermined the roots of important trees such as the tree of seeds on mount parnassus or the tree that supported the skythe trees without which xanth as we know it would cease to exist imagine a land without all the myriad and wonderful species of trees that stem from those magic seeds or a land without any sky how could we function without the sun and moon and stars and clouds safely out of the way but it seemed that these monsters didnt worry about that they just wanted to bring down the trees maybe thats one of the differences between mon sters and human beingsthe monsters dont care what happens next the callicantzari have tunnels going to every signifi cant mountain and labor diligently to bring down those crewel lye trees but when they get close to the surface and its un accustomed freedom they rush out and run around ter rorizing people and animals and dancing wildly maddened by the sight of the stars until morning comes even the goblins cant stand them and will attack immediately if they show up in goblin territory that explains why the callicantzari hadnt used our tunnel to escape when they get out elsewhere and the sun rises they flee its light in terror the shock always takes them some time to recover from and by the time they resume their normal equilib rium such as it is the trees have regrown their roots and the job has to be started over thus the callicantzari are never successful which perhaps is just as well gen erally because of their repeated failures they are in a foul mood and their breath suggests that mood sothey really have quite a history and are not just ordinary mon sters but at the moment all i knew was that pook and i were in more trouble we slowed to avoid the monsterbut then another appeared behind us and we heard the tramping of others in neighboring caverns if there is one thing worse than one monster it is two monstersand worse yet is a whole slew of them we were surrounded got to bull through and hope we win clear i told pook before we both suffocate from the stench you gallop and ill fend them off he galloped and i aimed the lance at the monster before us the calli was too stupid to move so that my point caught him on the nose the shock drove the lance through his head and knocked it out of my grasp we charged on by the falling monster who smelted even worse wounded than whole but another appeared before us i whipped out my trusty sword though i hated to soil my clean blade on ilk like this and struck at his ugly neck like the other he didnt move and my blade decapitated him ugh it was gory barbarians are supposed to glory in blood but this was ugly smelly gunky blood that contained very little glory still there were more two lumbered from side tunnels reaching for me with their grotesque canionhooks i cut the arms off the one on the right but the one on the left got me in a gruesome hug and hauled me off my steed yes i know that sort of mishap is not supposed to happen to heroes the truth is it happens but the barbarian publicity department censors it out pook faltered turning his head back to look at me more monsters were converging run i cried at him as i poked the point of my sword over my shoulder to stab the face of the monster holding me hot ichor sprayed against my neck and i knew i had scored get out of here pook before they catch you too the ghost horse took off and i laid about me valiantly with the sword hacking off arms and legs and ears as they came within reach but as i had known the monsters were too much for me one scored on my head with a hammy fist knocking me silly and another took a huge bite at my face i felt his tusks sinking into my cheeks then i lost consciousness naturally i wasnt aware what happened next but now i see it in the pictures of the tapestry and my under standing of the situation helps fill it in satisfied that i was dead the callis hauled me down to their main depot where their cows and cubs lurked there they clumsily used my own fair sword to cut my body open so they could gut me with their dirty claws they yanked out all my innards and gobbled them down as delicacies quar reling over the scraps then they jammed me in a bi pot of cold water to cook the tougher parts and set about fetching wood for a fire this took some time for they had not planned ahead and there wasnt much wood to be found in the deep caves but after some hours they scraped up enough garnered from the roots of the trees they had been trying to destroy now at last they were ready to cook meanwhile some of them checked through my tattered clothing to see if there was anything interesting there they chomped on the buttons and laces and ripped the cloth liking the ripping sound they found the bag of berryberries i had saved then fought again among them selves to see who could gobble the greatest number down well i daresay they felt the effect in due course it was almost worth dying to think of the effect those debilitating berries would have on those monsters there was another problem the callicantzari were afraid of fire it seemed its brightness reminiscent of that of the sun hurt their eyes if you ask me what sense it makes to crave cooked food when youre afraid of fire i cant answer i suppose monsters wouldnt be monsters if they were sensible if i had known about this before i would have arranged to bring a torch with me into their caverns so they would not have dared approach me but barbarian heroes arent necessarily allknowing either not one of the monsters wanted to light and tend the fire this problem hung them up another hour at last they drew lots for the one who would do the deedbut then he had no spell to start the fire they had to look for another hour to locate the spellby which time it was their night which happened to correspond with ours though i dont know how they knew maybe the glowing fungi dimmed a little so they left the feast until morning and snored their snores were absolutely awful sounds like sawfish sawing down rock maple trees meanwhile pook was galloping along the passages searching for a way out the monsters werent chasing him because they already had me for their meal and werent very enterprising folk pook finally did blunder to an exit went out sniffed the airand turned back he had smelled something that made him pause so he didnt want to brave it alone the ghost horse now sure of the way came back to the central caverns and near morning sniffed out where i remained in the pot he nuzzled the top of my head waking me you see i had had about ten hours to heal and this was enough i hadnt really been killed i had been knocked out my face bitten off and my guts eviscerated by this time i had grown back my face and guts and healed the wounds it took longer than it had to mend my crushed legthe roc incidentbecause regrowing is more com crewel lye plicated than merely healing existing anatomy i remained a little weak from loss of flesh since my healing does not create matter from nothing it draws on the remaining resources of my body but i could function i had been a strapping young man before this started and now was merely less strapping tissue from my big muscles had been coopted to replace my guts knock over the pot i told pook he did sothis was the first solid evidence that he understood my words completelyand i floated out with the spilled water the callis were such solid sleepers that neither the clang nor the water sloshing by aroused them indeed the noise could hardly be distinguished over their horrendous snoring and the water was no more volu minous than their droolings i climbed unsteadily to my feet and got on pooks back pausing only to recover my good sword my bow had been lost by the callicantzari maybe they had used it as part of the wood for the upcoming cookingfire i wouldnt put such an outrage past such creatures i still wore my boots they hadnt thought to take them off me before putting me in the pot then we were off coursing upward through the pas sages leaving the thick noise and stink behind at last we emerged into the wonderful bright morning on the southeast slope of the mountain oh what relief it was if i had to die i much preferred to perish in the open wilderness rather than in the dank closed caverns chapter elf elm we found a fresh stream and a copse of pie trees and i drank and ate and foraged for suitable re placement clothing from shoetreesmy boots were sloshingly soaked so i needed temporary footwear while they driedtrousertrees and shirttrees to replace what i had lost while pook grazed i didnt try to hold or confine him i lacked the strength and anyway i didnt feel i had a right since he had come back for me on his own maybe he wasnt tame but he had chosen to be my companion for a while i wondered why i saw that he did not stray at all far from me and i doubted this was from sudden affection i hoped i wasnt being overly cyn icalbut then i knew i had brought him a lot of trouble and barbarians arent noted for comprehension of the nu ances of interpersonal behavior it wasnt long before i found out pook lifted his head rattled his chains and moved toward me you want me to ride you i asked bemused youre not taking off alone into the wilds of the wilderness know ing that i presently lack the strength or inclination to chase you down again actually i was stuffed with pies which made me sluggish rather than weak but this was also the first use of my new face and digestive tract startups are always awkward and it takes a few hours to get the bugs out there was a lot of gas and i felt a little green but every time i burped another bug flew out and i knew they would all be gone in a few more hours there was no question that i was underweight though my thews were pitiful in a few days i would be as good as new more or less literally but i needed lots of rest and food crewel lye in the interim i was no magician my magic talent had to be tempered with moderation i really appreciated pooks offer whatever its motive it was easier to ride than to walk until my leg muscles filled out so i harvested some cushions from the sur rounding bushes fashioned them into a saddle seat that would prevent the chains from pinching my rear and mounted we began making our way south at a cautious pace and the elves arrived oho that was why pook needed me elves generally leave human folk alone and arent often seen but they are funny in some ways they can be deadly fighters though they respect property rights if they found pook alone they would run him down and tame him for their own use making him a work horse they could do that because there were a number of them they had little magic lariats and they knew the terrain they were ex perienced group hunters but if they thought i owned him they would let him beat least until they had dealt with me i was his buffer against the elves smart move pook i murmured with a certain rueful appreciation there was an aspect of this that worried me elves usually as i said dont mess with human folk because there is a standing covenant between our two species its a kind of mutual nonaggression pact since human and elven interests seldom intersect it is easiest to respect one anothers interests it certainly saves trou ble but both humans and elves had uses for a creature like pook if the elves really wanted the ghost horse they might choose to quarrel it wasnt good to quarrel with elves in elven territory they werent always as small as they looked at least now i knew that pook had a fair brain in that equine head he couldnt talkbut of course talking is not necessarily a sign of intelligence he had made his problem mine unfortunately i was in no fit condition to do battle at the moment this was a party of six elves they were armed with assorted weapons and they wore green tunics they were crewel lye proportioned and dressed like human beingsoh sure human beings do wear tunics on occasionbut stood only a quarter my height i met them with respect for i knew that at the best of times they were far better as friends than as enemies and this was an indifferent or middling poor time i cast about in my uncivilized mind for the proper form of address was it sire no sir what be your business in elven demesnes man their leader demanded just passing through sir i replied carefully how did you get past the goblins they drove us into the mountain sir and the mon sters there left me for dead and my pooka rescued me the elf eyed me suspiciously you tamed a ghost horse well partway perhaps its hard to tame such a crea ture completely the elf considered eyed pook and shrugged satisfied you seek no quarrel with us man none sir im just a barbarian warrior in search of honest adventure honest adventure eh he considered me again and i wasnt clear what thoughts were percolating through his mind would you agree that there are other kinds of adventure than battling callicantzari that was when i learned the identity of the mountain monsters i certainly hope so sir then you will be our guest tonight amazed i had to stifle a gape i had hoped only to be allowed to pass without quarrel thats very nice of you sir whats your name man jordan sir i am oleander elf of the tribe of flower elves these are he indicated his companions in turn cactus dogwood knotweed bloodroot and arrowhead in deed i saw that they were armed in the manner of their names cactus had a dagger made of a large cactus thorn arrowhead had a little bow and quiver of arrows knotweed had knotted rope bloodroot had a red bag of crewe lye fluid that might be bloodpoison and dogwood had a wooden spear tipped with a large canine tooth only oleander carried no visible weaponbut he was the leader and i suspected he had something perhaps a fight ing spell there were no goblins on this side of the moun tain and this was surely because of these elves elves did not seem as fierce and were certainly not as numerous as goblins yet they kept the goblins clear that spoke for itself like many people i wondered what their secret was since as far as i knew goblins respected nothing but brute force oleander led pook and me along a winding path to a hidden glen i was glad to go with them for this was a signal honor and elves were creatures of integrity as their guest i would be absolutely safe but i remained mys tified as to why they should extend this honor to a wan dering barbarian it could not be purely for delight in my company barbarians do not make very good company the journey took over an hour for the little folk did not travel as fast as a man though they stepped out sprightly enough i did not mind since i was riding and also recovering from my recent injuries the nourishment from all those pies i had stuffed in my new face and gut was working its way though the rest of my body and my thews were strengthening the elven camp was around and in an elf elm of course everyone knows elves will reside nowhere else when danger threatened the women and children retreated to the heights while the warriors ringed the base of the tree at the moment most of them were down for they were setting up for their midday meal the smells were good but i was still digesting pies and wasnt really hungry that was just as well for their portions were small we sat on the ground and the elven maidens served leaves filled with stew the leaves were cleverly worked into bowls so that the stew did not leak i accepted mine curious what was in the stew but hesitant to ask there seemed to be chunks of vegetables nuts fruits and meats in it and i suspected that the meat was from mice and crewel lye grasshoppers it tasted good anyway and was just enough to top off what i had eaten before then oleander brought an elf maiden to meet me this is bluebell who wishes to ask a favor of you man he said somewhat brusquely and departed i wondered at that anew had i given some sort of offense i had cer tainly tried to be a good guest but one never can be certain with nonhuman cultures though the elves were about as human as such cuitures got if it were not for the dis tinction of size i would hardly know the difference a favor i asked i will be happy to help in any way i can but i dont know much about elves bluebell smiled she was a lovely little creature per fectly proportioned like a doll in her green dress i will tell you about elves jordanman she said but first i must do you a favor so its even what would you like i am quite satisfied to accept the elven hospitality i replied cautiously i glanced across to where pook was grazing few animals got to touch grass as lush as that which the elves cultivated around their elms and so is my horse that is favor enough no you will repay that by telling us your story to night she said i mean a favor from me personally what was she getting at your charming company is enough i said please tell me what you wish me to not yet she demurred she jumped up to perch on my bent knee dangling her pretty legs in the way girls had i must do you my favor first i shook my head as i said im just a backwoods man unfamiliar with elven ways i dont want to give offense by making mistakes and i have already antago nized oleander in some way so you will have to explain to me exactly what she emulated my motion but the effect differed when she shook her head her lovely elfgray hair tumbled about fetchingly dont worry about him hes just perturbed because he wanted cowslip to get your favor but i won the toss cowslips his cousin and shes all right if you like that type bluebell indicated an elf maid nearby looked and saw a stunning example of the type i did indeed like it i will do a favor for each of you to keep the peace i said magnanimously but i need to know what she laughed merrily only for me man thats the rule ive got the spell i won it and i wont share it i was more perplexed than ever what spell she glanced at me sidelong you are delightful i will show you in due course nowname your favor i sighed silently evidently she preferred to play her game with me in the fashion of maidens everywhere and i felt every bit as ignorant as i was supposed to be well im an adventurer but i dont quite know where im going that is im headed for castle roogna the man capital but there are a lot of barriers along the way like the goblin mountain that i would have avoided if id known if i had a good map a map she exclaimed of course you shall have it she bounced off my knee and ran to the tree her hair flinging out behind her doll she might be but she was a womandoll soon she was back hauling a scroll about as big as herself breathlessly she unrolled it for me on the greens ward pertly sitting on the top end while i spread my fingers to hold down the bottom end this is xanth she panted prettily here we are in the center with the goblins griffins and birds to the north and the dragons to the south to the east beyond the river is the big ocean and to the west are the five terrible elements air earth fire water and the void they arent nice places you dont want to go there in fact nowhere is as nice as right here i perused the map with interest i came from up here in the fen i ran into the oh no dont tell your story yet she protested save it for the whole tribe where are you going from here specifically well i thought south i dont want to pass through the elements i see here and i doubt id care for the region of the flies below it so if i go south and then crewel lye loop around to the west belowum i dont see castle roogna on this map she cocked her head and wiggled her toes considering i have heard the name faintly we elves dont concern ourselves overmuch with human business but all the other details should be right i think your castle is south of the thei dont quite remember what but south of it maybe here she pointed to the bottom section of the map marked here there be ogres and shuddered ogres naturally i knew of those huge awful crea tures but never had i seen one thats the sort of ad venture im looking for i exclaimed when i recover my strength she glanced at me with feminine concern you are ill no not exactly i was severely wounded by i broke off as she began to protest i knowsave it for the tribe anyway ill recover fully in a few days so thats all right its mainly a matter of regrowing my lost muscle tissue ill be in fit condition by the time i en counter the ogres then ill go to castle roogna and see what adventure awaits me there this map will help me get there faster thank you bluebell so you accept my favor she said pleased certainly i do i agreed now what do you want from me she gazed at me with eerie intensity i think you wouldnt understand yet she said but when you are ready ill tell you i shrugged just so its before i depart your charming elf elm realm it will be jordanman she assured me then the elves cleared away the remnants of the meal and faced the tree in a great circle the king elf stood beside the trunk clapping his hands for silence thats crownofthoms bluebell whispered to me she was now perched on my shoulder dangling her legs down into my right shirt pocket she was so light i hardly felt her and her grasp on my right ear to steady herself was like a caress crewel lye crewel lye king crownof thorns spoke and a wellspoken king was he i welcome the traveling barbarian man who visits us this day he said formally i invite him to ex change entertainments with us first we shall show him ours and from the towering foliage of the elf elm descended ten elven damsels suspended by threads pirouetting in the air they came to rest just above the ground then began to swing like pendulum bobs their motions slow because of the length of their threads they bounced in unison spreading arms and legs as they swung around the tree then they swung in differing directions forming patterns that changed before my eyes could quite grasp them generating fleeting impressions of stunning beauty in and out they wove now together now apart now linking hands now spinning separately it was a unified dance lovely in its parts and in its whole and i was duly enchanted then the damsels dropped to the ground and a dozen male elves approached the tree these were young healthy specimens muscular and coordinatedthe equivalent of barbarians their dance was on the ground and it incor porated feats of strength they spread out in a wide circle about the elm each lifted a sizable stone held it a mo ment then dropped it then they moved into a tighter circle where larger stones had been set each lifted one of these with no more apparent difficulty than he had lifted the smaller one to my surprise once again they contracted the circle where lay yet larger stones and each picked up one of these i wondered whether the larger stones were of lighter sub stance to make this possible pumice for examplemagic stone spewn up from the depths some of it so light it would float on water that would explain what i observed here king crownofthorns spied my perplexity you doubt honored man he declaimed we will show you the magic of our tree fetch us the largest log you can carry go ahead bluebell urged in my ear her breath tick ling it your present strength is enough for that isnt it for a small log i agreed i got up and searched nearby and there conveniently laid out were several logs of assorted sizes i hefted one and found it too light my strength had already recovered somewhat i tried an other and it sufficed it was all i could handle in my present condition i got it up on my shoulder displacing bluebell who scampered nimbly onto my head and clung to my hair and i staggered toward the elm despite my effort i was aware of bluebell clinging to my head her feet now on my left shoulder her torso plastered across my left ear and her maidenly bosom squeezed against my hair this will do the king said indicating a spot on the ground some distance from the tree with relief i set down the log letting one end thunk solidly to the ground then easing the rest of it down no elf would move that but the elves intended to try as i backed off the twelve approached the log they set themselves about it and got their little hands under it and heaved together it wobbled but didnt lift i was not surprised since each elf was a quarter of my height depth and breadth that meant each was about onesixtyfourth my mass that was why bluebell was so slight on my shoulder i could have supported her whole weight readily with my littlest finger so each elf might be able to heft onesixtyfourth what i could and all twelve togetherwell im not that apt at math in my head but it seemed reasonable that all twelve elves acting in concert could lift only a fifth as much as i could maybe less of course i did not have my full strength back and they had many little hands and had to lift the log only marginally off the ground still chances were it was three times as heavy as they could manage the elves gathered at one end and lifted and shoved the ground was uneven and this end was slightly raised so they were able to pivot the log about its center support without lifting it they got it parallel to the elm then they all pushed and slowly it rolled toward the tree well they were using their minds now and leverage helped crewel lye that was the way to do it the velocity of the roll in creased as it went then they stopped they ranged themselves on either side of the log and heavedand this time they actually got it up amazed i watched as they carried it to the region where the first small rocks had been dropped there they set it down and six elves walked away the re maining six tackled the logand lifted it theres something funny here i exclaimed twelve couldnt lift it before and now theres more jordanman bluebell murmured tick lishly into my ear i watched the elves carried the log to the second ring of stones there they set it down and three of them de parted the remaining three got at each end and the mid dle of the log now im sure they cant i began the log came up i gaped they were doing it bluebell tweaked my ear we elves have magic you men wot not she whispered then i swear she kissed the rim of my ear im not sure which startled me more the loglifting or the miniature kiss what was going on here the three carried the log to the third ring of stones and paused then the two at the ends let go and walked away and the lone elf in the center carried the log the rest of the way to the trunk of the elm i couldnt let this impossibility pass i got up and strode to the tree i want to check that log i said it was in my mind that they had found a way to make things lighter near the tree the elf set it down i reached down and picked it up barely the thing was every bit as heavy as it had been how had he then i felt something odd i was rising i looked downand discovered that the elf was pick ing me up by my shoes his tiny hands gripped each of my heels and i was in the air still holding the log i began to wobble as much from surprise as from unbalance and he set me down then i put down the log crewel lye and stood dazed i had succeeded only in further confus ing myself the elves around the tree were smiling mer rily it is the tree jordan bluebell told me we elves grow stronger as we approach it thats why we always camp near an elf elm you mean but already i saw that it was true the stonesas the elves strength increased they had lifted larger stones it had been no trick just a demon stration at the base of the tree the strength of an elf became practically infinite females too want me to pick you up she asked i can do it here beside the elm youdo elves keep getting weaker away from the tree yes but its on a declining curve we change rapidly near the tree slowly away from it as long as we dont range out too far were all right and if a monster attacks you we retreat as far as we need toward the elm she agreed we protect the elms and they protect us the magic doesnt affect anyone who isnt ofelven stock so our retreats are almost impregnable an elven child could heave a monster away but we dont go out of our way to bother other folk that explained why elves werent seen much around the fen where i had been reared there were no elf elms in that vicinity now it is your turn she said you must tell your story for we elves are very curious about the other spe cies and regions of xanth i hope it is a good tale i shrugged i can embellish it if you wish no we prefer the truth so i settled down by the tree and narrated my story much as have been doing here and they listened atten tively and asked intelligent questions they really were interested and i saw a scribeelf making notes it seemed to me that what i had to tell was actuallyif youll excuse the expressionpretty mundane stuff since i had slain no dragons and encountered no phenomenal sorceries crewel lye but they really were interested and at the end satisfied the odd thing was that they seemed most taken with the portions they knew most about rather than those that were beyond their experience bluebell had said they wanted to hear the truth so that was what i gave them unexciting as it might be and they liked that later i realized that this was only in part en tertainment for them they were also judging me and on the basis of my story they judged me to be an honest man though they asked some very penetrating questions about my talent for healing finally perceiving that they doubted i suggested that they cut off my fingers and watch them regrow they recoiled i think not so much from horror at the notion of deliberate injury as from not wishing to seem to cast aspersion on my integrity so i simply rubbed my forearm along the blade of my sword cutting the skin so that blood flowed then held up my arm so that they could see how rapidly it healed they protested strenuously that such a demonstration was not necessary but in their very pro testation i concluded that it was as i said i am not expert in the judging of other cultures so maybe i have misin terpreted whatever significance existed now it was growing late in the day the elves served some sort of fragrant grog in leaf mugs mine was tiny of course but i drank itand the stuff burned down my throat and filled my belly with fire and sent my head floating somewhere above my body potent stuff it is time for the favor bluebell informed me favor i asked confused oh yes tell me this way she said leading me back to the tree i walked somewhat unsteadily feeling the grog that is to say groggy i stopped at the base of the trunk but she proceeded to climb the elm i cant go up there i protested eying the virtually vertical ascent the tree was large having had time to grow during the centuries the elves had pro tected it two human men would barely be able to reach around it there were no low branches it was a great column rising to the mass of foliage far above crewel lye yes you can jordan she told me the grog gives you the power dubiously i tried it i put my hands to the barkand they clung as if cemented i brought up a foot and it adhered similarly when i lifted one hand it came free so i could take hold higher like a fly i could walk the wall this of course explained how flies did it they sneaked sips of elven grog so i followed her up though the height was dizzying if the magic failed i knew i would fall and be killed but i wasnt worried for three reasons first i did not believe the elves meant me any harm so the grogspell should hold second if i did fall my body would heal the breaks within a day so death would be only temporary third the pleasant stupor the grog has put me in made all this a matter of indifference i simply didnt care it seemed almost natural to be following a dollsized elf lass up a huge tree at last we reached the first bifurcation of branches and entered the foliage bluebell led me up through it until we came to a great tangle of mistletoe in the highest reach the points of the missiles and toes scratched me but i healed in seconds bluebell entered this mass and i fol lowed discovering a way through and lo inside it was a great globed nest with pillows and a comfortable floor the fading light of day filtered in through the levels in diffused fashion pleasantly illuminating leaves and vines of many colors i lay against the resilient and fragrant leaf wall this is lovely i said now what is the favor i owe you do you need some heavy object carried down to the ground or lifted up from the ground though with their super strength it hardly seemed the elves would need my help there she smiled as if finding something funny girls of any species can be like that you need lift no object too heavy to manage jordan she said well im ready to serve name it it is the service that only you can give she said your most precious possession crewel lye dismay sliced through my daze abolishing it you want my sword she looked at me astonished then tumbled over in laughter i had to laugh too for it seemed it was not my weapon she was after and indeed i realized that a crea ture her size and sex would have no way to handle it i pondered and sobered again realizing what an elf would want of a man like me my horse bluebell managed not to laugh this time but obviously she was feeling merry she came to sit on my knee as she had done below now how could i get a ghost horse up here she asked and then the laughter bubbled up and overflowed again elves certainly are merry folk well i know elves need transportation and hauling away from the tree i said a creature like pook doesnt lose strength but i saw she was just about to fall off my knee with mirth and of course i was relieved to know that this had not been a ploy to demand popk he really would have felt i had betrayed him and certainly i had not intended to do that butwhat do you want elven maid im out of precious possessions i dont know why she was so overbubbling with laugh ter you can not guess jordanman im only a barbarian warrior not too smart i re minded her somewhat tersely but honest and strong and nice she said and not good at riddles i added annoyed she unbuttoned her green tunic slipped out of it and sat again on my elevated knee she was a lovely miniature woman in every respect now can you guess jordan man you want me to fetch new clothing for you this time she doubled up and rolled about with the force of her laughter in the process showing a good deal more than she ought and landing in a pretty heap in my lap oh barbarian you still have something to leam about elvesor about women she said when she had recovered some of her breath i know about women i replied somewhat stiffly remembering elsie i never claimed to be expert on elves crewel lye i knew of you little folk mainly by hearsay until i met you today you seem very like human beings except for your size and your magic there you utter truth indeed but still she seemed to be bursting with some horrendously humorous secret you dont know the nature of an accommodationspell i shook my head no oh this is fan she exclaimed peering up at me and kicking her legs about i knew barbarians only by hear say too youre much more fun than i expected thank you i said awkwardly for your information man the accommodationspell was fashioned by one of the magicians of your kind i think his name is yinyang he packages spells of all types and peddles them to anyone who is interested i never heard of him i think he lives down near castle roogna castle roogna i exclaimed thats where im going so you said after completing my favor yes if youd only tell me what she tired of teasing me jordan you force me to be direct i want your help to summon the stork she said or words to that effect i want a babya halfling able to be among men and elves i gaped at her thats impossible i protested the sizeitiive got to get out of here the favor she cried you promised but here ill invoke the spell she said she made a gesture with her hands there was a flash and then a fanny wrenching sensation when my equilibrium reestablished itself i discovered that the bower had expanded enormously it was now twice as big in diameter as it had been and eight times the volume lengthvolume judgments come readily to a person who may have to carry home the mass of the animal he puts an arrow through he quickly learns that twice the height means a good deal more than twice the crewel lye weight the cushion i sat on was now more like a small bed how do you like me now jordan bluebell asked i turned my head to look at herand gaped again she was my sizeor as close as a woman need be she was phenomenal the attributes that had been cute when she was small were now voluptuous iwhat hap pened she laughed yet again its the spell she explained it accommodated us you are now an eighth your former mass and i am eight times mine so were the same i looked at the bower again and the cushion yes every dimension had doubled which meant that my own di mensions had halved i was half as tall half as wide and half as deep while she had doubled every dimension it certainly made a difference but the baby i protested if when she corrected me when the uh the stork bringswhat size will be my size of course so i can take proper care of him she said until he leaves the tree thenwho knows some halflings can change size i certainly never expected this i said so i gathered she said well lets not waste time i know you want to get on with your more interesting adventures where there be ogres and such there is no point in describing in tedious detail what followed ill just say that elven maidens are fully as adept in summoning storks as are human maidens and i was glad to do my part when i had done it i got ready to leave the bower but bluebell held me back not yet she said oh well the accommodationspell hadnt dissipated yet so there was no point in my leaving the bower then i would be too small to do much adventuring we ate for the bower was stocked with giant fruits and nuts and bags of beverage i suppose they were nor mal size i was the one who had changed anyway we feasted there was a privy region for other natural func crewel lye tions then i napped for perhaps an hour and felt much improved when i woke it seemed she wanted to signal the stork again so we did that when that was done again i thought it was time to depart but again she restrained me so we had another meal and another sleep all very nice and i woke yet further restored it turned out that she wished to generate a third message to the storkor maybe she figured that three storks were better than oneand she was so lovely and persistent that i could do no less than cooperate now it is complete she said the stork will come youre sure i asked maybe it would be better to send a few more messages she laughed as she did so readily you are truly delightful jordanman but i have held you too long al ready i have felt the storks acknowledgment the baby will be delivered in due course that was the funny thing about the stork it insisted on a delay before delivery maybe this was to give the prospective mother time to change her mind or learn how to pin diapers but i knew bluebells mind was set she wanted that halfling so she dismissed me and i had to depart such is the life of an adventurer its certainly been fun i told her and ill remember it always she kissed me one last time youre sweet then she waved her arms reversing the spell and in a moment we were back to our original sizes we drank another draught of grog and left the bower climbing through the foliage and on down the massive trunk of the elm the other elves of the tribe were awaiting us at the base we have cared for your horse these three days barbarian king crownofthorns told me three days i said incredulously aye man did you not know it seemed like three hours now we must see to the augur the king said he led us to an old woman elf who sat at a shaped stone and had a sparkling ball before her crewel lye bluebell stopped before the old woman the fate of my baby she said the woman picked up the ball and flung it at bluebell the ball expanded to englobe her for a moment then contracted and returned to its place on the stone the woman peered into its sparkles which now seemed to have a different pattern a son she said he will leave you when he matures and go seek a wife among the human kind he will never achieve notoriety but his des cendants may thank you bluebell said sounding disappointed evidently she had hoped for more aware of this the woman peered more closely tracing down a particular sparkle let me seethere is one far down the line centuries henceyes she will consort with human kings of xanth oh bluebell exclaimed brightening then the old elfess threw the globe at me surprised i stepped back but it expanded to my size and englobed me for an instant i was dazzled by the sparkles then they were gone and the globe was back on the stone the elfess little face turned grim as she contemplated the sparkles lets pass on this one she muttered no i want to know i said if i am to be ancestor to the consort of kings what it says about me should be known the elfess grimaced you will be doomed by a cruel lie she told me yet it is not the end after your flesh has rotted you will find true love uh thank you i said no more thrilled than bluebell had been at first i didnt really believe in fortunetelling but i didnt really disbelieve either then the gathering dissipated the king bade me fare well ironic as that might seem after the prophecy and bluebell climbed up to give me a parting kiss i went to pook who had been happily grazing for three days on the rich elfsward and was fit and fat he had not tried to leave for that would have implied that he was not my true steed and the elves might have become awk wardly suspicious so he had stayed and when the elven crewel lye children had begged him for rides in the name of the barbarian man he had obliged i knew he was not yet tame merely smart enough to play the role he had to just as i had been up in the bower of the elf elm i mounted and rode away pausing at the fringe of the glade to wave to the assembled elves they waved back then somewhat sadly i moved on chapter bundle of joy i rode through the pleasant elfkept forest feel ing better as the poignancy of parting passed i had indeed spent three days with the elves my body had completed its process of healing and i was at full strength again maybe that had been one reason bluebell held me so longto send me out into the jungle fully ready rather than partly ready if so she had done me a favor beyond my realization at the time surely the other elves would not have let me stay once she finished with me they were businesslike folk at heart but if i ever encountered another such tribe i would be sure to pay my respects i liked their mode of entertaining travelers the map showed that i was approaching dragon coun try but i couldnt skirt it to the west the elements of earth and air were there marked unfit for occupancy the map was accurate about the northern regions i had already traversed and i believed it about the southern ones that left the eastern side and i decided to go that route how nice to have forewarning about the dragons naturally barbarians boast of slaying dragons but the closer a barbarian actually gets to a dragon the less in clined he feels toward combat i found myself in abso lutely no hurry now so i veered pook east crewel lye crewel lye we traveled for a day without event things were quiet in the elven region there werent even any tangle trees it occurred to me that in some respects the elven society was superior to the human one it certainly wasnt this pleasant or safe in the vicinity of fen village but as we left the elven region the terrain became rougher and we came up against the river the map showed as originating in the south and flowing north parallel to the more distant coast i considered crossing it but there were flashes of color in the waters depths and pook balked he remembered the sharks in the bog and i couldnt blame him so we turned south into dragon country after all then pook sniffed winding something he wasnt afraid just nervous so i let him go toward it it turned out to be a patch of blood on the forest floor a scratchy trail and a few feathers some bird came down to drink from the river i conjectured and some predator attacked it bird got away but injured happens all the time in the wilder ness but still pook sniffed perplexed theres more i asked want to track down the bird i warn you it wont be pretty i knew that few horses ghost or otherwise had much taste for blood pook sniffed out the trail and i let him he had a better nose than i had thought why was he so interested in this then we came in sight of the bird it was a white stork with a broken wingand it had a bundle i doubletook astonished this stork was making a de livery that bundle contained a baby could bluebell no as i said there was always a delay of several months before the baby was delivered the bureaucratic lapse differed and tended to be longest for human beings evidently storks didnt like human peo ple as well as they liked mouse people or gremlin folk or whatever certainly the wait was more than a day for elves besides the bundle was way too big to hold an elfling the stork looked at me his eyes were glazed with pain friend or foe he asked you talk i asked stupidly it was difficult to believe that such a long hard beak could form human syllables but it was also not easy to believe that those backward bending knees could enable it to walk if we disbelieved everything that was hard we wouldnt believe in xanth at all i talk he agreed i dont fly at the moment i suf fered a mishap he craned his head about on his mar velously supple neck to eye his torn wing from which blood still dripped are you planning to help or hinder uh to help i guess i said awkwardly i hadnt known that storks conversed with people like this if they spoke our language why did we have to make such in tricate signals when ordering babies it should be easier just to send a letter noimmediately i relized that il literates like me would never be able to order offspring then so there had to be a nonverbal or nonwritten signal anyway i had never met a stork before evidently their line of business required human communication at times so they were trained for it but i dont know exactly what i can do im not apt at heating others theres a healing spring south of thei forget what but thats where it is the stork said i realized that the birds brain was suffering some fuzziness i could fly there quicklyi know right where it isif i could fly but that confounded little dragon caught me unawares i pecked it on the snout and it ran home to its mother but alas my wing was already gone so ill just have to hoof it so to speak i studied the bundle that looks pretty heavy i re marked are you sure you can carry it in your condi tion i must deliver the stork said folding his good wing across his breast and gazing reverently upward uh yes maybe we can give you a ride the stork looked at pook that would be appreciated but its a fair bit by foot and its to ogre country crewel lye crewel lye thats where were going i said let me give you a hand with that i reached for the bundle there was a growl and a hairy hand came out and grasped my wrist with appalling strength startled i jerked my hand awayand the thing came right out of the bun dle hanging onto my wrist it was a hairy mass of glower and growl thats no baby i cried shocked yes it is the stork said tiredly a baby ogre tech nically an ogret i told you where i was taking it so you did i agreed barbarians are not too bright about some things i had missed the obvious connection of course ogres had babies too just as did humans and elves hardly as nice as humans and elves but a similar principle now how do i get this little monster off my wrist the matter was getting urgent because the ogret was chinning himself up onehanded and was angling to bite off my hand knock him on the head until he lets go the stork advised but hes a baby thats how ogres show affection oh live and leam rapped the baby on his stony skull with my free knuckle bruising my hand and he let go and dropped back into the bag wed better deliver him before he gets hungry the stork said excellent notion i loaded stork and bundle on pook then mounted the ogret grabbed onto a link of chain and started chewing on it the three of us were crowded but pook could handle it apparently he had some sympathy with the plight of the stork pook was a pretty decent animal really the ghost horse started out at a brisk pace i knew why there was an incoming smell of dragon on the wind how long would it take for the dragonlet to bring its mother back here its really not far toto the stork remarked but seemed to forget what he was going to say it was as if his blood were draining right out of his memory there was a sound i felt a shiver that was a dragon snort off to the right i was in no mood at the moment to take on a dragon i urged pook to faster speed but he needed no urging he fairly flew across the land i looked back over my shoulder to check on stork and ogret the stork had his feet hooked firmly into a chain so was secure but the ogret had chewed almost through the link he was working on stop that i snapped at him and he growled and continued chewing the trouble with ju veniles these days is that they have no discipline the dragon heard us of course and moved to intercept us dragons have phenomenal ears that tune in on what ever interests them what interests them most is prey and just about any living creature is prey to a dragon i had heard folk tales about single men fighting and slaying sin gle dragons but the closer i came to that sort of activity the less i believed it the fact is the smallest grown dragon is generally more than a match for the largest man unless that man has magic i did have magic of course but i wasnt sure how much good it would do me in the belly of a dragon i suppose in time my bones would reconstitute from the dragon droppings and i would re cover but i didnt care to try that out certainly there would be some discomfort and awkwardness who wants to wake in the middle of a pile of dragon manure pook was making excellent time we were leaving the dragon behind but then another popped up ahead and i knew we were in trouble in fact i was coming to resent the myth that barbarian warriors love to fight dragons it seemed that the dragons were the first to believe it being eager for the fray there is a distinction between adven ture and folly that even the average barbarian is aware of we veered to the left to the bank of the river the river was smaller here than it had been downstream but when we sought to cross it a water dragon lifted its head and hissed no escape there hang onive got to fight i warned supposedly barbarians fight just for the fun of it thats a halftruth crewel lye we enjoy combat when we expect to win with dragons the odds are inclement i guided pook with my legs he was very responsive knowing that once again his halflife was on the line as much as my whole life was i anchored my left hand on a chain and lifted my good sword with my right the dragon behind me was a firebreather so we stayed clear of it the one in front was a smoker that would be no fun but was a better risk than fire they say that where theres smoke theres fire but thats not generally true among dragons they also say that more people die from smoke inhalation than from direct bums buti didnt trust that so we charged the smoker snouton the dragon opened his mouth inhaling naturally he didnt stay stuffed with smoke all the time any more than a man holds his breath all the time the smoke is gen erated in the belly at need a bit like gas in the human belly and it takes a moment to work up the proper pres sure and richness i did not allow the dragon that time i came up so fast that i arrived just as the first puff of smoke started out i didnt bother with anything fancy i simply rammed the point of my sword up his right nostril since i was hanging onto pook and pook was charging forward that thrust packed a lot of wallop the sword shoved its full length up the dragons nose and my gloved hand followed it and also my arm up to the elbow it was an excellent shot i knew the point had skewered the creatures tiny brain that wasnt a mortal wound of course but it did cause the monster some dis comfort dragons dont really like having swords rammed up their noses and they can get quite perturbed about having their brains skewered for one thing it causes their coordination to suffer somewhat and thats incon venient when one is engaged in mortal combat i braced my body against the dragons warm snoot and hauled out my sword a gout of blood followed it dousing me in gore but the dragons head of smoke was already under way and now this shoved the gore clear and blasted out to surround us i held my breath of course and trusted the others were doing the same its a natural and sensible crewel lye reflex i urged pook away from there he obeyed with alacrity and in a moment we emerged from the smoke ball the dragon was thrashing and choking as the blood and smoke mixed in his nostril to form smog blood and smoke are relatively harmless separately but smog can be deadly the hole in the monsters brain was bothering it too so it wasnt handling its pipes as well as otherwise thus the smoker was preoccupied for the moment and we didnt need to worry about him but now the firebreather caught up go for the tail i told pook i meant the tail of the smoker which might shield us from some of the blast of the firebreathers breath but the ghost horse misunderstood and galloped for the wrong tail naturally the dragons head whipped about a jet of fire chasing us in an apparent curve we hurdled the tail just as the fire caught upand the dragon toasted its own tail now dragons have insulated pipes for the fire but their flesh lacks that protection you should have heard the roar it made south i cried pook oriented south and shot forward like an arrow the two hurting dragons bumped into each other and got tangled in their own coils by the time they realized we were gone we were too far gone for them to catch us id like to claim that this was my consummate skill in maneuvering but it was simple gardenvariety luck and i wouldnt care to try it again but we werent home free yet a flying dragon had been attracted by the commotion and was cruising over head it had not descended while it looked as if the big landbound dragons would eat us but now it looped about and zeroed in i saw its body huffing up fire and knew we had to get out of the way in a hurry we couldnt outrun that river i cried pook angled for the river trusting my judgment and his hooves struck the water as the first jet of fire slanted down the fire missed generating a huge hiss of steam as it hit the water water never did much like fire and the sentiment was mutual crewel lye the water dragon humped up it elevated its head and roared at the flier angry at this poaching in its preserve when the flier didnt sheer off fast enough the water dragon pursed its lips and squirted a column of water up scoring on one wing now the flier changed course spin ning out of control the blast of water had dislocated one wing i know how that feels the stork remarked as the dragon tumbled into the water we got back on land and galloped south again having escaped all four dragons no doubt i would boast to my grandchildren of this exploitbut i never wanted to run that particular gantlet again then a second flier appeared and drew a bead on us this was the land of dragons all right trees i yelled pook headed for a copse of trees ahead i hoped their trunks and foliage would help shield us from the flame but then the horse braked to a halt what are you doing i cried then i saw why the copse perched on the edge of a monstrous fissure in the ground it was a sheer cliff leading down beyond vision we couldnt go there whats that i asked in credulously now i remember the stork said its the gap chasm cant think why i forgot about it before ive flown over it hundreds of times its not on the map i muttered what a thing to leave off then the flying dragon caught up its jet flame seared down pook leaped out of the waybut the fringe of the fire touched us it fried my right arm and heated the hilt of my sword stovehot the storks feathers caught fire the ogret growled as his bag smoldered pook leaped again and the chains on his body slipped around his barrel and we were dumped hard on the ground my face smacked into a rock and the whole land of xanth seemed to whirl about me i saw my sword fling freeright over the brink of the chasm then i lost con crewel lye sciousness i do that when i get knocked hard enough embarrassing as it is when i woke i could tell by the slant of the shadow that only a little time had passed my talent was already healing me after all it was only a burn and a fall but i wasnt able to move yet maybe my neck had been bro ken paralyzing me and that hadnt healed yet so i lay there with my head on the ground absolutely still and saw what i could see nearby was the bundle of joy with a short length of chain dangling from it the little monster had chewed right through the link beyond was the bashed body of the stork the fire had burned away the feathers and cooked the rest the stork was dead there was no sign of pook he had his freedom at last if he had managed to escape the dragon well i couldnt blame him for that i had not done too good a job of protecting us from evil then i saw a shadow the dragon was returning that was good for pook for it meant he had found cover and hidden from the monster but it was bad for me i willed my neck to heal but nerves cant be rushed and bone is slower yet i still couldnt move anything below my head and anyway my sword was gone how could i fight off a firebreathing flying dragon barehanded the dragon spiraled down and glided to a landing it was ready to feed it hobbled along the ground weak on its feet in the fashion of its subtype and snapped up the body of the stork two chomps and the bird was gone the dragon hobbled another pace and reached for the bundle of joy suddenly the bag burst open the ogrets hairy arm came out and it swung the length of chain in an arc that smacked the links smartly across the dragons nose little stars flew up and a comet whirled away it had been a hard strike the dragon blinked then it hissed it pumped its bel lows preparing for another blast of fire to cook this ar rogant morsel just as the flame was ready the ogrets ugly head popped out of the bag few things in xanth are as ugly as an ogres puss and the sudden appearance of such a crewel lye crewel lye grotesquerie can be a shock growr he growled in the dragons face if there is one thing worse than an ogres puss its his growl the dragon was so startled he swallowed his fire in fact it backfired there was a sort of internal rushing sound and flame shot out of the dragons tail the mon ster straightened its system reamed out then curled and thrashed about as the heat of the fire cooked its own flesh it rolled across the groundand tumbled over the cliff now at last my neck healed the paralysis left me and i sat up my right arm remained inoperative but was also improving you do have your points ogre baby i said for it was a fact that the ogret had just saved me from getting toasted and consumed there was the sound of hooves pook was returning whats this i asked as i stood are you tame now pook snorted indignantly and swished his tail he glanced back over his mane i looked more dragons were coming they had us surrounded i should have known i said flexing my recovering arm you figure i can get you out of this pook nodded he had confidence in me maybe he had given me more credit for dealing with the flying dragon than i deserved i considered briefly well we cant go back the way we came and my swords down in thewhat did the stork call it the gap chasm the ogret growled oh yes said you need to be delivered and the stork cant do it i guess i do owe you a favor that reminded me of bluebell elf and the favors i had exchanged with her my map was gone burned but i no longer needed it anyway the gap had not been on it i thought again how odd it was that the map should be in error about so gross a feature of landscape when the elves were generally so meticulous about accuracy and the stork had been unable to remember it until ac tually seeing it maybe there was magic involved i peered down the cliff it was impassable i looked east along itand saw the river it flowed up the cliff face over the lip and on to the north where i knew it broadened out into a refuge for water dragons it hadnt occurred to me that a river could flow up a wall but of course there was a lot of xanth i hadnt seen before i have heard it said that travel broadens the mind it cer tainly was doing so for me maybe there i murmured i loaded the bundle of joy on the ghost horse and the hairy hand latched onto another length of chain i knew the strength of that hand he would be secure i mounted and guided pook east to the river again i flexed my right arm it was just about better now i dont know how id survive without my healing talent we reached the river before the dragons did the water at the lip was too shallow for the water dragon fortu nately we could cross itbut so could the land dragons no real escape there how about down into the chasm well wade upstream i told pook putting more con fidence into my voice than i felt i headed him for the water at the brink his ears went flat back and he balked so i dismounted and led him i stood at the lip then stepped over my body tilted around at a ninetydegree angle and i found myself standing on the face of the cliff kneedeep in water it was working after a moment with the dragons closing in pook followed his forehooves passed the corner and he strad dled the lip as if it were the top of a pyramid his belly almost scraping then he got his hind legs across and stood with me his head pointing down into the gap see i said it has to be level for the water to flow without falling rivers have ways of navigating that we can only emulate as long as we wade we wont fall i certainly hoped that was true but pook remained uncertain so i continued to lead him we waded upstream downcliff a dragon poked its head over the corner but lacked the courage to follow after a moment the dragon fired a jet of flame but the perspective confused it and the jet missed we proceeded out of range fortunately no more flying dragons ap peared maybe this region was awkward for their flying crewel lye crewel lye the water was cold the chill of it soon soaked through my boots and into my feet wed better get to the bottom of this i remarked looking down into the gap but the bottom was still a long way ahead i moved to the edge of the water channel hoping the effect extended beyond the water but i was cautious i scooped up a handful of water and hurled it to the side out of the channel the moment the water left the region of the channel it made a rightangle turn and took off forward acceler ating toward the base of the cliff i couldnt hear the splat as it struck but i knew i did not want to go that route myself nevertheless my toes were becoming numb and i could see that pook wasnt comfortable either no one likes to get cold feet at this rate our toes would freeze before we could get out of the water i had to do some thing i bent to peer into the water now i saw small fish swimming in it i scooped one upand cold stabbed through my hand that was one cold fish i wish i had a hotfoot i said or a hot dog that would drive away the cold fish but wishes wouldnt do me much good i needed something more tangible and immediate my feet were freezing i glanced back again at pook he was shivering my eye fell on the bundle of joy a notion bulbflashed in my skull so brightly that i suspect some light leaked out of my ears i went to pooks side selected a chain and yanked it upward naturally it descended on the other side as all the chains went around and around his barrel the ogret went down with it for he was chewing on it and refused to let go i suppose teething is rough for babies i contin ued to haul until the ogret hung upside down below pooks belly he didnt let go for no one had knocked him on the head but when his head dipped into the frigid water he was annoyed for no ogre likes to be coolheaded he roared the force of the roar sent froth shooting through the river the cold fish scattered in terror and the water warmed i hauled down on the chain and ogret came up on the other side until he was upright again still chewing on the link we proceeded onward after a while the cold fish came back so i repeated the performance and drove them away again by the third time they collected we had reached the foot of the cliff and were able to step out on upright land that was a relief now we were in the gap chasm the river crossed its base arid went up the far wall came down it that is no doubt we could walk up that the same way we had walked down but i thought id explore for an alternate route i didnt like having to dunk the ogret all the time and didnt want to be caught with cold feet halfway up if that trick didnt work so i got on pook and we traveled west along the floor of the chasm i spied my trusty sword lying near the river beside the body of the flying dragon the ogret had back fired i recovered my blade welcoming it like an old friend washed it in the river and watched bemusedly as the bloodstained water flowed around the corner and up the wall fascinating then i dried the sword on the hot hide of the flying dragon and returned to pook it was pleasant here with green grass bushes and patterns of racks and dragon tracks dragon tracks i examined them more closely yes these were the spoor of a big dragon one who evidently hunted here that made me a trifle nervous i had already had enough experience with dragons to last me the rest of my life a life that would not necessarily be long if i encountered one more dragon i was nervous with reason now pooks ears perked and i heard it too whompwhompwhomp that was the whomp of a lowslung heavyset dragon the sound was coming from the east so we galloped west soon i looked back and saw ita horrendously toothed monster of the steam variety whomping wasnt crewel lye the most efficient way to travel but with a creature this size it was fast enough pook put on a little more speed and we stayed com fortably ahead of the dragon that was one big advantage to having a horse but i saw that the chasm was narrow ing and this made me nervous suppose it deadended that was one hefty steamer back there i didnt think i could slay it it would take a fullgrown ogre to fight that thing an ogre i glanced back at the bundle of joy no that was a baby ogre formidable enough for his age but only a tiny fraction of the ugliness and power of a grown one some qualities of ugliness take a lifetime to achieve wed simply have to escape this dragonwhich would be easy enough if the gap remained wide and impossible if the gap became too narrow i didnt really care to gamble that the chasm would favor us i looked at the cliffs on either side no hope there we needed a channel a level path cut into the steep slope that a horse could navigate one trouble about this was that anything a horse could travel a dragon of this con figuration could also travel still if we followed the path and stayed ahead until we got out of the chasm this was the stuff of daydreams there was no path cut into the side the floor of the chasm became corrugated there were ridges in it as if the walls had squeezed together and wrinkled the base these ridges gradually rose up until they were as high as pook i didnt like this we were being channelized and i preferred room to dodge the dragon if one of these little channels should deadend it would slow us in scrambling out and the dragon would gain on us pook sniffed you smell something i asked if its a way out im for it he came to an intersection of channels and swung left the walls of this channel rose up higher up to my riding head height then abruptly the channel ended pooks hooves skidded churning up turf but he couldnt stop in time we spun halfway around and crashed crewel lye into the end dirt shook down as we righted ourselves and the ogret growled then i saw a tunnel slanting back it hadnt been visible from the other side as the entrance was narrow and i heard the approaching whomp of the dragon get in there i cried pook squeezed in as the dragon whomped by i was afraid the dragon would turn and pursue us so i urged the ghost horse on into the darkness as my eyes adjusted i was able to see because wan rays of light leaked in through cracks this tunnel was close to the surface but never quite emerging where did it go it twisted in wormlike fashion to the right and then began to rise surely we would break out of the ridge any momentnow but we didnt then i saw a larger crack and paused to peer through it there was the chasmslightly below us we were in the wall we continued on up the tunnel meandered up and down and around and sometimes formed large spirals in the earth but generally trended upward i hoped it was a way to the surface it smelled dank and there were spider webs in the cracks so it seemed long disused but it had to go somewhere wherever that was that was where we were going it took a long time but our hope ascended as the tunnel did and we got there the tunnel finally debouched into a lesser crevice one running at right angles to the gap chasm but intersecting it well above the base so that we could not have entered here without using the worm tun nel we followed this one south until it lost interest and surfaced and we returned at last to the ordinary ground ofxanth this was the heart of what the lost map claimed was ogre countrywhich was right where i wanted to be now all i had to do was deliver the bundle of joy to its expecting family and proceed to castle roogna i found i had lost any interest i might have had in challenging a mature ogre to heroic combat if a baby ogre was this horrendous i had better stay away from a grown one crewel lye but also i no longer saw ogres as bestial monsters be cause of the ogret i realized that they had personalities and families just as real people did its hard to condemn any creature whose glare and growl has stopped a dragon from consuming you but where was the ogrets family ogre country was a broad vast region there could be many ogre tribes and many families within each tribe how could i know which one was the right one without that information how could i deliver this bundle of joy it was evening now and i was hungry after the days adventure so i foraged for food finding some fruits for the ogret i didnt know what babies ate but suspected this one would eat anything after all if he teethed on chains my assumption seemed to be correct i offered him a banana and he grabbed it in one hairy mitt squished it in the center so that the pulp shot out at either end and jammed the remaining skin into his maw he took an apple squeezed it so hard juice spurted and gulped down the skin and seeds with evident gusto this sort of eating was messy but of course babies are messy eaters i gave him a milkweed pod afraid that he would just squish the milk all over himself but this one he chose to swallow whole finally i gave him a pomegranate and he really liked that he knocked the granate on his head cracking the stone open then picked out the red juicy seeds threw them away swallowed the stone and burped up a seed he had overlooked he was really sort of cute in his hor rendous fashion taking care of a baby it turned out was no problem at all my only concern was changing the diaper but it seemed the ogret hadnt existed long enough to process food all the way through yet so the diaper remained clean that was just as well since i wasnt sure i had the strength to take it away from him for cleaning i didnt worry about pook either he could go off now if he wished to since i had gotten most of the way to castle roogna and he no longer needed me to save him crewel lye from being taken over by elves or eaten by dragons or whatever we could get along without each other i leaned back against an acom tree what am i going to do with you ogre baby i asked rhetorically as i held out a fruitpunch naturally the ogret punched it juice exploded and the baby crammed the husk into his big mouth he spat a seed at me that just missed my head and embedded itself in the tree trunk behind me and growled contentedly the shudder of the seedshock trav eled up the trunk and caused the branches of the tree to shake dislodging a corn which thunked into the ground before the ogret he picked it up and chewed on it i saw a sparkle on him what could it be i reached for it but he grabbed for my hand so i had to let it be but it was something he wore what would an undelivered baby wear what else except an address tag i had to see that but the ogret wasnt going to turn it over voluntarily i fetched another fruitpunch and shoved it at his big mouth while he punched and chomped on that i took advantage of his distraction to grab the tag it was blank of course i couldnt read anyway and wouldnt if i couldbarbarians take justified pride in being illiteratebut that was a separate problem how was i to get an address from this i turned it overand it flashed one side was bright the other dull when i turned it again the brightside dulled and the dullside brightened when i held it flat both sides dulled it was as if the thing were a mirror that reflected light only when properly orientedexcept there was no source of light that accounted for the flash just jungle but a magic mirror would use another type of light source i smiled now i knew in what direction the ogrets parents were the flash pointed the way i cut off a length of vine and tied it to the ogrets bag in such a way as to keep the baby inside while allowing him to look and reach out then i passed the vine over a sturdy branch and hauled the bundle of joy up about halfway that kept the baby off the ground which was no crewel lye safe place at night even for a tyke as horrendous as this and prevented him from going anywhere while i slept as an afterthought i sliced off a section of ironwood and passed it up the hairy hand snatched it from my grasp and the teeth happily gnawed on its end it was a decent pacifier that should keep the ogret halfway quiet i climbed the tree found a suitable niche and settled down to sleep pook continued to graze below he wasnt concerned about the spooks of the darkness being a ghost horse himself in fact the rattle of his chains probably frightened away other spooks it was a quiet night and i woke refreshed naturally pook was gonebut to my surprise he returned when he heard me stirring you mean youre tame now i asked him as i had before he snorted derisively as before but did not depart i found some rock candy and several more milkweed pods for the ogret and he chomped them up violently and spat seeds at flying bugs scoring an impressive num ber of times i wondered whether the night had soiled his diaper but it seemed all right maybe it was a magic one selfcleaning the storks seemed to have deliveries down to a science if thats not a meaningless term in xanth that is they are impossibly well organized in real life of course things are never scientific and its foolish to believe that they can be only in a place like mundania would anyone try to hold such a view i loaded the bundle of joy back on pook not bothering to untie the vinerope and mounted naturally the ogret found another section of chain to chew on babies are always putting things in their mouth but it kept him quiet in ogre country silence is a special blessing we headed in the direction indicated by the tagflash which was roughly southeast we galloped through forest and plain over hill and valley past cliff and cave monster and river we passed curseburrs antlions drifting magic dust a colony of fauns and nymphs harpies and a mouth organ tree that tootled a low note of warning at us it was a pretty dull trip we made excellent time for pook liked to run and in crewel lye the afternoon we reached the region of the ogres i could tell because some trees were twisted into knots others were broken off at the base and small ironwoods had been bitten off at ground level ogres liked to play with things i had heard somewhere that the ogres were mi grating north but this seemed pretty far south to me maybe they were slow movers well they could take three centuries to move north if they wanted to no one was going to tell an ogre what to do just so long as they never got too near to fen village i checked the ogrets tag for reorientation it was glow ing like a little fire we were very close but now a problem occurred to me how was i to hand over the bundle of joy without getting myself clobbered i didnt want to defend myself with my sword what good was it to deliver a baby to a dead mother but i didnt want to be pulped and eaten by the ogres either i located the family domicile which was a pile of trees torn up by the roots and shaped into a crude nest ogres never did things carefully when brute power sufficed i saw the ogress she was almost twice my height and so ugly that her puss made spots of gook dance before my eyeballs it was like a cross between the rump of a sick sphinx and a squashed antlion i could hardly look at her let alone go near her i worked up a notion i suspended the bundle of joy by the vine and swung it around in an arc the ogret chortled he liked swinging through the air almost as much as he liked chomping chain then i nudged pook forward we came to the ogress she was ripping a small tangle tree from the ground and chewing on its flailing tentacles expectant females were known to have odd tastes here it comes i cried and charged toward her whirl ing the ogret i passed her just out of reach which was a scary thing because ogres have phenomenally long reaches the swinging bundle of joy whomped into her belly knocking her onto her back her feet in the air the bundle atop her the ogrets head popped out and he growled so horrendously that the remaining tentacles of the tangler she held straightened out stiffly in sheer terror crewel lye the ogress let out an equally horrendous screech of joy and clutched the ogret to her mother and sonwhat awful music they made together i galloped away un molested the delivery had been made of course the male ogre spied me he did not appear to be completely pleased about the delivery or maybe he had simply decided that pook and i would make an ex cellent repast he lumbered after us making surprising speed because of the length of his stride he was even uglier than the ogress and ogret put together incredible as that sounds small birds startled by our passage flew up glimpsed his gross puss and fell from the air stunned bugs died in clouds where he passed trees quaked their leaves turning yellow around the edges in the sky a cloud looked down saw him and puffed into vapor we zoomed on we didnt want to look at him either when the ogre saw he couldnt catch us he paused to rip a boulder out of the ground and hurl it i saw it coming and had pook dodge behind a great rock maple tree for shelter the boulder struck the tree and knocked off its top we sprang out of there as rocks and sand showered around for the maple had been shattered what a brute that ogre was if this was his reaction to the happy oc casion of becoming a father id hate to be near when he was angry i was sure the ogret would have a happy home life we managed to lose ourselves in an intricate pattern ofgeometrees and the ogre gave up the pursuit he wasnt very smart for ogres are as stupid as they are strong and that is the standard against which all other strength and stupidity is measured he gave up the chase and went back to glower at the bundle of joy i hoped that when astork set out to find bluebell elf it would be able to deliver its bundle with less trouble than this one had been certainly i no longer thought that the storks had an easy job in fact it is all too easy to believe others have easy times when you dont know any thing about their problems we walked back the way we had come roughly north west for i understood that castle roogna was somewhere crewel lye in that region at this slower pace the journey took a couple of days and i fought off a few minor threats along the waygriffins carnivorous plants giant serpents hostile centaurs that sort of thing purely routineand i was beginning to get bored when at last the dusky towers of castle roogna hove into view i had arrived chapter heros challenge actually castle roogna wasnt the easiest place to approach it was surrounded by a spreading orchard and the trees were unusual i thought it was coincidence or bad maintenance when i found the approach path blocked by a massive branch i guided pook around it only to discover that it interlocked with the extended low branch of another tree so i guided pook around the other way to circle the first treeand there was another branch tying into another tree they were too low for pook to pass under yet too fluffed out with brush for him to leap over i paused and scratched my head we could get by of course but i marveled that the path to the castle could have become so overgrown had no one passed this way in the last fifty years surely the road to the capital would be kept up did this mean the castle was deserted in fen village we had not had direct news from castle roogna in a long time but we assumed this was because we were a minor backwoods hamlet now i wondered about the frontwoods region could it have gone out of business now that i thought of it i realized i had encountered no men on my longjourney here goblins elves ogres yes but these were only distantly related to men well perhaps crewel lye not too distantly related in the case of the elves bluebell had been most womanlike divinely feminine when the ad aptationspell was in force but where were the regular men and women i had understood there were human villages scattered all around xanth where were they well i would just have to get into castle roogna and find out i dismounted drew my sword and walked to the center of the path i picked my spot and used my weapon like an axe hacking into the wood i swear that whole tree shuddered at my first blow there was a rain of twigs and leaves and a groan as if wind were making the trunk shift hacked again at an angle so that a wedge of bark and wood flew out the tree shuddered again and reddish sap oozed from the cut pook neighed warning i leaped backand a solid branch crashed down where i had been standing the kind they call a widowmaker it was just as well i had avoided it since i wasnt married so couldnt leave a widow ap parently i had shaken the tree hard enough to dislodge some deadwood apt name for it i kicked it out of the way and made ready to hack again but now oddly the branch was lower in fact it touched the ground it would be easy for pook to step over it i considered hacking the rest of the way through it anyway to clear the path but dusk was drawing nigh in the creepy way it had and i wasnt sure what i would find ahead best not to expend more time here now so i remounted pook and we stepped across and proceeded onward as we passed under the looming height of another tree a great rock maple like the one the ogre had shattered pook leaped ahead behind us a rock crashed no ogre was present the tree itself had bombed us i looked ahead the trees beside the path stood close and threatening and i didnt trust them the things of the vegetable kingdom can be just as bad as those of the animal kingdom when they take a notion to be i decided to use standard barbarian approach number one the direct threat of mayhem i drew my sword again crewel lye listen you trees i yelled whichever one of you drops anything on me will get its branches lopped off or its trunk girdled there was no response holding the sword ready and glaring about me like an ogre i guided pook forward his ears were turning this way and that alert for the sounds of treachery but nothing happened and soon we were clear of this region it seemed that my warning had suf ficed i had cowed the trees dont tell me that violence is the refuge of incompetence its the only language some things understand of course i am a barbarian warrior so there may be a modicum of selfinterest in that state ment now the orchard opened out and castle roogna came into view from fairly close range in the light of the setting sun i was ready to behold and marvel at its glories i stifled my disappointment castle roogna was no glowing edifice it was a mildewed rundown structure whose gardens were overrun by weeds and whose moat was a mass of brown goo this was the capital of xanth it was more like a witchhags den or the fabled past residence of the zombie master who had lost his love and turned himself into a zombie four hundred years be fore what was wrong i rode up to the moat the water was low but closer inspection showed that there was not much goo just brackish stuff the moat monster was asleep hey wake up soursnoot i called indignantly to it sleep on your own time the thing opened an eye flicked its tail and went back to its slumber how lax could castle security get disgusted i crossed the drawbridge which was down and unattended the castle was the largest human constructed edifice i had seen imposing despite its run down state but i was saddened to see the authority of man at such reduced level i had expected to come to the center of a flourishing empire instead it was little more than my home village a woman appeared at the interior gate she was middle crewel lye aged and dumpy and her apron was dirty welcome hero she exclaimed do come in how do you know im a hero i demanded not completely flattered oh i like flattery as well as the next barbarian but this seemed gratuitous and possibly insin cere also flattery is much easier to accept from young pretty women than from old dumpy ones the prophecy she explained what prophecy i asked somewhat aggrieved be cause i remembered the one made by the old elfess that i was to be doomed by a cruel lie i dont really like such prophecies so this was one i preferred not to be reminded of king gromden will have to tell you that come on in we have supper waiting i shrugged and dismounted it was strange that the trees had tried to prevent my approach to the castle while people welcomed it i remained on guard but the pros pect of a good meal was tempting what about my horse i knew pook would be interested in the same kind of protection he had had among the elves he was helping me in the wilderness and i was helping him in civilization we have a nice stall for him with magic grain the woman said pooks ears perked up he whinnied he knew a good thing when he heard it obligingly the woman led us to a stall set in the wall sure enough there was a pan of grain there and it looked delicious even to me pook went to it and started eating and i saw that when he took a mouthful the level in the pan did not drop it was magic all right and evidently the grain was good youll be all right i asked him remember we dont really know these people but he ignored me he was happy i wondered if he had not gotten too tame it was not good for an animalor a barbarianto be too trusting of strangers especially civilized strangers civ ilized people did not share the simple values of barbarians and could be very devious thats pretty concentrated stuff i warned him if crewel lye you eat too much you could get sick he snorted sending oats flying he knew what he was doing and didnt appreciate my meddling i suppose i wouldnt have ap preciated his cautions on women swordfighting and such either we human beings can be awfully arrogant in little unconscious ways i followed the woman into the human region of the castle this was in better repair the floor was clean and there were attractive tapestries on the walls we came to the banquet hall and there a sumptuous repast was laid out a man stood at the head of the table he was old and bald and fat with straggly white whiskers and sunken eyes he wore a fancy robe and crown so i realized he was the king of xanth naturally i greeted him with the respect due his rank hello king i said hello hero he replied batting an eye urn king i dont know about this hero business it is the prophecy he explained in our time of need a young wellformed man of primitive lineage is to appear riding a pooka he has tamed you are evidently that man now sit down and eat before it gets cold uh sure i agreed disconcerted that prophecy did seem to have me nailed down pretty well except that pook claimed he wasnt really tame i suppose its a mat ter of perspective but if that prophecy was on target what about the elven one i didnt like that thought so i flushed it from my mind i sat down and the woman served us both it seemed to be dragon steak and fruit salad with foaming brew from a beerbarrel tree standard fare except for the dragon meat i wondered how they had come by that but on occasion dragons suffered mishaps and men were able to snatch the bodies before some other creature did i was good and hungry so i went to it youre really supposed to wait till king gromden starts the woman murmured in my ear as she poured the beer i paused mouth full mf mmf i asked crewel lye crewel lye quite all right the king said quickly taking a mouth ful himself so we ate and it was an excellent meal the king didnt eat much so i polished off most of it tucking a spare dragon steak in my pocket for future consumption then we settled back to talk you may not know it king but im just a barbarian warrior i said burping vigor ously and wiping my mouth on the tablecloth that is surprising he remarked gravely whats this hero business i mean so theres a proph ecy but what do you need a hero for it would seem that we have a problem gromden said we do need a hero and evidently you are it well its true im looking for adventure king what can i do for you you can undertake the heros challenge sure king just tell me where to go and what to do i yawned as it had been a long day tomorrow gromden decided you are obviously tired from your journey suits me king i agreed politely and so the maid woman showed me to an upstairs room complete with a fine big bed mirror and chamber pot id never had a room with such modern sanitary facilities before soon i flopped on the bed and slept snoring roundly i know i snored because i heard the echoes off the walls i really preferred the forest but im adaptable i can make do with civilized fixings when i have to in the morning i woke to a peremptory knocking i bounced off the bed set my hand on my sword and went to the door it was only the serving woman something has come up she said hastily i wont be able to fix your break fast but you can forage in the orchard thats fine i said whats come up well she looked pained his majesty is indis posed oh you mean the old boy doesnt want to talk today well i guess i can wait she didnt answer she just turned quickly away women can be funny that way i used the chamber pot and dumped it out the window then went down and out to the orchard pook was already there grazing he looked satisfied that load of grain had done him good how come you havent run away i asked him youve been sticking with me when you dont have to and you even served as part of the prophecy are you sure youre not tame he snorted derisively as he always did and continued to graze it occurred to me that even ghost horses might get lonely or maybe tired of rattling chains at night while he was with me he had company and was admitted to the territories of elves and men where there was good eating maybe it made sense to be tame or to seem to be i found plenty of ripe fruits on the trees and soon fashioned myself a sandwich from slices of breadfruit and cheesefruit i saw snapdragon bushes and so the mystery of the dragon steaks was abated it wasnt real dragon meat i didnt mind it tasted the same as far as i knew i could see that this had once been a wellkept grove but now it was clogged by weeds there just didnt seem to be much doing here at castle roogna i remained dis appointed though i hoped the king had a good adventure for me when i went back inside i decided to check on the old boy i found king gromdens door with a crown painted on it so i pounded on that there was no answer so i pushed it open and went in you here king i called politely i didnt want anyone to think i was just barging in there was a muffled sound from the bed so i went there king gromden was lying on his back and he didnt look well at all hey i exclaimed youre really sick king his eyes ground open astute observation he whis pered hey look grom im sorry i said i didnt know crewel lye crewel lye the wench just said you werent talking is it something you ate can i help i am old he confessed as if that werent obvious i wont live out the year perhaps not the month my wife and child deserted me years ago you can help by undertaking the challenge sure king i said i told you i would yesterday what is it it is he paused for a labored breath last the year or the month i wasnt sure hed last the hour he had seemed okay the night before but i guess these things come and go when youre old it is the challenge for the succession the what the succession when i die there must be a new king the best magician in the land but theres a problem i lack the strength to resolve he faded out yes king i prompted prodding him with a thumb you say you have to do something before you croak so there must be a contest he whispered a contest of magic and i waited but he seemed to have lost consciousness too bad i really wondered what he had been trying to tell me a contest of magic sounded pretty interesting but i didnt see how i fitted in i was after all just a barbarian i didnt know much about strong magic i went back to my room there was the maid looking flushed where have you been she asked severely ive been looking all over for you i was talking to the old boy i said you bothered the king she demanded as if shocked women get shocked by the littlest things hes ill he sure is i agreed you should have told me dont you have a pill or spell for him its past that stage she snapped now you go down stairs magician yin is here to see you in the audience chamber who magician yin youll see magician yang tomorrow they refuse to come together theyre very competitive i shrugged amiably sure ill talk to anyone i hope the old boy feels better soon maybe hes constipated if you give him some prune juice but she was already bustling away i suppose she was one of those people who didnt take kindly to good advice so i went downstairs and found magician yin i re membered that the elves had said someone with a name like that made the canned spells that could be so handy he turned out to be a mediumsized mediumaged man in white who really didnt look like much naturally i told him so barbarians believe in straight talk he smiled for some reason reminding me of the way the king had reacted to some of my comments i just dont understand the attitudes of civilized folk i suppose its as if they are piped in to some other kind of awareness that passes me by women are like that too let me show you what i do yin said he reached into a bag he carried and brought out a small globe he handed it to me set it somewhere and invoke it he said oh you mean its a spell i said yes i make spells i set it on the table i invoke you spell i said instantly the globe glowed the light from it brightened the whole room say thats pretty good i said turning my eyes away from its brightness how long does it burn until nullified he said you mean till i tell it to quit no you can not uninvoke my spells they are per manent it requires a counterspell to nullify itone equal and opposite some of my spells do lose strength as time passes though it depends on their nature and complex ity okay lets have a darkness spell i said i dont make negative spells yin said oh who does my twin brother magician yang crewel lye crewel lye you mean there are two of you now that yinyang reference was clarifying equal and opposite say i exclaimed catching on you and hethe contest to see whos best correct yin agreed one of us must be king after gromden expires the strongest magician but we havent been able to determine which of us that is but how do i fit in obviously yang and i cant just throw spells at each other theyd simply nullify one another and it would be even we need to discover whose magic is more effective in practice so we need a third party to use the spells for some practical purpose then we can ascertain whose spells are best a third party i said that must be me correct yin agreed you will go on a quest using my magic to assist you and to facilitate your mission while yangs magic opposes you if you succeed i will win and be designated the next king of xanth if you fail um what happens to me if i fail i asked well it is simply a matter of fetching an object if you dont bring it back then yang wins and becomes the next king but im sure my spells will enable you to succeed i guess so i agreed uncertainly equal and oppo siteit seemed to me the spells would still cancel one another out leaving no advantage for either side but i was the first to concede that a barbarian is not the one to comprehend the nuances of magical interplay how do i get the spells this bag is for you he said our agreement is that i provide seven spells to assist you yang will set the opposite seven spells to oppose you mine you can carry with you his will intercept you without warning you merely have to nullify his evil spells with my good ones and complete the mission seems simple enough i said disappointed i had hoped for news of some dark tower defended by monsters with a fair damsel to rescue and magic to blow up the monsters and scale the tower wall ah well a mundanish adventure is still an adventure i suppose it should be he agreed with a certain subtle civilized nuance of the type i have already remarked on i looked into the bag of spells it was filled with objects a little white shield a figure of a monster a skull a stone a doll a tangled length of vine and a magic compass but these are toys i protested yin laughed hardly they are inert representations when you invoke them they become fullsized and po tent i lifted out the little skull i dont need a fullsized skull allow me to explain because all yangs spells and mine are equal and opposite they have similar forms in many cases king gromden decided on the seven spell sets that would be used in this contest he wanted to allow a fair trial of magic without endangering bystanders thus we are permitted no deadly explosive spells or basilisk spells or noxious contagiousdisease spells the seven are fairly straightforward and you should not have trou ble understanding them his negative spells are black my positive ones are white so when you encounter his black skull you must invoke my white skull the black skull brings death the white one brings just the opposite life they dont complete their effects instantly you will have a minute or so to invoke the lifespell when you feel the deathspell taking hold oh i reached into the bag for another spell maybe you better explain them all for me so i know exactly what to do in my minute each time i brought out the little white shield what about this the white shield counters the black sword a sword of course is negative it exists for one purpose only to cut and kill a shield exists to preserve limb and life and this shield when invoked will preserve yours it certainly made sense i looked forward to seeing that magic black sword that was the kind of sword and sorcery i understood maybe id take it on with my own sword crewel lye before i invoked the shield just to see how good it really was i brought out the twisted vine this that is a representation of an eyequeue vine note the eyeballs braided into it i had thought those were beads but now i saw that the tiny dots were pupils in nature the eyequeue dispenses temporary or even illu sory intelligence the victim thinks he is far smarter than he is but my vine is real put that on your head and you will become far smarter than you are now and the effect will last for several days slowly fading most spells dont work well on the brain thats why it cant be a permanent enhancement but you dont want to use it before you encounter the black idiocy vine yang has crafted for you want it at full potency to counter his the two are even at the start but if you use mine two days before his strikes you you will be somewhat duller than you are now for several days because the negative one will be fresher i see the point i agreed im just a backwoods barbarian none too smart to begin with i cant afford to be any worse than i am precisely yin acknowledged politely i brought out the compass now ive heard of these magic gimmicks i said their little arrows always point north but i already know where north is and if i dont i can find it by gardenvariety backwoods magic such as the moss that grows on the north sides of trees why do i need this this compass doesnt necessarily point north he explained it points to the object you need to find and bring back to castle roogna this spell you must invoke first so you will know where to go and yangs compass will point the wrong way i asked ill simply ignore it yangs compass will make this one point the wrong way he clarified well ill just remember the direction then i have a good sense of direction once i get my bearings all bar barians do unfortunately the object may move about so you can not track it without the compass until you know its crewel lye nature also it is not merely the compass needle that points it acts on your mind so that you know in which direction to go the black compass will prevent you from knowing where to go even if you dont look at it oh i said getting slightly confused then if the two compasses cancel each other how do i find the ob ject you must try to avoid the black compass until you find the object after that the black compass cant hurt you how can i do that if i know where yangs spells are ill avoid them all unfortunately again you cant they will be placed in your path so that you will intercept them all in turn ill change my route no your route has been divined by magic yang will place the spells in your way but nothing can be totally predetermined if you are alert you will be able to spot them and nullify them with mine before they cause you unredeemable mischief i am trusting you to do that he smiled thinly well ill certainly try i agreed will his spells be out in the open yes and no he will place them in such a way as to try to confuse you so that you are likely to overlook them until you come into range your mere presence will invoke them so you must be alert at all times the key here is not avoidance since you can not avoid them except per haps the black compass but your readiness to nullify them promptly if you spy a black spell from a distance you can approach it deliberately with the white counterspell in hand so your state of readiness will be critical i will be ready barbarians are always alert to their surroundings i was getting to like this challenge after all i drew out the monster figurine this yangs spell will summon a horrendous monster one that will surely destroy you if not dealt with promptly my spellwill banish that monster so you wont have to fight it at all crewel lye oh i said disappointed i like fighting monsters i assure you you wont like this one he said its the tarasque never heard of it i said disdainfully just keep an eye out for the black spell and keep this white one handy dont use it on any routine monster i brought forth another spell the doll this that particular set is one of the most insidious yangs spell will exchange your identity with that of the person or creature nearest you at the moment it is invoked it wont hurt either of you specifically but i doubt youd be pleased if it wasnt nullified for example if the nearest creature is a fruit fly you would find yourself in the body of the fruit fly and it would have your mans body my spell will restore both of you to your original bodies provided you make sure they are adjacent when you in voke it urn yes i wouldnt want to be a fruit fly i agreed i fished out the last spell the stone and this falls on my head not exactly the black stone spell will cause you to become stone the white one will return the stone to flesh both have a substantial overkill factor huh this one is powerful enough to turn several barbarians and their horses to stone if allowed to run unchallenged so the other can convert a large amount of stone to flesh how does it know the difference between natural stone and converted stone i asked is the type of stone dif ferent the spell merely acts on the closest stone to it since you will be invoking it as you are turning to stone that will be you only you can invoke the white spells that is a necessary safeguard i pictured a mimicbird flying by squawking invoke invoke and bringing to life my entire bag of spells at once i nodded it was indeed a necessary safeguard they had worked out the details of this challenge pretty well i took a deep breath so if i just keep this bag of spells handy ill be able to counter each of yangs spells and crewel lye complete the mission that seems straightforward enough well there are always unexpected details of situa tion he said and also complications of terrain im a barbarian im used to handling terrain and on the return trip you will be burdened with the object that may distract you you must be especially careful once you have the object for the difficulty of the challenge may increase exponentially then there is that i agreed wondering what exponen tial meant i assumed it was just a highbrow magician term for a lot just what is this object im supposed to fetch yin looked moderately embarrassed im afraid i am not permitted to tell you that king gromden decided that some things should be held as surprises to make the con test more er sporting i have informed you of the nature of the spells and counterspells giving you a certain ad vantage some unknowns are necessary to counterbalance that perhaps yang will tell you more however his face darkened you must not believe everything yang tells you i am a good magician he is an evil magician therefore i must always use my magic positively and speak the truth he uses his magic negatively and he let the words fade out you mean he always lies then ill just believe the opposite of what he says yin looked further embarrassed it is not quite as simple as that truth is not necessarily the opposite of untruth for example you could ask a liar what direction the nearest pillowbush was and he would tell you it was east when actually it was south if you went the opposite way you would go west and still be deceived well at least id know one direction it wasnteast that would be some help not necessarily so yang does not lie precisely he seeks to deceive if he can best deceive by indirection or even by telling the truth in a way you will doubt he will do that thus the bush might indeed be eastthe one direction you would not go after asking him crewel lye i began to appreciate the ramifications the civilized folk had evidently developed lying into a sophisticated art we barbarians were straightforward liars when we lied at all i really would prefer that you not talk to yang at all yin said but the rules of this contest give us equal access so all i can do is warn you not to trust him either to speak the truth or to lie for he will surely mislead you to his advantage he is insidiously clever i shrugged thanks for the warning magician ill be careful he smiled do be that and farewell hero i hope to see you again at the conclusion of the mission sure thing yin i left him and took the bag of spells to my room the rest of the day was frankly dull the serving woman fixed me a decent lunch and hurried off to attend to the sick king i amused myself by exploring the castle which was big and empty in one upstairs room was the magic tapestry showing scenes of xanth during the last four hundred years there had been a long succession of kings some of them pretty good i rather liked king roogna who had supervised the construction of the castle he had used centaur labor and evil magician murphy had tried to interfere but a barbarian had arrived to help king roogna trust a barbarian to show up in the nick of time when the civilized folk couldnt manage i was of that heroic mold myself as i may have mentioned but somehow it seemed that the power of man had faded in xanth slowly over the centuries and the once farreaching activities of the castle had contracted until today old king gromden was about all that remained gromden meant well and was a good man but people lacked confidence in him maybe it was that there just werent enough human folk left in xanth to hold back the jungle the woman appeared the king asks for you she said disapprovingly i went to gromdens room he was sitting up in bed evidently somewhat recovered though he did not look at crewel lye all spry feeling better king i asked brightly maybe the prune juice helped my malady comes and goes he said and each siege is to a new nadir it derives as much from the soul as from the flesh how i wish my wife and daughter were here but he shrugged with deep regret a man can pay a lifetime for a moments folly thats for sure king i agreed i remember when i found this tangleseed and thought id plant it in our garden i summoned you in this period of my lucidity because it may not last long i have something important to tell you that i fear you will not believe im just a barbarian king i reminded him i can believe almost anything he smiled tiredly that is surely why the prophecy named you for this mission you have no preconceptions but i fear you are being deceived unnecessarily so simple fairness requires me to set some things straight sure king i nodded whats crooked this contest between yin and yang is not precisely what it seems it is not really a trial to determine which magician shall assume the throne of xanth after me but rather which one shall serve the other isnt that the same thing i asked the one who loses doesnt get to be king so no not the same he asserted and that object you are supposed to fetch has certain qualities that will greatly complicate your task this is no simple matter barbarian yin and yang dont realize that i know any of this but how do you know it king i asked he smiled again i see that you like they question my remaining mental acuity indeed i found the truth difficult to believe myself perhaps it will be more con vincing if i demonstrate how i ascertained my informa tion i guess so i conceded doubtfully the old boy did seem a little confused but that was what happened to sick people sometimes crewel lye if you would be so kindfetch me an object from the grounds sure king i agreed amicably might as well humor him i turned my back left the room went down and out and looked about what would be suitable a fruit may be a prune a stick of wood no sense going to a lot of trouble since hed probably be asleep when i returned i spied a chip of stone fallen from the castle wall that should do i picked it up and went back inside king gromden remained awake i handed him the chip he held it before him staring at it this is a fragment of stone from the outer wall of this castle he said it was quarried by centaurs and hauled to this site four hundred years ago what do you know i remarked it really didnt take any magic talent to know that all the castle rocks were quarried and hauled in at that time if that wasnt common knowledge the magic tapestry showed it to anyone willing to watch as i had been the centaur who hauled this particular stone had a speckled hide and gray tail he continued he struck one hoof against a root and issued a bad word for which he was duly reprimanded by his superior on the crew sure i agreed noncommittally convinced he was making this up later before the castle was finished the goblins and harpies attacked he continued a harpy hen laid an egg that detonated close by cracking the block but the mortar held it in place then the goblins stormed the castle and their dead piled up against the wall the eyeball of one was wedged against this chip somewhat to the chips disgust i chuckled obligingly ill say this for the old boy he could spin a yam maybe not as fancy as the yarns of the tapestry but still good enough then the goblin bodies were melted down and some of the stain soaked into the chip and it endured that way for centuries until recently a bird brushed it and the chip was finally dislodged and fell to the ground there is a spell on this castle to keep it in repair but age and neglect crewel lye may have weakened that spell you picked up the chip between the wall and the moat near a yellow flower hey i did i exclaimed remembering howd you know that king for there had been no window cov ering that region he could not have peered out and seen me he smiled it is my talent the magic of magician caliber that made me eligible to assume the throne i can hold any object and see and hear its history that is how i discovered the deception of yin and yang a button fell from yins clothing i picked it up and read it to determine whose it was and found that it was his but also i glanced at him he was looking worse the effort of sitting up and talking was bad for him id better let you rest now king i said but i must warn you he protested weakly it is important for you to complete this mission for yin he coughed and spat up some phlegm and his words were choked off i didnt want him to pass out while trying to talk to me so i beat a hasty retreat barbarians dont really understand illness you sleep it off king i said at the door ill talk to you again tomorrow it certainly was dull here at the castle i was eager to get going on the challenge at least that promised to be halfway interesting next day magician yang showed up he wore black cloak and looked forbidding but his features were just like yins i can see you are twin brothers i said ob servantly naturally he agreed unsmiling we two represent the good and evil aspects of magic lets get on with this where are the spells huh i replied perhaps not displaying my full in telligence such as it was yins spells yokel i need to check them so i know which ones to match oh i had somehow thought he knew which spells since the king had specified them in advance evidently i had misunderstood i went to my room and brought down the bag crewel lye yang grabbed it and opened it and peered in the usual garbage he said yin never was one for much imagination i think king gromden selected the him too dullards all no wonder xanth is sliding to the depths in a basket case he reached in and hauled out the eyequeue vine i can match this idiotstring read ily well sure since your spells are equal and opposite and this airhead he said bringing up the white skull then dropping it back into the bag with a clunk and this freak now he had the white monster figurine and the old magic shield gig yet yins got no spunk at all well as i said the king and as i said him too now this one had possibili ties he said bringing up the doll you ever been in someone elses body bumpkin no not exactly that way and the stoneage ploy he continued holding the white stone he peered at me take my advice would be hero save yourself a lot of grief take a dive a what just go out there and dont come back vanish from the scene i had trouble grasping this but the mission the mission is to determine whether yin or yang should be the next king if you fail to bring back the object that determination will be made yang will be king butnot even to try well you have two ways to go ignoramus you can go out there and get yourself killed or you can go out there and take it easy and survive either way the result of the contest will be the samebut your own situation will differ you have to consider your personal stake in this i couldnti said id make an honest try and you fool he cried indignantly dont you know the contest is rigged you cant bring back the object the whole deal is a cruel lie set up to appease the masses crewel lye masses i wondered where they were but king gromden said that old fool is in his dotage simpleton and sick to boot look how castle roogna has deteriorated under his administration we dont need more scandal in the castle its past time for a strong hand to take the reins and restore the throne to its proper glory there was some sense to that but magician yin couldhe has similar magic yin is constrained by his foolish notions of ethics he places the means before the ends no person can accom plish anything if he worries more about how he does it than what he is doing thats why yin is doomed to lose this contest i have never regarded myself as a clever man and i saw right away i was outclassed here i couldnt argue with someone as smart and ruthless as yang still i had stupid doubts i dont know of course you dont rube yang agreed so i will tell you when i am king i will reward you handsomely do you like nymphs i will give you a barrel of nymph spells each nymph good for a day and willing to do any thing you say do you like food i will arrange a feast every night creature comforts the most comfortable creatures shall be yours whether i should accept the mission i continued doggedly if im not even going to try if i didnt know better id suspect you were trying to bribe me to the light dawns at last oaf what is your price besides it sounds like a good adventure and thats what i really came here for i certainly didnt much like yang what kind of adventure is it to get your head bitten off by a monster dead men cant enjoy life actually for me there was life after death evidently he didnt know that in his arrogance he hadnt bothered to check out my talent i decided not to mention it yin said you would try to deceive me yang laughed loudly how do you know hes not crewel lye lying hick naturally he doesnt want you to listen to we he had a point now i didnt know whom to believe i guess id just better go ahead with the mission and do my best and see how it turns out pool yang dropped the bag of spells on the floor and stalked out i wished i could get some good advice but there was no one with any sense around here except maybe the king and he hadnt heard this conversation and might not believe it then i remembered his talent he could evoke the dialogue or whatever from a button on my clothing then he would believe i went to his room but he was asleep and i didnt want to wake him he might go into another coughing fit well what could he have said anyway except for me to do the mission as planned actually he might already know about yangs dishonesty for he had been trying to tell me something the day before now maybe i knew the nature of his warning that yang would try not merely j to deceive me but also to corrupt me fortunately i was not clever enough to be corrupted i chapter mountain of flesh i set out the next morning ready for action with the bag of spells tied to pook i had my good sword and a knife had picked up at the castle the woman had also found a good sturdy replacement bow and a quiver of arrows in the armory i had plucked some cherries and pineapples from the trees of the orchard as well as some edible fruit to consume along the way i wore light body armor consisting of leather strips magically pickled and crewel lye hardened there was a lot of good stuff at castle roogna too bad there were not more people to enjoy it i was at last starting my adventure this buoyed my spirits despite the aspects that puzzled me and i feared that it would not be as exciting as i hoped all i knew of the object i had to fetch was that it was vaguely northwest of castle roogna but that was enough to get me started i could invoke my finderspell anytime but preferred to wait until i had passed the loserspell i knew was in my path then i could nullify the black spell completely hop ing enough of the white one was left over to enable me to pinpoint the object when i reached its general area was it possible that all the evil spells were in a straight line to the object in that case i would be better off meandering somewhat so as to avoid most of them then i could invoke the white compass when i was close and nail the object quickly after that it wouldnt matter what the black compass did it would be too late so my not using the white spell was like saving my last arrow until well within range of the targetplain common sense except that yin had assured me that i could not avoid the black spells they would be set in my predetermined path if i meandered they would be set along that mean der i found this difficult to accept after all i could keep changing my course randomly but magic has strange as pects that are beyond the comprehension of louts like me id just have to see what happened the band of aggressive trees tried to give me a hard time as they had done before i wondered why they didnt like me since i was here to do some good for castle roogna and have a nice adventure maybe they like yang figured id fail but in that case their obstruction just made it more likely that i would fail at least they should be glad to see me going they could oppose me again on the way back in if it were just me they didnt like this made no sense but what can you expect of blockheads so i just made my little statement and held my sword aloft and pook charged through the branches trembled with rage but did not strike sometimes force is the only feasible alternative especially for those who possess it crewel lye we trotted along making good time and soon came to a range of mountains i pondered whether to go around them but i didnt know their extent and was afraid i would have to go far out of my way and perhaps lose track of my general direction so i took the simple bar barian courseover the top naturally the obvious course is not necessarily the easiest one as the firebird discovered when he tried to romance his reflection in the water and got his flame doused but it was in the middlingrear of my mind that no one would have expected me to be dumb enough to go right over the top so maybe there would be no evil spells there this was really a test casewhether i could do the unexpected and mess up the predetermined path if i couldnt be smart i could at least be cunning the slope got steeper as we went until pook was puff ing and i had to dismount to ease his burden at one point i had to unloop one of his chains and throw it around a tree trunk above us so i could pull on it and help heave him up actually those chains were one reason he was struggling they added a fair amount of weight to his climb but we persevered and got so high by dusk that the land of xanth spread out below us its lakes and jungles a lovely patchwork one lake turned brighter and larger as i looked at it trying to impress me the inanimate can be just as vain about its appearance as any animate creature unfortunately i could not see what was ahead of us to the northwest because the remainder of the mountain blocked that off but i knew wed see it once we crested that should be as good as a map maybe id even see the object whatever it was but would i recognize it the mountain went up and up it certainly hadnt looked this big from below the thing seemed to be drawing itself up trying to outlast us making this its own special con test well next time id go around and risk the bad spells but having started this course i wasnt about to quit now as i may have remarked barbarians can be oinkheaded on occasion and i was typical of the breed the air grew cool then cold we were entering the crewel lye snow region sure enough a flock of snowbirds wheeled in the sky coming to investigate us i didnt know much about snowbirds but didnt trust them and neither did pook we moved faster seeking to avoid them but they came over and buzzed us white powder drifted down from their wings then they were off and out of sight no trouble after all i said relieved lets find a spot to camp for the night ill have to make a fire so we wont freeze but pook laid back his ears and plowed on up the cold slope hey whats the matter i demanded weve got to stop before the ground gets frozen and theres no brush for a fire see if you can sniff out a level section or maybe even a small cave still he traveled not slowing or searching at all i began to get annoyed now look pook im tired and i want to rest and youre not that fresh either then i noticed that snow was falling but there was no cloud the snowflakes were forming in the air as i watched they expanded becoming wonderfully large and intricate disks each one different from all its companions i caught one by its rim and it was the span of my spread hand with six spokes radiating out from a hexagonal cen ter each branching and rebranching into finer networks until the rim was another finely wrought hexagon i mar veled at the beauty and symmetry of it when it melted in my hand and fell apart i was unhappy at the loss of such a wonderful artifact to stifle the unbarbarian tear coming to my eye i grabbed another snowflake and con centrated on it this one was like the finest doily ever crafted in all ways absolutely delightful but in a moment it too dissolved and was lost now the snowflakes became more ornate they were no longer disks they were prisms reflecting and diffract ing the slanting sunbeams so that rainbow hues radiated out in spokes of their own forming larger hexagons of colored light that filled the air before me the lightflakes became so solid i thought i could climb upward by grasp ing their interlocking spokes but my hands merely changed colors when i reached finding nothing crewel lye crewel lye ahead was a crevice in the mountain too wide to leap across its depths too deep and awful to contemplate but the snowflakes multiplied and interlocked to form a bridge across it and i guided pook there he came to the brink and balked i kicked his sides urging him forward its a perfect bridge i told him its a hallucination you fool he told me how can you be sure of that i argued this is all a form of illusion he insisted give me some proof mulehead it has to be illusion because in real life i cant talk human speech he said i pondered that considered it and cogitated a bit on it could be i opined at last but whats the cause that snow the snowbirds dropped on us of course thats why i tried to get out of it the stuff spaces out your mind and makes you see and hear things that just arent there you mean there arent any big snowflakes and youre not talking to me now that is precisely what i mean lunkhead the only big flake around here is you now sit tight while i get us out of it he picked his way on up the mountain real snow cancels out the mindbending snow the cold freezes it i think no matter what you see dont get off my back why doesnt it zonk out your mind too dont be silly barbarian im just an animal i decided he knew better than did actually its sort of fun i said pook just snorted and plowed on now the flakes converted to snowfairies dancing on the breeze they leaped they twirled they pirouetted most prettily one of them beckoned to me and she re minded me of bluebell and the dancing elven maidens i started to dismount but pook gave a shake that jolted my memory aggravatingly and i desisted slowly the colorful images faded and the mountain slope was revealed in its grim reality all rock and scrub and patches of genuine snow i looked below at the crev ice and saw there was no bridge across it i would have plunged into it to my doom or great discomfort had not pook cautioned me about the illusion spawned by the snowdust the next snowbird i saw would get an arrow through its body suddenly i recalled the elf crones prophecy that i would be doomed by a cruel lie that snowflake bridge had been a lie all right thanks to pooks horse sense i had avoided that doom i glanced at pook thanks ghost horse i said you saved me from my own folly back there you were more sensible than i pook twitched an ear affirmatively and kept climbing but since you cant talkhow did you warn me i mean if i just imagined you spoke to me in human words the horse continued moving i sighed well i dont quite know how much of what is real but im sure you saved me pook so i guess i can call you tame now pook snorted insulted sorry i apologized but if youre not tame then why do you stay with me the horse merely shrugged rattling a chain then i had about as bright a notion as a barbarian was capable of at that hour of the day pook if i may not call you tamemay i call you friend he nickered affirmatively i had finally caught on when pook was satisfied that we were secure from hallucination he stopped we found an indentation not really a cave but enough to shelter us from the cutting wind and i gathered straggles of halfburied brush and made a little fire pook was able to find dry grass and lichen under the snow for his supper while i consumed my rations it didnt seem like much of a meal for him but i suppose he was used to that sort of thing the fire sank to embers and we settled for the night pook lay down and i curled up next to him glad for the heat of his body i didnt worry about watching for ene mies what man or monster would climb way up here past the snowbirds and snowdreams just to bother a crewel lye lone man and a horse anyway i slept lightly and so did pook we would be all right i believe i have remarked before on the weakness of barbarian reasoning this was demonstrated again this night a sound would have roused us both but there was no soundnot until it was almost too late pook became aware of it first his nose was more alert than mine he didnt move he puffed a nostrilful of warm air in my ear i woke wondering what he was up to and felt the chill slithering across my ankle i knew instantly what it was a snowsnake how utterly stupid of me to forget about them they were snowwhite and snowcold and lived in snow it was difficult to see or hear them in their habitat but they were poisonous and they liked fresh meat we were in trouble i lay there feigning sleep the way pook was assessing the situation one bite would prove fatal for me and probably three bites for pook i would recover in due course assuming the feeding snakes left enough of me to be reconstituted but pook wouldnt so i had to prevent him from getting bitten first i needed to know how many snakes there were and exactly where they were then i needed to eliminate them first i had to deal with the ones who were most ready to strike then the others i cracked open an eye that didnt help it was too dark to see so i listened and felt that didnt help either they were silent and once the one passed my leg i had no way to track it but i knew the snakes wouldnt wait long before striking they would be eager to feed they would pick their targets and very well we would have to shoot for double or noth ing roll i cried suddenly pook was ready he rolled while i leaped up grabbing for my sword i heard a hiss pook had squished a snake under his crunching chains i jumped for the leftover fire sweeping my sword point through it embers and coals flew about brightening an grily as they felt the cold air one struck a snake i heard crewel lye the hiss of anguish and i chopped at the sound there was a violent thrashing in the dark i had scored now the snakes were all carelessly active frightened by the glowing coals among them probably they would have moved on us earlier if that fire hadnt been there they had waited till it was low and then been cautious not cautious enough i struck at every hiss i heard and my reflexes were barbarianswift and my blade sliced through reptilian flesh in a moment or so i had cut up everything that made a sound i returned to the fire and tossed on fresh brush in a moment it blazed up and i saw what i had wrought there were four dead snakesone squished three cut to pieces each was about manlength too small to be much op position by day but big enough to do a lot of damage by night especially considering the poison if any of them survived they had fled pook returned he had rolled downward and bounced to his feet he did not seem to have been bitten his chains had protected him and once he rolled free all the snakes had been in my area we had won through unscathed but neither of us was inclined to lie down again even the slightest scathe by one of those snakes would have been a whole lot of trou ble i stoked the fire and pook stood near it almost astride it and i mounted him thus only his four feet were vulnerable and they were close to the fire but i held a cherry in my hand just in case if anything ap proached it would get bombed we spent the rest of the night like that sleeping on guard and the snowsnakes did not return in the cold morning we ate again and resumed our journey the pieces of snowsnake near the fire had melted of course there was nothing left of them it really hadnt been much of an adventure just an inconvenience i would rather have had undisturbed sleep maybe i just didnt have the right attitude another cutting wind came up that kind of wind seemed to like the upper reaches i wrapped my cloak tightly about me for warmth and kept my gloved hands in toward crewel lye my belly mainly i depended on pook for heat i couldnt have made this trek without him by noon we reached the crest not the peak there was no point in going right over that as we werent interested in height just in getting past we headed for the lowest notch in the ridge that ran from peak to peak in this range wind cut through it with extra effort stirring up powdered snow i was reminded of the snowbirds snow and shud dered but i knew it wasnt that i would be glad when we got down to good oldfashioned gardenvariety tangle trees and hypnogourds again but as we passed through the pass i saw something lying in the snow black against white i got down and picked it up it was a black compass just like the white one i had in my bag of spells it flashed suddenly i felt dizzy where am i going i asked plaintively what am i looking for but in a moment i remembered im looking for an object to settle a claim for the new king of xanth but i have absolutely no idea where it is the loserspell has nullified my sense of location and then i said nows the time to invoke the finder spell so i can restore my sense of location or whatever that way ill know where im going pook did not protest so i decided that made sense that black compass had really reamed out my mind leav ing me fundamentally uncertain i dont like having my mind messed with i dug in the bag and brought out the white compass invoke i quavered at it something strange happened the snow on which i stood began to melt well no not exactly melt but it was turning slushy no not exactly that either the ground beneath the snow was softening how could that be i scraped away the snow and saw that it was bare rock below and that the rock had become pale pink flesh was this mountain in fact a monster crea ture it couldnt be i knew the nature of mountains and this was definitely a mountain yet the rock below me had become flesh crewel lye the flesh spread rapidly outward i saw the snow sink ing in an expanding ripple marking the progress of the transformation the whole mountain was turning to living flesh pook neighed nervously he was balancing on the spongy surface uncomfortably and wanted to get off it but i retreated cautiously from the fringe of the conver sion wanting to understand this phenomenon to whatever extent my primitive barbarian mind was able so i wouldnt fall into some trap of magic why should the mountain turn to flesh just when i was invoking unrelated magic i looked down at the white compass i had invoked only to discover that both it and the black one had dis appeared expended but i still had no idea where the object was then i reached into the spellbag and pulled out the white stone wasnt that the spell that was sup posed to turn stone back to flesh then why had it hap pened with the compass i wasnt bright but i wasnt completely dull either yang i exclaimed he switched the spells pook neighed again he was right we had to get off this mountain of blubber i dont know where were going but maybe you do i cried go for it i jumped onto his back and hung on he started off down the mountains north slope his hooves skidded as the snow made the flesh beneath slip pery i saw that the transformation had now reached to the peak and it was quivering like jelly indeed the whole mountain was quivering as its solid bedrock turned soft magician yin had not been kidding about overkill on the spells this one was strong enough to convert a hundred men and horses tothat is to reconvertwell anyway it was one hideously powerful piece of magic and it was being wasted doing me no good at all pooks hooves slid as the slope steepened he was hav ing real trouble keeping his footing what with the heaving of the mountain itself just sit down and slide i sug gested its probably safer and faster he tried it we slid down on cold posteriors and it crewel lye was indeed fasterbut maybe not safer we soon got up formidable speed and there was still a long way to go ifyins spell was strong enough to convert a mountain to flesh how strong was yangs spell the one that turned flesh to stone they were equal and opposite werent they what would happen when i triggered the evil magicians spelland had nothing to counter it would it turn me to stoneand pook and everything near us my talent was good but i couldnt handle that if we were doomed to encounter the black stone that meant we were doomed indeedby the cruel lie yang had made of this contest yang had suggested that i give up this quest letting him win that seemed like good advice in retrospect wouldnt it be better to abort the mission now and at least salvage my life but as i said the oinkheadedness of barbarians is leg endary and justly so even though it now seemed point less i was determined to push on i had agreed to undertake this mission and i always did what i said i would do if i could even if it made no sense at the time and who could tell maybe my talent would heal me from being stoned of course that might take a few years we slid to the snow line the flesh had not reached here yet and the mountain below remained stable pook got to his feet swished his tail about to dislodge the snow sticking to his rear and moved on down not eager to have the rock turn mushy under his hooves again horses dont go for that mushy stuff actually i wasnt sure that would happen there had to be some limit to the effect or all of xanth would become flesh indeed the mountain seemed to stabilize above the snow line if the conversion was continuing it had slowed there was just too much rock in the mountain for the magic to digest if that was the proper word once we were safely below the region of flesh we paused to eat and graze our slipsliding had taken some time and more energy and we were tired and hungry horses i had discovered had to eat a lot i had somehow supposed that a man with a steed could travel long dis crewel lye tances at high speed now i knew it wasnt so but of course pook had become more to me than mere trans portation much more maybe his companionship was more important than his average velocity so we took time to fill our bellies in our separate fash ions foraging for grass and leaves and fruits and scouted around for a suitable campsite we were below the level of the snowsnakes but what about the snowbirds i didnt want to have my mind zonked out again by their snow job however a completely different threat materialized we had ignored the mountain of flesh because we were beyond its range we thought that turned out to be overly optimistic the ground shuddered at first i thought it was an earthquakea magical tremor that was very unsettling to experience resembling as it did the heavy tread of an ogre but not too dangerous in the open but then i re alized that it emanated from the mountain of flesh above us the stuff was shaking with increasing violence as if trying to get free of course it wanted to be free here it was abruptly waking as a huge mass of living tissuewith no eyes or ears or nose no way to discover where it was or what it was doing there so it was doing the only thing it could bashing its way out if i were blindfolded and deaf and tied down id struggle too snow crashed down beyond the snow line heading for us the shaking flesh had started an avalanche there wasnt enough snow to do real harm but i did not feel easy sure enough pretty soon the rocks on the fringe of the fleshzone were shaken loose and they started rolling down those could harm us i think maybe this is not our best place to camp i told pook he agreed i mounted and we started on down but now it was getting dark and the struggles of the mountain increased the violence was such that the welkin was jarred and an earlyshowing star was jostled out of crewel lye crewel lye its socket it fell nearby tracing a fiery path across the sky and set the dry brush aflame more trouble the mountain heaved again and shook the firmament other stars fell starting other fires they really werent very well anchored when they first came out soon there were sizable conflagrations and we smelled the smoke but we couldnt hurry because the footing was treach erous in the gloom and we had to be alert for more rolling stones the mountain peak belched a mass of gas burst out soiling the sky several stars coughed and a comet sneezed so hard its tail flew off bad business we traveled as well as we could but it was nervous business with fires blazing on either side boulders rolling down from above and clouds of the mountains stomach gas hovering in the night sky the scene was very like my private picture of hell and i was not eager to remain there long the conversion of stone to flesh had not melted the snow apparently it was cold flesh but the fires raging up the slope were now heating the upper reaches and water was beginning to flow from the fringe of snow we came to a culdesac ahead was a section so steep as to be clifflike while the fires closed off the escape to the sides we did not want to retreat back up the moun tain but did not want to stay in place either the ground was still shuddering with the motions of the tortured flesh threatening to dislodge us from our perch behind we heard the increasing sibilance of rushing water we could soon be washed on down the cliff becoming part of the waterfall there is something about personal hazard that sharp ens my native cunning diversion i exclaimed pook cocked an ear at me questioningly perhaps fearing i was losing what little wit i possessed ill show you dismounted and scrambled to the side near the fire i used my boot to scuff a channel in the ground and my sword to cut through the brush in the way quickly i extended the channel upward at a slant forming a bank on its lower side i took advantage of whatever natural declivities there were so that my channel curved but was reasonably deep pook was perplexed but helped me ex cavate through a small ridge by bashing it with a hoof naturally we struck a buried boulder too big either to circle or to pry out now was the time for my reserve equipment there was very little time for excavating around the boulder so i poked a hole with the point of my sword and dropped in a cherry bomb the explosion blew out a much bigger hole then i tossed in a pineapple and dived clear this explosion blew the top off the boulder it crunched into a tree in the firezone lucky for us it hadnt gone the other way now my channel was complete all i had to do was touch it up where the explosion had messed it up just in time the trickle of water was becoming a river and now this coursed down my sluice i stood by to free any clogs that developed soon there was a torrent and the water deepened the channel itself and sought to over flow it hastily i shored up my embankment i wasnt perfectly successful but most of the water did stay on course this meant that only a little of it swirled around our feet and poured on over the cliff and most flowed down into the rising blaze we had saved ourselves from being washed away and had diverted the water to the more useful employment of fighting the nearest fire there was a continuous angry hiss as the water in truded on the fires domain and a cloud of steam puffed up my new channel ended at the fires edge so there the water spread out coursing over a much broader area soon the fire was gone from there and a swath of black ened but unbuming terrain appeared leading down the mountain and this is our route down i said pleased with the success of my strategy i mounted pook and he stepped into the channel walking carefully to prevent the moving water from interfering with his footing thus we made it off the mountain it wasnt easy or comfortable but the farther from the mountain of flesh we got the less severe the effects were finally near dawn we felt secure enough to rest we doubted any wild r crewel lye creatures would be bothering us they were all terrified by the strange events of this night and most had fled the scene as i settled down to sleep beside a nice solid boulder i pondered the significance of what had happened so yang had switched the spells he must have done that while handling them in my presence of course he had known what they were he had pretended ignorance so as to have a pretext to touch each one he had distracted me with talk of the futility of my mission so that i would not catch on to the real nature of his skulduggery his attempt to bribe me had not been serious why bribe me when he already had the situation in hand he had indeed deceived me obliquely not for nothing had he remarked on my bumpkinishness he had proved it he had ironically spoken the truth when he said he was convinced that i would fail he had ensured that by cheating yin and the king thought this was a straight forward spellvsspell contest set in the field yang knew it was an ignorant barbarian trotting blithely into disaster yins spells were now just about as dangerous to me as yangs maybe the king had caught on and had been about to warn me not to let magician yang touch those spells i had been too quick to dismiss his effort talk of blun dering fools i had just done the cause of barbarian public relations a singular disservice by being precisely as oaf ish as charged how could i hope to complete this quest when i had no idea where the object was or what it was i had climbed the mountain back when i had some notion was it be cause the object was up there should i go back to the fleshy peak i could not be sure but since hadnt seen anything up there except snow i concluded that wasnt it could the thing be on one of the other peaks of this range and i had been about to check them all until i found it again i couldnt be sure the black compass had somehow nullified my brain in this respect so that i could not even decide where to search the only confi crewel lye dence i had was that whatever i decided to do would be wrong because of that hostile magic somewhere among my remaining white spells was the true finder compass but which one was it if i invoked one and guessed wrong not only would i be wasting an other spell that i would certainly need later but i could be getting myself into immediate trouble as i had done atop the mountain i had supposed this adventure was going to be slightly tame for my taste abruptly it had become slightly too challenging elsie had tried to warn me that there could be days like this naturally i hadnt listened a barbarian who thinks he can interact on an equal basis with magicians is a fool indeed well pook had been farther from the black compass than i had been so wasnt affected as much perhaps he being equine had not been touched at all i would just have to trust his horse sense to get me where i was going i suspected that evil magician yang had not realized that i would have a sensible friend along with that modestly renewed sense of comfort i slept chapter tarasque in the middle of the day the heat forced us awake pook had been grazing in his sleep thats a talent his kind has that i was coming to envy i foraged for bread sticks picking them off a stale bread tree they were better than nothing then we went on we were in hilly country now but there were no more mountains for which i was duly grateful i had climbed the mountain in part to avoid the predestined route and the evil spells on it obviously this had been ineffective crewel lye crewel lye so there was no point in bothering with such efforts hence forth pook proceeded northwest which i was sure was the wrong direction but i didnt argue i hoped he had some inkling where the object was though i despaired of either finding it or bringing it back to castle roogna how could i with my own spells loaded against me magician yang had really fixed me but that ol barbarian oink headedness prevented me from quitting if theres one thing worse than blundering it is admitting the blunder as evening dawnedwell you know what i mean we spied a region of caves and considered using one of them for the night barbarians of course are not far removed from cavemen but in the shadows we heard myriad clicking sounds and saw little pincers lifted in eager anticipation of our flesh nickelpedes no these were smaller but twice as fierce they were dimepedes they had ten little legs and silvery pincers that could readily gouge out serrated disks of flesh they couldnt do much to pooks hooves but all they had to do was scuttle to the flesh above and begin work certainly we were not about to lie down there so we found a little lake with a littler island and leaped across to that the dimepedes could not swimin fact they sank in water like so many bits of metalso we knew they would not bother us in the night and since they would be foraging in this region under cover of dark nessthey could not tolerate the full light of day because that showed up the dirt on themno other creature would be in this vicinity we had an ideal nocturnal retreat but as darkness closed the fish came to the surface of the lake and they were strange ones one had little gauzy wings so that she could fly just above the surface and a little halo of light formed above her head what are you i asked not expecting an answer for few fish talk shes an angelfish manvisitor a voice at the shore said there was a fatfaced fish there and it seemed that one could talk she will dance for you if you wish angelfish are very nice creatures well sure i agreed seeing no harm in it some civilized folk think there is nothing good in the wilderness but we uncivilized folk know that there are fewer threats to man among wild creatures than there are among our own violent kind the angelfish stood on her tail just over the water buzzed her wings and did a pirouette then she leaped and circled and splashed lightly against the lake the light from her halo was enough to make her reflection visible in the still water so that there seemed to be two of her one was upright above the surface and the other was inverted below it was a pretty effect then another fish appeared his motions sending rip ples that broke up the reflection of the first spoiling the effect he hoisted himself up he lacked wings but some how was able to walk the surface he was reddish and had little horns and his tail curved back behind him as he stood ending in a barb and theres the devilfish the fat announcer said he always shows up to spoil things indeed it was so for the angelfish made a little bubbly scream and fled the devilfish chasing her with an evil leer on his gills but she could not leave the region of the water and the lake was small so they went round and round in circles suddenly i jumped something had cut my foot which was near the water i lookedand saw a cuttlefish its tentacles like knives brandishing those little blades at my tender toes i had taken off my boots to air my stinking feetbarbarian feet can be pretty bad when confined and when the stench gets so thick it squishes its time to let it outso now they were vulnerable get away from me you creep i snapped grabbing a boot and flailing with it the fish dived below the surface my boot struck the fringe of waterand stuck now i knew boots could get pretty gunky but they had never stuck to water before i yankedand found that something had clamped onto the boots toe it had giant dull pincersand when i hauled harder the whole thing came up and i saw it was crewel lye crewel lye nothing but pincers broad serrated things whats this i demanded a shellfish of course the other fish replied how do i get it off my boot well its afraid of starfish i looked into the dark sky there was a star in the shape of a fish but it was out of reach some starfish shine brightly in the water while others hover in the night sky i suppose there is enough water up there for them but my animal cunning was operating let go shellfish or ill fetch down that starfish i threatened immediately the shellfish dropped off my boot and sank back in the water i had bluffed it you should have eaten it instead the other fish said and the cuttlefish too they wouldnt have liked that i said who cares what they like they dont count nobody counts but number one my brow creased what kind offish are you i thought youd never ask i am a selfish of course sell fish what do you sell instant gratificationthats the selfish way dont worry about the welfare of others dont listen to him the angelfish called pausing in her flight then she screamed for in that moment other distraction the devilfish had caught up with her he wrapped his fins about her quivering body and bore her down despite her struggles the two disappeared under the surface and only her little halo remained floating on the water he always wanted to catch an angel like her the sel fish said smugly she wont be needing that halo any morenot after hes through compromising her i was angry about the fate of the pretty angelfish somethings fishy about your attitude i said i fished the halo out of the water but it disintegrated in my hand halos were not for such as i youre a fool the selfish said witheringly and swam away i surely am i said under my breath people like me were always getting victimized by clever unscrupulous people like magician yang just as the angelfish was rav ished by the devilfish yet somehow i didnt care to trade places with the obvious winners i couldnt make much sense of my own attitude it was simply the way i was just an ignorant barbarian i slept discontented next day we left the island and set off again we came to a kind of gateway in the forest formed by two large trees linking branches above i didnt like this it reminded me of the trees guarding castle roogna the ones that didnt like me but there was so much thorny bush around that the portal appeared to be the only practical way to go pook didnt like it any better than i did but also saw no better way it seemed that was the direction we were supposed to be going in by his reckoning so we went pook nudged through the gate and i kept my hand on my sword nothing happened but pook sniffed the air nervously winding something unpleasant and i experienced a feeling of claustrophobia this was definitely ugly territory yet the sun shone pleasantly there were playful little breezes the footing was good and there did not seem to be any bad animals in this region so we moved along well i did notice that the trees interlinked forming ver itable walls of foliage but these were intermittent so that we had no trouble passing through the spaces both of us remained nervous about the confinement but all we needed to do was trot along until we got out of the region cer tainly it was better than climbing a snowtopped moun tain then there was a buzzing i didnt like the sound of that and pook switched his tail nervously horses tend to dislike buzzing things generally but some buzzes are worse than others and this was bad buzzing the sound loomed louder and then the source manifesteda swarm of huge flies i muttered a repellerspell some people claimed spo ken spells didnt work in xanth but in my opinion those folk hadnt given them a fair trial i used spells to make fire put myself to sleep abolish warts adjust my eyes to sudden changes of light ease pain and the like that sort of magic generally worked for me of course it helped to have two magic stones to strike together for the first spark for the fire and to relax properly before using the sleepspell the magic took weeks or months to work on the warts and several seconds on the eyes and there was only so much that incidental magic could do for pain but weak magic was better than none at all i always said knocking on wood sometimes when i was very tired and really needed to sleep the sleepspell zonked me out in stantly and that was a blessing one simply had to under stand the natural limitations of magic then it worked just fine once in a while one encountered a bum spell one that simply did not perform as advertised then it was simply a matter of reporting it to the barbarian better business bureau so that no one else would be deceived into using that spell anyway i used the flyspookspell but that swarm came right on at us then i saw that these were not or dinary flies they were dragonflies resistive to such little magic normally dragonflies did not deign to bother peo ple but buzzed about their own business preying on other bugs and keeping company with real dragons on occa sion a dragonfly would adopt someones garden keeping it clear of bugs but these ones were different they were wild not tame and they were out after us pook broke into a gallop but the dragonflies were faster than we were and quickly overhauled us i flailed my arms and pook swished his tail violently but to no avail the flies came at us headon jetting fire and veered away only at the last instant thus their fire continued on at its target one of those little scorches scored on my bare forearm it hurt this seemed ludicrous but i drew my sword and sliced the air with it swiftly i cut a fly in half and winged another the first fell with smoke trailing from its fuselage and the second plunged out of control because of the loss of its wing crashed into the ground and exploded a mushroom cloud of smoke roiled up from the site of the impact that made the others pause for a moment then they formed into a wedge and charged us together i put up the flat of my blade to deflect their massed firepower and their flame reflected back at them scorching several you would think dragonflies would be immune to their own heat but as with many creatures they cant take what they give out there were three more spins out of control and two more explosions the third just fizzled sending up a few sparks before melting down now the flies withdrew into a huddle consulting i didnt like the look of this if they charged us all at once from all sides pook and i would get badly burned but instead they retreated what do you make of that i asked aloud pook twitched an ear as mystified as i some of his hide was scorched and he had surely expected worse to come these flies had seemed more omery than that and cer tainly no cowards their abrupt departure was as ominous as their approach had been but there was nothing better to go on maybe they ran low on fuel i said the way that last one fizzed maybe he lacked the oomph to blow but i didnt really believe that then pook stepped over an object on the ground there was a flash of something awful the next evil spell i exclaimed with dismay we triggered it the dragonflies knew it was lurking here but what spell was it nothing seemed to have hap pened so i leaned down to peer more closely at whatever it was before it faded out the dragonflies would not have veered away from an innocuous spell it was in the shape of a black monster i needed the monsterbanishingspell and i had it in my bagbut did i dare invoke it it was possible that not all the white spells had been garbled but i decided not to risk it for one thing no monster had appeared maybe this particular spell had malfunctioned we heard a gleeful buzzing returning and with it the thunkthunk of the footfalls of some massive creature now i could be wrong but that sounds like large trouble to me i said pook agreed he took off at a gallop leaving the pon derous noise behind its always best to avoid trouble if possible especially when its bigger than you are i know that sounds unbarbarian but there are a number of myths about barbarians ive been trying to dispel when the only safety is in flight the sensible man flees but we came to a curve in the path and the vegetation was too thickly intertwined to permit any ready egress we had to follow that curve in a loop back the pursuing thing made a shortcut and gained on us we just didnt have time to hack through the meshed trees and brush we had to keep moving that was of course why that spell had been placed here it was a very bad place for me fortunately we had developed enough of a lead so that we were still well ahead of the creature we took off down a new path and again left the thunkthunkthunk behind and again we encountered a curve this was incon venient annoying and perhaps dangerous for it allowed the thing behind us to catch up once more this time the snout of the thing showed around the curve before we left it behind it had whiskers and a feline aspect as we left it behind this time i wondered what had a feline aspect and six legs for that was the number it had i could tell by the triple thunk i was long accustomed to identifying animals by their traces and sounds two legged creatures have an even beat when they run four legged have double beat as the two forelegs and two hind legs strike this was triple i had not so long ago en countered a sixlegged creature i couldnt quite remem ber where but it had been so lowslung as to whomp rather than run this was different and another turn this was awkward as anything now all of the pursuer came into view and i recognized it at lastthe tarasque of courseyin had warned me of it of all the creatures i might have encountered here this was the one i least preferred now that i grasped its na ture the tarasque was technically a dragon but not a normal one for it possessed certain nonreptilian attri butes its head was that of an antlion it had six ursine legswe dont have what the mundanes call bears in xanth but we do have their legsa big spiked carapace and an ugly reptilian tail all in all an ugly customer once more we outdistanced it but still we were in the confines of this maze and the tarasque seemed tireless some of these big ones are boosted by magic unfair as that may seem to their prey if we ever got out into open forest we could outrun it permanentlybut we were stuck in this mess of channels and of course that was the point the evil spell had been placed to summon the monster as the final wedge of a careful trap naturally the bumpkin had marched right into it it was now apparent that the evil spells were not simply strewn along my predetermined path in random fashion they were set where they would do the most harm the odds against me were even worse than i had imagined i had no choice i would have to risk a defensive spell maybe it would turn out wrong but at least it was a chance but which spell the white compass had converted a stone mountain to flesh would the monsterbanishing spell relate any better but i didnt know what would be better than the correct spell i just had to hope that not all the spells would turn out to be mixed up so i grabbed for the white monster figurine as we moved along invoke i cried as i held it in my hand it flashed but the triple pounding of the monsters paws continued unabated behind us whatever the spell had done it wasnt monster banishment my awareness enlarged as the white object faded from my hand i knew we were in a mazewarren that might have only one exit so that the tarasque could run down unwary prey at his leisure that way the monsters slow ness did not matter just as i had worn down pook when i stalked him and herded him into an inescapable situa crewel lye tion so the tarasque would wear us down flight would not accomplish anything except tiring us out and that was no good it would be better to stand and fight while we were strong pick a good place to ambush the monster i told pook well fight he wiggled an ear in acknowledg ment one thing about tripping the evil spellit meant we were still on course for the object since the spells had been placed along that course in factanother light bulb sprouted momentarily above my head brightening the whole region but not alas blinding the tarasquethat course was predestined yang knew where to place his spells because he knew where i was going to go according to the prophecy there really should be a law against such prophecies thought darkly but this was actually good news for me since my route was predestined i did not even need the finderspell i would get to the object re gardless in fact i couldnt avoid it that also explained why yang had tried to bribe me to quit if he really believed i would fail he had no need of bribery but if my route was predestined then i would find the objectunless i deliberately gave up the mission it was not failure that stalked me but successassuming i could handle the hazards along the way presumably if i got permanently killed that would be the same as giving up and the remainder of my predestined route would be voided now why was all this obvious to me now when it had been obscure before was i thinking better and the an swer was yes i was thinking quite a bit better i was more intelligent than i had been that meant that i had invoked magician yins spell of intelligence it had been intended to counteract yangs lurking spell of idiocy but now had simply increased my normal level i was a barbarian ge nius the irony was that genius is wasted on a barbarian it doesnt take brains to swing a sword it takes muscle no really smart man would be a barbarian another counter spell had been wasted crewel lye well i was stuck with it could intelligence help me escape the monster that was doubtful given a little time i could devise a weapon from plucked foliage that would cause the tarasque to draw into his shell and be helplessbut i had no time the smartest thing to do was to stay out of the monsters labyrinth i would have realized that had i invoked this spell before entering so it wasnt much help to me at the moment nevertheless being smart couldnt hurt quickly i reviewed what i could recall about the tar asque i had thought i had never heard of it but i had merely forgotten there turned out to be more information stored in the crannies of my brain than i had realized bits and pieces of things i had heard elsewhere in my life and not remembered until this moment of heightened in telligence the tarasque was a deadly monster and not a stupid one it preyed only on live healthy creatures so that it would not pick up any loathsome diseases or suffer indigestion it avoided carrion and tainted meat the classier predators were like that griffins were no toriously finicky for example there was my strategy of survival i would try to kill the tarasquebut if i failed i would pretend to be tainted then it would not eat me and my talent in due course would restore me to full health it was not the easiest way to get through but it was feasible what then of pook he could not heal rapidly or grow back lost limbs or return from death pook if i lose you take off immediately you must escape while the tarasque is tending to me he neighed in negation no i will heal i assured him you need time to find your way out of the maze i can give you that time he snorted disliking this obviously believing that i was exaggerating my healing propensity but he assented suddenly he veered into a side pocket this was just large enough to give us fighting room while protecting our sides and rear if we could hold off the monster this was the place to do it crewel lye but first lets give the tarasque a chance to pass us by i said we dont want to fight unless we have to in a moment the monster shot past our alcove screeched to a halt backed up and stared in i realized that i should have struck at its midsection before it got its head oriented now that i saw it clearly the head had tusklike teeth and orangeglaring eyes and was framed by a tawny mane overall the tarasque was as big as pook but the horse was constructed for running while the mon ster was constructed for combat its bearpaws attached to hugely muscled legs and their claws were stout i drew my sword as i dismounted and stood before pook facing the tarasque i dont suppose we can settle this amicably i inquired of the monster i really didnt expect any affirmation but i wouldnt want it said that i had fought without reason there are forms to be fol lowed after all for answer the monster roared the sound made the trees confining us shudder their leaves curling what power an ogre could hardly do much better than that im a husky barbarian of course so i dont properly understand fear but that sound provided me with an ink ling the wind from the monsters exhalation blew back my hair and tore at the interlocking branches of the trees the odor of it was not exactly sweet either i feel obliged to advise you that i am a primitive warrior type excellent with my weapons i said too bad the monsters carapace was so sturdy it would resist the blast of a pineapple otherwise i would have had an easy way out if you should choose to back off now i will understand the tarasque took a step forward its three left legs moved together then its three right legs it opened its mouth marvelously wide so that i could readily perceive exactly how horrendous its jaws were those teeth were like a forest of spikes some narrowing to points some splitting into multiple cutting ridges some serrated like the surface of a saw there were ledges and valleys and sculptured contours that i was sure meshed neatly with crewel lye their opposite numbers when those jaws came together hapless indeed the creature on whom those jaws closed i tried once more for courtesy requires three attempts at peaceful settlement there is one special thing you should know about me the tarasque pounced mouth gaped wide another roar forming in the tonsil region ah well i had tried now i fought free of any res ervations im actually pretty good in that sort of circum stance i swung my blade about with the legendary skill for which barbarians are justly famed it blurred in an arc that passed through the gaping mouth and severed the tongue a tonsil and the forming roar that cut the bite short the jaws clapped together as my sword exited and spurting blood overlapped those finely chiseled clean white teeth i did try to warn you turtleshell i said i am not your routine terrified helpless prey i am a swordsman you will take severe injuries and perhaps die if you per sist in this quarrel the tarasques eyes blazed that was of course the point to my discussion to enrage the creature beyond the edge of reason it is standard barbarian artifice number three verbal aggravation of subject some weak swords men with strong tongues do very well on the adventure circuit i understand the monster nudged forward swiping at me with a massive forepaw i ducked back and the swipe missed and caught the trunk of the tree to my right gouging out four channels of bark the tree shuddered and groaned woodenly and sap dripped from the wounds that from channel number smelled very good but i had concerns of my own i poked my point at the monsters left eye the tarasque ducked back alertly avoiding the thrust my first strike had caught it by sur prise but now it was wary having ones tongue cut off tends to facilitate caution so i struck down at its black nose and lopped off two whiskers that made the creature angry the loss of those whis kers disfigured its puss and it seemed the monster was crewel lye vain about its appearance the severed tongue and tonsil didnt show but those whiskers did the tarasque let out a bloodflecked scream and pounced at me of course i ducked down and jabbed the point of my sword up seek ing to cut the exposed throat the monster spun aside just barely in time lost its balance and crashed against the clawed tree my advantage i squeezed out on the other side and made a powerful twohanded chop at its side all i hit was its heavily armored carapace my blade bounced off with no injury to the tarasque but with a numbing shock to my hands and arms ouch i wouldnt do that again now i was outside my alcove and afoot i had no protection to sides or rear i would be lost in a moment if i didnt do something the tarasque was bringing its head about i jumped forward grabbed the nearest spike and hauled myself up on the dragons carapace i doubted that the mon sters head could reach the middle of its armored back ho halfwhisker i cried as i seated myself between spikes bracing my boots against them what do you say now stinksnoot tastefully selected insults are naturally a key aspect of artifice number three what the tarasque said was an unrepeatable roar of wrathy rage it whipped its head about to snap at me but couldnt reach me i chopped at its furry ears with my sword cutting off one of them that made the monster angrier yet the tarasque tried to buck me off but was too solid to accomplish much and i was well braced it tried to reach up a paw to swipe at me but the six legs were designed for nether support of its solid mass not for upward mobility and this one never got close it tried to bash my leg against a tree but its own spikes extended well beyond my leg so that all it did was poke a hole in the tree and get itself temporarily stuck in the wood it tried to roll over squashing me but the spikes prevented it from rolling meanwhile i constantly nicked those bits of flesh i could reach with the point of my sword harrying the monster unmercifully crewel lye unfortunately i could not do the tarasque serious harm from where i perched its carapace protected it from in jury as effectively as it protected me from molestation so we were hung up for the moment locked in combat without being able to terminate it maybe this would be come a kind of siege with the one who lasted longest emerging the victor alas not so the tarasques long serpentine tail whipped about and stung me on the back that could touch me i tried to lop off the end of thattail but it flicked in and out so fast i couldnt catch it in fact i didnt even dare turn my head for fear the tail would twitch out an eye or two my light body armor was getting cut up and stripes were appearing on my flesh i had to get out of range of that tail but to do that i had to get off the carapaceand that would render me vulnerable again to the rest of the mon ster was there some other way yes there was i squirmed around and crawled back ward passing one spike after another moving toward the tail naturally the flashing tip tore up my back consid erably but i pressed on until i was able to turn partway shield my face with my free forearm and poke my sword down at the base of the tail where it emerged from the carapace i sawed away at that exposed flesh trying to sever it from the body my leverage wasnt good but my blade was sharp and soon i penetrated the thick hide to the tender flesh beneath the tarasque screamed and leaped prodded by the sudden pain that motion was so abrupt and vigorous that i somersaulted from my perch and rolled on the ground now i was in trouble the tarasque blinked taking a moment to realize that i had been dislodged then it got its reflexes back in order and pounced i had hung onto my sword now i brought it up and stabbed it at the monsters snout the point sank into the tender cheek the head jerked back coming off the blade and blood gouted out i scrambled to my feet and backed toward the alcove crewel lye the enraged monster sprang at me again this time swiping with a forepaw i parried the paw and the blade sliced into it cutting off a claw and its supporting pad but the shock of the swipe dashed the sword from my hand i was disarmed well not quite i still had my knife i had left my bow and arrows and the bag of spells with pook they would not be useful in combat like this but the knife seemed pitifully inadequate the tarasque figured it had me and pushed forward mouth opening to take a juicy bite of barbarian its an established fact that barbarians taste better than civilized folk do because they are healthier with more lean red meat well monsters make mistakes just as men do i stabbed the knife blade into its black nose and twisted that smarted the creature let out a feline screech that threatened to turn my fingernails green and jerked back with unbecoming haste i hung onto the knife wrenching it out just ahead of a gout of blood for the moment the tarasque was blinded by pain naturally i followed up my advantage i am not a war rior for nothing i lunged again for the monsters throat seeking the vulnerable vein but the head pulled back quickly this thing wasnt a predatory monster for noth ing either i was a good deal more of a contest than the dragon had figured but the odds remained in its favor especially as it learned from its little misjudgments i missed the throat and stumbled into the chest area actually this wasnt a bad place to be the tarasque was accustomed to chasing and catching fleeing prey not to scratching for it underfoot chickens scratch not drag ons it tried to swipe at me with a forepaw but lacked proper leverage that way and i had no trouble avoiding the clumsy motion then realizing that its right midpaw was pretty well pinned to the ground while the right fore paw was swiping i squatted and plunged my blade through that portion that was against the ground right above the big claws hoo what a fuss that monster made it yanked up the crewel lye pawbut with two paws in the air at once it lost its balance and sank down on that side i had to scramble to avoid getting crushed under the descending carapace this creature was armored all around its midsection so that i could not get in a good bellystab too bad in this moment the region was wide open aha the legs werent armored just the body where the legs emerged from the carapace they looked espe cially tender there was room for motion around each leg so that it wouldnt bang into the carapace the monster would not be able to chase down swift prey without free play for the legs it all made sensebut it offered me my opportunity i dug my blade into that cavity between carapace and leg i was rewarded by another roar of enraged anguish i was really scoring on the monster now both magician yin and the tarasque itself had underestimated the bar barian powers of close combat and perhaps i had done so too maybe i could take this monster but i had overplayed my hand the tarasque flopped all the way to the ground and though i had to scramble out from beneath and did so with alacrity my knife hand got pinned between the leg and the carapace and i was caught thats the one time when the leg does come up against the shellwhen the creature lies down my knife hand wasnt hurt but i couldnt quite scramble free and the mass of the monster whomped down on my left leg crushing it it was my turn to howl the tarasque got up and turned about to come at me headfirst i tried to fend it off with one bare hand but one fell swoop of its forepaws nearly ripped my arm from its socket then the monster pinned me to the ground with one paw and got ready to bite off my face pook get out of here i screamed just before the slavering bloodsoaked mouth closed on my head there was an instant of extreme discomfort as those tusks dug init really isnt much fun getting your face bitten off then darkness pook galloped out of the alcove his chains rattling the monster glanced up it wasnt finished with mein crewel lye fact it had hardly started on mebut the horses motion confused it maybe the sight of fleeing prey activated its chase circuit but of course one morsel on the paw is worth two on the hoof so the tarasque returned to the business at hand so to speak it chomped the rest of the way through my face pook whirled charged back and delivered a twohoofed kick to the monsters hind shell the gross body was shoved forward and the snoot plowed into the dirt beside my head that did it the tarasque spat out my face shook the dirt out of its eyes and started off after the ghost horse this was of course exactly what i didnt want since pook hadnt hadenough time to get clear but i was in no position to protest being unconscious in fact only now do i see in the tapestry what happened and how it was that pook once again rescued me i owe a lot to that horse the dragon limped but was still able to get up re spectable velocity i had hurt it in tongue cheek nose foot and shoulder socket but not enough to dim its fight ing spirit i had not it seemed slowed it enough to give pook a decent chance however pook was a smart animal he remembered the route out of the maze and followed it he did lose time going around the curves maybe he was guided by smell and sight as well as memory and did not dare to leave the exact trail we had made lest he get lost and confused and be trapped by the tarasque so it was close but he was able to remain just ahead perhaps the fact that he was no longer carrying my weight added to the injuries the monster had suffered helped what might have been a small but critical deficit in relative velocity became a small advantage in due course pook found his way to the entrance but it was closed vines had strung themselves across it and interlaced and sprouted wicked thorns pook skid ded to a halt four hooves churning up turf what was he to do now he had no sword to cut through this mass the dragon puffed up behind him the tarasque was crewel lye an oddball among dragons possessing no fire smoke or steam but when it ran it puffed pook took one look to the side realized that it was folly to remain in the maze to be chased down and leaped into the vineshrouded gate the thoms bit cruelly into his skin but his chains pro tected him some and he was able to scramble through just as the monster came up the tarasque snapped at pooks hind legs and that was a tactical error because those hooves shot back with a force of one horsepower and pasted it on the snoot then the ghost horse was through outside the maze but the dragon didnt desist it shook its sore snoot and roared at the vinesand they shriveled and fell away the tarasque leaped at pook who whirled and galloped off now the nature of the chase changed for the terrain favored the horse pook began to draw ahead but paused as it were in thought and then deliberately slowed al lowing the monster to close the gap pook ran just ahead always seeming about to be caught luring the predator ever farther away from its maze pook was of course very good at this sort of thing for this was how ghost horses earned their livingluring fools into bad regions or scaring them away from good ones i ought to know that gave me time to heal fortunately i wasnt dead just unconscious and facechewed in an hour or so i could grow back my eyeballs and things and be as good as new instead of my using myself as bait to distract the monster so pook could escape pook was distracting the monster so i could recover i think that was really nice of him pook led the tarasque to the region of caves we had passedthe ones with the dimepedes what was he con templating he could not hide there for the dimes would nickel him to death but it turned out he was more canny than that pook was a master of traps as i had discovered when i first chased him down he went and stood in a patch of sunlight crewel lye before a deepdark cave the dimes avoided sun so they did not show their silvery little snoots the tarasque came up it was a solid creature with its heavy carapace and maybe its injuries were telling it had slowed and was huffing loudly but now it thought it had trapped the horse and it charged pook stepped aside letting the monster burst into the cave it disappeared into the darkness there was a pause then a roar that shook the hillside the tarasque had dis covered the dimepedes or vice versa then the monster started to back outbut pook braced himself and kicked with his hind hooves again at the rear of the carapace using his horsepower to shove the monster back in it was a beautiful ploybut alas not enough the tarasque weighed more than pook did its huge shell made it invulnerable to kicks and it had strong reason to get out it hunkered down and shoved and pook could not confine it soon it got its head clear pawed away the clinging dimepedes and rotated to face the horse pook was no coward he stepped close to the tar asques face and spun about his chains flung out and whipped across the dragons head knocking out a tooth or two or maybe an eyeball the monster was so sur prised it pulled its head and forelegs back inside its shell whereupon pook kicked sand and dirt in after the head it seems monsters dont like having sand kicked in their snoots the tarasque bellowed so hard that the sand was blown out of its neck hole and three leg holes the car apace almost lifted off the ground propelled by the blast as roars go that was a good one now the baleful head came out of the shell teeth gleaming furiously and pook scored on the nose with another kick his hind hoof jammed the sore black nose right back into the dragons sore head so that the tar asques face became concave instead of convex and shoved the head back into the shell pook was fighting the monster better than i had then the horse sniffed smelling something quickly he trotted to the side where a ragweed bush grew he snatched a rag between his teeth ripped it off held his crewel lye breath and trotted back to the tarasque whose head was just emerging again from the carapace pook flung the rag onto the monsters nose and backed out of the way now ragweed was not a normal choice for cloth be cause of a special and objectionable quality of the rags no one wove ragweed into rugs or clothing except per haps as a practical joke and not just because the rags were ugly but in this case the tarasque sneezed that was what ragweed did it caused uncontrollable sneezing some creatures could sneeze for days after a single whiff others could struggle to keep their heads attached once the monster got a good deep whiff of the potent rag it was some sneeze the blast from it blew the leaves off bushes and stirred up little dust devils who uttered unkind syllables and fled the dragons whole body slid back a distance because of the recoil the next sneeze slid it back some more and the third put its tail well inside the cave half a dozen more sneezes had the tarasque all the way back in the cave pook trotted over to the ragweed and harvested an other rag the sneezedust practically oozed from it itch ing to do its nefarious job pook tossed it into the cave then scrambled up the hill found some debris and kicked it down he managed to start a minor avalanche that piled up junk before the cave partially blocking it that wouldnt stop the monster from powering out of course but it did tend to enclose the air and deflect the wind from the sneezes so that the magic sneezedust from the rag re mained mostly inside the cave that meant the tarasque had to keep inhaling it which in turn meant continued sneezing pook cocked an ear listening as the hillside shook with the reverberations i know what he heard a number of little sneezes along with the big ones the dimepedes were affected too they would be very angry once they managed to stopand there deep within their cave was the apparent instigator of it all the tarasque the dime pedes could not pinch through the carapace but they were small enough to scuttle up inside the leg holes head hole crewel lye crewel lye and tail hole and mad enough to do considerable damage to whatever flesh they found in there the tarasque was too deep inside the cave to escape readily this time there was about to be a reckoning satisfied pook trotted back toward the maze he had to most intents and purposes defeated the monster now he was returning to rescue me but i had problems of my own i had been healing nicelybut then the dragonflies arrived to harass me i was just regaining consciousness when they swarmed in and blasted me with dozens of little fiery jets singly each blast was painful together they were devastating my newly healing skin was blistered my clothing burned off my hair set on fire my sight was lost again and my sense of smell and then two flies zoomed down to jet into my ears and deprive me of my hearing too they actually tore me up much worse than the tarasque had done now that they had me helpless nothing is quite as cruel as a weakling with sudden power when pook returned to pick me up he found me lying under a cloud of dragonflies he charged in swishing his tail so violently that dozens of flies were knocked out of the air and sent spinning to the ground where they det onated the explosions were somewhat feeble because the flies fuel was almost exhausted now pook was strong the dragonflies weak they had used up most of their re serves on me cooking my flesh they spooked and fled there was no point in their remaining anyway they had already had their vengeance by destroying my body it seems pook did not yet properly understand the full nature of my talent maybe he thought my recovery had been a fluke before in the caves of the callicantzari he did not realize how badly the tarasque had hurt me or how far i had recovered from that before the flies re turned thus he did not understand that i would recover on my own given a few hours so he tried to help me he rolled me over with his nose shoved me into the bushes fringing the maze passage and wedged me up i rolled off and flopped back on the ground he tried again and again i flopped limply one seldom realizes how use ful human hands are until one observes a horse trying to pick up a man with hooves it is just about impossible my burnedoff skin was now plastered with dirt so that i looked like a zombie fried in bread crumbs anyone else would have sought a decent burial for the appalling remains but pook wouldnt give up he found a better place where a low branch touched the ground and rolled me to that then nosed me up on it got his head under and finally managed to hump me off the branch and onto his back my head and hands dangled on one side of his body and my feet on the other but he was able to carry me he took me out of the maze then on around it proceeding generally northwest probably he knew there was no help where we had been so he was hoping there would be some where we hadnt been as the day waned i healed partway and began to stir pook didnt realize the significance of that he might not even have distinguished my motion from that of inert flopping at last he spied a cabin in a clearing in the jungle he gave a nicker of relief and headed for it there perhaps there would be human help for me chapter threnody i woke in a bed of fragrant ferns i saw the in terior of the cabin neatly ordered with shelves bearing spices and herbs in a corner was a strange large hollow gourd with strings stretched lengthwise across it and sitting in a wicker chair was a quite pretty young woman in a brown dress she saw me react and got up to approach me so you crewel lye are recovering she said in a low voice i wasnt certain you would oh i always did before i said my body ached but i knew that would soon pass as the healing was com pleted your horse brought you in she said you seem to have been pretty badly burned that was when i realized that the dragonflies had re turned the awareness had faded out but now i remem bered yes i dont get many visitors the woman said so i may be rusty on the amenities let me just say that my name is threnody i live alone and like it and well get along just fine if you keep your hands to yourself and depart as soon as you are able your horse is grazing outside so this was a woman who wanted to be left alone some were like that i never did quite understand why well i had never been one to force my attentions on anyone barbarians generally encountered enough willing women so that they had little taste for unwilling ones and i dont care what the civilized folk claim to the con trary i am jordan the adventurer i heal very fast and i have a mission to accomplish so ill be on my way soon enough i said i thank you for taking care of me while i was unconscious i must have been pretty dirty you certainly were i had to wash you all over sand was virtually embedded in your hide i thought you were dead but you werent as far gone as it seemed i put some ointments on your burns and let you rest you must have blundered into a dragonfly nest she eyed me apprais ingly i must say you do have a hardy constitution youre quite a robust figure of a man yeah im a genuine barbarian mostly brawn not too much brain i said smiling actually i was pretty smart at the moment because of the eyequeue spell i had ac cidentally invoked fortunately pook is on hand to take care of me pook she repeated your horse does that mean crewel lye yes he is a pooka a ghost horse thats why he wears those chains you tamed a ghost horse she asked surprised no were just friends she laughed she was beautiful when she did that well hes loyal he could have dumped you off any where and left you to die she glanced toward the kitchen comer are you well enough yet to eat oh yes im hungry you are recovering swiftly you look better already yes im always hungry after a fatal injury i agreed again she laughed taking this as humor she poured some gruel from the pot on her hearth into a wooden bowl and brought it to me the stuff was as dark and liquid as her hair but it tasted good and seemed to be nutritious i felt rapidly stronger i have a trousertree growing in my yard she said never thought id need it as i prefer dresses she held up a pair of brown jeans these should fit you thank you i said i got out of the fern bed and into the jeans and they did fit tolerably well thats amazing she remarked watching evidently she wasnt one of those prudish civilized women though in other respects she did seem civilized your skin is almost whole again you were so badly burned i shrugged guess it looked worse than it was i could have explained about my talent but it didnt seem nec essary since i was about to leave actually i wasnt paying full attention to her as my ensmartened brain was distracted by philosophical insights and intellectual ex ercises it hadnt been interested in before today i can only vaguely appreciate the mental convolutions i in dulged in then for now i am of only ordinary smartness that is why i am not telling this story in the intelligent way i could have told it then yet i think in retrospect that i must have made the error of overlooking the obvious in the course of my pur suit of the esoteric for i really did not act very smart in threnodys house some extremely smart people are sort of dull about practical details crewel lye i had no idea youd be on your feet so soon she said what is your mission oh nothing that would interest you i replied off handedly i have to go fetch an object and bring it back to castle roogna castle roogna she repeated interested in a peculiar kind of way i should have noticed that but didnt then is that still functioning oh sure but old king gromden is dying and theres a problem about the succession so i the king is dying she asked alertly yes and these two magicians yin and yang are vying for the throne so yin and yangbut they cant agree on anything i finished except on this magic contest to see whose spells are stronger so i im beginning to understand you are working for them yes in a way ive got to complete my mission so yin will win but yangs spells are interfering its been pretty rough but i think im getting close i shrugged i wont bore you with the details ill be on my way now thanks for the gruel girl wait she said this object you have to fetchdo you know what it is no i have yins finderspell but havent used it yet but i think the object is somewhere around here because im predestined to sit down jordan she said let me tell you a story that you may not have heard ill serve you some wine oh sure thanks i was always willing to be socia ble threnody mixed some fluids in a cup which surprised me for i had always thought wine came directly from wineskins grown by winelilies she brought the cup to me and i drank it while she talked it was pungent stuff with a bitter aftertaste but pretty good barbarians dont have much taste anyway king gromden had a child a daughter threnody said crewel lye oh sure he told me what else did he tell you about her nothing much just that his wife and child had gone away and he missed them something awful i burped that wine was bubbling up inside me there was a bit more to the story than that thren ody said well hes pretty lonely now then my intelligence had a flash yang mentioned scandal maybe that was she was silent a moment then resumed her story as if she had not been interrupted king gromdens daugh ter was the apple of his eye and indeed she was said to be very pretty his wife grew jealous of the attention the child got and put a curse on her if she remained at castle roogna the castle would fall this saddened the king very much but he had to preserve the capital of xanth at all costs so he sent the girl away because he was angry with the queen for putting on that curse he sent her away too but before the queen departed she put a curse on him also that was her talent of coursecurses she came from cursefolk stock deep in southern xanth some call those folk fiends she caused him to forget the nature of the first curse so ever after the king sought his banished daughter not realizing that he himself had banished her and for good reason he finally located her but she remembered the curse and refused to return with him to castle roogna he could not understand why for when she told him of the curse he immediately forgot a good curse cant be circumvented just by a persons being told its nature it operates until revoked or until it just wears out and the curses of the cursefiends dont wear out since he could not grasp the truth and insisted on an answer she had to tell him a lie instead cruel as it was that she preferred to live in the open wilderness instead of in a gloomy old castle he kept trying to find ways to change her mind but was never successful thats very interesting i said he never said any thing to me about the curses naturally not he remembers his daughters absence crewel lye though threnody said and he swore he would find a way to bring her back and make her happy at castle roogna in fact he hoped she would marry his successor the next king of xanth so his line would continue in power the throne of xanth is not hereditary as it goes from magician to magician but sometimes there is a li neage through the female side his daughter wasnt a sorceress of course but that doesnt matter for wives well i guess that didnt work out i set down my empty mug his successor will be yin or yang and i dont think either is much interested in marriage right now they are interested the people would be more ready to accept a magician who married the prior kings daugh ter and her magic power would help him reign so she is a moderately valuable property as well as being physically attractive men tend to put too much stress on the latter aspect um yes i agreed contemplating threnodys own figure in any event they would not have a choice the king arranged it so that neither could become king unless he married her my head was whirling pleasantly that was strong wine maybe hell spring that detail on the winner once i bring back the object i said but it will be too bad because if her return to the castle means it will fall yes it is a cruel situation she agreed that girl will never return to castle roogna because she loves her father and loves xanth nothing else she will do anything to prevent her return no matter who the next king is though it breaks her fathers heart she has no choice well its not my business i said standing i just have to fetch the i reeled staggered lost my balance and fell against the bed something was wrong threnody came to me im sorry i had to poison you barbarian she said but if you should succeed in your mission and yin becomes king he will do what king gromden wants and marry gromdens daughter and keep crewel lye her at castle roogna i must prevent that for when castle roogna falls so does the human domination of xanth but i protested groggily you see barbarian innocent am king gromdens daughter she said i felt it only fair to let you under stand why i had to kill you better that the life of one foolish adventurer be forfeit than that castle roogna should fall it is nothing personal you seem like a nice person for a barbarian then i passed out and i suppose i died for the poison had spread all through my system and it was potent stuff threnody dragged my body across the floorshe turned out to be pretty strong for a womanand to a trapdoor in the back of the cabin and shoved me in i slid down a dark chute then out into the light and into empty air the chute opened into the forgotten gap chasm i dropped a horrible distance and thunked head first into the rock at the bottom if the poison hadnt quite killed me the fall certainly had pook heard the distant thunk his ears twitched the edge of the chasm was curved here and the chasm itself was narrow pook found a ledge that overlooked the depth and he peered down his sharp eyes or nose spied my still remains below and he gave a neigh of dismay maybe he felt responsible for he was the one who had brought me to threnodys cabin but he was a pretty smart animal and maybe some of that intelligence spell had rubbed off on him for he set about getting down to me without hurting himself he trotted west along the brink of the gap to where it inter sected the sea then jumped into the deep channel of water he had a long way to fall and made an awful splash but in a moment he bobbed to the surface despite the weight of his chains and swam into the chasm until the water thinned and he could walk on land evidently the gap dragon had business elsewhere for there was no sign of him after all the gap extends all the way across xanth as we now know and no one creature can be everywhere at once still it was a considerable act of courage on pooks part unless perhaps he had forgotten about the crewel lye dragon on the other hand he had turned out to be pretty good at fighting dragons so maybe he wasnt afraid or maybe he remembered and was afraid but was deter mined to go to me anyway it wasnt long before he trotted up to my remains i was not a pretty sight my legs were broken and my head had cracked open and spilled some of its contents out nothing important just some gray matter that i sup pose was stuffing or insulation but it was messy and there was a good deal of blood spread about i was as dead as i had ever been my sword was lying nearby bent and chipped too that makes me sad to contemplate for that sword had served me well and could not heal itself pook used his hoof to scrape the pieces and gunk into a pile he pushed the pile onto a big leaf and made as good a bundle as he could manage there was dirt and garbage mixed in of course but that couldnt be helped pook shoved the bag around trying to figure out how to carry it but could not so he cast about for a decent burial spot believing me to be finished there was none he decided to take me to the shorebut that was some distance away what was he to do he managed to get the top of the bundle knotted to gether somewhat then hooked one of his chains through it and the swords guard and dragged them the bundle bumped across the terrain getting its contents thoroughly mixed when pook reached the small sandy beach where the chasm joined the ocean he left the bag at the edge and set to work excavating a hole with his hooves ob viously he intended to bury the remains he was after all a ghost horse he knew about death and burial but when the hole got deep water seeped in dis gusted he moved farther from the sea and started a new hole he didnt want my remains to get wet maybe he thought id be uncomfortable if i rotted in the water but the new hole too filled with water he moved yet farther awaybut here it was rocky impossible to dig with hooves pook pondered then he got smart again what about crewel lye sea burial he could weight the bag down with a big rock and sink it in the sea evidently he thought my remains wouldnt be as uncomfortable in deep water but there were several problems for one thing he had no way to tie a rock to the bundle even if he had good vines he couldnt tie knots in them and he knew the big wrapping leaf would soon disintegrate in the seawater releasing its contents as he peered out across the water he saw a lurking sea monster licking its chops he knew i didnt like getting eaten by monsters good thing that monster hadnt been there when pook had jumped into the sea finally he shrugged and resumed dragging the bundle he intended to get it to a suitable burial place no matter how much effort it took he hauled and he hauled finding paths up the steep slope to the higher ground he was panting and sweating but would not desist till nightfall made it too dark to con tinue without risking a misstep and a tumble back to the beach pook was used to night but this was treacherous terrain and the bundle was awkward to manage so he parked it in a niche then braced himself below it and slept on his feet he was tired and hungry but he refused to quit until he had done the burial properly pook was one faithful friend in death as he was in life but in the night the creatures of the noctum emerged to forage unseen things slithered along the slope and there were sounds of scuttling and scratching insects set up a persistent chirruping pook stirred himself to stomp anything that approached the bundle a hatch opened a short distance below and a goblins head poked out pook nudged a stone to roll down and scare the goblin back into his hole as he knew goblins could be very bad in quantity but this place was evidently out of the main goblin country a solitary goblin could be dealt with more readily than a mob then a smell developed pook sniffed and snorted disliking it for a moment he might have been afraid the stuff in the bag was decomposing then he heard crass flapping and realized it was a harpy the uglyfaced avian crone loomed near sensing her type of prey namely crewel lye crewel lye something helpless but pook squealed warning and reared up milling his forehooves and clanking his chains and she reconsidered i didnt know that carrion was yours pooka she screeched most nags dont eat meat next time let a girl know you blippety blip i doubt i am repeating the exact words she used as they weren t nice words they flattened pooks ears against his head and caused the scuttlings in the vicinity to curl up and die in this manner the ghost horse guarded the bag during the night and never was there a more loyal and forlorn service rendered pook thought he was protecting the re mains for decent burial actually he was giving me time to heal my talent had both poison and the fatal fall to nullify and that was a considerable task i doubt that i had ever before been killed quite so dead but all my pieces were there plus some dirt for good measure i had been granted a day and a night without disturbance and i was indeed on the mend as the light of morning peeped hesitantly over the brink and crept into the chasm i stirred pook had been horsenapping the motion in the bag brought his ears straight up in shock had a predator sneaked inside to guzzle out the goodies he investigated immediately pulling the bag open i looked out at him hi pook i said was it bad this time he almost fell off the slope i stretched and climbed out of the leaf i was weak but whole its rough recovering from two deaths simulta neously i would need to eat and rest to replenish the formidable energies expended in the reconstruction say didnt i hear a harpy in the night i inquired you shouldnt have driven her off you should have used her for stork fodder then i paused appalled while pook looked at me as if i had sprouted demons horns what was i saying nobody got that close to a harpy how could i have spawned such a dirty thought actually its clear now though it was muddy then some of that dirt had gotten scooped up with my remains and tied in the bagthat dirt had gotten caught in my cracked head as it healed and now i had a dirty mind too badbut of course it had been a very difficult feat of healing after a moment pook recovered from his amazement and disgust decided it was really me back alive and came to nuzzle my hand oh didnt you understand about me i asked him realizing that he hadnt actually seen me heal before not all the way from death he had always been away avoiding dragons or searching for an exit from callicantzari caves or battling a tarasque my magic tal ent is to heal rapidly from wounds or whatever if i lose part of my body i regrow it if i am killed i recover you must have collected everything together for me so i could recover most rapidly thank you pook that was very nice of you he just stood there embarrassed i petted him on the neck horses have excellent necks for petting chickens dont i see you brought the bag of spells along also and my sword thats good those spells may be jumbled but ill probably need them i still have my mission to complete i looked around but how did we get here on the slope last i remember threnody had given me poisonbut it shouldnt have taken me a day and a night to recover from that i glanced at my body and that wouldnt account for the destruction of my clothing and all the new flesh i have grown ive just been through a major healing pook gestured with his head indicating the chasm you mean she dumped me down there i asked i must have splattered like a broken egg he nodded agreement now i understood just how much he had done for me and what it had meant when he gave me his friendship i knew i owed him a big one we climbed on up the slope slowly for i was weak and he was tired as i moved i remembered what thren ody had said just before i died she was king gromdens daughter cursed to stay away from castle roogna lest it fail and afraid that magician yin would marry her and make her return if he became king i could see her con crewel lye cembut it seemed somewhat extreme for her to murder me so abruptly just for that i had nothing to do with it really well not quite true if i succeeded in my mission then yin would become king and the heat would be on threnody but why couldnt she simply refuse to marry him or refuse to return to castle roogna she had said no to her father the king she could say no to magician yin she didnt have to kill me to prevent yin from win ning she could have asked me not to mention her where abouts or she could have moved to some other hidden place before i returned to the castle thus her action didnt seem to make sense and that bothered me for she was a most attractive woman a woman i would have been happy to then i wondered just how much sense my own thoughts were making but i had an excusethe dirt mixed up with the other gunk in my head for all i knew some rich brown dirt was a good substitute for the useless gray stuff that had spilled still my head wasnt quite the way it had been of course as i said i didnt realize this at the time for i hadnt seen myself splat in the gap chasm nevertheless my mind did feel somewhat like an egg scrambled in sand for one thing i seemed to have lost most of the advantage of the intelligence spell since no more complex philosophic thoughts churned about inside my skull maybe the eyequeue spell had compensated for the mixing my skullinnards had received resulting in approximately normal intellect had i been really smart i could have figured out exactly what made sense about threnody and maybe saved myself an extraordinary amount of grief but the eyeballs of the eyequeue must have been pointed every which way so they couldnt quite focus on the obvious i cant say even now how my thoughts ran then i guess i hadnt properly appre ciated the extent of my injuries since i had been dead at the time i really didnt want to believe that a woman as lovely as threnody could have done as much damage to me as she had i wasnt nearly as sensible as a barbarian should have been one thing was muddily clear though i should stay crewel lye away from threnody because she was either crazy or dangerous possibly both if yin was going to marry her that was his problem not mine he was a magician maybe he could handle her i couldnt see why he would even want to marry a woman like that um no i could see to gain king gromdens sanction for the succession and the dirt in my mind smudged a picture for me of what she might look like without clothes and of what a man might dowell never mind i would just go about my business fetch the object bring it to castle roogna and then get out of this region before the ship hit the fanny so to speak i think that saying derives from the time someone accidentally sailed his ship into the pos terior of a snoozing giant sea monster that was not a smart thing to do we made it to the top of the slope by midday to our immense relief there was a nice green plain loaded with tall grass and dotted with fruit and nut trees here we could relax and fill up as we so desperately needed to i took three good steps toward the nearest treeand tripped over another black spell this one was in the shape of a stone it flared up darkly i knew what that meantand if i hadnt known i could have guessed for my foot was turning to black stone quickly i kicked the spell so hard it flew out over the edge of the plain and rolled down the embankment toward the sea there wasnt much damage it could do there most of the slope was already stone it might be awkward for the goblin and harpy in the vicinity and perhaps the sea monster but that was all it wouldnt catch pook then i grabbed for a counterspell for now my other foot was calcifying too evidently that moment of contact had been enough for the spell to get the measure of me i hadnt stopped its progress merely by kicking it away the stonetoflesh spell had already been expended but maybe i wasnt thinking clearly the dirt fuzzing my brain could account for that too mostly i think i was just too rushed to make any really smart decision when one crewel lye feels ones legs getting stoned one doesnt pause too long for reflection i came up with the white doll that was the bodies exchange spell to reverse the black spell of that type i didnt need that now but since the spells were all mixed up i knew it would be something else maybe some other spell would help crazy as that notion seems now that i can consider it more objectively invoke i cried the doll flashedand suddenly i had a vision of an arrow pointing east an arrow what could that be ohthis was the needle of the compass of the finderspell for the object i was to fetch now i could find it since this positive spell was fresher than the negative one i had encountered atop the mountain but that didnt do me a phenomenal lot of good at the moment for my legs were still changing to stone and my thighs too maybe getting rid of the black spell had weak ened the effect but i had gotten a good dose and it looked as if i were going to become a statue now what should i do as i hesitated my hands stiffened and the hair on my head became brittle and heavy my face glazed over my breathing got labored for stone is not very flexible i felt myself falling and felt the thunk as i struck the ground hard i hoped my stone body did not hurt the ground too much then i faded out as my brains were stoned too this was my third death in the space of a day or two not what i would call a very positive record pook watched all this with alarm he had hardly gotten me to safety when this happened but he was smart enough to realize that if i could recover from getting smashed at the bottom of the chasm i might recover from getting stoned too pooks brains after all had not been scram bled so he nosed me over hooked a chain under my rigid arms and dragged me to the shade of the tree i had been headed for there he let me lie while he grazed about the tree in a widening circle keeping one eye on me and the other out for any stray monsters that might pass by creatures did appear one was a small feline on the crewel lye prowl for prey but pook stomped a forefoot and it fled for it was a scaredy cat a swarm of frisbees flew over but they were only interested in flowers they were shaped like little disks and they sort of glided down to a flower then spun away to the next a long dark shape flapped in its wings leathery its body like a thin club it was a baseball bat looking for a baseball there was none here as the bases generally held their balls in the evenings so it flapped on past some junebugs buzzed me no they were jejune bugs comparatively dull and uninteresting a bird flitted about the tree under which i lay a brown thrasher but there was nothing brown here to thrash so it dropped a dropping on my nose taking me for a statue and flew off now i understood why sculptures objected to birds dusk came creeping guiltily across the plain pook stood near me making sure nothing bothered me the truth is very little bothers stone figures apart from ham mers and earthquakes and the aforementioned attentions of birds but the ghost horse remained as faithful as ever trusting me to recover in due course his trust was rewarded for gradually my talent fought the curse of stone and prevailed my head returned to flesh in the night and my torso and i began to breathe again it was a good thing that evil magician yang hadnt known about my talent he thought the stonespell would finish me and he was wrong had he suspected he might have arranged to have my statue smashed into little pieces and scattered im not at all sure i could have recovered from that certainly it would have taken a long time and probably by then yang would have been deemed the win ner and crowned king as dawn dawned i was able to sit up pook gave a neigh of pleasure his faith had been justified but i was far from well for my legs and my left arm remained stone and my skull felt sort of rocky usually my healing ac celerated as it neared completion this time it was stalling i realized that my talent had been severely strained i had been savaged twice in the tarasques maze and killed twice by threnodys poison and the fall into the chasm crewel lye crewel lye and this was the fifth bad accident in two days or so i had never been killed before faster than once a day and usually not that frequently also these had been pretty thorough killings not simple to heal so my talent had at last exhausted itself and was unable to complete the job on my body well i couldnt blame it in a few hours or days i was sure my magic would recover its strength and polish off the remaining stone meanwhile i would have to func tion on an aswas basis in retrospect i conclude that my talent having expended its last gasp getting me mostly restored lost track of the job and assumed that i was supposed to be partly stone for it did not rush to complete the job when it could have just as a man coming into a strange house does not realize if a chair is out of place my reviving talent did not realize that the stone foot and hand were wrong but this is only conjecture long after the fact i dont really understand magic pook stood close and i grabbed onto his chains and hauled myself to my feet then i reached up to harvest enough of the fruits and nuts growing on the tree to sustain me after a while i managed to stand and walk by myself though my feet remained stone it was like walking on stilts i could manage but for traveling i needed the ghost horse now the day was fairly on us and the image of the arrow was in my mind eastthe direction of the object i had to go there and find it we went east following the fringe of the monstrous chasm odd i thought that no one had warned me of this natural hazard it could hardly be overlooked and what kind of an object would be hidden here well the arrow was clear in my mind showing only a little smudge along the shaft doubtless from the dirt in my head and i knew i would learn the answer soon this was after all a good time to have invoked the finderspell the object was evidently close so the spell tuned in strongly we approached threnodys cabin perched at the very brink of the chasm obviously the object was beyond it so we turned south to give the cabin wide clearance but the farther south we went the more the arrow veered it was pointing right at the cabin i tried not to believe it but when we were east of the cabin the arrow pointed west there could be no doubt the object was there i sighed i would just have to go and get it i knew threnody would not be pleased after all she had already killed me twice to prevent me from getting the object now i would have to take it from under her nose but id have to do it quickly and get away from there before she found some other way to kill me i couldnt blame her for not wanting to have someone bring her back to castle roogna but i did object to being killed even if it wasnt too serious a matter we went to the house and i dismounted and knocked on the door i heard music inside rather pretty she was playing the stringed instrument i had seen before when i knocked the music halted and in a moment threnody opened the door she stood aghast as she recognized me her mouth fell open and her fair skin paled got something to pick up i said gruffly i would have been more curt with her but she was so pretty i didnt feel as angry as i should have this is one sort of foolishness that barbarians are prone to they tend to be lieve despite significant evidence to the contrary that women are as beautiful inside as they are outside i knew better still the way she had treated me seemed less ob jectionable than it might have ill just take it and be gone in a moment please stand clear she stepped out of my way her eyes round and staring and i brushed by her and rechecked the arrow it pointed back toward threnody okay you have it i said i guess you knew it all the time but didnt tell me hand it over youre dead she gasped not any more i heal fast i said gruffly now give it to me idont have anything she still acted as if she had seen a ghost maybe she thought the ghost was me look womanyou killed me so i dont think i owe crewel lye you anything give me that object or ill take it from you i tell you i dont have it she said losing some of her pallor i dont even know what it is i had had enough there are limits to what a barbarian will tolerate from even the prettiest of women and per haps some stone remained in my heart i grabbed her and proceeded to search her patting her body all over threnody did not resist i didnt find any object on her but the arrow still pointed to her maybe its some thing youre wearing i said take off your clothing ill do nothing of the kind she exclaimed recovering her indignity as she got accustomed to the idea of my being alive then ill do it for you i said and began unbuttoning her dress you barbarian she cried thats right i agreed pleased she saw i wasnt bluffing oh all right ill undress she said i did undress you before after all she undid the rest of her brown dress and stepped out of it she wore nothing underneath it she took off her slippers too and stood completely bare i picked up her clothing and set it in a pile on the bed then stood between her and it the arrow pointed directly at her i looked closely at her there was a lot to look at but there simply wasnt any object there maybe you ate it i said so its inside you dont be ridiculous she snapped i dont want you cutting me open to verify it isnt there i scratched my head i just cant figure it unless unless i am the object you seek she concluded that of course was it suddenly it made sense why fetch an object to win the throne then go after an un willing woman to marry how much simpler to fetch the woman herself and if she didnt want to comemight in fact even kill the one who tried to bring herwell get an ignorant barbarian to do the job for you i had had a low regard for magician yang now crewel lye abruptly magician yin didnt seem phenomenally good to me either well i was stuck for it since i had agreed to undertake this mission maybe this was what king gromden had been trying to warn me about he hadnt knownbe cause of the second cursethat threnodys return to castle roogna would cause it to fall he just wanted his daughter back and married to his successor so that his bloodline would remain in power but he had known she didnt want to return and would resist any effort to bring her there with all the forces at her command i could see her point even though i did not approve of her methods if i knew that my return to fen village would cause it to be destroyed i would resist that return as strongly as i could now i felt guilty about what i had to doyet i did have to do it it was not my place to decide on the larger rights and wrongs of the situation i just had to complete the job i had agreed to do what a pile of mud this assignment was turning out to be chapter demon striation threnody didn t bother going for her clothes she leaped for the door i intercepted her knowing she would be difficult to catch if she got away as she was bound to be more familiar with this region than i was she struck at my face with her small fist but i fended her off with my left arm ow she cried what are you made of oaf stone i said my feet and left arm anyway i ran into a spell crewel lye crewel lye she relaxed sounds like one of yangs spells you turned partway to stone more or less i said letting her go she bolted for the door again this time getting out but she ran smack into pook who had thought to back stop me she bounced off his hide and in a moment i caught her again i just have to take you back i said im sorry but i agreed to bring back the object and i will im no object she protested struggling in my arms but this time i was smart enough not to release her sure you are i said the object of my mission youll never take me alive listen youve already killed me i told her still distracted by her motions if i hadnt already known that barbarians were often clumsy with women id have sus pected it now you should know thats no good ill kill you again she said trying to bite at my shoul der unfortunately she picked the wrong one and bruised her teeth on the stone well id better get you dressed i said i knew it wasnt right for bare women to be out of the house the flies would bite them i hauled her into the house tossed her onto the bed and held her down while i wrestled the brown dress onto her it wasnt easy because she was punching and kicking at me all the time but finally i got the dress buttoned you oaf she snorted its backward i had of course put the buttons in the front where they belonged but the fit did look a little awkward does it matter i asked innocently get off me you buffoon and ill do it right i let her go and stepped back she stood unbuttoned the dressnow i saw that i hadnt aligned the buttons properly so that the buttons ran off the top while the holes ran off the bottomand took it off she turned it aboutand suddenly leaped for me the dress stretched between her hands she wrapped it about my throat and twisted it in back choking me but some of the stone remained in my neck too and the choke was not tight i struggled for a moment then let myself relax feigning unconsciousness she choked me a while longer making sure then let go what am i going to do with you she muttered rhetorically sup posing me to be beyond hearing youre basically a de cent guy but if i let you live i grabbed her about the legs and hauled her down again you forgot your dress i said and spanked her smartly on her bouncy bottom she made a sound as of water dousing an angry fire youre impossible im barbarian i corrected her now if you dont get into that dress ill wrap a sheet around you and take you that way this dress is ruined she protested its all twisted up because she had used it to choke me well untwist it ill get another she decided and youd better put something on too you look like a zombie i realized it was true clothes dont heal the way i do my shirt was a tatter and my trousers might as well not have bothered a few dangling leather strips were all that remained of my leather armor you can have this dress she said jamming it at me well it was better than nothing i would use it until we passed the trousertree in her garden i put it on couldnt button the top because my shoulders were too broad and the bottom hung halfway to my knees but it did provide some cover backward again she remarked i did not reply apparently a dress was backward no matter which way a man put it on threnody got a gray dress from her closet and donned it and her slippers she stood before a mirror and brushed out her hair she had lustrous black tresses matching her midnight eyes i had been partial to fair women but now i realized that the dusky ones could be every bit as ap pealing physically all right im ready she informed me crewel lye i took her left arm to lead her outsideand with her right hand she struck at me she had picked up a knife the blade dug into my stone arm harmlessly its edge chipping oh i give up she cried in disgust i forgot about that i i realized that i could not trust her for a moment i saw some clothesline vine hanging on a hook i took it down oh no you dont she cried making another break for the door but she wasnt very strong despite being strong for a woman and i held her and got her hands tied behind her i picked up several scratches and a bite in the process but i had expected that she was a hellkitten and the dirty truth was that was every bit as appealing to me as the milkandhoney type of woman then i took her out and set her on the ghost horse and tied her dainty feet to the chains pook seemed disgusted at having to carry her but he understood i couldnt trust her on her own two feet it was too bad i reflected that women werent more like horses horses were so much more reasonable my lute she exclaimed i need my lute your what my lute bumpkin my musical instrument so i can play and sing but i distrusted her motive she certainly didnt plan to play music at castle roogna since she believed it would fall when she got there she wasnt going to play for me since she was fighting me forget it i said her mouth closed in a hard line she was really angry about thismore so it seemed than about getting cap tured and tied women are funny creatures where is your trousertree i asked looking around forget it she snapped ah well i should have known i would simply have to use the dress we started off toward castle roogna i didnt want to go through the tarasques maze or over the flesh moun tain so i went east instead along the brink of the chasm i hoping to cut south beyond the range of mountains i had crewel lye encountered before progress was slow because i had to walk and keep a constant eye on threnody as well as on the landscape traveling in xanth is not much of a picnic anyway and was less so now my heavy stone feet thunked into the ground like ogres pads i had learned to walk but it remained clumsy threnody evidently getting bored with riding started talking how did you survive the poison and the fall she asked as if this were a routine matter of curiosity perhaps it was for her i saw no harm in explaining since i intended to give her no chance to kill me again she listened attentively so you can not die she concluded not to stay well it hasnt happened yet i said was she mel lowing i didnt trust it i had had experience with gentle straightforward loving women but never before with a treacherous vixen like this maybe she was just trying to figure out how to kill me permanently so despite my halfway desire to believe her i remained cautious demons cant die either she said thats because theyre not alive to begin with i said oh no theyre aliveits merely a different sort of life they have feelings and interests just as human folk do only the evil feelings i said they dont have love and conscience and integrity do barbarians she asked as if nettled certainly were primitives closer to nature than civ ilized folk are we care about nature and magic and friend ship do you have any friends pooks my friend a ghost horse she sneered pooks ears laid back again and he made a motion as if to buck her off but controlled himself he certainly didnt like this woman as i said i said we barbarians are close to nature pooks a fine animal and im proud to be his friend i noted as i spoke that now pooks ears were blushing what about love crewel lye crewel lye i love my father and mother she rolled her eyes imbecile i mean manwoman love have you ever truly loved a womanor do you merely use a woman and go your way i pondered elsie had been nice and i liked herbut if i had really loved her i would not have left her as for bluebell elfthere never had been more to that than the favor i had promised so the barbarian virtue of integrity forced me to yield the point grudgingly no i guess its just a passing thing so far in that you do not differ from a demon she said smugly establishing that point but i could love i said a demon cant true but whats the big difference between a person who cant love and one who doesnt love listen im no demon protested hotly what are you getting at you are taking me against my will to a castle that will be destroyed by my presence she said do you call that an act of conscience this was uncomfortable because i had already ex perienced a nudge of guilt about it i undertook to per form a mission i replied disgruntled my conscience says i must do what i agreed to do whatever it is even when you know its wrong now i understood what she was doing she was trying to talk me out of it but some of the intelligence from the eyequeue spell remained despite being filtered through dirt and stone and i was able to answer her how can you talk to me of right and wrong you treacherously killed me twice over well i told you i was sorry she snapped i didnt like it but i had to do it well i dont like doing this i retorted but i have to do it touche she murmured or something like that theres only one human language in xanth but this sounded like another she was silent for a bit then started in again you had a normal human barbarian upbring ing sure and then i went adventuring and this is your adventure right fighting monsters and spellsgood oldfash ioned sword and sorcery and kidnapping helpless maidens for a fate worse than death she certainly had a way with a barb but i could barb back thanks to that dirt in my mind bringing a mur deress in to be married she mulled that over for a while finally she said its true i tried to kill you and you have a right to be perturbed about that but i knew your mission could cause great harm to xanth so i had to stop it i still have to stop it any way i can if i cant kill you maybe i can reason with you something about that seemed backward to me but it did seem better to have her talking than to be coldly silent reason away i said barbarians arent very smart about things like logic if i employ methods you disapprove of its because i am not a barbarian she said in fact im not precisely human i glanced at her she was tied to the horse probably not in the most comfortable position but she was a beau tiful figure of a woman barbarians have an excellent eye for that sort of thing you look pretty good to me thank you she made a little curtsy i dont know how since she was astride the horse with her feet tied but she did women can be remarkably talented in insig nificant little ways but not all that looks good is good yeah like the nice little paths leading up to a tangle tree i agreed it happened that there was a tangle tree in the distance and we were avoiding its tooconvenient path analogies are easy to come by in xanth there is something i didnt tell you about my ances try youre not the kings daughter i am his daughterbut the queen was not my mother thats why the queen resented me so much and finally crewel lye cursed me she hated me for what i represented and for what i was not your mother i repeated blankly how is that possible you simpleton not all offspring derives from mar riage i am a bastard the word appalled me coming as it did from so lovely a creature of course i knew what it meant but it shocked me to think that she should know it let alone describe herself by means of it youthe king the king was seduced by an unscrupulous temptress who cared not a whit for him threnody said i was the result my mother conceived me purely as a challenge she had no interest in keeping me only in embarrassing her lover and that she didby turning me over to king gromden and proclaiming my origin butbut thats inhuman i exclaimed naturallyconsidering the nature of my mother no decent woman would but you see my mother was neither decent nor a woman but i skidded to a verbal halt confused youre obviously not a halfbreed like a centaur or harpy or werewolf youre human half human i dont understand my mother is a demoness a female demon still it did not explain everything king gromden wouldntnot with a demonesshes a good man threnody smiled grimly so it would be nice to be lieve but the fact is human beings are sometimes naive and often vulnerable i love my father and know hes a good man therefore i have spent some time rationalizing this matter of my birth it is necessary to understand that the queen my foster mother was not the most attractive of women and was no longer in her prime while the king was a virile man he had married her for practical reasons to help unify the diverging subcultures ofxanth she was from a village in the south that had felt neglected among crewel lye the socalled cursefiends who are actually human but live apart from others they are said to be great actors when he married one of their women it cemented their loyalty to castle roogna and strengthened the throne he really was trying to do what was best for xanth but she was barren and in any event not much interested in storks i know about storks i murmured then you know that they do not choose the couples to whom they deliver they must wait for the couples to summon them they merely fill those orders that have been properly entered it is a peculiarity of their nature yes and they always deliver to the woman no matter how hard the man works for the baby i dont think thats fair she laughed many things in life and magic arent fair barbarian so this meant that if the king wanted a baby he had to make arrangements through some woman other than the queen i think that was in his mind when the dusky demoness came to him maybe there were other things in his mind toomen can be quite superficial about such thingsbut i must believe that he really did want me of course he did i exclaimed and he wants you back home now that must be why he agreed to this and i dont think he knew the nature of my mother you see a demon can assume any form so she became the most beautiful woman anyone could imagine mid night of hair and eye perfect in every physical detail you favor her i said be quiet imbecile she said angrily my mother was a terrible creature she had absolutely no conscience demons are soulless they have no human values just human passions she wanted to make mischief for the human folk and she knew the most telling way to do that was to compromise and humiliate the human king so she assumed a ravishing form and came to him with a story about being outcast from her distant village and needing help and protection and when she got him alone oh you dont know what lying is until youve seen a crewel lye crewel lye demon do it shewell she got him to help summon the stork and the stork took the order for me and when my mother was assured of that she laughed and changed into the semblance of a mundane monster called a crocko dile so he would know what she was without any further illusion and then she became a puff of laughing gas and faded out the king was mortified when he realized he had been with a demoness but it was too late poor king gromden i agreed now i remembered that there had been a passing mention of scandal at castle roogna that reference was coming clear and when the stork delivered me she had the other part of her terrible funcausing everyone in castle roogna to know what the king had done she brought me openly to him in broad daylight when the king and all the people of the castle were at dinner and set me down before him saying here is your bastard baby adulterous king dare you deny it and the king being an honest man whatever other weaknesses he may have had did not deny it perhaps in part because he knew i would fare ill indeed if he refused to accept me in that sense i was the cause of his loss of respect in xanth then my demonmother vanished in another puff of smoke only her cruel laugh remaining she had deceived the king ruined his reputation and forever finished any de cent relation he might have had with the queen after that the people associated with the castle began drifting away each one finding some important business else where and of course the king could not say nay he had been rendered impotent by the crudest of lies when the queen cursed me there were fewer than a dozen people remaining there there are only a couple now i said only the ultimately loyal she said wryly people resemble demons in some respects but they react more slowly and make excuses for their dereliction while the demons act swiftly and without apology i wish i could be with my father now and provide the support he needs but i can not that curse prevents she shook her head as if clearing it of distress so now you see why i had to go i dont blame my foster mother the queen my presence was demoralizing the whole region simply be cause of my origin i was a constant reminder of the kings peccadillo the king never held this against me but the others didat the same time as they condemned him for that error they magnified it grotesquely threnody paused to choke back her rising emotion i dont think much of the average human being its better among the barbarians i said we would never it was getting difficult for the king to govern xanth effectively the queen had no love for the king but she did see the need for xanth to be unified she knew that could not be while i remained at castle roogna and she knew the king would never send me away himself so she arranged for me to take myself away her curse made it plain to me that i was destroying xanth i had been unable to see it until she made it literal if i was going to destroy xanth as the seat of effective government why not bring the castle down too and complete the job so she was right she did what had to be done and i dont hate her for it i had been a child i grew up in a few hours and i left castle roogna forever i felt the impact other storybut i remained suspicious you said she was jealous of you she was i dont say she wasnt petty in some ways thats part of what had alienated her from the king before my mother stepped in i was beautiful while she was not and the king loved me and not her that was grounds for resentment though i had not intended any evil she never made any attempt to relate to me and so i had neither mother nor foster mother she shares some of the blame no ones hands are entirely clean in this but she was right about me and about the need to make me leave then why did she curse the king to forget why you left threnody shrugged i exaggerated my father never understood why i left he was absolutely blind to any negative thing about me i was his favorite and only child and he wanted me to inherit the throne after him of crewel lye course that was impossible for several reasons and i al ways knew that but it shows how he felt no curse was needed to make him forget he simply refused and still refuses to believe that my presence is bad for castle roogna in any literal or figurative manner he thinks of me as his darling little girl some darling but i knew how fathers could dote on their daughters i would if i had the chance well arent you damn it im half demon she flared have you any idea what that means i shrugged that youre a crossbreed that you have some human and some demon traits xanth has a lot of crossbreeds i happen to know of an upcoming humany elven crossbreed you fool it means i have no soul there was the anger of despair in her tone i dont know much about souls i said but i thought they came with human ancestry since your father is hu man a human parent means a soul is possible not that it is guaranteed i suppose the chances were even for me but since the delivery was to the demoness not the human man i lost i didnt get one her voice was flat and cold how do you know i asked genuinely curious i had some concern for the son the stork would bring to blue bell would he have no soul do people with souls kill passing strangers she de manded i pondered taken aback by the point im human i said after a bit im ready to kill strangers if they attack me im a barbarian warrior i live by my sword it de pends on the circumstance in war this isnt war you came to me injured and i poi soned you and dumped you into the gap there was that but you said you were sorry big deal im also sorry you returned to capture me but demons have no conscience i pointed out theyre never sorry youre wrong ignoramus they can be sorrywhen crewel lye a plot turns out bad like my killing of you it didnt work so my effort was for nothing im sorry you ever set foot on this misguided mission but you said you were sorry before you knew i would recover i persisted i remember hearing that just be fore i died i say a lot of things she said irritably but she seemed slightly mollified i also inherit the demon capacity for lying the more cruelly the better you cant afford to believe anything i say i found this confusing but there had to be some truth in it if a person tells you hes a truthteller he may be lying but if he tells you hes a liar he has to be telling the truth ironically because a truthteller could never call himself a liar be could become a liar by that state ment a liar in contrast cant lie all the time because that makes it too obvious people start interpreting what he says the opposite way so he becomes a truthteller in reverse its confusing but magician yin had helped clar ify this matter for me so i had to believe that threnody could lie and that therefore she spoke the truth when she warned me to be wary of anything she said maybe so i agreed but you could still have a soul some human beings are liars like magician yang and youre more human than demon no im not i cant love now thats a lie right there what about your father you said you love him i lied she cried without conviction i dont believe you i think youre lying now you do love him therefore you can love and you do have a youre a fool to believe me then why do you care what happens to the king or to castle roogna why dont you just come along with me without protest and watch the castle crumble and laugh as it falls what does any soulless one care about the welfare of xanth she looked at me with a peculiar mixture of relief and frustration but did not answer my questions i was sat isfied she might be a liar but she was more human than crewel lye demon her humanity ironically was proved by the man ner in which she opposed me and what of my soul if i believed her i could not afford to deliver her to castle roogna so i had to believe that she had lied about the curses and just didnt want to marry yin i couldnt blame her for wanting to make her own life instead of getting tied down to a family i was that way myself but that was no reason for me to ab rogate my own mission i was of course a fool in several respects but i didnt know that then we moved on and gradually the terrain changed the trees and brush thinned out and the ground became sandy youll never get through here threnody said why not i know this region this is slowsand seems ordinary to me i said undaunted youll see barbarian she said confidently the patches of sand became larger until finally they linked and we had to walk through them rather than remain on rock and turf but as pook and i stepped on the sand we slowed our steps became measured then dragging we seemed unable to move at normal speed whats this i asked surprised i told you threnody said slowsand now i understood it slows us down to a crawl well starve before we get through here fortunately this was only a thin barrier with more hard land beyond after a tedious trek pook and i made it out of the sand and resumed normal velocity now we stayed off the sand however circuitous the route had to be but this became difficult and finally impossible the level region between the mountains and the chasm turned into a desert of slowsand we had to go around itbut there was no way through the chasm to the north so it had to be the slopes to the south we meandered that way our progress slowed almost as much by the deviousness of the necessary route as by the sand itself the last section before the slope had a strand of sand cutting us off pook hurdled itand slowed crewel lye in midair so that he seemed to be floating he wasnt he was merely in midjump but it took about fifteen seconds for him to make it to the opposite bank i jumped too with the same effect so we were both crawling through the air the slowsand affected creatures above it as well as on it wont do you much good threnody said smugly farther along theres quicksand quicksand obviously that would speed us up as much as the slowsand slowed us down ill risk it i said gruffly suit yourself idiot anything that happens to pook and me happens to you too i pointed out since id rather die than betray my father by return ing thats all right we got well clear of the sand by ascending the gentle slope of the foot of the mountain range but now dusk was looming we stopped under a spreading chestnut tree whose chests were loaded with nuts no problem about food here i unbound threnodys feet so she could dismount she reacted without gratitude how do you expect me to eat or whatever with my hands tied whatever i asked ill do it behind the tree oh embarrassed i untied her hands but you must give me your word you wont try to escape sure she said wryly chafing her wrists then she went behind the tree while i reached up to harvest a chest of nuts it turned out to be a fine selection qnuts and pnuts green pistachios blue red and hazel nuts soft yellow butter nuts sandy beach nuts even a small brown cocoa nut plus a few bolts for good measure and even some washers that was convenient i used a washer to wash my grubby hands after a time i realized that threnody hadnt returned from her errand behind the tree i hesitated to go and look since i never really did understand how women managed these things and preferred not to inquire so i crewel lye called phrasing it discreetly hey did everything come out all right there was no answer suddenly nervous i went and looked sure enough threnody was gone i had been a fool again well i would just have to track her down i could follow the traces through the brush and weeds of the slope and if she had gone down into the slowsand plain id be able to see her despite the en croaching darkness i found no traces perplexed i hesitated could she be so adept at hiding that she left no trail then my lin gering intelligence provided me a notion use my lingering compass sense i tuned it inand the arrow pointed up into the tree i smiled that was a neat ployhide and when i dashed off in a fruitless search for her she could come down and proceed without pursuit whatever her half demon parentage might have cost her it wasnt clever ness well two could play at that game i finished my meal of nuts then climbed the tree myself i settled on a com fortable lower branch and slept after an hour or so she climbed quietly down she tried to pass me but of course i woke and caught her leg going somewhere woman i inquired damn she swore trying to yank her leg free but i held on sliding my hand up for a better grip she was my prisoner again you told me you wouldnt try to escape i chided her i also told you i was a liar she reminded me its my demon heritage then ill just have to tie you again i said regretfully how do you expect me to sleep if you tie me she demanded i pondered very well i wont bind you hand and foot ill tie you to me so you cant go without me i brought her to the ground and used a cord to tie her right wrist to my left one i made the knots too tight to untie crewel lye readily barbarians are good at that sort of thing since she had no knife she wouldnt be able to free herself without alerting me how do you know i wont strangle you in your sleep she asked as we lay there in the dark beneath the tree i wouldnt stay dead and if you start wrestling with me at night i might forget that im saving you for marriage to yin i replied barbarian she spat and somehow it didnt sound like a compliment precisely i thought that would shut her up as ive said barbarians dont really force themselves on unwill ing women thats just hype put out by the barbarian publicity department image is very important to our kind even when the reality falls short i hadnt shut her up though if i have to she said warningly ill use my talent oh whats your talent i asked interested of course she had a talent everyone did but some talents were better than others some people were proud of their ability to make a dust mote bounce in the air maybe hers was better striation what it derives from my heritage lout demonstriation oh i didnt care to admit that this still didnt make much sense to me so i let it be only those who are not ignorant feel free to confess their ignorance well you do what you want only let me sleep i will she agreed i slept and there was no jerk on the line and no attempt to strangle but when i checked automatically after an hour or so i discovered that she was gone the cord remained undisturbed the loop that had been about her wrist now empty somehow she had slipped it i got up immediately activating my finderspell it showed her nearby apparently she had only freed herself in the past few minutes going somewhere kings daughter i inquired crewel lye oh she cried furious why couldnt you stay asleep longer i brought her back to the tree how did you slip the loop i asked its too small for your hand to pass through small and fine as your hand is i told you oaf striation demonstriation i agreed realizing she was not about to tell me her secret i hung onto her hand so she couldnt flee again regretting that the contact was for this antag onistic reason instead of for a positive one it was indeed a fine little hand she was nicely formed in every part since the cords no good ill just have to hold you di rectly ill kick scratch and bite she warned me ill heal it will hurt though and you wont get much sleep ill make you a deal i said you dont kick scratch and bite me and dont let the dirt in my mind tell me what to do with you youyou waw she exclaimed in a cute little fury i guess she realized that i wasnt bluffing and that i half way hoped she would abort the deal i wrapped my arms about her as she lay beside me and settled back for sleep my stony left arm was hardly aware of her but my right arm tingled from the contact with her soft body she struggled a little evidently considering the kickscratchbitedirt route then relaxed she laid her head down next to mine so that her black hair tickled my nose and she slept as dawn crept reluctantly in i woketo find my arms empty threnody was gone againand my arms had not been disturbed how in xanth had she managed that i tuned in on her with the arrow she was threading her way past the slowsand going home i went down and caught her again lassoing her from the edge of the sand so that i could move faster than she could but i was more curious than angry i was holding you in my arms that time how did you escape you can not hold me she said evidently not there was something very odd about crewel lye her but i put that from my mind for the moment well have some nuts and well get moving she had some nuts and we got moving this time i didnt tie her but i watched her and she did not try to escape we moved on around the mountain slopes then i spied a cloud looming from the east it sparkled iridescently i peered at it i dont trust that type ac tually barbarians dont trust anything they dont under stand its a necessary paranoia in the wilderness that was the main reason i didnt trust threnody its a technicolor hailstorm she said they develop in this region i think its because of interactions between the slowsand and the quicksand generating fierce con vections better get under cover coverfrom a hailstorm i asked derisively well ignore it suit yourself moron i didnt like either the storm or her attitude but there wasnt much to do but move on we did so and the storm loomed massively seeming almost solid in the sky spreading out until it blotted out much of the welkin i heard a low throbbing sad melody i looked and dis covered it was threnody singing what are you doing i demanded im singing the dirge of our demise she replied im good at that sort of thing thats how i got my name but i do better when i have my lute she was still angry about not being permitted to bring her musical instrument actually it would have hampered her attempts to escapewhich meant that i might have been better off to let her bring it but i had a more im mediate concern demise from a mere hailstorm i asked incredulously well maybe youll recover after it passes since you can return from death the rest of us wont i didnt like the sound of this and i saw pooks ears perking up with alarm he was a ghost horse but if the living aspect of him died he would be just a ghost and if threnody died my mission would be finished i was crewel lye sure it would not count if i delivered a dead body to castle roogna okay ill seek cover i cast about and saw a small stand of timber trees upslope we moved to them i used my sword to chop the timbers and used the timbers to construct a pointed edifice then bound it tightly at the top with cord and wedged its base into the ground below i think this type of construction is called a teewarn its useful in an emergency i wrapped bark about it tying it in place it was a crude structure but sturdy we crowded into it the three of us just as the first hailstones struck youre pretty good at this threnody remarked in differently its a barbarian skill i said foolishly flattered live and leam i didnt know barbarians were good at anything except kidnapping helpless damsels that too i agreed a hailstone struck the shelter with a crash like that of solid rock i jumped i peered outand another stone just missed my head thunking into the ground so hard it made a formidable dent it was green and pitted i reached out and grabbed it before it rolled away heythis is a real stone i cried what did you expect she asked colored ice well yes little light balls of ice maybe elsewhere here it hails real stones so it did another struck the shelter and rolled away i could see them falling all around red and blue and or ange and brown they were prettybut any one of them would have brained a person or animal maybe that was why we had encountered no large animals in this region only the small ones could hide from this sort of storm threnody had been right to urge shelter we could not travel while the storm raged so we waited huddled together threnody was astride pook and i be side my torso against her left leg she resumed her song of lamentation pooks ears were laid back he didnt like either her or the song but i thought both were rather pretty that leg certainly was i wished again that things were more positive between us crewel lye the storm raged for an hour i snoozed on my feet leaning against the leg when the storm finally abated i woke finding myself leaning against pooks side i looked about threnody was gone again heywhere is she i asked pook had been snoozing too he woke with a start he sniffed the air but was as baffled as i it was amazing how she could depart without alerting us i used the arrow again it was slowly fading as time passed but was enough to do the job it pointed west threnody was headed for home again we emerged from the shelter which was now sadly battered by the stones and hurried west around the slope soon we caught up to her she hadnt gotten very far she was moving very slowly though she wasnt in the slowsand i charged up and caught her by the armand my hand passed through it youre a ghost i exclaimed ap palled you went out too soon and got clonked by a hailstone and now youre dead no im just diffuse lout she said faintly i passed my hand through her body sure enough there was some resistance like that of thin water or thick fog she was more substantial than a ghost though not by much youre pretty fresh barbarian she informed me as my hand emerged from her chest i jerked my fingers back guiltily what happened to you its my talent she explained striation id have been long gone if i hadnt encountered a headwind its hard to fight a wind in this state i saw that it was so a gust of wind passed and almost blew her off her feet she hardly weighed anything at all you can just thin out i told you i have demon parentage demons can turn to smoke and change size and shape but if you can do that why did you ever let me tie you i cant do it fast she said bitterly it takes an hour crewel lye crewel lye just to change one aspectand you never gave me more than an hour to myself i almost felt guilty the loop of rope i exclaimed you diffused out of it of course she was slowly becoming more solid and i diffused enough so that the hailstones couldnt hurt me but the storm stopped too soon so you werent confined and this stupid headwind had started to wonder how i could hold her when she was smokydiffuse but now i realized that all it would take was a fan to blow her anywhere i wanted her to go her escape had been slow because of the air resistance which was much more formidable for her than for those of us in the solid state you say this is just one aspect you can change other ways too oh you might as well know it all she said with angry resignation you seem to have the blundering luck of ignorance demons can change form instantly thats why my mother was able to fool king gromden who would never have touched her if he had known her natural appearance was horrendous but she emulated the human form so well that nobody could tell the difference but im only half demon so i cant operate as well i can only do one aspect at a time if i want to be big or small i have to take an hour for that but then im either diffuse or concentrateda smoky giant or a supersolid midget until i change my density to match that takes another hour because my mass hasnt changed only my size and if i want to be in the likeness of a normal mouse it takes a third hour to get the shape right if only youd let me be for three hours was amazed this creature was more of a handful than i had known she might have changed into a dragon and devoured mehad i given her time i cant see why yin would want to marry you i said of course he doesnt want to marry me she cried hes only doing it to provide continuity of a sort so the human beings of xanth will accept him readily as king and not hold it against him that hes filling gromdens shoes its the same for yang they have only politics in mind i dont want to marry either of them but if your arrival was such a scandal the people wouldnt want you to marry the new king i objected the common folk dont know my origin it was strictly a palace scandal no one tells the common folk anything i sighed im sorry about having to bring you in threnody i really am but a barbarian always keeps his word maybe you can escape after i turn you in escape from a magician she demanded bitterly i was able to avoid them in the forest i threatened to throw myself into the gap chasm if either one of them came near thats why i set up a chute right in my house but i cant do that at castle roogna i saw her vaporous tears as she spoke id rather die than marry one of thembut i wont have any choice thanks to you you unfeeling wretch i nodded glumly i was a wretch but i was not un feeling i felt awful we returned to the shelter and within an hour thren ody was solid again there was not enough time left in the day to warrant more travel so we remained where we were the nearby trees had been badly battered by the hailstones but we were able to forage for fruits that had been knocked to the ground now how was i to keep threnody captive during the night her demonstriation talent meant i could not hold her physically not physicallybut how about emotionally a small ruse might simplify things considerably it was certainly worth a try i went out at dusk circling our camp as if looking for something i put my hand on my sword i wish i had my bow i muttered nervously whats the matter threnody called you plan to put an arrow through me next time i escape oh i wouldnt want to worry you i said shading my eyes with my stone hand and peering into the gloom they probably wont attack in the night anyway what wont attack she demanded crewel lye the traces arent really fresh i said couple days old at least so theyre probably gone do you smell anything fresher pook pook sniffed the air then shook his head no he was smart enough to play along what are gone threnody asked annoyed by the mystery i knew the feeling the harpies of course i said there are no harpies in these parts thats what i said they seem to be confined to the cliffsides this flock was probably just passing through and wont be back she was silent we settled down for the night you take the shelter i said ill sleep outside arent you going to hold me it doesnt do any good i pointed out you can slip any tie any grasp i guess you could have done it anytime when you were riding but you didnt want me to see true barbarian my talents more effective when its secret she considered still you can hold me if you want to it might give you earlier warning no i think id better remain outside i said glancing nervously about as if aware of a harpy then i put my right hand on the hilt of my sword and lay down suppose the harpies come and youre asleep she asked there are no harpies in these parts i reminded her but i unsheathed my sword she grimaced then lay down in the shelter pook grazed on the slope i slept barbarians can nod off instantly and wake instantly in the manner of other animals there was a rustle in the night as of some winged nocturnal predator i woke just long enough to identify it as a genuine bird harmless to us and slept again but in a moment i felt a body beside me youd better hold onto me threnody murmured i might try something foolish uhhuh it seemed my ploy was working nobody sleeps well when harpies are about suit yourself demon spawn crewel lye she nudged closer warm and soft im truly sorry i killed you jordan now she was calling me by my name youre also a liar she struck at me damn you a point for me but her body was delectable touching mine and i wished for the umpteenth time that things were otherwise this is a lie too she said after a moment her head came over mine and she kissed me on the mouth firmly and lingeringly the irony was i knew it was a lie threnody cared nothing for me alive she just wanted to lull me into com placency so she could escape im pretty naive about women but there are limits to naivete and i do learn quickly enough from experience yet a part of me wanted to believe that a lovely creature like this a kings daugh ter demon or not could really care for me i guess i know how it was with king gromden i muttered when she released my lips she stiffened then laughed ruefully i swore id never do to a man what my mother did to my father i guess i lied about that too then she put her face down against my shoulder and it became wet there could a soulless creature cry i wondered probably could i decided but never would except to deceive still you okay i asked oh i am a cursed creature she sobbed literally true i knew myself for a fool but i couldnt help it sometimes a man just has to be a fool if hes a man i put my arms about her and held her close to me not to prevent her from escaping but because it was nec essary to do she cried for a while and then she slept and after a while i did too one other thing bothered me though i woke thinking of it and finally i murmured to the night sky there really arent any harpies here crewel lye i know it threnody murmured back i had thought she was asleep but in the morning she was still there this night she had not tried to escape chapter sword and stone we followed the slope as it curved around to the south and when we had left the slowsand region be hind we returned to the level land normal animal life returned i had to dispatch a griffin and a river monster that menaced us but that was routine in another day we should be at castle roogna you know i dont want to go there threnody re minded me her eyes very big and dark i know you know castle roogna will fall i dont know you could be lying i could get very friendly if you cared to delay the journey a while it wouldnt seem like a lie to you at all i know i could even get to like you for real if dont know youll say anything to get your way let me show you how friendly i can be when i try id be a fool of course i was a fool for i was sorely tempted she might be a completely selfish lying demon creature but she was beautiful and barbarians appreciate physical beauty more than they do mental beauty so i fended off her advances not because i feared her body but because i feared what her body could do to my mind but my resolve was weakening i can still change form and escape you she said but without my arm and sword to protect you you would be vulnerable to the monsters ofxanth i pointed out thats why you are no longer trying to flee there may be no harpies here but there are other creatures what little remained of the smartspell had enabled me to work it out when you change form you may look like some other creature but you arent you can assume the form of a bird but you cant flynot unless you become so diffuse as to be as light as the air and then the wind will blow you away it takes a lifetime to learn to fly properly she shrugged not denying it actually i can do some of the things the animals i emulate do but it is true that flying is a very specialized discipline and certainly i would not be good at it id probably blunder into the nearest tree and be easy prey for any winged predator and you probably havent practiced it much because of the danger you need skill as well as form so your talent is limited at the moment when you threatened me with the harpies i realized that was true there is always something in xanth to prey on the unwary or unprotected youre a primitive man you have muscle and a sword and you like to fight you can handle strange territory and slay monsters inciden tally but once you got me more than a days journey from my home she spread her hands i may have a heart of stone but the monsters dont care about that theyll eat my flesh in a momentand i cant recover the way you can so im the sword and youre the stone i said con scious of the irony since part of me really was stone now yes if had your body i could go right home you can assume my likeness i said i suppose i could she agreed tilting her head in temporary reflection but i wouldnt have your skill with the swordy or the power of your masculine muscles or your ability to heal so fast when wounded so thats no good if i had your body id be a lovely creature i said im not beautiful in my soulif i have one at all i had no answer to that threnody was the first pretty crewel lye woman i had known who was demonstrably ugly in her origin and natureliterally demonstrablyand i still had difficulty reconciling that combination i kept wanting to believe she was as lovely inside as out and that her evident intelligence translated to good personality some times i almost succeeded certainly she was not all evil even though she was far from all good this just isnt the kind of problem a barbarian is fit to cope with life is simpler when the alternatives are flat good or flat evil clearly labeled and correctly labeled at noon we came to a pleasant grove of ancestrees each had a solid base that soon split into two major branches and these split into four and thence to eight until at the fringe there were so many little branches that the eye lost track the bark was corrugated and thus resembled printed words sometimes i wished i could read so that i could contemplate my own family tree i can read threnody said its a skill required of royal children but dont care to be reminded of my demon branches we went on and came to a pattern of artistrees ep a manysplendored thing with ornate multicolored leaves and sculptured lines we paused awed by the sheer mag nificence of this display one tree was deadbut its skeletal form was impres sive each branch perfectly contoured the whole a marvel of symmetry there was a hole in the base of its trunk and even this was beautifully arched so that it resembled a doorway to some sublime realm we walked toward itand suddenly at my feet a small black sword flashed quickly it expanded to fullsword size a thing of glistening dark iron suspending itself menacingly before me i had heedlessly blundered into another of yangs evil spells when would i learn to watch out more carefully for them my own sword was in my hand for barbarian reflexes are necessarily swift get clear of me i cried to pook and threnody this things dangerous indeed it was the black sword slashed viciously at me and it was all i could do to parry the blade in time crewel lye as it was the power of its blow drove me back and shook my arm nothing was wielding that sword but it felt as if there were an invisible giant behind it i had fended off its cut but the black weapon recovered with horrible quickness and struck at me from the other side i parried again and again felt the shock of the col lision sparks flew from the place where the two blades met and mine was nicked of course it was already bat tered and slightly bent from its fall into thewell i didnt remember quite where but it had fallen somewhere yet a blade that could so casually nick this one the evil sword whirled about in the air danced over my head and slashed at me from behind i threw myself aside avoiding it but the moment it missed it reoriented and came at me again i fell to the ground barely getting my blade around to biock the thing never before had i been subjected to as savage an attack by a sword as this i prided myself on my expertise with the sword it was one of those things barbarians specialized in my sword was the only reason i had no real fear of tangle trees or griffinsalbeit a healthy respect for them i could strike with it before such monsters could get me dragons were more difficult because of their steam or fire and their scale armor but of course dragons were the top of the predatory chain so my sword was my strength how ever this was no beak or tentacle i faced it was another sword it struck and struck again and a third time in as many seconds then realizing it could not get me with a frontal or rear attack it spun to the side and lunged i scrambled halfway to my feet but had to dive clear again rolling on the ground the black sword sliced at my feet missing no opportunity jerked them clear and it struck the ground so hard where they had been it seemed the very land would cleave asunder i fought my way back to my feet in time to parry the next strike i normally have plenty of muscle speed and coordi nation i had died three to five times recently but the past three days had enabled me to recover almost com pletely except for my stone extremities sayi should have let the sword strike my feet how could it hurt them crewel lye so i fought very wellbut already i knew i was over matched this magic sword had a ferocity beyond any thing i had encountered before and showed no sign of tiring one thing i had to say for magician yang his spells were not anemic ones i had to get away from this thing i tried but it pursued me relentlessly it wanted my blood all my blood and nothing but my blood it whistled at my left side before i could get my own blade around i lifted my left arm and it took the cut there was a clang and the black sword bounced back shaken of coursemy left arm too remained stone for the first time i had occasion to bless the failure of my talent to tackle this detail it was evident that the evil blade could not slice stone one hears stories about swords that can do this but i think this is merely more hype stone is awfully tough stuff this was pure barbarian luck the lingering trace of the last evil spell was helping me fight this one the black sword shook itself as if confused then charged back to the fray it swept at my neck with a ferocity that threatened not only to sever my head from my body but send it flying to the moon that would have been awkward for me it is no easy thing to grow a whole new head i blocked the swipe barely then the sword dropped down again to my feet and this time i didnt move them so it clanged again against the stone my luck was holdingbut i really needed the magic shield because the black sword was not letting up and was getting more imaginative about spots to attack i was tiring from this frenetic activity and that sword wasnt sooner or later it would find or force an opening and get me in a vital spot the spell i cried to threnody get the spell what spell she asked oopsshe didnt know about that complication and might not care to help me if she did after all if i died she was free to go home and she could be long on the way before i recovered on the other hand she could not safely travel alone so she might have to help me what crewel lye choice did i have i ducked as the black sword whistled over my head any spell pook has them threnody hesitated i knew she was considering whether it was better to help me or let the black sword take me out but pook snorted warningly at her and she decided to help she went to him and opened the bag of spells he carried meanwhile the enemy blade pressed me harder than ever it wove a perplexing pattern in the air and dazzled my eyes so that it was increasingly more difficult to parry its sudden lunges it looped around me forcing me to turn constantly to protect my flank and rear i was getting dizzyand that too could be disastrous i had to have some kind of cover for my back or i would shortly be wiped out i spied the dead artistree with its architecturally shaped hole in the trunk that would do i fended off the sword and retreated toward the tree soon i managed to wedge my back against it and nudge into the hole the space was just my height so was very convenient the black sword could no longer attack me from behind the thing was furious it chopped at the trunk of the tree but the deadwood was hard as well as beautiful and only small chips flew this protection would last me for a good long time i was careful not to back all the way into the hole for that would restrict my motions and work to my disadvantage used the tree just enough to max imize my efficiency now i was holding my own resting as the enemy sword wasted its energy on the wood all this had taken very little time the seconds seeming like minutes while threnody was fetching the spell its hard to describe two separate actions at once so im doing it one at a time but they were happening together now threnody drew out one of the white objects magi cian yin had given me is this the right one she called its a bit of vine with an eyeball tied in gruesome thing the eyequeue spellwhich had already been ex pended so i was sure this one stood for some other spellmaybe the magic shield i needed it will do i called back throw it here and another spark flew as crewel lye blade met blade it was a good thing my own sword was a sturdy one albeit battered now it had many nicks to go with its dents she came toward me then threw the spell in the under handed female way her aim was good however the spell struck the tree and dropped directly before me the black sword sensing danger sliced at the spell invoke i cried i saw it glow just before the black sword struck it then the strangest thing happened my consciousness seemed to leave my body and fly ghostlike through the air had i been abruptly slain by an unseen strike of the evil blade was my soul now flying to wherever it was fated to go but this had never hap pened before when i died then my awareness approached threnody as she stood between me and pook prettily concerned suddenly it dived into her body and settled there i heard a hoarse scream i saw myself drop my sword and hunch back into the dead tree immediately the enemy sword lunged running its blade through my unprotected heart my blood spouted from my chest as i fell forward dead but the black sword was not finished it lifted itself high then struck down on my exposed neck cutting off my head the head rolled a few paces away and came to rest in a hollow staring up with a slightly bemused expres sion still the evil sword did not desist it hacked at my right arm cutting it off then started on my left up at the shoulder where it remained flesh the thing meant to dis member me entirely i ran toward it unable to watch this destruction of my body without acting then i paused how could i run toward it when i was already dead and decapitated i realized that though my body was dead my con sciousness was not it was now in threnodys body and her consciousnessmust be in mine presently uncon scious for i had activated the spell of exchange well crewel lye of exchangeback the one intended to counter yangs exchange spell since we hadnt been exchanged we couldnt be unexchanged the unexchange constituted an exchange in itself i had brought upon myself the very mischief i had hoped to avoid when we exchanged identities threnody had found herself in my male body fighting the deadly swordand she hadnt known how to defend herself as with the notion of assuming the form of a bird and trying to fly without practice she was unable to fight like a man simply because she had a mans body womanlike she had screamed and cowered thus she had been instantly vul nerable and the enemy weapon had seized its advantage and gotten her it didnt realize it had killed the wrong person how could it know theoretically i had a minute to reverse the spell before it took full hold but how only by finding the black exchange spell could i do thatand then i would merely exchange myself into a dead and dismembered body also that minute had already passed as if time meant anything now what a picklement this was when would that terrible enemy sword stop it seemed determined to mince my entire body i might have the use of another body now but i still couldnt stand idly by and let it happen since my talent had been strained by overuse recently i wasnt sure how much more it could take or had my healing talent flown with my consciousness to threnodys body if that were so then my bodyand threnodys consciousnesswas dead and i was stuck forever in her body would yin be after me to marry him thinking of it that way i felt greater sympathy for threnodys resistance to the idea of being taken to castle roogna for marriage no i had to assume that our talents remained with our bodies so that it was possible for my body to revive and take me back i had to stop that sword from doing more damage well maybe i could bluff it i resumed my run to it leaned down and grabbed the hilt the sword paused in crewel lye surprise well done excellent sword i cried in thren odys voice you have acted courageously and saved me from a fate worse than death now you can rest the sword hesitated then decided to accept this i smiled winningly at it knowing the power of a lovely female expression over masculine things threnody her self had used it on me and i had been hard put to it to resist but i wasnt sure how long i could fool this dread instrument if and when it caught on to my real identity it would attack this body and dismember it too and then i would be truly finished i had to put the evil weapon out of commission before it did catch on but how by using threnodys talent of course when she went diffuse so did her clothing otherwise she would have been naked when i caught her and i was sure i would have remembered a thing like that she had been clothed in her gray dress which i now wore which meant that things closely associated with her shared the effect so i could go diffuse and do the same to the sword i held and and when i let it go it might return to its original state and come after me with a deadly gleam on its surface better not to risk that going far away from it was not the answer either it could fly and the other spells had shown dismaying longevity it would catch me in time well what else could i do with it whatever it was i didnt want to wait longbecause until i nullified the sword i couldnt do anything for my dead body it both ered me seeing that severed head staring up suppose a predatory animal came to gobble it down hamy elevated intelligence remained in fact it seemed a little enhanced because there was no dirt in threnodys brain to mess it up or was i using her brain i surely wasnt using my own whatever my thought was this diffuse the sword then put it into something that would hold it in place when it solidified of course first i had to see if threnodys talent would work for me i had never had a talent like hers before and i wasnt sure how to invoke it should i just will myself crewel lye thin or smoky or what was there some key phrase to utter well my own talent of healing didnt need any special attention it merely operated at need maybe this did too so i would concentrate on being smoky and see what happened lets take a nice little walk i said to the black sword still holding it in my delicate hand it was surely too heavy for this slender arm to support for long but it was self sustaining and felt quite light maybe that was another masculine trait i had to admit it was a handsome weapon and there were no nicks in its blade it was therefore superior to mine but it was not mine and i couldnt trust it especially not when my own body revived i wondered where this instrument had come from orig inally surely magician yang had not forged it himself he must have obtained the sword then enchanted it the same would be true of his other spells and those of yin it was remarkable that the twin brothers had such similar talents i had heard of twins before who had quite dissim ilar talents i turnedand there was pook his ears were flat back his teeth bared his nostrils dilated and his eyes were rimmed by white his whole body was tense and his chains rattled warningly this was one hypernervous horse i realized what was wrong he thought i was threnody and that i had now armed myself with the terrible evil sword pook i cried let me explain but then i realized that the sword was listening too if i told pook who i was and convinced him the sword would also know and that would be disaster threnodys slender arms did not have the strength to hold this thing if it got violent maybe my own arms would not have been strong enough it was one wicked weapon how could i let pook know without giving myself away to the dread sword fortunately the residual eyequeue spell enabled me to think of a way or maybe it was threnodys brain which was a good one stand aside animal i said to him this fine sword will strike down any creature who seeks to convey me to crewel lye castle roogna it is quiescent now only because i am free you saw what it did to that ilk i glanced back at my horrendously hacked body pooks ears went even flatter back in a moment he would attack me overcome by grief and rage he was an animal but he was loyal and i was indeed proud to have him as my friend whom do you suppose you are facing animal i demanded looking him directly in a dilated eye i held the black sword in my right hand near my body slowly i winked my left eye which was out of sight of the sword the ghost horse blinked startled but his menace did not abate he knew what a liar threnody was remember the nature of the spells you carry i said i had described them to him in the course of our journey to threnodys house since they might affect his welfare as well as mine remember which have been invoked and which have not that was as close as i dared hint for the sword might know about the other spells too and i didnt know how smart it was i dared not tell it too much still pook did not react the hint had not been enough i had mentioned the various types of spells to him but maybe he had forgotten the exchange spell indeed who would have believed how it had acted on this occasion remember your past experiences i continued how you were herded into the firewall by this dead ilk behind me who only wanted a free ride how he cruelly rode you into the territory of the goblins and the lair of the callicantzari again i winked and again pook blinked threnody had not been with us then and i had not told her pook had been with us and would have known if i had gone into that with her but now he was mystified not certain and the elves i said remember how he dallied three days with bluebell deserting you what do you owe him and think of the stork the dragons and the baby ogre that barbarian made you wander allover xanth and for what i fixed his eye again what was there ever between you and this man whatever it was let it remain crewel lye unchanged i paused knowing he knew the answer friendship a third time i winked covertly whom do you sup pose you are facing friend slowly pooks ears relaxed and the white circles around his eyes disappeared now at last he had caught on he would go along with what i planned as he had done be fore i have an errand elsewhere i said briskly i glanced back at my body you know what to do with this corpse to whom you owe nothing now stand aside pook moved aside i walked on by him the sword extended before me i passed on through the grove of artistrees admiring each barbarians dont have much culture but maybe threnodys royal tastes were rubbing off on me for each tree seemed to be a marvel of indi vidual expression and form no two were alike in color or structure or size but each was a masterpiece of its type xanth could use more artistrees while i walked i concentrated on becoming less dense it didnt seem to be working but since it was my only hope i had to keep trying a shift of form or size or density took an hour she had said so i would try for an houror whatever it took and as i walked concentrated and hoped i was aware of the nature of this body it differed from mine the proportions were funny the legs seemed sort of short and fat in the thigh the arms were short and so low on muscle as to seem like pipestems the center of weight was lower and the balance was strange seeming bottomheavy with my free left hand i felt about verifying that there was an unseemly volume of posterior and the chestit seemed unnatural having all that flesh on my chest it bounced when i walked too fast in fact i had extra flesh distrib uted all over i felt ungainly there were other problems my black hair flopped about my shoulders and tended to fall forward to obscure my vision if i didnt keep my chin up there was something about the way i walked my hipbones were set too far out or something so that my whole pelvis gyrated awk crewel lye wardly when i took fullsized steps the only way i could control it was to confine myself to mincing little steps that slowed forward progress ah well doubtless it was worthwhile to have the op portunity to appreciate firsthand the liabilities of the fe male form no wonder women tended to be jealous of men in the course of half an hour to my immense relief i verified that threnodys talent was working i was defi nitely lighter and the resistance of the air seemed greater now i needed to find a suitable place to stash the sword in a tree no it might cut its way free in a deep hole no someone might dig it out too soon it had to be per manently bound then i spied a sitting boulder at the edge of the artis tree community the rock was about half as tall as a man and massive it seemed to be solid marble continued to walk until the transformation was com plete and the sword and i were as diffuse as fog or more so i kicked at a tree trunk and my small foot passed through it with hardly perceptible resistance i was ready i marched up to the rock lifted the sword in both hands shifted my grip so that it pointed straight down and plunged it into the boulder it sank in to the hilt i removed my hands stood back and contemplated it with satisfaction stay there dread blade i said i shouldnt have said that the sword heard me and evidently realized that something was amiss it began to lift itself out of the boulder quickly i grabbed the hilt and shoved the sword back relax relax cried you have done so well honored blade now you must rest you cant be a gay blade all the time i batted my lovely eyelids at it the sword relaxed but i didnt dare risk letting it go again for if it pulled out of the boulder and flew away i would never catch it so i held on soothing it with my gentle feminine touchthat too i had learned about when threnody kissed me and held me the night before despite the lie that touch impliedkeeping it in place while we slowly solidified crewel lye but it had some suspicion and started to wiggle i was afraid of its brute force so i pacified it by singing to it my voice was lovely and sad i didnt know the proper tune or words so i just sang lalala with enormous feel ing and as long as i did that the weapon was quiescent no wonder women practiced subversive wiles on men what else was effective i stood and sang for the full hour it took to restore body and sword to full solidity then at last i let go of the weaponand it was embedded firmly in the boulder good enough that blade would bother me no more i left the sword in the stone behind retreating cau tiously watching to be quite certain that dread weapon did not abruptly free itself and resume its mischief it remained in place i wondered whether someday in some other land that blade on the boulder would turn up in some significant spot and someone would leam how to no ridiculous what use was a sword in a stone no one in xanth would fool around with anything like that i started back toward the site of my bodys de mise and a shadow descended oopsthat looked very much like ain fact it was a reached for my sword and of course my delicate hand slapped only soft flesh the sword i had carried was in the stone my own blade was with my body i was unarmed the creature glided to a landing before me it was a fairsized griffin a female for her color was shoepolish brown in virtually every species of living creature it is the male who is the creature of splendors with the bright est colors the biggest muscles the best proportions there is one exceptionthe human species there the female seems to have most of the splendors i have never been certain what went wrong maybe some longago curse was put on man and on manrelated creatures also the females of other species are good hunters and fighters while those of ours are not in this moredecorativethan functional body i was suddenly aware of my extreme vulnerability this griffiness was well equipped with beak and claws while i crewel lye it was too late to hide the griffiness had landed because she had spied easy prey i could not fight i had neither sword nor muscle to wield it i could not change form that took too long more than ever now i appreciated the position of human women no wonder threnody had not wanted to travel home alone she would have been dead in hours predators that never showed their mugs to me knowing that armed barbarian warriors were not to be trifled with would freely stalk an unarmed woman what was i to do well threnody had tried to use guile on me and i had used it on the black sword now that i was in her position it seemed like a natural course i would have to trick this predator somehow what were griffins concerned about aha they were notoriously clean creatures the op posite of harpies griffins spent hours preening their feathers and stroking their fur and cleaning their claws they never fed on carrion but always killed fresh they were like the rocs in that respect no griffin or roc ever died from food poisoning they were good enough hunters so that they could afford to be choosy i huffed myself up and issued a feeling groan the advancing griffiness paused cocking her birdhead she had been approaching me slowly knowing i could not escape griffins were more efficient than dragons and never scrambled when they did not have to when a dragon made a kill it was apt to be messy with blood and gobbets of flesh strewn across the landscape when a griffin did it there was hardly even a scream she was hesitating not from any nervousness but to make quite sure there was nothing here that might soil her feathers oooh its so horrible i lamented if only id known those berries were contaminated griffins dont have visible ears nevertheless her head perked up contamination now ive got the greenspotted gut rot in my giz zard and im filling up with purple pus please slay me before i rupture i staggered directly toward her the griffiness backed offbut not too far she had a keen eye for flesh and mine did not look spoiled in fact crewel lye i was about as delectable a sample of female anatomy as could be found in xanth surely tasty in every portion had i had more time to prepare i could have smeared green juiceberries on my tender skin staining it impres sively that was the problem with extemporaneous ef forts the verisimilitude suffers but i improvised discovering the genius of despera tion would you believe i pleaded distraughtly that i am actually a man my innards have been so mixed up that theres no telling what will squeeze out next look at this i used my hands to cup my wellendowed bosom my chest muscles are practically drooping off the griffiness backed off another step her beak curv ing uncertainly i pursued her oh pleasecut me open and let out the gook before it geysers out on its own i made as if to squeeze a breast the griffiness spun spread her wings and took off she didnt want any gook on her maybe she wasnt en tirely convinced but she preferred not to take the chance i relaxed that had been a close call surely no genuine woman would have used that particular ruseand per haps the griffiness had known that i wondered how threnody had managed to survive alone in her cabin so long a threat to jump into thethesomewhere to her death would not stop an animal predator but i knew the answerby guile and poison she had dealt with me as she had handled any other threat and i could no longer blame her i would do the same in her place wearing her body she had told me she was a liarand she was but of course a weak creature with tasty flesh could not afford the fighting integrity of an armed barbarian warrior understanding this could i fail to understand also her desire to avoid castle roogna and marriage to a magician whose only real interest in her was to shore up his standing as king if i were in her placeand it seemed i was for the time beingid rather go with a man whose interest was in myin her body at least that was honest but i had more immediate concerns i hurried back to crewel lye crewel lye my own body over two hours had passed anything could have happened fortunately it hadnt pook had gathered the remains together in another leaf bag and this time had managed not to include too much dirt if any monsters had threat ened the ghost horse had stood them off i got rid of the sword i said but now we have a problem friend im in the wrong body pook nodded having figured that out for himself i really cant do much in this body i said its weak and misshapen for barbaric purposes and i shrugged i just prefer my own the ghost horse nodded again he never had thought much of threnodys body of course it could have been worse i said if you had been standing closer to me than she was i would have switched identities with you pook snorted revolted by the notion i laughed though i cant say i was totally thrilled by his reaction i checked my own body it was beginning to heal pook had rolled the head against the neck and the arms against the shoulders these had reattached and most of the spilled blood had soaked back in my eyes were no longer staring the lids had closed in halfway normal sleep my body would be all right in a few more hours decapitations werent so bad when the head was not lost if i had had to grow a new one im not sure how my memories would have fared as they are packed mainly in the head look ing at my body this way seeing it undergoing the process of healing i really appreciated my talent never before had i stood there and watched it from another body but the afternoon was passing and we needed a secure place for the night there are griffins in this region and probably worse when its dark i said if i had my body i could handle it but in this poor thing im in trouble i glanced down at my present form oh it was an excellentlooking form but at the moment i didnt want to look at it i wanted to use it pook nodded again evidently he had sniffed monsters in the area of course you can survive better alone i said were a burden to you especially in this condition so maybe you should go your own way now pook stamped a forefoot in negation he would not desert me in this hour of desperation i was so grateful i almost cried being caught unaware by the reactions of this body i stopped myself just in time and gave him a maidenly hug of gratitude instead he tolerated this sto ically well ive got to protect myself until i can change back i said maybe i can climb a tree and but i looked at my unconscious body and at my present thin arms and i knew i could never get us both into a tree my barbarian body was simply too massive for my fem inine body to lift that was a confounded inconvenience why did barbarians have to be so big maybe i could take this sword and but again i knew it was useless these slender arms could never wield that great blade effectively i uttered an unladylike syllable of frustration my pres ent mouth almost choked on such a gross word threnody might have been quite ready to kill a man in defense of her interests but she was not a foul talker so i grabbed a hank of my black hair and yanked on it venting my displeasure all my avenues seemed blocked then i spied the hole in the dead artistree i can drag my body into that i said and squeeze in myself and you can stand guard outside that should get us through the night in the morning my body should be mobile and you can carry it to some safer place pook nodded agreement i gripped my body by the shoulders and hauled it was a real effort but i managed to heave it a little i reminded myself that threnody had managed to drag me to the brink of the couldnt re member where but surely she had dragged me so i should be able to do it too in her body i braced again hauled again and moved it some more soon i was panting my bosom heaving prettily but i got my body to the tree when i peered into the arched hole i saw something i hadnt noticed before there was a stairway in there crewel lye the steps led down into darkness beneath the ground this wasnt a hole in a tree it was an entrance to to what i gazed pondering steps usually meant peo ple or some roughly similar species they were small steps but there was clearance for human height was it wise to go down there pook looked around nervously sniffing the air and rotating his ears to catch some sound that was beyond my perception whatever designed human beings really messed up on the ears not only were ours less efficient than those of most animals they werent nearly as pretty pooks ears for example were superior to mine in just about any respect youd care to consider something dangerous i asked and he nodded af firmatively something we cant stand off again the nod like a dragon yes then we have no choice i concluded you range free maybe leading it awaythats your specialtyand ill haul the two of us down the stairs it was obvious that pook wouldnt fit in the nether passage i took another hold on my body then paused uh pook in case this doesnt work out but i couldnt finish the sentence so i just gave him another maidenly hug about the neck and a sweetlipped kiss on the ear and dropped only one or two tears on his hide then i hauled my lunky unconscious body on into the hole and down the stairs headfirst going down was easier because gravity helped grav ity can be very useful magic sometimes i paused to look back and saw pooks silhouette above then we rounded the curve and the parting was complete chapter gnobody gnomes s felt halfway naked without pook and it was much worse to feel naked in this body than in my own i reminded myself firmly that pook really was better off free in the forest where he could outrun any threat with luck we would find the subterranean region empty and be able to rest and recover in private safety of course there might be a problem about food but we could emerge to forage in the morning without luckwell what choice did we have that evil spellsword had really cut down our options i had managed to use the wrong white spell to salvage something at least i reached the foot of the stairway now we were in a rough passage that wound among the descending roots of the artistrees the roots were aesthetically shaped and arranged just as were the branches above and it was in consequence a rather scenic passage nicely contoured though it was formed of packed dirt where should we go from here if anything used this stair these days i wanted to be clear of it i had not noticed any cobwebs as i descended with my body and that suggested that the stairs had been recently used maybe there was a room along the passage where my body could be hidden i left that body for a moment and explored yes there were occasional chambers opening from the passage they were just rounded places that perhaps had once been used to store things i went back and resumed the haul on my body what an awful job it was then i became aware of another presence it was gloomy here and getting more so as the day waned above crewel lye reducing the light leaking down the stairway but now there was yellower light at the far end of the passage someone was coming i tried to haul my inert body the rest of the way to the chamber but i was tired and the body seemed heavier than ever and there wasnt enough time the light of a lantern rounded a corner and paused what have we here a gruff voice growled oh no i recognized that quality of speech this was a gnome the gnomes lived underground and their profession was mining they tunneled endlessly ferreting out pretty stones and they werent partial to intruders sometimes they ate visitors sometimes they did worse things especially to attractive young women for some obscure reason i was now far more acutely conscious of the problems of young women than i had been before gnomes werent as bad as goblins being slightly more civilizedyes even i a proud but ignorant barbarian could appreciate some aspects of civilizationbut they were bad enough some idiots thought of gnomes as in nocent little men like the elves i knew better i didnt like this at all mymy friend and ihes injured and must have shelter i said hoping to rouse some element of sym pathy in the gnome it was a faint hope but all i could muster at the moment it was promptly dashed you are intruders the gnome growled i saw that he carried a wickedlooking pick in his other hand the kind that could pry stone from bed rock i gnasty gnomad of the gnobody gnomes shall deal with you forthrightly gnomes were very forthright folk that was part of their problem he lifted his deadly pick had i been in my own body with my trusty sword i should hardly have been concerned gnasty stood only a third my normal height was shortlegged and shortarmed and the pick was relatively clumsy compared with the sword however devastating it was against unarmed folk but i was not in my body and my sword remained above crewel lye ground i could not effectively oppose the gnome physi cally shamed as i am to admit it so i scrambled cunningly once more wait good gnome sir i cried no need to kill us we can be useful to you we oh what could i offer that i was willing to offer in this body again the genius of desperation struck we can sing i care nothing for human hilarity gnasty said touch ing his squat dark cap dourly but he paused no hilarity i said sad very sad listen and i used threnodys voice as i had done to calm the black sword ululating fervently it sounded as if something gross had just expired gnasty gnomad considered maybe so he said grudgingly impressed then follow me he turned about and tramped back down the passage i returned to the dragging of my body oh leave him the gnome snapped well cut him up for broth no i cried he can sing too were a duet much better together i hoped that was true my bodys ability at singing was nil as song is not a barbarian thing but if threnody animated it her skill might compensate the gnome shrugged it better be true he grumped i hauled and somehow got my body moved along fortunately it wasnt far down the passage was a cham ber hollowed from stone with a ventilation shaft pene trating to the surface it had a barred wooden door when i struggled in there with my burden the gnome slammed and locked the door but well need food water i cried in order to sing well in due course chattel gnasty said and marched off well for the moment we were secure too secure perhaps since we were prisoners but maybe that was better than nothing i checked my body carefully the healing continued apace the head and arm were now so firmly attached that only faint scar lines showed where the severings had been what a marvelous talent i had actually threnody had a marvelous talent too i felt crewel lye i should use it to rescue us from this fix i could change into a snake and crawl out between the bars and up the stairs and out but my body could not follow and i didnt want to leave it unattended suppose dimepedes or nickelpedes showed up or the gnobody gnomes while i was absent so i just had to sit tightat least until the healing was far enough along i settled down beside my body and slept by morning my body had healed enough to return to consciousness but still had some healing to do i noticed that the legs were flesh again my talent had cleared up that detail while it was at it good enough i really didnt need stone feet or even feet of clay however i now had the chore of explaining things to threnody who had not been in a position to appreciate much of what had happened recently i had to get things straight with her before the gnomes returned dont get excited i murmured in my ear it was a dirty ear i really should have cleaned my head more often especially after it had rolled in the dirt there has been an exchange of consciousness my eyes widened my left arm jerked up before my face my mouth opened dont scream i warned thats more trouble she was smart enough to desist but she took a while to get settled my arm she whispered horrified its all big and hairy thats not all i muttered i explained the rest of it in terse whispers bringing us up to date so now you must try to sing using my voice i concluded once she accepted the reality of our exchange of bod ies she adapted readily she didnt like it any better than i did and had just as much trouble with the specialized male anatomy as i had with the female anatomy but she was a clever and realistic woman i realized that magician yang must have expected me to be nearest pook or some other creature perhaps a living tree when the exchange spell was activated surely he would not have wanted me in the body of the woman he hoped to marry or did he crewel lye hope to marry her maybe he would be satisfied to have her dead regardless of the attitude of the common folk ofxanth at any rate threnody and i were for the mo ment unified in objecting to the present situation gnomes are no good for us she said they dont like to go on the surface by day so have to hunt at night they have spells to protect them from night creatures or maybe its just their bright torches that scare the beasts away but they have an appetite for daygame which they seldom have opportunity to assuageand we are day game she looked down at my body which was now clothed in only the merest tatters of her brown dress if i had known this was going to happen id have let you get new trousers can this hunk of flesh survive being cooked and eaten im not sure i said uncomfortably swallowed whole by a dragon sure but spread among several stomachs the more my body has to regenerate lost parts the harder it is maybe if the bones were piled togetheri think its the bones that are the essence of me but if they are kept separatethrown away in different dumpsi dont think id be able to recover im not like a worm where each part becomes a new creature thats what i thought so if i get eaten by gnomes in this body im done forand my own body cant recover from simple death theres no chance there weve just got to avoid being eaten i never much liked being eaten anyway i confessed but how can we escape your bodys a lot stronger than mine but yours is pretty weak right now she smiled with my brute masculine face im in a position to know after a recovery my body needs a lot of food and rest i explained it will be a couple of days before its up to full snuff and without a weapon or tool to fight with or pry us out of here even your full strength wont do much good she said well have to depend on my talent my body can escape readily but but mine cant i finished for her and we need both bodies until we can get switched back crewel lye im aware of the irony she said grimacing weve got to stick together and protect each other from further harm but how can your body escape undoubtedly you as a barbarian have had prior experience with this sort of thing hairbreadth escapes and whatnot she gave me too much credit most of my life had been spent peacefully growing up in fen village that was why i had had to go out on my own to fill my quota of ad venture i had drowned once gotten zonked by the stare of a stray basilisk and had my neck broken by a falling branch but these were mere boyhood experiences the kind any lad had i had never been imprisoned and threat ened with getting cooked before this journey to central xanth but i did know a way i could assume the form of a creature with strong teeth or cutting claws then i could cut you into chunks small enough to pass through these bars and carry the chunks to the surface one at a time after that i could put them together and wait for you to reconstitute she grimaced there are a squintillion problems with that first doesnt it hurt and if you knocked me out first wouldnt there be a lot of lost blood when you cut and wouldnt it take so longthree hoursfor you to change in my body and do the job that the gnomes will return and discover what were up to and if not and you carry the chunks to the surface whats to prevent some predator from consuming them up there one at a time while youre down here fetching another and if all that can be overcome how do you know your body will recover after that bad treatment so soon after being hacked apart by the black sword you hadnt recovered all the way from the stonespell before and i still feel a little stone in my toe i spread my small pretty hands youre thinking bet ter than i am i guess youre right it wouldnt work we cant escape on our own but what else can we do i think you had the right idea before well have to sing our way out crewel lye but can you sing well in my voice i was never good at that sort of thing marvels can be done with harmony she said its one thing your weakened body can probably do as well as ever maybe wed better practice but the gnomes will hear and what if they do they want us to sing dont they i cant think why they want song but wed better oblige them so we sang her bodys voice was very good even without the accompaniment other lute but i knew neither words nor tune so could only ululate in the fashion i had done before my bodys voice was deep and rough but threnody knew the songs it seemed impossible at first but she knew what she was doing that turned out to be an improvement on my situation and an important part of singing i will teach you a song so you can sing it properly she said then i will be the bass accompaniment the secret is harmony and counterpoint the two voices will complement each other and become more than they are separately let me see she pondered briefly lets start with a wordless one you just learn the melody she made my voice sing the tune as she got used to it she made my voice perform better than it ever had sung before it stopped barging about the basement and started marching in more disciplined fashion at ground level i realized that my poor singing had been more a matter of attitude than ability even the worst voice could sound halfway decent if properly managed then with her voice i was able to pick up the theme on a higher register and soon i could sing it it was a sad but pretty thing that seemed appropriate for mourning a close friends death or the tragedy of the human condition in general there was a tramping in the passage and we broke off gnasty arrived followed by several other gnomes see gnitwit gnasty said i told you they could sing gnitwit gnodded so you did but will the cowboys listen crewel lye why hot try it and see what do you think gnone such since the cowpokes infest our richest region gnone such said anythings worth a try if it doesnt work we can always put them in the stew gnitwit peered at me she looks delectable look at that thigh i get first dibs on that gno you dont gnasty snapped as i hastily tugged the hem of my skirt down to cover the exposed thigh i found them i get first pick from the stew lets fatten them up so we can all feast gnonesuch suggested good gnotion gnasty agreed they departed and threnody and i practiced some more harmony we had extra incentive now while i sang the tune i had learned she used my voice to fill a deep underpinning a sort of strumming that was nothing in itself but really sounded good when it lined up with what i was singing we were a team there was more action in the passage this time the entrance was by gnomides the gnome women who were rather pretty little things i have already remarked on how the humanrelated creatures seem to have better taste in women than in men at least as far as appearances go structurally its another matter of course legs that may look and taste delectable dont run as fast as those with muscles i suppose there should be a reasonable compro mise between appearance and performance but of course i was not the one to design the humanoid form the gnomides brought a pot of murky water and a bundle of cooked roots the roots tasted awful and were threaded with undigestible strings but we were both so hungry that we ate them without protest at least there was plenty of the stuff so that my body had the substance it needed for healing completely and strengthening the gnomides departed and we had more time to our selves thats one thing prisoners have plenty oftime we practiced our song some more perfecting it then rested the more you sleep the faster my body will recover i told her crewel lye i wonder whether you should practice changing form she said we dont want the gnomes to know you can do it but if the opportunity arises for a change you do need to know how i phased to smoke so i could bury the black sword in a stone i said i just willed it and it happened yes thats the way if you concentrate harder it works faster but you still cant do it in much under an hour you were very smart to deal with the sword that way i was desperate but i felt a feminine flush of pleas ure at the compliment the problem is you can do only one kind of change at a time and you have to complete that before you can begin another you cant change size halfway then change density halfway the most you can do is change your mind and resolidify before youre done so its really quite lim itedwhich is one reason i did not try to escape captivity till nightmy body is vulnerable while its in the process of change it has to be undisturbed for things to work right i know how it is i said my body cant heal properly if it keeps getting messed up but how does your body know when halfway is i mean couldnt you be shrinking to elf size but stop at gnome size and decidethats where you were going anyway my eyes widened in my handsome but smudged male face i never thought of that she exclaimed i always had an object in mind like a mouse first id change to mouse size and be so dense id almost sink through the ground then id diffuse back to normal density at which point id be the size and mass of an imp then id change shape and be a complete mouse i never was able to do it any other waybut i suppose its possible just as it turned out to be possible for my voice to sing i agreed whats this about superdensity the mass of the body stays the same unless thats whats being changed she explained when i reduce my mass without changing size or form i become ghost like then if i reduce my size commensurately i become crewel lye normally solid again the mass of a mouse distributed through the volume of a woman is vaporous but still there when the size becomes that of a mouse all is well thats interesting i said not very interested but now youd better sleep she agreed my body settled back and in a moment was snoring that startled me oh i knew i snored some times but hadnt realized it was that loud and vulgar people at fen village had complained now and then but i had believed they were joking i wasnt sleepy myself this body was not busy re covering from decapitation and dismemberment so was more alert i decided to experiment cautiously with chang ing states i had diffused before and returned to normality so i knew i could handle that what about shape no that would be too obvious if the gnomes came back un expectedly size yes maybe i could do something with that i would make myself largerno smaller again to escape notice if observed and i would stop wherever chose then decide what to do next i wanted to know the limits of threnodys talent our lives might depend on it i shrank for about a quarter of an hour then checked the mark i had made on the wall yes i was about three quarters of my prior height in an hour i could reduce toto whatzero size microscopic a microscope was a magic instrument used to see things too small to see i could appear under that instrument and do a pantomime act astonishing the magician watching except that any larger creature could eat me that thought changed my mind quickly i was denser there was a different feel to my body not comfortable i was breathing more rapidly as if my lungs were not taking in enough air this made sense they had to support the same mass but they were smaller so they had to work harder how could threnody have diminished to mouse size without suffocating she must have diffused first then shrunk so she could breathe i was also having a little trouble with my balance because i was closer to the ground and had less time to correct my stance as well as being overmassed for this size i crewel lye realized that even if density were kept constant a person would not want to be the size of a mouse for it would be hard to balance on two feet the imps of course were used to it and maybe had magic to keep them steady but if i were the size of a mouse id better also assume the form of a mouse it was amazing how complex a simple thing like sizechange became no wonder thren ody hadnt been eager to launch into it now i decided to diffuse back to normal density so i wouldnt have to pant already i could see the limits of these changes if i diffused too much wind could blow me away or even apart while if i became too solid could sink into the ground but waiti wanted to find out whether i could stop here and do something else or alternate one form of change with another threnody thought i couldntbut again i reminded myself that i had thought i couldnt sing i had shrunk some better try diffusing i concentrated on diffusion and in fifteen minutes i was breathing easier so far so good i had done a change in half an hour instead of two hours what next well could this body change part of itself and not the rest threnody had been so sure of its limitsmaybe she hadnt even tried new things i concentrated on my left hand willing it to become a crabs pincer i ignored the rest of the body working on just that one thing and it worked in just a few minutes that hand was a big green pincer i tried it on my skin but it wasnt a strong pincer it had the form but not the power no this was not an easy way to convert the body into a natural weapon not without more time and practice still this represented a breakthrough threnodys body had more talent than she had known because the focus of change was now narrow it was relatively swift she had required an hour per change because she insisted on doing the whole body all the way she had been limited in her thinking and therefore in her talent but id better get back to normal lest i be discovered i tried to change size and claw simultaneously but found crewel lye i could not it had to be one or the other very well claw first then size it was easy i changed the claw halfway to the hand then switched to sizechanging switched again to density to catch up on my missing mass and returned to finish the hand i could only do one type of change at a time but i could do whatever change i wanted to whatever extent i had in effect rendered threnodys talent far more versatile was that true for all people i wondered could every person do much more than he believed if he changed his belief to what extent were all of us needlessly limited the mundanes refused to believe in magic and therefore could not practice it there was a horrendous example but barbarians arent much for philosophy maybe they could be if they thought they could be i got myself back to normal then settled down and snoozed in and out threnody slept more solidly for several hours waking when the gnomides brought more food this time gnasty was with them prepare yourselves chattel he said gruffly soon you will sing for the cowboys he spun about and tramped off who or what are these cowboys i asked one of the gnomides glanced around to be sure gnasty was out of hearing range they are bullheaded folk she said well so is gnasty i said she smiled becoming more at ease no you mis understand human woman they she shrugged at a loss to provide more detail my name is i hesitated but realized i had to go with my present body lest there be considerable com plications of understanding threnody threnody she repeated and i am gnifty gnom ide gnice to know you gnifty i said in my most fem inine manner while threnody kept silent and actually it was nice for these gnomides were of quite a different personality from the gnomes it served as a reminder that a person can not be said to know a species unless he crewel lye knows both sexes of it what do i misunderstand about the cowboys do they herd cows or something cows were mythical mundane animals a titter rippled through the gnomides of course not gnifty said they aretheir heads are she cast about for a better term but found none bulls she finished you mean their bodies arelike oursbut their heads yes she exclaimed pleased at this success of com munication they graze graze on the moss of the rocks where our men mine and they getthey have horns it was coming clear at last when the gnomes try to work the cowboys want to graze so they get ornery and interfere yes and they are too big and strong to oppose so we cant mine but theyre not aggressive usually and they like musiconly we arent good at music well well sing for you i said generously but suppose it doesnt work oh we dont like to think of that gnifty said but an older gnomide hardened to tougher stuff man aged to come up with the thought the pot shes gnaughty gnifty confided embarrassed and shes gnymph she indicated the youngest gnomide who was too shy to speak at all as with human women their shyness was inversely proportional to their age i knew better than to ask these little women to release us they didnt have the key and they wouldnt dare defy their gruff men as it was they shied away from thren odys side of the cell afraid of the big brute male body despite the gate separating us they took me for a woman so were friendly with me all women i realized shared a bond of awe and subservience because of the roughness of men how odd that i had never noticed this before assuming female aspect myself well thank you so much for the food i said my friend jordan there has a big appetite he was hurt crewel lye thats why we came down here we couldnt stay up there at nightnot with all those monsters the gnomides shuddered they were afraid of mon sters too that was why their kind lived safely under ground but why dont small monsters come in that open door in the tree i asked we came right down the stairs we didnt know there were people here theres an aversion spell on it gnifty explained only our own kind can enter or someone in such dire need that he overcomes the aversion that was us i said he was unconscious i dragged him down our men have aversion spells on their hats gnifty continued she was really quite talkative now that the ice had been broken so that no big monsters come near just creatures small enough to be hunted at night when a dragon is near they cry hang onto your hat that makes sense i agreed with maidenly agree ment we finished eating and the gnomides took away the refuse then the gnomes returned move out gnasty said as he unlocked the gate we were conducted to a deep region where the tunnels branched out in all directions apparently these ones had not been hollowed by the gnomes they were larger and older and their walls were covered by furry growths in some sections the walls had been chipped away by the miners where they had delved for precious stones the moss did not grow in the chipped sections i could see why those who grazed would be annoyed to them per fectly good food was being destroyed when two cultures interfaced who was to say which one was right and which wrong they merely had different viewpoints when i thought of it that term interface was inter esting it derived from a spell in which the faces of two creatures were locked together or combined so that they interconnected there had been a person whose talent was interfacing she could lock any two faces together however awkward it was for the participants later usage crewel lye had been less specific until now it meant the overlapping of any two things including culturesas in this case i was fascinated by the way words came into the language too bad i wasnt civilized words have always been very important to me because we barbarians have only an oral tradition without words we would have no culture at all words have real power and not just the magic ones one has only to listen to a harpy swear to know that the gnomes slowed becoming nervous theyre near gnasty said i smell them if only our aversion spells worked on them sure enough there was a whiff of barnyard odor then we heard a kind of crunch crunchthe sound of grazing and chewingand every so often the burp of a wad of cud being brought up finally we came into a larger cav ern and there were the cowboys true bullheaded men the size of my body they spied us one snorted and pawed the floor of the cave with a bare foot he was unclothed but fairly furry all over so he didnt seem naked he lowered his horns gnasty clapped his hand to his hat and backed off this was really cowboy country sing gnasty cried now look i said reasonably dont the cowboys have as much right to this cave as you do after all theyre hungry and this is where they graze gnitwit go smoke up the pot gnasty said to his companion well sing i exclaimed the gnomes had a truly compelling argument that was often the way of it when reason met fanaticism so we sang my pretty melody and threnodys deep resonating accompaniment in this larger space it worked well the sound sort of spread out and mellowed and those bass notes reverberated while the high notes cut straight through to the ear it was a nice effect if i do say so myself and the cowboys responded the aggressive bull un aggressed and returned to his grazing beyond him was crewel lye a cowgirl with a body not unlike the one i was using that one listened attentively her ears cocked toward us move them down to the far side gnasty told us gruffly pleased we want to work here so threnody and i slowly walked to the far side of the cavern and the cowfolk followed us so as to be close to the song behind us the gnomes unlimbered their picks and had at the wall gouging out chunks of it then using their mallets to smash apart the chunks when they had reduced the rock to gravel they sifted through it search ing for gems they didnt find many but of course such work is slow as is anything worthwhile i couldnt fault the industrious gnomes but i was sorry to see the natural walls being torn down and the rubble accumulating the gnomes were more civilized than the cowfolk so naturally they had more destructive ways once the gnomes were through with a section no one would have any use for it all we had was one song but the cowfolk seemed satisfied with it the cowgirl gradually came closer to me avoiding threnody and i realized that she like the gnom ides felt more comfortable with her own sex once again the camaraderie of the gentle aspect prevailed i held out my hand to her and she made so bold as to sniff it then shied away alarmed by her own boldness these were basically shy folk not looking for trouble the bulls simply stood their ground when they had to maybe the aversion spell of the gnomes did work on the cowboys but they became desperate when defending their diminishing pastures so resisted it my sympathy was with them i seemed to have a lot of female sympathy now maybe it derived from my present body yet some how i doubted it was any carryover from threnodys personality but we were captives of the gnomes and we didnt know much about the cowfolk and my body had not yet recovered its full strength we had to remain with the gnomes until we saw our way clear to escape we sang until we began to hoarsen which was bad for pacifying cows so we had to quit for the day but the crenel lye gnomes had done good mining during this period and were well satisfied the gnomides carried several small dia monds evidently they were the guardians of such stones the gnomes returned us to our cell and fed us well i would have appreciated it more if i hadnt known they wanted us fat for the pot at such time as our usefulness as singers ended once our effect on the cowboys dimin ished or the gnomes completed their operations in cow folk caves we would be in hot water there didnt seem to be any gnomes near our cell this evening but a barbarian never trusts appearances com pletely they could have one of their number lurking in a nearby cell listening to make sure we didnt make any secret escape plans so i said nothing on this subject to threnody but as darkness closed at the ventilation shaft i settled down next to her put my face near hersthat is near mineand murmured theyre going to cook us one of these days yes well really go to pot she agreed so we must plan our escape youll be stronger to morrow but it will take one more day for full strength do you think we can wait that long i think so she said thats a big cavern theyre mining and maybe not the only one but lets plan it carefully now just in case we have to try it tomorrow i think the cowfolk will let us pass through their home passagesbut we need to be sure theres a way to the surface from there i was propped on one elbow so as to address her ear my arm was getting uncomfortable but i didnt want to move away and have to talk louder uh may i lean against you i asked sure she said gruffly here put your head against my shoulder and ill hold you in place so rested my head in the crook of her shoulder and neck and she put her brawny arm around my body one big hand fell rather familiarly across my bosom uh your hand i said what she sounded annoyed and she put both hands crewel lye crewel lye on my shoulders drew me in to my face and kissed me on the mouth i wrenched away brought up my own hand and slapped her on the cheek smartly then i scrambled out of her grasp what did you do that for she demanded angrily even in the dark i was aware of her big muscles tensing and i was uncomfortably conscious of the disparity in the powers of our bodies she was not yet at full strength but she could pick me up and throw me across the cell if she wanted to you behave yourself or ill scream for the gnomes i said tersely but all i was doing she began in a baffled voice all you were doing was responding to your strong masculine passions you think any available female is yours toto i could not continue appalled at the prospect my masculine passions she retorted outraged then she laughed ruefully you know its true ive never felt stirrings like that before im alliis that the way men react to women to pretty ones i said guardedly i never realized before how it was with men how do you ever manage to control yourselves it isnt always easy i admitted grudgingly mollified that night when you lay against me and breathed she laughed again i know now i understand exactly how you felt that dirt you said you have in your mind i think some of that rubbed off on me becausewell never mind oh jordanyou were a saint saints are mythological mundane creatures i mut tered further mollified but this experience had unsettled me too never before had i properly appreciated the wom ans position i apologize threnody said i got carried away i accept your apology i said graciously and so we were reconciled but we did not resume physical contact and we did not discuss our plans for escape that night next day was much like the first we ate rehearsed another song and sang it later for the cowfolk this time three cowgirls approached one was young really a calf child with cute little horns yooo nnize vvoook she mooed as we paused between songs we had found we didnt have to sing continuously they would give us a few minutes for silence if it was obvious there would soon be more music i did a double take was she talking it seemed so the bovine lips and tongue were not well adapted for speech but when i realized that the z sound substituted forthe s sound and the v for the f it made sense thank you i murmured you nice folk too nnize zoongz she said pleased nice songs i agreed glancing to make sure the gnomes werent paying attention can all of you talk our language she shook her head no oonee mmeee mmiii zaa lenz your talent i agreed understanding i hadnt real ized that nonhuman folk had magic talents but of course the cowfolk were mostly human all except the heads so it made sense that they should have souls and magic this was a very interesting development could we turn it to our advantage we certainly needed an advan tage we sang another song to preserve appearances then i talked with the calfchild again what is your name i asked mmooola she replied richly hwaaz yoorz she had trouble with some consonants but i could understand her increasingly well as i became attuned threnody i said feeling a twinge of guilt for this necessary deception there was no way could make these folk understand my real situation and if i could it would only frighten them away i believe in good old fashioned barbarian integrity but there are times when it doesnt seem to apply zrennozee she repeated carefully you speak very well i complimented her and her crewel lye nostrils dilated with appreciation i leaned forward con fidentially just between us girlsi have a secret her beautiful bovine orbs brightened all girls love secrets her furry ears twitched zeekrez yes we are captives of the gnobody gnomes will you help us escape moolas nose wrinkled in perplexity eezave correct escape the gnomes mean to cook us in a big pot when theyre through with our singing vvigg vozz a big big pot i agreed we must escapetomor row will you help the calfbrow creased and the ears twitched uncer tainly mmuuz aazg she lowed glancing at the largest bullhead who was evidently in charge tomorrow i repeated then we had to sing again for the herd was getting restless that night we definitely had to make plans so i trusted my valuable and delicate feminine body close to the brute hunk threnody was using and discussed our escape i think all we have to do is walk into the midst of the cowfolk i said the gnomes couldnt stop us if moola says its okay but can we trust them she asked with typically masculine suspicion what do they eat besides moss their mouths arent suited for meateating i said or for talking thats just moolas talent but i wasnt entirely easy since i now inhabited what was surely a delectable car cass anyway what choice do we have we dont want to wait for the gnomes to light a fire under the pot the notion of that smoking fire and boiling pot seemed to bother her as much as it did me a pot is best left unsmoked wed better trust them she agreed they do seem like decent bovine folk a better risk anyway i made ready to draw away but she held me close im sorry i killed you she said we had been through that before are you getting ready to make another pass at me i demanded trying vainly to free myself from her grip crewel lye of course not she said insincerely then she laughed ruefully i never suspected what a difference a body makes she said i mean i have assumed many forms in the past but always female you could assume the male form couldnt you i asked maybe i should try it it wouldnt work my talent is formchanging not that maybe my body could look male but inside it would always be female that seemed reasonable yet now in our exchanged bodies she was assuming male attributes and i female ones form did make a difference still i definitely thought of myself as a male and surely she remained female in out look some questions have no easy answers and i suspect the question of sexual outlook is about as uneasy as any we separated and slept but perhaps we respected each other more than we had before next day was as before until we came to the cowfolks cavern about half the wall of it had been chipped away so that there was much less grazing than previously we sang the first song and moola approached verzinanz zayz ogaa she reported contentedly ferdinand says okay i relayed to threnody then lets get the hell on our way she said gruffly i dont know why males cant be more gracious about accepting favors and i wish they would watch their rough language we got up and walked to the far end of the cave where the main herd of the cowfolk was hey gnasty gnomad shouted brandishing his pick but two bullheads stood in the way their horns lowered and he could do nothing and we had the pot ready to smoke tonight he raged such a pity creep threnody muttered without much sympathy males can be quite callous at times moola skipped along ahead of us showing the way but neither of us escapees was completely sanguine about where this was leading chapter nightmare it led to a huge barnlike cave where motherly cows nursed small baby calves and old bullheads chewed cud complacently standing in a kingly stall was ferdi nand a huge and noble bull of a man moola conducted us straight to him moola had to translate as we did not comprehend bovine language the king however appeared to under stand our speech well enough royal creatures do seem to place a premium on education and at times that really helps greetings your majesty threnody said making a formal bow it was evident that the males dominated this herd so she as our apparent male was expected to be the important person i stifled my annoyance at this rank sexism for now id give threnody a piece of my mind later we are deeply grateful for your timely assistance in rescuing us from the gnomes the king mooed moola translated zoze mnovozzee mnomz arr aa vaane those gnobody gnomes are a pain i repeated qui etly for threnodys benefit as her masculine ear seemed to be less attuned to nuances no wonder she couldnt sing as prettily as i could they certainly are threnody agreed they were going to smoke us in a pot the bullheaded king mooed again and moola said nnoow yoo ghann zzingg vorr uz voreverr oops now you can sing i began whispering i heard threnody snapped with insufferable mas culine crudity she raised my voice for the king your crewel lye majesty we deeply appreciate what you have done for us but we have business elsewhere perhaps there is some other service we can do for your good folk to show our gratitude mooo the king asked disappointed we can not stay here threnody said firmly this is no aspersion on your region or culture it is just that we have a prior commitment i am a kings daugha kings offspring and the duties of my status regretfully the king mooed again he was not one to argue against the honoring of duties of royal status the only other thing we need is more pasture moola translated in her fashion im rendering it for the moment in our normal mode though of course it wasnt actually her accent was not bad for a heifer and i dont mean to disparage it im sure we sounded as odd to the bovines but our deepest and best pastures are controlled by the knights and already we pay a terrible rental for the use of some of those caves nights threnody asked they are very dark knights moola said precisely managing to convey a hard k sound at the beginning of the term we are bracketed above by the gnomes and below by the knights the gnobody gnomes and the knockkneed knights the story as it emerged was that terrible armored creatures called knights allowed the cowfolk to graze in some nether pastures but required the sacrifice of the finest bullocks and heifers each year if the cowfolk re fused to send their tribute the knights would cut off the pastures entirely now with their upper pasture depleted by the ravages of the gnomes the bovines would not have enough left to survive the annual ritual had started many years before when the knights had moved into the caves and proved to be too strong for the cowfolk the invaders were from a far place called konkrete where everything was very hard the bovines had tried to fight but their horns were no match for the pikes of the knights and they had been driven relentlessly to the very fringe of their range up against the gnomes the knights could have exterminated crewel lye explained that would have taken an hour to complete the cowfolk entirely but preferred to save them for en tertainment so the tribute was not just for grazing it was for the very survival of the bovine community but it was a sporting thing as the knights liked sport the sacrificial cowfolk were given swords and sent into the dread lab yrinth to meet the knight tourney champion if they could run that gantlet and defeat him in battle the tribute would be forgiven and thereafter the bovines would be permitted to graze free that gave them a genuine incen tive to fight wellbut so far none of them had prevailed even though the bull and heifer were permitted to tackle the lone knight together the knights champion had been too strong but how do you know they would keep their word if you ever won threnody asked with male suspicion oh the knockkneed knights always keep their word moola assured her they are creatures of chival ric honor they believe that without honor they would be nothing at all they are tough warriors and heartless creatures but they would never dishonor their word i began to perceive a certain barbarian ethic here maybe we could come to terms with the knights the only escapes from these caves were through the territories of the gnomes or knights so if we did not wish to remain here we would have to go one way or the other if we really wanted to do the cowfolk a favor on our way out threnody was doubtful but i wasnt we ought to help these good folk i said not just because its a way out but because they are in genuine need besides it sounds like a grand adventure grand adventure she exclaimed more like a night mare we could get killed id rather get killed in a good fight for justice than boiled ignominiously in a pot of course the easy thing would be to stay here and sing for the bovines forever while they slowly starve you retain some of those bold masculine notions she muttered but i suppose we have little choice you crewel lye could change into a mouse and sneak out alone but i cantand anyway i want my body back before you ruin it she straightened my massive shoulders and ad dressed the king again your majesty we have decided to take the place of your two sacrifices and go to battle with the knights champion perhaps we shall defeat him and free you of your annual tribute if not at least two of your own folk shall be spared this year king ferdinand made a bellow of pleased surprise zhiz is aa heroig zhing yoo dzoo moola translated yoo arr aa graaze mmaann aa graaze mmaann threnody agreed with irony and privately to me you and your damned noble in stincts the sacrifice wasnt due until next month but the king was sure the knights would accept it early we decided to go the next day first we had to prepare for the encounter the cowfolk cooperated in fitting threnody with a bullhead so that she looked very much like the king himself the bovines were fairly clever with their human hands and had fash ioned likenesses of the heads of their heroes of the past made from cloth plaster and paint this particular mask head was a representation of the minotaur a bygone hero who had gone to mundania to seek his fortune he was believed to have acquitted himself very well in labyrinth competition there slaying many mundanes naturally things were better with fewer mundanes iv oonlee wee hadz hiz llighe aagenn moola said reverently vudz wee arr zoo veesvull nnow too peaceful i agreed yet there is merit in that for my part i used my bodys talent first i expanded my size to that of threnodys body my body techni cally next i increased my density to make myself normal again then i changed my head to become that of a homed cow the cowfolk watching this onehour transformation were amazed so was threnody you did it three times as fast as i do she exclaimed i started to change to a giant twice as tall as you i crewel lye i stopped when i was your height so only ten minutes had passed then i started to increase my mass eightfold but stopped after fifteen minutes when it was only dou ble finally i changed my head leaving the rest of my body alone so that only took half an hour but the whole body has to change she protested no it doesnt if you change from human shape to cowgirl shape only the head changes otherwise you couldnt assume some partly human forms such as this one or that of a harpy or centaur she shook her head i wouldnt believe it but i just saw you do it youve learned more about my talent in three days than i did in a lifetime just lucky i said smugly her eyes narrowed i thought barbarians were sort of stupid youre smarter than she shrugged youre really quite aa person i shrugged im close to nature thats all your talent is a natural thing your demon heritage natural she muttered with mixed emotions we had a supper of fresh moss as that was all that was available it wasnt tasty by our standards but it did feed us we slept in a chamber lined with old straw which was a precious substance here the cowfolk were treating us royally next day we set out for the challenge moola had ex plained how to find the knights who would give us swords if they accepted our status as sacrifice it was simply a matter of walking to the lower level and mooing for at tention the knights like most arrogant conquerors did not bother to speak the subjects language vaarr wwelll moola said as we departed a big lovely bovine tear in her brown eyes fare well moola i replied giving her a female hug i was now much bigger than she but the sentiment was the same i had increased my size because i felt that would give me a better chance in the action to come part of what sets women at a disadvantage is their smaller size and that was one disadvantage this body did not have to put up with crewel lye we walked down the indicated route the caves looked strange from my bovine eyes i could see behind me as well as before me but detail was not as clear as i liked very soon we were in the forbidden territory so we started mooing to advertise our presence otherwise we had been warned we could be slaughtered casually as trespassers or as strays from the herd it wasnt long before a figure in metal armor appeared it was largeas large as we wereand so completely covered that no flesh was visible a forbidding apparition indeed moo we mooed together the specter studied us one gauntleted hand on the huge sword slung at its metal hip then it turned and walked away its armor did rattle some but its knees did not actually knock nervously we followed presuming we had been accepted as the sacrifice and would be per mitted the privilege of running the gantlet sure enough we were brought to an arena it wasnt really a labyrinth or a gantlet but rather an open area surrounded by a warren of low channels as we stood in the center more suits of armor filed in taking seats on these low walls in fact i now saw that these were tiered benches the ones behind set higher than those before so that the knights could all see clearly into the arena empty it looked like a labyrinth filled it was an audience cham ber in the center of the arena beside us was a ramp it started level with the floor fairly wide and rose at a slight incline as it crossed the arena near the edge the ramp curved and went back still rising across the arena it bent once more and had another straight run by this time it was fairly high so that a person would not want to fall from it at the uppermost end of the ramp far overhead was a metal gateand beyond that was the light of day that was the route to the surface that was our escape that distant spot of light looked wonderful below the only illumination was by murky torches what was to prevent us from simply marching up that crewel lye crewel lye ramp and out that gate well the gate was closed and surely locked wed have to break through which would be very difficult and perhaps impossible or get the key to the lock that key could be anywhere and certainly not where we could get it the gate would open when the knights chose to open it not otherwise but why then make a ramp up to it was this a high way the knights used themselves then why have it in the arena surely they did not form an audience every time one of their number went topside we were not kept waiting long once the theater was filled a knight walked to the base of the ramp he faced us and drew out a chain with a large metal key on it then he walked up the ramp swinging the key tramping around each curve until he was high above the floor approaching the gate he used the key on the lock of the gate and the gate swung open then he pulled the gate closed locked it and walked back down the ramp no question about it this was our escape route we would have to earn that key as the knight reached the base of the ramp he looped the chain about his armored neck then he walked to the far wall a door opened and an armored horse emerged the knight went to this steed mounted and took up a long sharp lance but what about our swords threnody asked nerv ously the knight spurred his steed who charged forward the monstrous lance descended to point at us i think the cowfolk got the wrong information about that cried had kept a human tongue in my cowhead so i could talk readily or these honorable knights have broken the agree ment threnody said bitterly no wonder no cowboy has ever won this challenge but theyre supposed to be nothing at all without honor i said does this count as a breach of we dived to either side as the mounted knight charged through the hooves of the steed barely missed us as it passed we scrambled to our feet as the knight braked his steed slowed and turned were lambs for the slaugh ter threnody cried you escape up the ramp while i distract him i said as the knight started his next pass no good without the key she cried the knight charged again that sent us both diving over the ramp we had better sidewise maneuverability than the knight did but sooner or later that terrible lance would skewer one of us again we scrambled as the knight slowed and turned weve got to get rid of that lance i exclaimed sure how ill drop on him from above i said you distract him so i can the knight thundered at us again threnody ran away to the side while i raced up the ramp with diverging targets the knight had to choose one and he went after threnody she ran and dodged with the fleetness of des peration and a powerful body the knight swerved to pursue her and i got the feeling that this was what the knightly audience really wantedthe sport of the hunt we were not opponents we were fleeing prey one victim would have been too easy to dispatch but two was more of a challenge so they set it up that way to help provide the illusion that the prey might escape i considered that as i ran upward rounding the first turn for sport the knight would not slaughter us right away he would play with us making us react and per haps be applauded by the audience for an artistic perform ance that might give us more leeway he might even withhold his killing stroke if the points were wrong wait ing for the chance for a better score threnody i called take off your dress for my body which she was using now still was wearing the brown dress i had donned at threnodys house it was soiled and torn but represented a fair quantity of material huh she called out as she cut back causing the knight to overshoot her position no points for him on crewel lye that pass my wellcoordinated body was proving to be a boon to her as she learned how to use it take it off i repeated still running i was now head height soon id be high enough to be above the knight use it to bait him with i dont understand she cried ducking out of the way again there was no time for a detailed explanation maybe the maskhelmet threnody wore prevented her from hear ing exactly what i was saying i would have to make a demonstration i struggled out of my own dress as i ran it was tight on me anyway in my larger size despite the tucks i had let out to accommodate my girth theoretically the dress should have expanded with me and maybe it had but somehow my extra mass bulged more in proportion i saw the helmeted heads of the knights in the audience turn to follow me oopsi hadnt thought of that i wore nothing under the dress and i was one big girl now my anatomy bobbled all over as i ran i had tried to keep the proportions the same but realized belatedly that i should have slimmed them down mass does make a difference so that the giant has to have different proportions from the normal person in order to carry his weight conveni ently now that the dress was off i was really hanging out well that couldnt be helped i had to show threnody what i meant like this in front of him i cried holding the dress so it formed a swatch of gray to the side make him charge it instead of you now she understood she ripped off her brown dress and i saw the visors of the audience swivel to follow her it seemed the knights got a voyeuristic thrill from seeing people disrobe evidently they never got out of their ar mor not in public anyway strange folk threnody stood naked and held the dress to the side forming a cape of it the knight who perhaps did not see too well from the saddle with his visor closed aimed his lance at the dress of course the point slid through it brushing it aside and threnody did not have to dive out crewel lye of the way well she still had to step clear of the horse but this was an improvement get him to pass under me i cried stopping at a suitable elevation on the ramp threnody tried she ran underbut the knight passed to the side so i couldnt drop on him however we seemed to have a viable program the knight turned and came backand this time he was on target as he passed under me i dropped on him landing just in front of him on the horse i could have sworn his visor slits widened as my bare anatomy came up against his faceplate but my ample posterior was crushing down his arms and lance interfering with his action he could hardly have been pleased i grabbed the chain around his neck and ripped it off i had the key then i realized that i had a pretty good position here and i tried to haul him off his horse with me i squirmed around attempting to pin his arms to his sides but he turned out to be very strong and i had only womans muscles his hands came up letting go of the lance and grasped me with horrible force in a moment he heaved me from the horse i landed partly on my feet but without balance and sat down hard i had a lot of padding in that region but that landing smarted it was as if i had been spanked by a giant however i had a victory of sorts for not only did i have the chain with the key i had caused the knight to drop his lance threnody was hurrying to pick it up go up and unlock the gate she cried ill fend him off here you dont know how to use that thing i pointed out hell wipe you out with his sword indeed the knight was already drawing his great blade it was dusky black and reminded me ominously of the evil sword magician yang had sent against me but you dont have the muscle for this she re sponded and she had a point that lance was one heavy pole i could see why the knight was strong he had to be to carry his weapons crewel lye crewel lye now the knight charged us both the terrible sword gleaming wickedly we both wrestled with the lance heaving it upbut we were at the end and the point was at the other end far distant and by the time we managed to lift that point the knight was upon us his sword slashed down and lopped off the point of the lance again we had to dive out of the way ignominiously weve got to stop splitting up this way threnody gasped as we got up on either side of the fallen lance we can still use this i said picking up the severed point which was about half my body length it was a sword of a sort you get the other part she picked it up finding it more manageable now that it was shorter the knight had unwittingly done us a favor he had helped arm us as the knight charged this time we attacked him from either side swinging our sticks at him he merely lifted his shield to fend me off on the left and slashed down at threnodys arms on the right she jerked back but the sword cut off her left hand it plopped to the floor fingers curling spastically damn you she cried as the knight turned for the next charge a smear of blood on his blade she jammed the stump of her wrist into her own side to stop the blood from spurting out but already that flow was abating as my healing talent manifested she stooped to pick up the fallen hand then as the knight advanced she hurled that hand at his head the knight was one tough fighter but this startled him the hand clutched at his visor one finger poking into an eyeslit it looked like a distorted spider trying to get inside the helmet it couldnt get inside of course the knight should have known the separated hand was harm less but he reacted with remarkable vigor he halted his steed and grabbed for the hand with his left gauntlet i took advantage of his distraction to leap up and spread my gray dress over the entire helmet i clung forming a hood of gray material so that he was blinded get his sword i cried but already that arm and sword were thrashing about and threnody could not get close so i grabbed for the sword arm myself my leverage was bad and when i let go of the hood it started to slide off the knight got a glove up and shoved me violently away so that i fell on my sore bare bottom again the dress slid down now the knight could see again and he retained his weapon however threnody saved the moment unable to get near the knight she went for the horse she got her mouth close to an armored ear and yelled booo the horse spooked naturally enough it neighed and reared the knight fell off and clanked to the floor thren ody scrambled to fling herself on the extended sword arm pinning it to the floor while i made a flying leap for the head my weight knocked the helmet from the armored body it squirted out from under my feet and rolled across the floor simultaneously the body went dead threnody was able to wrench the sword away from the abruptly flaccid gauntlet i peered into the neck of the armorand there was nothing i looked at the separated helmet it too was empty there was nothing in this suit of armor nothing at all threnody looked at me empty armor she asked bewildered but it fought us it fought without honor i said we were unarmed without honor the knights are nothing at all then what about all the others who permitted it we looked out at the audience now each knight there reached up a gauntlet to open his visor inside each hel metwas nothing theyre all empty i breathed the knights are all bodiless no wonder they never removed their armor thren ody said without their armor she paused to look at me realizing the significance of my statement about honor theyre nothing lets get out of here before they decide to do some thing dishonorable i said she looked around that horse she said crewel lye crewel lye what about it it looks familiar its buried in armor just like the knights i pro tested its probably empty too no its hooves show its a real horse i walked over to it the armored horse stood still waiting for its rider to return i saw there were metal straps holding its armor together i unbuckled one at the neck so as to uncover the head underneath was a real horsehead no phantom whats a live horse doing in a place like this i asked threnody onehanded removed a portion of the body armor its a ghost horse she exclaimed sure enough there were the chains wrapped about the barrel a ghost horse serving armored ghosts i said we killed its master she pointed out were entitled to what the knight had anything of it we want the spoils well keep the sword i said as for the horse we can free it free her threnody said unbuckling more armor shes a mare a knightmare i said realizing the manner in which this made sense lets ride her up the ramp and out and let her go on the surface agreed we owe her that we won the match when she spooked and threnody had been the one to think of that ploy i would remember that we got the rest of the armor off while the assembled knights watched emptily evincing no emotion it seemed they did honor the rest of their deal we had won we were free and there would be no more cowfolk sacrifices and the grazing range would be expanded we had done our part for the creatures who had helped us that pleased me i mounted the ghost mare dont forget my hand i reminded threnody she picked up the fallen hand and stuck it to her wrist which had stopped bleeding and started to heal over at first she placed it backward but she corrected that im mediately ill walk she decided i cant ride while holding this together it wont take long to reattach but it will be weak for an hour or so i advised her so i guided the mare up the ramp carefully while threnody walked behind holding my hand the walk became slightly nervous business at the height but the knightmare was surefooted and we reached the gate without misstep that was just as well the assembled knights watched us with their empty faces still making no move to stop us those hollow men are eerie threnody muttered i dismounted and took the key to the lock it worked and the gate swung open we moved through then i re turned to lock the gate behind us flung the key through so that it dropped to the arena below after all it belonged to the knights and we had no intention of returning we stood in a pleasant open forest of mixed types of treesbeeches sandalwoods and other shore types which indicated there was a lake nearby there were a number of fruit and nut trees we could travel through this very comfortably well ghost horse i said youre on your own now the mare looked at me she rattled her chains inquir ingly youre free i said go romp through the wilder ness she just stood there and gazed at me from beneath long equine lashes she had lovely dark eyes even for a horse though her coat was light she doesnt understand threnody said wiggling the fingers of her left hand which was now firmly attached and improving rapidly then she removed her bovine mask nonsense i said pook understands every word i say im sure peek does too peek look at her eyes indeed the mare was peeking soulfully at us whoever says animals dont have souls is crazy shes peeking threnody agreed maybe she does crewel lye understand but she may be tame she could have been raised in captivity by the knights shes a knightmare you know pook could still be waiting for us among the artistrees i said realizing peeks a ghost mare do you think you women are always matchmaking she said and you men are always trying to avoid commit ment i retorted then we both laughed to the mares confusion so we decided to take peek back to the artisforest to meet pook after that it would be up to them if peek was nervous about going out alone pook could guide her i reduced myself to normal size returned my head to human and dissipated my extra mass peek watched all this with equine astonishment then we found a toga tree that enabled us to cover our immodesty with togas i took a blue one and threnody a red one peek shook her head knowing we had the colors reversed even animals knew that blue was for boys and red for girls i patted her neck its complicated to explain i said i rode peek north while threnody walked her big barbarian body could keep the pace much better than my feminine one could soon we reached the dead treeand there was pook faithfully waiting he gave a glad neigh as he spied usthen did a double take as he spied peek i introduced them pook this is peek she helped us escape the underworld peek this is pook my friend the two ghost horses sniffed noses cautiously they rattled their chains making a kind of music together they decided they liked each other if only it were that easy for human folk threnody said somewhat wistfully if you two want to trot elsewhere youre welcome i told pook peeks not sure shes ready for the wilder ness but you can show her the two nickered at each other and decided to stay does that mean we can both ride i asked pleased it turned out that it did so i took pook and threnody rode peek and we bore crewel lye south in the evening we stopped and foraged and grazed as the case might be hey look at this threnody called i went over it was a bush covered with bright disks of glass each disk slightly curved they were too small for mirrors i picked a disk and held it to my right eye to see it betterand it jumped out of my hand and plunked itself against my eyeball startled i stepped back but the glass hadnt harmed me it just covered the front of my eyeball so that i had to look through it the surprising thing was that my vision seemed clearer through that eye than through the other the focus was sharper and the colors better defined its a visionimprover i ex claimed oh ive heard of them she said theyre called contact lenses because they make close contact when your sight gets old and fuzzy you wear a couple of these and they bring it up to snuff well have to remember where this optical bush is its valuable i pried the lens off my eyeball i guess its all right but i dont need it threnody peered over the bush whats that on the other side she asked i walked around the bush toward it threnody close on my heels some sort of doll or figurine the black doll flashed and suddenly i was drifting out of my body hovering and homing in on the brute barbarian body beside me i dropped into it dizzy the evil spell i cried with big crude lips it was set here to intercept usbut were already exchanged so it just switched us back threnody patted herself making sure so it did she said pleased then she looked at me now we dont need each other any more i felt a sinking sensation you mean youre going to start running again she considered you know if i rode peek i could probably get home all right during our underground odyssey i had tended to for get that we were enemies now i perceived the kind of trap this could be i acted instantly my barbarian reflexes crewel lye serving me well pook peek i cried running toward the grazing horses my big male muscles gave me more speed than threnody had now weve changed back dont do anything threnody says pook looked at me uncertainly and it was evident that peek had no notion what i was talking about remember how we met i said to pook how you tried to scare me at night and i circled around you and you thought i was still at my camp and pook interrupted me with a neigh he understood well as long as we were in the wrong bodies thren ody and i couldnt separate i said we had to coop erate just to survive but now were back in our own bodies and she can flee me she wants to ride peek back to her home dont take us anywhere but south toward castle roogna can you tell peek that so she under stands pook nodded he would take care of it i relaxed i had acted in time i still did have my mission to complete after all threnody came up behind me well you certainly fixed that barbarian she said severely you dont trust me at all do you barbarians are ignorant not stupid i replied stung it was getting dark now she accompanied me to the fern bed we had fashioned in the radiating branches of a treehouse tree you will want to hold onto me again to be sure i dont flee in the night i dont you cant afford to trust me but i trust you and she curled up next to me ready for sleep somehow i didnt feel at ease but i didnt seem to have much choice in the matter so i comported myself for sleep this night was cooler than the others had been ive gotten used to your larger mass threnody murmured im cold in this little body you can make it bigger i reminded her that takes too long you can have my cloak i offered removing my red crewel lye toga and spreading it out now its color was wrong as it was truly being used by a male id fetch another in the morning well share she decided she removed her own gar ment arranged the two togas as blankets and nestled right up next to me i lay stiffly awake for some time wondering exactly how smart i was did i even want to deliver her to castle roogna now so another man could marry her naturally i had no interest in her myself or did i why did things have to be so complicated with human beings why couldnt we as threnody had remarked just sniff noses rattle chains and be satisfied yet if we were not what we were creatures with at least the awareness of purpose and honor what would we be empty knights in armor seeming so strong on the outside yet hollow inside who was i to deny the human condition with all its problems of awareness if i werent on a mission you wouldnt be safe a moment i muttered at her soft warm shapely breath ing sleeping body i know she whispered stretched electrically against me and returned to sleep a pox on women chapter idiocy in the morning we donned new togas of the cor rect colors foraged for more food mounted and rode south again i knew we were getting reasonably close to castle roogna i would be sorry to have this mission end i hoped threnody would never know how close she had come to diverting me from it but if she had had occasion crewel lye to comprehend the male viewpoint i had similarly ex perienced the female position i knew her body well i had been in it literally i refused to take advantage of it peek grew nervous as we progressed and finally balked i was riding pook and we stopped beside her whats the matter with her i asked concerned she was such a nice horse and had been quite docile till now pook whinnied at her then listened to her reply he tensed some danger ahead i asked she knows this region a monster threnody asked i can change form until she indicates that it matches whatever monster shes thinking of that way we can identify it precisely at an hour a change i asked that could take for ever do you have a better way yes and i proceeded to name monsters for the horses quickly we eliminated dragon griffin sphinx tarasque goblin callicantzari sea monster and harpy i was beginning to fish for other notions when threnody put in one basilisk she said peek nodded emphatically further questioning turned up the news that it wasnt just one basilisk whose gaze would kill people it was a whole colony of them this was in fact the land of the basks where cockatrices henatrices and chickatrices congregated for regular staring tournaments this was no safe region for any other creature but we have to pass it to reach castle roogna i said can we circle around the bask territory it turned out that we couldnt the mountains and sands combined to make this the only feasible route south but there was a way to pass through it at night the basks slept and if the two horses galloped through then they could clear the region by daybreak then it would be an easy ride to castle roogna good i said relieved well rest here then set off at nightfall i set off foraging again as this body liked to eat well crewel lye i spied a spaghetti tree with the edible strands hanging down in tempting masses i grabbed a hankand discovered hanging behind it a black eyequeue vine oops i said drawing hastily away but of course i couldnt escape it the vine flashed and suddenly i was so stupid i could hardly figure out what i was doing i stumbled back to the camp dragging the hank of spaghetti strands behind mewhats the matter jor dan threnody asked perceiving that something was wrong duh i replied what duh i repeated firmly i was stupid but she was not those bad spellsyou mentioned one for idiocy did that one strike i nodded stupidly had i been smarter i could have anticipated her thought processes but i was dull in fact i was about as unin telligent as a barbarian gets which is pretty un i think she said slowly that considering your con dition it is now too dangerous to proceed south through bask territory one of those cocks or hens might wake up and wipe us all out dont you agree jordan yuh i said happy to go along with superior rea soning pooks ears flattened back he was not stupid and he was not going to go along peek stood with him following his lead i think we should go north instead threnody con tinued carefully it is so much safer traveling a familiar route yuh i agreed it was a good thing she was still smart then we can go around to the north and avoid both the basks and the sands and reach castle roogna safely she said this will take a little longer but its so much more certain dont you agree jordan yuh i agreed again it was so nice of her to consult crewel lye me like this something nagged at my sodden brain but i couldnt quite figure out what it was so ignored it well rest here tonight and ill take good care of you and in the morning youll just tell the horses to carry us north wont you she asked persuasively yuh pook looked ready to kick someone maybe me i couldnt think why because that business about going south nomatter what doesnt apply any more does it you know better now yuh i said a little uncertainly she smiled she was awfully pretty when she did that youve been struck by the idiocy spell so i realize its a little hard for you to figure out right now but well sleep on it and im sure youll be satisfied by morning pook snorted with absolute disgust and stomped away i heard him neighing something to peek they were trying to figure out what to do evidently pook didnt want to listen to what i would be telling him in the morning strange animal then threnody took me by the hand and led me to our niche for the night and she was so lovely that i knew she must be right we settled down in that bower and she arranged the togas over us as blankets and crooned a lovely little mel ody and got very close to me she was all sleek and soft and warm the shape of mans desire in fact i have an even better idea she murmured in my ear her breath like a playful summer breezelet ticklish and nice lets go back to my house together huh i asked perplexed you dont really want to turn me over to some ma gician at castle roogna do you she urged convincingly i didnt follow all her reasoning but her bare body was so smooth and special against mine and i realized how nice it would be to do whatever she had in mind some things do not require a great deal of intelligence nuh i agreed crewel lye she moved against me and i hugged her to me be ginning to get a glimmer of what we could then there was a fluttering in the forest and something white showed it came right up to usa big longbilled bird in fact it was a stork a stork threnody exclaimed shaken she drew away from me as if i had become a monster i hadnt thought of that i reached for her again but for some reason the sight of the stork had turned her off and she shrank away from me women can be very funny about irrelevant things the stork landed beside us and closed its wings im looking for jordan the barbarian it said for him threnody squeaked you birds never bring your bundles to men then she turned thoughtful though it might be a good thing if you did after all fair is fair the stork ignored her bureaucratic creatures seldom concern themselves with fairness it turned to me jor dan yuh i answered i am investigating a recent event it seems that one of our number was lost during a mission and we are uncertain whether his bundle was properly delivered you have been implicated do you care to testify something about that last word sounded dirty to me to what to clarify what happened just north of thewherever it was oh i was stupid but i remembered the episode ogre i said the stork lifted a free feather and perused its lines closely yes that was an octogre delivery what hap pened to the stork dragon i said chomp injured wingno fly more the bird used the tip of his bill to make a mark on the feather that corroborates what we concluded what happened to the bundle i concentrated and some of my wit returned de livered i said crewel lye crewel lye the stork elevated one eyebrow i hadnt realized be fore then that they had eyebrows you delivered it yuh ogret he made another note on the feather highly irreg ular ill say threnody put in whoever heard of a man delivering a baby had to be done i said defensively the stork put away his feather to be sure and what was the fate of the injured stork eaten i said the bird straightened up and half spread his wings you what not me nother dragon oh the stork relaxed making another note un able to fly fell prey to dragon he glanced up it is after all hazardous duty we get flight pay just so long as the bundle was safely delivered yuh thank you that will be all the stork spread his wings then paused it is our policy to reward those who render useful service would you like a no threnody cried alarmed the stork made another note reward of lucky feather declined he muttered speaking to himself then he spread his wings again and took off you cost me lucky feather i accused threnody she ignored this you are on intimate terms with storks she demanded yuh it was too complicated to explain in detail now you i reached for her she jerked away dont you touch me she screeched huh not while there are storks in the neighborhood i didnt grasp her objection but did grasp that she had changed her mind disappointed i lay back women can be awfully hard to understand in the morning the horses were gone pook had left the bag with the remaining spells so i knew he wasnt coming back stupid as i was i still understood why because he knew i was going to ask him and peek to take us north i couldnt figure out why it was so bad to go north since threnody had explained the reason so sen sibly but pook wouldnt go that way so he had left therefore we couldnt go north either he had been free to leave us anytime but had chosen this time because of our irreconcilable difference of opinion about direction i was really sorry to lose him yet couldnt blame him sometimes the best thing a friend can do is to refuse to help a friendgonewrong not that i had gone wrong butwell anyway it was too bad then i had a notion spells i exclaimed but they dont work right threnody said evidently nervous about another foulup like the exchange of iden tities maybe help anyway i said with foolish eagerness i pawed through the mostly empty bag and fished out the little white skull life i said life you mean itit restores someone who has died you dont need that i wasnt smart but my memory remained good mixed up this not life ohyou mean it has to be some other spellone that may help us travel yuh then before i could become confused i said invoke the skull glowedand expanded a ridge appeared that circled around the staring face this projected out until it formed a fullsized shield while the face flattened into a picture of itself on the surface of that shield the back of the skull became the apparatus by which the shield could be comfortably supported on the left arm say i exclaimed pleased nice shield if we had needed a shield threnody said curtly we could have taken the knights shield how does this help us travel but i remained delighted with this acquisition i had never had a shield of my own before because barbarians are too primitive to understand a shields proper use crewel lye however my experiences with flameshooting dragons and lancebearing knights had provided me with an ink ling sometimes defense was a good thing even for a barbarian or so i supposed now that i was stupid i put the shield on my arm and postured with it slicing the air with my sword we now had two swords since we had recovered my own from near the dead tree as well as saving the knights take that i exclaimed striking at an imaginary foe and that then i lifted the shield as if warding off an enemy blow nyaa nyaa you cant get me some toy threnody muttered disgusted women dont understand about war games but they sure are fun for the youngofbrain in due course i settled down and we came to grips with the problem of traveling i suppose well have to walk threnody said unthrilled but it will take us a couple of days and ill be footsore damn those horses yuh i agreed amicably she focused on me you wont stay stupid forever she said these spells wear off after a few days dont they yuh i said some do a man does have his uses she said to herself as long as im single im vulnerable on one level or another the only way to finish this nuisance for good is to marry an amiable man not too bright then she looked up as if becoming aware of me very wellill carry you at least that will get us there huh ill change into a dollarpede she decided thats a hundred times the size of a centipede but not vicious like the nickel or dimepedes because it doesnt have any metal pincers a doilarpede has no metal backbone so it has been losing strength for decades its a helpless form subject to the whims of whoever handles it youll have to protect me with your sword and shield helpless dollarpedes just seem to keep getting devalued by everything else they encounter she said until finally crewel lye they look as big as ever but theyre hardly worth anything at all maybe thats because theyre made mostly of pa per paper i was stupid but even to me that sounded funny some of them have silver support she said those ones are stronger but theyre very rare ill become one of that kind yuh i agreed reassured of course it took time first she changed her form after cautioning me to keep a sharp eye out for predators as she was most vulnerable while changing everybody grabs for dollarpedes had i been smarter i would have realized that that was the main reason she needed me right now if she had been able to change safely when alone in the jungle she could have deserted me and headed directly for home so she had to take me along my brain wasnt worth much now but my body and sword and shield were but of course she didnt tell me that she told me she liked me and wanted my companionship its an old ploy women use on men and i being stupid believed her though even now i wonder what she could have meant by that remark about marrying an amiable nottoobright man certainly she didnt mean magician yin and events were to prove that she didnt mean me but as i have said even when i have been smart i havent really under stood women in an hour she was in the form of the dollarpede with the mass of a person then she worked on her size ex panding up to a creature so large it could carry me except that she was now too diffuse to support my weight since her mass had not changed in the third hour she increased her mass until finally there she stood before me completea creature with fifty pairs of legs dull green in hue on one side gray on the other with all sorts of print and numbers on it the face was gray and looked a little like that of a sphinx while the backside resembled a bird waxing amorous with a shield overall the thing did seem sort of papery with corrugations supporting crewel lye each set of legs but the silver backbone gave it strength to support me i mounted and stacked the spellbag and extra sword behind me this was the strangest creature i had ridden but of course most of my prior experience had been with pook if this dollarpede could do the job all right the creature started moving this was interesting first the number one set of legs stepped forward quickly fol lowed by the number two set followed in turn by number three and so on down the line in a ripple there was a gentle sway as the ripple passed under me and proceeded to the tail then it bounced back and swayed me forward it was a little like riding an ocean swellwhich was an interesting thought since i had never been to the ocean swell or awful threnodydollarpede flowed over the irregularities in the landscape picking up speed soon she was traveling as fast as a galloping ghost horse and i was feeling seasick from all the swaying but we were making excellent time around noon a shadow descended i looked up and saw a great bird circling it was a roc and it looked hungryand the dollarpede was about the right size for a snack get under cover i cried needing no special intelligence to recognize danger like this threnody scooted for a nearby fallen tree hoping to conceal herself under it i dismounted drew my sword and held my shield firmly before me i stood beside the fallen tree facing out while threnody tried to get her length squeezed under it but it seemed that a dollarpede was very hard to hide from an alert predator the roc quickly corrected course and descended phew those birds are huge i keep for getting how big they are until i encounter another the giant wings covered all the sky and the monstrous talons came toward me likelike a rocs talons there isnt anything else to compare them to i had fought a roc before and knew we were over matched but a barbarian warrior doesnt question the odds he just fights on especially when hes stupid so crewel lye as that foot came at me i held up my shield and swung with my sword my sword connected cutting off the end of the claw blood gushed out and a few seconds later when the sensation reached the rocs head there was an ear dazzling squawk that shook the clouds in their orbits now i had the rocs attentionand a baleful attention it was the foot retreated one claw snagging in a small palmtree and ripping it out fingers toes and all the birds head came down the eyes peering at me the beak pecked at me and it was the size of the snout of a good sized dragon i was finished now but my shield came up and blocked the beak i thought the impact of the beak against the shield would break my arm and knock me over and maybe drive the shield deep into the ground but there was no recoil at all odd the roc squawked again and such was the blast of air that the nearby saplings bent and their sap squirted out and the fallen tree rolled a turn or two back exposing the dollarpede the roc peered at me again straight down from above and i knew i would be squished like a bug and perhaps spitted on bedrock below there was fire in those little roc orbs my shield came up once more and this time i knew i wasnt doing it the thing was shifting itself hauling my arm along with it it stopped over my head horizontal blocking that plummeting beak the beak struck with a colossal clangand i felt no shock but the bird bounced off as if rejected by a stone mountain its beak dented i was slowwitted but now at last the truth managed to wedge itself through my brainthis was the magic of the shield it was intended to combat the magic sword but it wasnt smart enough to distinguish between types of attack so it fended off whatever came at it self powered it absorbed the fud thrust transmitting no shock to me as long as i held this shield i could not be suc cessfully attacked the big bird its beak bashed came to a similar con clusion it backed off spread its wings and launched itself crewel lye into the air the downdraft flattened the nearby bushes and tore a branch from an acom tree the branch thudded into the ground and acoms peppered us like hailstones but my shield protected me against those too threnody crawled out somewhat bedraggled her pap ery body did not stand up well to such high winds and i dreaded to think what rain might do to it she was unable to speak in this form but i was sure she was pleased not to have been gobbled by the roc i remounted and we proceeded on north we stopped in midafternoon back at the copse ofartis trees perhaps it was fitting that i brought the magic shield back here to where the magic sword had attacked me still as my stupidity gradually abatedmaybe my talent was healing my brain of this malady tooi became in creasingly uneasy about the direction of our travel castle roogna after all was the opposite way it took threnody three hours to change back to her normal form first she went diffuse then she sank to human size and finally she changed to human shape im famished she exclaimed why not eat in dollarpede form i asked concen trating so as to formulate my question properly as it was hard to handle full sentences in my present state of mind why so much trouble to change back my you are improving she remarked not entirely pleased youre not half as stupid as you were last night i know i agreed dully satisfied she certainly was pretty in this form had i been smarter it might have occurred to me that since she could control her form she naturally made sure it was a good form what woman given the opportunity to make herself more attractive would fail to exercise that power i will answer your question she said if i remained in dollarpede form and mass i would have to feed that massand that would require a lot more food than my natural body does also dollarpedes feed on things like principal and interest and assets and liabilities and bud gets since there arent any of those around here this one would have to make do with bugs and moldy twigs and crewel lye things and i dont happen to like such food much so i change back to human form so i can eat human food which i do prefer i didnt know what an asset was but i could see why she wouldnt want to eat one but but how can a human meal feed the mass of a dol larpede because i only have to feed the form im in when eating if i shrank to gnat size i could feed myself on a gnat meal then return to human size and not be hungry but that would take three more hours and id be vul nerable all the time any bird could come by and swallow me when i was in gnat form and that would be the end of me so i dont like to go to the small sizes and my own form seems to be the best compromise all that was a bit more explanation than i could assim ilate at my present level of intelligence i merely smiled and nodded acquiescently it was evident that threnody did know what she was doing besides why should i question such an excruciatingly beautiful woman so what if she had used her talent to reshape herself it was a lovely shaping she hardly had to work at fooling me i was eager to fool myself so we foraged and ate then removed ourselves from the immediate vicinity of the dead tree with the gnomes entrance and made camp for the night once again thren ody cuddled up to me after glancing around to make sure there was no stork nearby uh i said trying to organize my thought we should go south there is another reason to go north she said quickly it was almost as if she had expected me to remember my mission and have a second thought about our direction of travel as my intelligence increased you said the en emy spells have been placed along your route so that when you go where youre going you walk into them yes i agreed she had a good grasp of the situation and most of those evil spells are a whole lot of trou ble she continued like the black sword and the per sonality exchangei realize that was the good spell that crewel lye hit us but it was the same as the evil spelland the idiocy yes well if you dont go where youre going you wont encounter the spells laid out along your route will you huh if we go to castle roogna straight south the next spell is sitting there somewhere in our path waiting for you to meet it probably in the middle of the bask terri tory so well really be in trouble but if you dont go there you wont walk into that spell that makes this a better route doesnt it say yes i agreed brightening i was still too dull to figure out the predestination angle but how do we get to castle roogna going north she smiled in the dusk we go around the quicksand desert to the north then turn south and proceed without further trouble thats nice i said reassured still she added as if musingly it would be just as easy to turn west and return to my house then you and i could stay together forever it seemed to me that she had said something like that the night before but we had been interrupted by the stork tonight i was a trifle smarter but what about my mis sion i asked let me show you how it can be with us she said then you can decide about the mission well uh i said uncertainly torn between loyalty and her beauty she wriggled and her bare body came up against mine she put her lovely face to mine for a kiss the conscious ness of my mission faded i enfolded her in my arms and there was a noise threnody stiffened someones near she whispered alarmed i felt for my sword and shield in the darkness in a moment i located the direction the sound was in the area of the gnometree the gnobody gnomes i whispered out hunting crewel lye ive seen enough of them to last me a lifetime she said ill go out and slay them with my sword and shield in my own body it will be easy dont be stupid that wont but i am stupid i protested she chuckled so you are at the moment but trust me jordan we dont need to attack the gnomes theyre only out foraging for food and supplies not looking for us and theyre not such bad folk if we kill the men the gnomides will suffer all we have to do is lie quiet and theyll pass us by we lay quiet though i wondered how folk who put strangers in the smoking pot could be considered not bad but i was not smart enough to figure that out so i was still and she was right the gnomes moved on by and never knew we were there but we had to bide some time and in due course i fell asleep whatever it was that threnody might have had in mind did not come to pass between us that night the gnomes had saved me from what in the morning we ate again threnody converted to the dollarpede form and we moved north in the after noon we came to a huge chasm that neither of us remem bered that was odd because it was far too big to be ignored we stopped and threnody changed while i for aged and ate and made a hut from stray timbers in the sky to the south we saw huge shapes wheeling we knew that the rocs were angry and were searching for us we cant stay here and we cant go south again threnody said you fought valiantly to save me from the big bird yesterday and i am duly grateful but if a whole flock of them comes upon us well be finished but where can we go i asked bewildered i will assume another form one that can traverse that chasm she said ill start early so ill be ready by dawn and will carry you with me only yuh i asked im not certain which way to go crewel lye i was yet smarter than before to the east so then we can go south to castle roogna she sighed yes of course but i dont want to go to castle roogna i want to go homewhich means turning west oh i said disappointed well goodbye then she settled down next to me in our shelter jordan i need you with me the episode of the roc shows that youre powerful and brave and youre a good guyeven when youre stupid and i think you need me with you too for my talent complements yours we must travel together and i dont want to have an argument about the direction at the brink of that chasm with the rocs closing in on us yes i agreed i could see how that would be awk ward and she was so absolutely beautiful in the waning light that i could not take my eyes off her but you want to go to castle roogna and i want to go home we have a fundamental conflict i must complete my mission i said realizing that it had been an error to say goodbye to her i couldnt let her go is therfe no way i can persuade you to come with me she asked but i was still stupid enough to hang onto my mission i must take you to castle roogna or die in the attempt i said like the stork i must deliver even though you can be with me forever possessing all that i have to offer if you come with me now she asked nudging closer even though you will lose me to magician yin if you take me to castle roogna and the castle itself will fall i felt miserable and every bit as stupid as i was yes you are too damn incorruptible for your own good barbarian yes she turned her face away for a moment then she turned back you are the man i want to marry jordan not magician yin you are bold and strong and honest crewel lye and nice while he is more devious than you can grasp please please come with me now she had spoken openly of marriage between us temptation took me like the wind from a storm she was all that i ever wanted in a womanor so i thought at the timeyet i could not see my way clear to do what she asked i was no thiefnot even of love i did not answer i will show you she said almost savagely she half way flung herself on me and hugged me to her and kissed me and stroked me i had occupied her body and knew the difference in attitude between man and woman but now she was as aggressive as a man and i like the idiot i was did not think to ask why or to reflect on the unnaturalness of her attitude scarcely any woman flings herself on a man she doesnt plan to marry but because i was stupid and she had timed her effort with that stupidity in mind i lacked the proper suspicion i was overwhelmed by her urgency i reacted as she intended me to and i knew that i loved her ab solutely and eternally whatever else might come greater folly has no man than this early in the morning before dawn she woke me jor dan i must begin my change she said i love you do you love me i was smarter than i had beenbut that no longer mattered yes i said will you come with me my heart felt as if it were cracking in two no there is no way i can turn you from the course you have set no she sighed then i must go with you though it be disaster for us both so i had won why did i feel so miserable she proceeded to change stage by stage and three hours later as dawn peeked shyly into the gloomy chasm she was ready she had become a giant snail with a shell the size of a small house i climbed up on the shell keeping the shield and the crewel lye crewel lye two swords tied to me and took firm hold of the corru gations the bag with the few remaining spells dangled from my waist nothing could dislodge mei hoped the snail crawled forward toward the chasm it quested along the lip until it found a rounded part then slid over that and down onto the face of the cliff itself now i had to hold on tight the depth of the chasm yawned beneath us awesomely if i fell i would be smashed to death on the rock belowand this time had no ghost horse to scrape up the pieces if threnodys sticky under surface became unstuck she too would fallwith no hope at all of revival i could understand why she did not want any arguments about direction at this stage i be came nervous but her surface held and we slid slowly down into the chasm and east along its face if she had decided to turn about and go west i could not have stopped her but she had agreed to go east and she was doing it i knew now that i had never had any chance to bring this creature to castle roogna without her acquiescence she had used love to persuade me to go her way instead it had per suaded her to go my way or so i believed then in my idiocy i heard a noise and looked down far below i saw a huge sixlegged dragon pacing us evidently hoping we would fall it was so eager for our flesh that puffs of steam drifted up from it then i heard another noise and looked upand saw a little roc the big birds had found us at last the roc swooped down and i knew doom was upon us for even a little roc is a giant creature i hated being helpless before this predator i felt the way i had when i occupied threnodys body and faced the griffin something nagged the slow molasses of my brain didnt griffins and rocs have something in common some weak ness or at least some kind of fmickiness how had i stopped the griffin desperation once again lent me a stupid kind of genius yuck i cried making a grotesque face rocs were big but their eyesight and hearing were excellent this snail tastes awful gunky putrid its just a shell full of pus it was a little roc did it understand what i was saying would it be fooled a mature one might be too canny but the roc veered off the wind from its wings almost tearing us off the wall we clung sliding down help lesslyand the bird departed my ploy had worked some snails did taste bad so maybe the roc had been ready to believe actually those birds being rocheaded werent the smartest creatures in xanth but a young roc surely tried eating anything that moved at first so had many bad experiences and would be eager to avoid more of them maybe this one had once gulped a shell full of pus threnody managed to skid to a halt on the wall then continued her slow slide to the east and in due course she crossed over the lip of the chasm and onto level land the quicksand was behind now we could safely proceed south i let go of the shell but my arms were locked into position from the long clutch and had to be unkinked joint by joint threnody was so tired she just slumped in her shell but we had made it ahead had i but known was the cruel lie chapter cruel lie after a while threnody changed back to her human form looking somewhat wasted i fetched her food and water and she kissed me and we rested there a time just appreciating each others company a shell full of pus she asked wryly well it worked i said embarrassed crewel lye i would never have forgiven you if it hadnt worked she said well lets get moving again but you are tired let me carry you now change to something small she smiled ill simply diffuse that will take less time she did so when she was smokythin looking indeed like the demoness she derived from she put her vaporous arms around me and i marched south carrying her along with me without effort when a passing wyvem thought to take a bite of us threnody simply floated up and breathed booo and the poor creature took off as if it had seen a ghost i wasnt worried anyway my sword and shield and stupiditythe three ss as threnody put itmade me practically invulnerable to attack but it was true that our two talents complemented each other making safe travel possible and easy we were a good team we made excellent progress that day and camped for the night not far from castle roogna threnody densified resuming her natural and lovely solidity and embraced me this may be our last night together jordan she said soberly we must tell magician yin what we feel i said maybe he wont want to marry you then some men are very choosy about winning a ladys love for themselves that thought had crossed my mind she confessed when you deliver me there yin will win and be he next king of xanth and surely he will be good for the land but if he rejects me and sends me away the castle will not fall and i can be yours but but i asked the plan seemed quite feasible to me but there is also yang she said reluctantly yang is evil he cares nothing for anything decent including the fact that i now belong to another man he might choose to take me for that reason but you dont want to go with yang i protested jordan i may not have much choice she kissed me again lingeringly you have seen the power of his spells no ordinary person can stand against the power of a ma gician good or evil thats why a magician is always king crewel lye if you bring me near castle roogna but not all the way there then yang will win and be king and he more than yin may want the aspect of legitimacy conferred by mar riage to the daughter of the prior king sometimes the least worthy folk crave legitimacy the most i will no longer be able to threaten to throw myself into thethe whatever i will not be able to escape she took me by the hand and gazed into my eyes but whatever happens jordan remember that i love you and i love you i said then she began singing in her low sad way and her voice was so eerily beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes as i listened to her it seemed that some terrible tragedy was in the offing but i was too dull to grasp what that could be or to wonder how she could know what was to come im sorry i did not let you bring your lute i told her she paused to put her fair hand on mine i forgive you jordan there were tears in her eyes too in the morning we set out for castle roogna on foot as we were it was not that far and threnody wanted there to be no doubt about her identity so that there could be no misunderstanding as to the success of my mission we held hands and it was a sad rather than a joyous occasion but what could i do a good barbarian always completes his mission we saw the highest spire of the old castle poking above the trees to the south threnody paused to kiss me i love you jordan she said again i total fool believed her yet even now seeing it in the picture of the tapestry i find it hard to believe that she could have been false everything about her signaled the sorrow of love about to be lost almost i wishbut of course i am not now the idiot i was then experience has been an exceedingly cruel teacher we came to the ring of gnarled old trees surrounding the castle they still didnt like me branches descended to bar our progress i drew my sword i told you before crewel lye trees that id lop off any branch opposing me i said i have to deliver this object to the castle and that i shall do now clear the way but this time they did not yield the right of way angry i hacked at the branches making good my threat and the afflicted trees groaned woodenly with the pain and dripped colored sap but still would not give over they were stupidly loyal to their perceived cause as was i they know threnody said they remember the curse of my return they dont care who is to be king of xanth they merely protect the castle from ruin jordan believe me only tragedy can come of this delivery i promised to deliver you and i will i grunted hack ing away she shook her head with resignation if only your loyalty were rightly fixed what a hero you would be i didnt know what she meant by that so i ignored it forcing a way through the trees took time but i was barbarianishly determined and i cleared a channel through the resistant forest we emerged to the inner orchard with its marvelous array of fruits and nuts i was hungry after my exertion so i reached for a big red appleand it jerked away i blinked then reached for anotherand it too avoided me now this is pushing it i snapped not so dull as not to realize i was being snubbed im going to have some fruit or do some cutting here i walked around the tree stalking the evasive fruit a cherry dropped near me from a neighboring cherry tree the thing exploded as it touched the ground blasting dirt at my legs i jumped awayand almost collided with a pineapple tree look out threnody cried a pineapple dropped but i managed to reach out and catch it and hurl it away before it detonated the explo sion shook the orchard and fruits dropped all around us several more cherries went off around me but my shield alertly blocked off the shrapnel of juice and cherry pits they know threnody repeated i shook my sword at the cherry tree but dared not try to chop it down because the cherries would have blown crewel lye me to bits in mundania it may be possible to chop down cherry trees but not in xanth and as for pineapples i have heard but naturally do not believe that they dont even grow on trees in mundania they supposedly grow directly from the ground one pineapple to a plant lu dicrous next thing well be expected to believe is that mundane cherries and pineapples dont explode we went on to the plain surrounding the castle there stood a truly motley assembly dozens of zombies dirt sifted from their sodden shoulders showing that they had recently disinterred themselves gobbets of rotten flesh festooned their spindly bones each skull stared out with maggoty sockets the zombies rise when castle roogna is threatened threnody said they know that the moment i set foot in the castle it will fall i remember when i was a girl a rogue dragon came and the zombies marched against it the creature was covered with slime and rot before it gave up the attempt are you sure you want to i have a mission i said sullenly i may have men tioned the oinkheadedness of barbarians particularly stu pid ones i drew my sword and held my magic shield high and marched into the awful throng the zombies were no cowards ill say that for them they threw themselves on me as if not caring for their own lives at all my shield moved about fending them off and my sword hacked off arms legs and heads with abandon pieces of zombie soon littered the landscape threnody had to use the almost empty bag of spells to shield herself from flying rot for some reason she didnt seem to like getting it in her hair or down her front or in her slippers women do tend to be fussy at times finally the last of the zombies had been cut to grotesque pieces and the way was clear to the castle i took threnody by the hand and led her onward she remained reluctant but did not resist we came to the moat the drawbridge was up and the moat monsters were on full alert in contrast to their prior attitude well i had fought monsters before i needed to get that drawbridge lowered so threnody crewel lye crewel lye could cross i wasnt going to drag her through the moat then she would be at castle roogna and my mission would be successfully accomplished despite all yangs machinations then and only then could i relax perhaps i would recover threnody perhaps not either way it would be done wait here i told her then i jumped down into the moat naturally the nearest monster pounced on me its huge fangs spearing for my head my shield hefted up to intercept the strike and the fangs clamped down onto it there the monsters maw froze two fangs projecting down inside the shield drip ping saliva while the eyes of the monster stared at me startled i lifted my trusty sword and brought the blade down cutting off the end of the snout including the fangs the monster gave a squeal of pain and jerked back blood and spittle flying i suspect it was none too pleased mon sterfighting can be a messy business at times look monster i said ive got a job to do same as you do im crossing this moat and letting down the drawbridge im a barbarian warrior none too smart at the moment and cutting up monsters is my profession either you can let me operate in peace or you can get yourself hacked to pieces its your choice and i waded on across the clogged waterway without waiting for the monsters response thats the way you have to deal with monstersfirmly and fairly the monster considered it was an old one long past its prime unable to mount the savagery of its youth and id given it a painful wound it probably hadnt gulped down a maiden in years by the time it decided to attack again i was across i climbed to the drawbridge mechanism no one was there this castle no longer had human guards which was part of its problem there was only so much that trees and zombies and monsters could do without competent human support modern battle is an integrated matter each aspect dependent on the others had the human element been present i would not have been able to storm castle roogna an edifice that had withstood attack for four hundred years when magician yin became king surely he would upgrade the defenses assuming the castle was still standing i cranked the chain and lowered the bridge until it fell into place with a heavy thunk i walked out on it now you can cross i called to threnody she approached reluctantly and i went to meet her just this short distance across the moat and it would be done maybe it will count if i dont actually get off the bridge and touch the castle itself threnody said if my father the king sees that you have completed your mission maybe so i agreed i really didnt want castle roogna to fall threnody paused picking up something at the edge of the planking whats this she asked it looks like i reached for it it was a small black ball as i took it in my hand i saw its other side there were two squarish sockets and a grinning set of teeth thats the black skull i exclaimed trying to throw it away too late the evil skull flashedand i fell dead jordan threnody cried as i dropped from the edge of the bridge to the ground beyond the moat she tried to catch me but there was nothing she could do for me i was already deceased there was the counterspell in the bag but we didnt know which one that was and only i could invoke itand as a dead man i couldnt even do that the evil spell had operated much more rapidly than it was supposed to a figure appeared across the moat at the castle gate it was magician yin so you have come to me at last princess threnody he said the barbarian has done good service she stood frozen for a moment staring at him the mission is not yet complete she said but you can step right across and make it complete yin pointed out and castle roogna will fall she said disdainfully crewel lye crewel lye but your father wishes this union to be yin re minded her we can build another castle not like this one come lovely woman yin pleaded the ignorant barbarian has given his life to bring you this far would you cause that sacrifice to be in vain pah threnody exclaimed i am demonspawned i have no conscience all i want is to spare the castle where i grew up the one place where i was happy now i shall live my own life you would not let me do that once you have power magician yin ahso the maiden plans to run away with the bar barian when he revives had been alive then i would have been startled by that i had thought yin did not know about my talent but of course magicians tend to know more than they let on its part of their power hardly magician this oaf lives only to complete his missionto bring me to you yin i tried to seduce him away from that but the fool would not be swayed only by being rid of him can i be rid of you but you will never be rid of him princess since he can not be killed that was my little ace in the hole against yangs machinations so you might as well cross the moat and marry me i shall be rid of himand you she exclaimed i know how to keep the barbarian dead and she took my sword and struck at my body the magic shield tried to lift itself to block the attack but its spell was no longer new and i was dead so it couldnt do much in a moment she hacked off my shield arm and the shield was finished then she hacked off my other limbs and my head and cut my torso into two chunks i looked like a dismembered zombie except that there was a good deal more blood spread about this moron will never bother me again she gasped spearing my staring head on the point and carrying it into the orchard yin stood watching her go then you are determined not to let the barbarians mission be complete he called after her absolutely she called back as she disappeared among the fruit trees time passed then she returned to spear another chunk of my body and you refuse to cross over and marry me yin asked as if this were a routine matter you got it magician she agreed hauling the second chunk away in a different direction when she returned again yin asked despite the wishes of your dying father if my father knew the truth he would repent those wishes she marched away in a new direction with the third chunk next time she appeared yin asked dont you know that if i am not king my evil brother will be king in stead of course i know it she exclaimed what care i for your politics she took the fourth part of me away in a new direction when she returned yet again yin said dont you realize that if you do not marry me you must marry magician yang maybe yang wont want me but if he does he wont make me live at castle roogna she said spearing a fifth chunk and toting it away soon she was back again for the nexttothelast chunk what do you care for magician yang yin demanded threnody paused in her labor well if you want it straight i am demonspawn i prefer evil to goodand yang is evil she hauled the chunk away that isnt what you told the barbarian yin said when she returned for the final chunk i told the barbarian i was a liar that much was true she carried away the seventh piece of me when she returned yin tried yet once more the barbarian is finished but you could still cross over to me i ask you daughter of the king one last time oh stop this charade she exclaimed picking up my magic shield and dumping it into the moat then she tossed my sword in after it do you think i dont know your secret crewel lye secret princess that yin is merely the whitemagic side and yang the blackmagic side of the same person you are not contesting to see which magician shall be king you are deciding which facet of your personality will dominate since that decision turns out to be mine to make i am choosingand i choose yang come to me you evil creature for i shall not come to you the price of me is to turn your back forever on castle roogna then so i shall yin said he turned about his cloak flaringand as he turned his color changed and he be came the biackrobed yang he strode across the draw bridge and took threnodys hand you have done well evil creature he told her even to seducing the bar barian for you know i could not touch a pristine woman only yin could do that she agreed kissing him the placement of that last spell was beautiful the oaf never suspected the drawbridge itself thank you you realize of course that i was testing you i feared you might actually have some feeling for that barbarian though i know what a consummate actress you are so i arranged to i do have some feeling for him she said contempt he was a fool even before your idiocy spell hit him and there was another stroke of geniusmixing up yins spells even so it was uncomfortably close for the bar barian was the most oinkheadedly determined fool ive ever seen a close contest is more tantalizing yang said i knew i would win but for the sake of appearances i preferred the outcome to seem in doubt well evil magician you will be king now so take me away from here and do what you will with me i am king now your father died yesterday threnody stiffened if she had cared for anything at all it was for her father then i could have killed the barbarian last night and my father would not have known why did you torture me like that it is my nature yang said as it is yours together we have betrayed all that is decent in xanth crewel lye she smiled why so we have and now we shall neglect the interests of xanth com pletely letting castle roogna go to ruin in its own fashion i shall devote myself to grafting spells of every type and who knows what mischief they may do in the course of future centuries as they are discovered while you while i will assume whatever strange forms you wish for your sinister pleasure threnody finished together they walked away from the castle their cruel lie complete at last of course i was dead so i was no longer much con cerned with this but my ghost was present at the spot where i had died and my ghost was appalled at this evi dence of the betrayal of myself and xanth that threnody had wrought all the time she had been collaborating with the evil magician plotting to but the evil magician and the good magician were one and the same and threnody had known this and chosen the evil aspect to go with all the while playing up to me the ignorant barbarian fool when i had not failed to bring her back to castle roogna she had had to come into the open about it why had i been so blind why indeed they had chosen me for this very quality if my course for the mission had been predestined so had my course before it bringing me to castle roogna at precisely the time they needed such a fool how could a mere barbarian comprehend the intricacies of civilized treachery perhaps king gromden a good man had sus pected and tried to tell me but his illness had prevented him that very illness might have been sent by a spell from one of the aspirants to the throne since yinyang had free access to castle roogna it would have been better had i never entered the picture for i had been the unwitting tool of their treachery i as much as threnody was responsible for the demise of castle roogna as the center of the human government of xanth and for the centuries of the decline that followed how great was my guilt crewel lye but it was done and i was helpless to undo it all i could do was watch a few hours after my death pook and peek arrived on the scene pook came and sniffed the mostly empty bag of spells threnody had dropped on the bank of the moat and forgotten he knew i had been there and that i had been betrayed by the cruelestoflies he had tried to warn me to discourage me he had refused to aid me in my folly but i had pursued it anyway bewitched by foolish love and met my ordained fate now pook could do nothing he didnt know where evil threnody had bur ied my pieces and lacked the means to dig them up be sides nobody knew but her and she would never tell truly she had sealed my fate disconsolately pook picked up the limp bag of spells with his teeth craned his head around to tuck it in amidst his chains so that he could carry it as a memento then departed peek went with him sharing his melancholy with her beautiful moist brown eyes she was an animal she did not deceive or betray her companion the way a human woman could and so i was dead and dead i remained evil threnody had seen to that my ghost moved into castle roogna as that was the only building within range and ghosts do prefer a structure to haunt i met the other ghosts there and learned their sad stories one was millie the maid who had been killed by a jealous rival for the magician she loved the others each had his or her life history as tragic or ironic as mine oh we shared common heritage of folly and grief we ghosts of the castle and so we remained over the centuries while the castle stood idle for magician yang the evil aspect of the man indeed cared nothing for castle roogna or the welfare of xanth he moved back to his home village and made his nefarious spells for that was his chief entertainment in truth most of his spells were neutral for there is no real good or evil in a given spell only in its actual use does it become good or evil ail the spells and enchanted objects in xanth date from his reign including the magic weapons of the castle roogna arsenal made before he left some of those crewel lye spells like the forgetspeli on the gap chasm date from before his time yet he made them too i dont know how that was arranged he was a great magician but an evil man those spells proliferated and xanth declined be cause the spells were not used in any organized service of man they were just scattered about the kingdom whimsically to do what mischief they might in ignorant hands we ghosts had news of outside events only oc casionally when some traveling spook or wraith passed through we ourselves were unable to leave the castle premises so this is sketchy but in the course of cen turies we did catch up on the major items eventually magician yang diedbut the next king of xanth did not return to castle roogna to reign it seemed it had become fashionable for kings to remain in their home villages there was no longer a centralized govern ment in xanth the mundane waves washed freely over xanth it was the dark ageall because of threnodys cruel lie she had sought to preserve castle roogna from falling whatever the cost but it had fallen anyway fig urativelyand who is to say that was not the real nature of the curse yet perhaps she was not directly to blame for the evil times that came to all xanth for the tides of men are slow and subtle and answer to no isolated influences maybe xanth was doomed anyway and would have suffered some other calamity if not this one threnody had not chosen to be cursed or even to be delivered by the stork maybe it had really started with the demoness who had humiliated king gromden and succeeded in her mischief beyond her most infernal expectations still this does not excuse me i utter fool had helped threnody to do itby trusting her when i knew she was untrustworthy and loving her when i should have known that the spawn of a demon could not truly love in return whatever she might say she had done to me what her mother had done to her father and together they had ruined more lives than anyone can know my pain was all the greater because i had loved her however foolishly now it was hatebut still my emotion for her whether crewel lye positive or negative dominated my tenuous existence as a ghost i had been a fool in life i remained a fool in death but what was to be expected of a barbarian lout one thing came to bother me increasingly in my spirit existenceelsie the girl i had left behind in fen village i had promised to return to her when my adventure was doneand after i had learned the folly of loving demon spawn i would have been glad to settle down with a decent girl but i could not i was dead if i had known more of the true situation with magician yinyang and threnody i would have set her on the drawbridge said here you are cross or not as you see fit and departed for home to be with elsie a genuinely decent young woman who would never have betrayed me but i hadnt known so i had died and now could not know how elsie fared was she waiting for me throughout her life for a promise never to be fulfilled how cruel a lie had i told her in this i perceived a certain justice to my own fate i had been served as i had served another person i had perhaps ruined a fine girl and now i was ruined myself the two griefs merged and fused in my being as time passed i tended to forget the more recent horror in favor of the earlier one perhaps because the guilt of all xanth was not associated there yet it was not all bad for me and perhaps not for xanth with the decline of human power the several creature kingdoms strengthened and mankind had to learn to deal with animals as equals centaurs in particular had been treated mainly as beasts of burden and laborers now they formed an island kingdom of their own and became quite civilized i like to think that the elven tribes pros pered and that bluebells descendants exist today be cause of the diminished interference of human folk the other ghosts of the castle were decent sorts very supportive they had been through their fatal experiences and understood exactly how that felt they regarded themselves as keepers of the castle preserving it for that day when a king would return to rule xanth properly and usher in a new golden age of man castle roogna itself had a spirit it kept itself whole and its ambience extended crewel lye out through the surrounding orchards and trees now i understood why the trees had fought me they had known that my presence meant doom to the castle whichever way my mission turned out as a ghost i ranged the whole region apologizing to every tree and zombie i had injured with my sword and to the old moat monster too im very sorry and i wont do it again i promised but that was empty i couldnt do it again still they accepted my penitence knowing the ignorance and frailties of the mortal condition and i became one with the castle an empty promise is still a promise i have tried in whatever way i can to help castle roogna and perhaps i succeeded when the king mare needed help to save it from occupation by the evil horse man that can hardly make up for the evil i did originally but its a beginning in a couple of years a new ghost appeared she was renee whom you have met she was bewildered by her abrupt death though it had been suicide people who die by their own hands often dont realize quite what they are getting into she had come to the deserted castle to end her misery and had not expected to retain awareness in this form she had suffered an unhappy marriage not being able to marry her true love and had finally taken this way out she reminded me poignantly of elsie though i ardently hoped i had not driven elsie into such a situ ation by my defection i had been the youngest ghost in terms of the period of my spirits existence now renee was i was glad to help her and show her the ghostly ropes and she was very appreciative this helped me forget my own distress and i trust it helped her too it is a truth of death as well as of life that the surest amelioration of ones own misery is to be obtained by helping another person in timemuch time for the emotions of ghosts are as diffuse as their physical essencesthis relationship evolved into love now threnody was but a distant mem ory renee was the one i existed for in death i had found my lifes partner and i knew she felt the samethough it was too late for us even before we met crewel lye crewel lye eventually king trent came to castle roogna and brought the monarchy back to its rightful seat once again xanth flourished and the dark age was behind we are now some thirty years into the new age and man pros pers but we ghosts remain for our stories are not yet finished and perhaps will never be chapter caustic truth and that jordan the ghost concluded is my story sad as it may be i was an ignorant barbarian fool and i paid the price yet today i have happiness of a sort for i have seen the dark age of xanth end at last and i love renee and now i have the memory of my living history thanks to the crewel lye you used to clarify the tapestry i thank you little princess though not all of my memories are pleasant ivy considered she had found the ghosts tale to be more of a narrative than anticipated with some aspects that were a trifle awkward for a girl of five to comprehend it had granted her the wish she had made on a starfish to know the origin of the forgetspell on the gap a certain mystery remained about that since that spell had been applied to the gap long before magician yinyang lived but still it was an answer now she wondered what the big deal was about summoning the stork wasnt it just a matter of kissing her parents tended to get evasive when her questions about such points became too pointed and she had the suspicion that jordan would be no more can did still it was worth a try some things have changed she said oh we live in modem times storks no longer deliver babies directly to the mothers they dont jordan asked as if amused that was an annoying trait adults had i must be out of touch yes today the storks deposit the bundles under cab bage leaves probably it saves them time if you had done that with the ogret you wouldnt have had to worry about the ogre and ogress that must be why the storks changed it jordan agreed thats where my mother found dumb dolph my pid dling baby brother thats no way to speak of him jordan said well he is piddling she insisted stoutly they have to keep a diaper on him all the time and keep changing it im sure its more trouble than hes worth there is that the ghost agreed now came the clincher i dont quite understand this business about summoning storks anyway ivy said pet ulantly exactly how is that done um i forget jordan said awkwardly well lets zero in on one of those scenes in the tap estry and enlarge the detail that should refresh your memory ivy was very practical about satisfying her cu riosity im sure thats not necessary jordan said quickly its a very dull business how do you know if you dont remember well i just remember that it probably wouldnt in terest you children dont do it you see but the ghost had turned a shade or two whiter than he had been there was no question about it jordan was part of the adult conspiracy there was some secret here that all grownups wanted to keep from all children let s go back to the beginning ivy said where you and elsie ah elsie the ghost said sadly id like to know how she survived uh yes ivy agreed curious about that too so when the tapestry zeroed in on elsie just after jordan had left her she followed the woman forward instead of crewel lye crewel lye backward ivy like jordan had her weaknesses curiosity tended to overcome her common sense what had hap pened to elsie as it turned out elsie did not grieve long a handsome farmer began paying attention to her the moment jordan left as time passed without jordans return her interest turned to the farmer in due course she married him and the stork delivered a baby but the lights were always out when the couple set about signaling the stork so ivy still was unenlightened thats a relief jordan exclaimed what ivy demanded irately to learn that i didnt ruin elsie after all the ghost said now i dont have to feel guilty any more she was better off without me i was just a passing fling for her as she was for me oh now ivys full attention returned to jordan your magic talentcould you revive today if your bones were put back together the ghost considered i dont know its been a long timeand anyway i dont know where my parts are buried so they cant be put together i know where they are a faint voice said behind him jordan turned ohrenee i didnt know you were there the female ghost took better form ivy could see that she must have been very pretty in her life ilooked for them and the trees showed me renee said why did you do that jordan asked perplexed because i love you jordan was abashed i never thought to look for your bones i must not love you as much as you love me its all right renee said comfortingly i am notas lovable as you are jordan ivy pounced on the information take me to jordans bones she exclaimed im going to put them together so he can live again but it might not work jordan protested nonsense ivy said with the certainty only a child her age could muster you can do it if you try she turned to renee show me obediently renee led the way out of the castle and across the moat and into the orchard the head is here under the roots of this skullery treeshe indicated the tree which was hung with pots and kettles and other kitchen utensils indeed there did seem to be skull de signs on the utensils this location was obvious now that attention had been called to it well have to dig it out ivy said eying the firm turf beneath the tree the two ghosts spread their foggy hands we are un able to affect material things jordan said i could not even invoke the pictures of the tapestry myself only a living solid creature can do that and not all of them ivy looked at her cute little hands she considered the trouble she would be in if she got them and her dress messed up ill get help she decided help jordan asked any adult is likely to ask awk ward questions dont i know it thats the one thing adults are really good at she glanced at the ghost except maybe bar barians thank you jordan said wryly perhaps the little dragon renee murmured ivy brightened she put two fingers into her mouth and made a piercing whistle there was a stir from the far side of the castle in a moment stanley came steaming along he whomped up to ivy expectantly ivy pointed to the ground there is a skull under here sniff stanley sniffed in a moment he located it he indicated the spot with a jet of steam dig it outcarefully ivy ordered stanley was glad to cooperate he steamed the ground making it soft then dug with his front claws soon he sniffed again steamed the dirt sodden and used his teeth to dig out the dirty skull oh youre so good at that ivy exclaimed stretching crewel lye crewel lye her arms around stanleys neck for a hug she had per fected the technique of female flattery by watching her mother handle her father it certainly worked on stanley he blushed bright green with pleasure soon they steamed the skull clean and white and ivy carried it to the next location renee showed them to a shoetree with boys and mens shoes in every stage of growth sure enough down under the roots its foot nes tled in a buried hiking shoe was one of jordans skeletal legs stanley dug it out carefully and steamed it clean this growing mass of bones was getting complicated for ivy to carry so they made a cache of bones under a parasol tree out of sight of the castle ivy didnt want any adult telling her no adults were all too prone to say no apparently for no reason other than sinister pleasure in uttering the syllable the other leg was under a female shoetree wearing a ragged ladyslipper no one would have thought to look for it there stanley was enjoying this he liked finding things though he was a little miffed about not being al lowed to chew up the bones once he found them but he was willing to settle for ivys hugs instead males have always been fools about that sort of thing jordan mut tered reminiscently the arms were beneath separate armstrees nestled among the old rusted swords maces and spears that had been dropped unharvested in bygone years one hand still held the sword recovered from the knight which re mained stainlessly shiny odd that she should have taken the trouble to put that sword in my hand jordan mused as if i died fighting why should she bother jordans own sword of course had been used by the evil threnody to bury the chunks of him there was no telling where that was now if it hadnt rusted away entirely it had been a good sword but not that good the upper section of the torso was buried beneath a chestnut tree the skeletal rib cage was packed in a chest another retrospectively obvious location threnody had evidently taken a lot of care in hiding each piece in a region so fitting that no one would think of it she must have been afraid that if any piece of me were found someone would realize where the others were jordan said shuddering at the mute malice of the demonspawns mischief one section remained and this was beneath a huge thick ash tree she planted my posterior neath the grass of an ash the ghost lamented a fat ash ivy agreed contemplating the girth of the tree stanley sneezed as he sniffed out the precise location for the fine ashes beneath the tree tickled his snoot then he dug down through the stratified layers of ash until he could get a tooth on the skeletal rump at last jordans entire skeleton was heaped beneath the parasol ivy arranged the pieces in order so that the figure lay complete on the ground now what she asked does it just start walking like one of the skeletons of the gourd after four hundred years as i said im not sure jordan replied cautiously ive never been dead that long before here i brought some healing lixer ivy said she took out a bottle and sprinkled it over the bones still nothing happened you see since all my flesh is gone jordan began nonsense all it takes is concentration and ivy concentrated ivy though a child was a full sorceress with power that rivaled that of any magician in xanth when she focused it remarkable things tended to happen such as dragons turning tame and thyme accelerating now she intensified jordans talent of recovery which had already been boosted by the healing elixirwhich itself was in tensified by her talent jordan had no flesh to heal only the most enduring part of him remained it seemed like a lost cause yet even four hundred years could not stand against ivys power few folk ever had occasion to per ceive the full extent of the magic of a magician or sor ceress for usually the ramifications were subtle this was an exception crewel lye crewel lye the effect was gratifying the bones began to knit the leg bone connected to the thigh bone and the arm bone connected to the shoulder bone and the shoulder bone connected to the neck bone all the bones con nected and soon the skeleton was intact now tendons sprouted from the bones stringing them together in a new way flesh formed on the surfaces like mildew growing surrounding the bones and tendons thickening turning red muscles developed and organs the skeleton became a cadaverous body probably the bones were becoming hollow for jordans healing talent did not generate flesh from nothing it was taken from the existing substance but in due course a layer of skin formed and the starving figure lay complete the thinnest man in xanth it has to eat jordan the ghost said its too thin to support life so its still a dead man then why doesnt it eat ivy asked dead men dont eat its still too weak ivy went to a nearby breadfruit tree plucked a loaf of bread and took out a slice she held this to the figures almost lipless mouth that did it jordan exclaimed he floated through the air toward the figure as if drawn by some vacuum the figure inhaledand the ghost was sucked into the mouth goodbye jordan renee cried faintly sounding sad for this parting and of course it was a parting for he was departing the world of ghosts now the body was breathing the mouth opened slightly and ivy poked in the bite of bread the mouth closed and the jaws slowly chewed at first it seemed almost too much for the teeth to bite through the soft bread but soon the motions strengthened as the nourish ment entered the body she fed him several pieces and then some fruits and gradually the body became more animated the sunken eyes opened and one arm twitched finally that hand was able to lift and grasp a piece of bread and move it to the mouth jordan was feeding himself but time was passing and ivy had to return to the castle for supper lest the grownups get suspicious stanleyguard she ordered the little dragon indicat ing the strengthening body she plucked assorted addi tional fruits and dumped them down in a pile for the body to eat then she went into the castle roogna where she got caught up in all the makework adults foisted off on children such as eating greens brushing her teeth look ing at picture books and going to bed she couldnt get away to see to the important business angry she kicked at the monster under the bed but it was smart enough to skulk just out of reach first thing in the morning she returned to the orchard jordan was gonebut stanley came frisking up and led her to the former ghost jordan the man was now on his feet and picking fruit for himself he was still very thin but the healing elixir and his healing talent as enhanced by ivys own talent had restored him remarkably he was now the shadow of his former barbarian self tall and broadshouldered and hankhaired and bigfooted the very outline of the model of a handsome man he was walking from tree to tree taking all the fruit he could reach and cramming it into his mouth still ravenous ivy clapped her hands with childish glee jordan youre really alive she cried of course he had been alive the evening before but so thin and weak that she really didnt think of it the same way mph sre m he agreed through a mouthful of fruit cake from one of the gardens valuable crossbreed trees vut but what he swallowed clearing his mouth somewhat so he could speak more clearly but renee isnt ivy looked around spying the female ghost who hov ered at the fringe of vision thats right i guess you miss her now am glad for jordan renee said faintly he will be able to finish his real life i will fade away no jordan cried clearing the rest of his mouthful i love you renee i dont want life if it means i must crewel lye lose you ill become a ghost again he glanced back toward the parasol tree where the knights sword still lay he took a step toward it dont you dare ivy said severely i went to a lot of trouble to get you back alive well just have to make renee alive too no that is not necessary renee protested jordan deserves to live i dont but howt jordan asked ivy interested ivy pondered it was an awkward question the very type that adults favored id better ask hugo hugo my friend at magician humfreys castle hugos very smart thats not what ive heard jordan said well hes always smart when im with him jordan had just experienced a demonstration of her power and began to understand if she thought hugo was smart hugo would be smartfor her humfreys cas tleisnt that where millie went i remember when she left us thirty years ago thirtyone years renee said evidently she was good at figures having a good one herself naturally these ghosts had known millie the ghost before she was restored to life millieyou mean lacunas mom ivy asked she lives in the zombie castle humfreys castle is east yes but thats still a long way away it would take a long time to go there even if you used the gourd again well use the mirror silly come on and ivy headed toward the castle at a brisk skip but if the adults see me theyll ask questions jordan pointed out that made ivy pause it was a big nuisance when peo ple asked questions she was coming to understand why magician humfrey discouraged it okay you stay here and eat and find something to wear oops jordan said realizing that his clothing had not revived with him it seemed he had been so hungry that he hadnt paid attention to other details crewel lye ivy returned to the castle and went straight to the magic mirror mirror mirror on the wall whos the cutest of them all she asked rhetorically you are you ravishing little snippet the mirror re plied showing the image of a kiss it was a game they played as magician humfrey aged he had gotten to tink ering with things he had not had time for in his senior years and had fixed the various inoperative mirrors so that now intercastle communications were excellent ivys talent hadnt hurt either the mirror responded especially well to her attention ivy made a grab for the kiss but it danced away back beyond the glassy surface where she couldnt get it this mirror was a tease and whos the smartest of them all now that depends the mirror began oh just give me hugo i thought you were working up to that the mirror grumped it flickered and then hugo came on hugo i need some advice ivy said youre real smart arent you i am now he agreed warily he had been through this before how can we bring a ghost back to life thats easy use a reanimation spell ivy considered the only one of those i know of was taken away by a ghost horse four hundred years ago hugo shook his head ivy youve said some foolish things in your day but this is worse yet how could you have lost such a spell four hundred years ago you didnt exist then just tell me how to bring back that ghost horse ivy said evenly ill have to ask my father hes a brat now but he likes to show off his information hugo disappeared from the mirror which played innocuous music and ran color patterns during the interim soon he returned he says quote you idiot all you have to do is rattle some chains unquote okay tell the brat thanks ivy dashed down to the arsenal found the heaviest chain she could carry shook crewel lye the bones out of it and dragged it out to the orchard the moat monster spooked as she hauled it across the draw bridge for it made a loud noise on the wooden planks panting from the effort she brought the chain to jor dan who had already filled out some more apparently ivys presence had accelerated his healing again rattle this she told him perplexed he obeyed he took the chain and shook it the rattling noise filled the orchard causing the trees to avert their leaves in a moment there was a distant answering rattle pook jordan cried surprised and pleased id know that sound anywhere indeed it was the ghost horse who was eternal as long as he wore his chains and avoided getting killed pook galloped up gave a startled neigh when he saw jordan and practically knocked him down in greeting yes im alive again jordan said did you miss me pook shrugged then he turned and neighed there was an answering neighand in a moment peek the female ghost horse trotted up trailing her was a little colt wearing cute little chains i guess you found a way to pass the time jordan remarked but four hundred yearsjust when did the stork deliver that colt ooo nice ivy exclaimed fascinated by the little ghost horse the feeling seemed mutual of course these things do take time jordan decided when youre a ghost ive had some experience that way myself that colt could be a century old and pook nod ded ill call you puck ivy told the ghost colt patting his pretty little mane jordan checked pooks chains there were the tattered remains of the bag of spells he pulled it free and two unused white spells dropped out a shield and a stone one of these must be the reanimation spell he ex claimed and the other he paused to tally them up in his mind the monsterbanishingspell but which is which ivy asked crewel lye well just have to try them both but first we have to find renees bones no renee said timidly i really dont deserve either you join me in life or ill rejoin you in death and jordans barbarian jaw was set so hard it was evident he meant it you dont understand renee demurred you wouldnt like me alive i never intended to live again well i never intended to die for four hundred years jordan retorted that was the mischief of threnodys cruel lie may she be forever damned but now im glad i did because thats how i met you i love you ill either live with you or die with you come on renee ivy said persuasively she loved a good romance even if there were aspects of it she had been unable to fathom yet dont be shy i know my father will make a place for you at castle roogna no never the ghost cried but after all youve been here for centuries thats different ghosts dont count i could never stay in life renee protested wringing her diaphanous hands then we can live somewhere else jordan said anywhere you want just so long as were together you want that dont you oh yes but then its decided ivy said decisively show us your bones reluctantly renee led them to one more sitea so phistree this looked like a solid regular tree but on closer examination it turned out to be a clever decep tionan animal masquerading as a tree by standing on its thick tail and spreading its limbs out covered with bits of green to emulate branches and leaves obviously it was an intruder in the orchard a weedcreature but the effort was so ingenious that no one had noticed for centuries until now ivy decided to pretend not to notice if the creature tried that hard and long to look and act like a tree it deserved to succeed after all it wasnt doing any harm crewel lye stanley sniffed out the bones and dug them up they were very shapely bones obviously renee had been a beautiful woman so her appearance wasnt the reason for her reluctance to reanimate that was fine for as jordan continued to pluck and eat fruit he was filling out into a muscular and handsome man ivy just knew they would make a lovely couple and she was thrilled to be able to reunite them in life she liked the ghosts of castle roogna and would be sorry to lose these two as ghosts but life was even better jordan reached into the bag and brought out the little white stone and shield these stand for life and monster banishment he said but theres no way to tell which is which short of invoking one ill just have to guess at least neither one will hurt anyone but renee protested i really think you shouldnt jordan held up the white stone invoke he said there was a flash from the stoneand a pop behind them they glanced around stanleys gone ivy cried appalled jordan looked abashed i forgot he was a monster he said he was so helpful during the night but i guess a little monster is still a monster but where is he ivy demanded peering around the orchard dont worryim sure hes all right jordan said he must have been sent to wherever monsters live when theyre not monstering i mean when i ran into the black monstersummoningspell it was a pretty healthy tar asque that appeared and this spell is just the reverse im sure stanley will find his way home hed better ivy said poking out her lower lip or ill give him holy whatfor jordan held up the little white shield this has to be it by elimination invoke renees bones quivered then the ghost was drawn to themand as she settled onto the pattern of bones her ghostly outline clarified thickened and became solid in crewel lye a moment she was a bare beautiful woman with flowing black hair jordan stared at her stumbling back as if struck threnody he cried who ivy asked bewildered the woman got to her feet she had gone through none of the agonizing stages of restoration that jordan had this spell had been quick and strong she gazed sadly at jor dan i tried to dissuade you barbarian she said i warned you that you wouldnt like me alive youyou substituted your bones for renees jor dan cried you tricked me into reviving you instead of the one i love behind him pook snorted agreement pook had never liked threnody now how could a dead person change bones with another threnody asked with the same air of regret i was always reneethreneedy i just simplified my name so you wouldnt know it was obviously true you deceived meeven in death jordan said even as a ghost even as a ghost she agreed walking to a clothing tree and making tasteful selections from it ivy had never seen a betterformed woman not excepting her mother irene even as a female child ivy could appreciate how such a figure could dazzle a mans mind threnody spoke again that was the crudest lie of all jordans prospective joy had changed abruptly to be wildered horror butwhy you had gotten what you wanted why torture me even in death she sighed i dont suppose you could believe that i have always loved you jordans big fist clenched so hard the knuckle cracked dont give me any more of your lies for once in your foul life tell the simple truth why she nodded as if she had expected this no more lies jordan ill just do you the favor of getting out of your life youre alive now you can make a new life for your self im sure any decent and lovely maiden would be glad to comfort a handsome barbarian like you you certainly dont need anything from demonspawn she completed crewel lye her dressing and walked out of the orchard away from the castle jordans hurt bafflement turned to outrage oh no you dont you cant destroy my love twice over and just walk away i promised to deliver you to castle roogna and now i will king dor will decide what to do with you and he ran after her grabbed her by her slender waist and picked her up he had not yet recovered his full mass and strength but he was already a powerful man stop that threnody cried put me down i cant go to castle roogna well see about that he gritted theres no evil magician now to kill me on the way once my mission is done im through with youbut not before she kicked and fought but he carried her through the orchard toward the castle while ivy and the three ghost horses followed pook snorted approval this was at least a fitting conclusion to jordans mission threnody would at last pay the penalty for her many treacheries but as they approached the drawbridge there was dust rising from the zombie graveyard to the side the zombies were dragging themselves out of their graves trying to protect the castle but they were too slow jordan reached the bridge first and started boldly across it despite the womans struggles castle roogna began to shake there were cries from within it as startled people reacted still jordan marched forward the moat monster forged through the water to ward them but it too was too late all the castles de fenses had been caught off guard by this sudden occurrence the shaking got worse the water of the moat rippled a stone fell from a turret and crashed to the ground the castles falling you idiot threnody screamed it will kill everyone jordan stopped amazed it really is he exclaimed i thought that was just a threat threnody managed to squirm out of his grasp and get back on her feet you never did know the truth from a crewel lye lie she said and ran back across the bridge you were always a fool she brushed past ivy and the horses tears on her cheeks no one tried to stop her the shuddering diminished as threnody got away from the castle the threat was easing the disinterred zombies paused and so did the moat monster watching her depart she sure didnt lie about that part ivy said shaken by more than the castle but i dont understand why did she pretend to be renee to trick me into reanimating her jordan said bit terly i would never have done it if id known she was the evil threnody but renee told you not to do it ivy pointed out she knew id do it anyway but when she came here to die four hundred years ago you had no spell she thought you were dead to stay didnt she why did she choose to become a ghostor if not a ghost why did she come here to die jordan shook his head bewildered i guess i cant make sense of it at all if she had had any change of heart she could have dug up my bones herself she knew where they were but shes demonspawn i never truly under stood her nature her mother destroyed her father and she destroyed me now shes taken renee from me and left me not only desolate but branded as big a fool as a ghost as i was in life the cruelty other lies just goes on and on and he sat on the edge of the bridge and put his head in his hands pook approached from one side not knowing how to comfort the man who had loved so unwisely and even the moat monster looked sad the tragedy of jordans first life had seemed to be beyond redemption yet he had redeemed it in deathonly to have it eclipsed by the tragedy of his second life ivy had some idea how he felt after all she had just lost stanley steamer but somehow it didnt make enough sense to satisfy her im going to ask hugo she an nounced jordan did not answer he just sat silently gazing into the water of the moat his new life turned to ashes crewel lye ivy had been grounded for getting into some perfectly innocent trouble on the way to the north village several days ago this time she knew the trouble was not in nocent lives had been restoredand ruined castle roogna had nearly fallen what explanation could hugo offer that would make any of this right but she had to ask she left the little group on the drawbridge returned to the castle and hurried through the halls no one noticed her they were all too upset about the mysterious shaking of the castle once they realized what her part in this had beenshe quailed before a mental picture of the giant flying hairbrush she had encountered at the good magi cians castle yet that could hardly be the worst of it what would the other ghosts say to her after what she had done to two of their number she reached the mirror and called hugo again youre the only one smart enough to figure this out hugo she said tearfully when his face appeared in the glass im in a big awful lot of trouble but im not smart he protested none too eager to get involved in her trouble it took no genius to know that what ivy considered little trouble was big trouble to any one else and what she called big trouble was apt to be downright dangerous yes you are she insisted hugo was stuck for it he changed his mind for a smarter one ivy told him what had happened and hugo listened intelligently why the answer is obvious he said as she concluded he explained it to her ivy brightened phenomenally thats it she ex claimed happily that solves everything oh thank you hugo and she dashed out of the stillconfused castle she returned to jordan who remained seated forlornly on the bridge in the gloomy company of the ghost horses the moat monster and a stray zombie i know why she cried because she hated me and wanted to humiliate me yet again jordan mumbled no because she truly loved you jordan crewel lye jordan looked up some love he growled now listen you dumb barbarian ivy told him se verely you dont know a thing about women on target he agreed morosely threnody knew about yin and yang right that they were just different sides of the same magician she had to know he said lugubriously so she knew that all the evil that was in yang was in yin too only it didnt show because the whole man is the sum of his parts if she married yin she was marrying yang tooand castle roogna would fall before she even got to yin since she had to return there in order for him to win and since they were the same magician she knew that all those bad spells that were trying to kill you were really from yin as well as yang in fact maybe yin mixed up the white spells himself to be quite sure youd be killed without king gromden knowing why because that magician liked his evil side better but had to do the con test to get good king gromdens approval so the contest really was fixed with no way yin could win threnody knew that yes jordan agreed seeing it and she helped them get rid of me was that love yes because she knew yinyang would kill you all the way dead if he realized she loved you and he was a magician a strong one and he was going to be king no matter how the contest turned out so no one could stop him he would bum your body to ashes and scatter them in the sea or seal them in stones or something so thered be no chance at all for you ever to recover and because she loved you she had to pretend she hated you because he was already suspicious and probably would have killed you anyway there was a lot of evil in him jordan nodded becoming interested yinyang was evil surely he had nothing good for me in mind i was just a tool for his ambition to be used and thrown away even without threnody he would have had to get rid of me so no one would know how he cheated but threnody didnt have toto make me love her then kill me her self crewel lye she didnt not exactly ivy said she didnt know you before you came for her and then she tried to kill you but gradually as she got to know you she got to love you too she told the truth when she said she loved you she had never loved any man other than her father before but you proved to her she was after all human then she really had to kill you huh even the ghost horses and the moat monster and the zombie looked perplexed at this ivy realized that hugos clear explanation was getting a bit garbled in translation she concentrated her mind and tried again actually it was yangs evil deathspell that killed you then threnody knew hed finish the job if she didnt act quickly so she cut up your body and hid the pieces very carefully to be sure she could find them again she knew she could bring you back to lifeafter the magician had forgotten about you thats why she told that cruel lieto save you from real death she was lying to the magician when she said she hated you she told you the truth when she said she loved you i dont know jordan began doubtfully remember when you were in threnodys body hold ing the evil sword and you couldnt tell pook the truth ivy asked you liedto fool the sword not pook well threnody was in a similar situation because yinyang was more dangerous than that black sword ever had been jordan brightened then dulled again but she never did bring me back because yang remained suspicious evil people are like that its the good people who are too trusting yang must have watched her all the time renee told you how unhappy her marriage was it must have been truly ter riblebecause she really hated the magician and had to pretend she loved him finally she couldnt take it any more she realized he would never give her a chance to return to you not while he lived not before she was an old hag she could do nothing about him because his magicians power was much more than hers could ever be and also he was the king the moment she made any motion to dig up your bones he would have known and crewel lye destroyed you both in terrible fashion so she joined you the only way she couldin death she loved you enough to die for you she hadnt known about the ghosts at castle roogna yes jordan said wishing he could believe but why didnt she tell me then two reasons yinyang knew she was dead but didnt know she had become a ghost only people with horren dously unresolved problems become ghosts but when she said anything about her identity the magician would recognize her and know it wasnt over and take steps to finish it if only by digging up your bones and burning them she couldnt risk that so to protect you as a ghost she lied to you again but yinyang didnt live forever jordan protested after he died she could have told me no you hated threnody for what you thought she had done to you you would have thought it was just another lie you were coming to love renee if she told you all that she could expect was that you would hate heras you did when her identity was revealed just now she loved you and just wanted your love in return her name didnt matter to her so she loved you as renee and you loved her and that was enough until you messed it up by returning her to life and then she couldnt tell you for the same reason because you wouldnt listen so she just went away heartbroken and i guess shell turn herself into a skunkcabbage or something and wilt away but renee helped me find my bones because she wanted what was best for you and life was best if it hadnt been for her you wouldnt have died before so she helped give that life back to you she felt she owed it to you to make up for the way she had ruined a fine man she didnt know you would bring her back too and didnt know how to handle it she had expected you to return to life slowly forget about her and find someone new then she would have done the right thing at last and made up for her cruel lies crewel lye jordan considered that but she really didnt try very hard to convince me what use ivy asked your mind was closed and shes a proud woman she wasnt going to beg she never begged in her life she just did what she had to so when you rejected her jordan was stricken true true i have wronged her well you didnt know youre sort of proud too but now its all right you can go to her jordan seemed awed all that shes doneshe did for love of me even her crudest lies i was too ready to believe in her guilt well so was i ivy said until hugo explained it all to me but of course im only five years old i dont understand about romance all those centuries jordan lamented what renee told me is true she was miserable because she could not marry her true lovewho was me i must beg her for giveness he got up and hurried in the direction thren ody had gone pook started to follow then decided not to some scenes were better without audiences i guess shell forgive him ivy said with satisfaction she can change her form she can change her mind too she looked around oh ive just got to hug somebody you and she hugged puck the little ghost horse and you she hugged pook and peek and even the nose of the moat monster but not you she decided encountering the zombie she looked toward the orchard did she see two figures merging behind the trees she realized that she would not see jordan again after this day for threnody would never enter the castle alive not with her curse she might be demonspawned but she had love and conscience and surely a soul and she didnt want the castle to fall the happy couple would have to go elsewhere and that meant pook and his family would go too ivy knew she would be very sad about that when she got over her present happiness i suppose id better tell my folks about why weve lost two ghosts and a dragon and why the castle shook crewel lye she said to herself she didnt relish the prospect but it was best to get it over with early she went inside things had settled down somewhat now her mother was sitting pensively while baby dolph was fussing in his crib whats the matter mom ivy asked willing to postpone the inevitable a little longer hes so restless irene said i dont know whats the matter i thought it was because of the earthquake tremor but thats past now im at my wits end ivy studied her little brother she had resented him from slightly before the moment he arrived at the cabbage but had never really looked at him he was an ugly thing sort of bald and fat and toothless and drooly and she couldnt see why anyone would want to pay so much attention to him but the story of jordan the ghost and threnody the demonspawned was fresh in her mind and she had just had a lesson in prejudice if jordan had been ready to believe the truth instead of the cruel lie told to save him suddenly dolph reminded her of threnody it was a completely incongruous impression on the physical side yet a profound one emotionally why did her helpless rolypoly baby brother remind her of that beautiful woman well there was one way to find out ivy moved closer to the crib and concentrated enhancing the babys qual ities whats his talent she asked we dont know dear irene said sometimes it takes years to discover a persons magic talent and theres no guarantee it will be worthwhile irene was really worried about that ivy saw she didnt want any child of hers to have a poor talent hes trying to do his magic ivy declared trusting her littlegirl intuition but he cant quite do it yet so hes frustrated ivy was something of an expert on frus tration irene smiled not taking her seriously adults could be especially annoying that way whatever you say dear ivy continued her concentration knowing that some thing was bound to show it always did when she willed it so she was sure there was some reason dolph reminded crewel lye her of threnody and sure she could make this apparent if she just intensified it enough suddenly there was a wolf cub in the crib say look at that ivy exclaimed pleased irene lookedand screamed in a moment daddy king dor and half the personnel of the castle were in the room they were all edgy because of the earthquakemaybe it should be left at thatbut it was too late startled by the scream dolph had changed back into a baby aw you missed it ivy said petu lantly dolphs a changer irene calmed down enough to pay attention a what like threnody only hes fast he does it in an in stant not an hour he who threnody thats a long story ivy looked again at the baby who was now peacefully sleeping satisfied with his effort dolph no longer looked as disgusting maybe dolph has demon blood in him not from my side of the family irene snapped i wonder if he can diffuse ivy mused instant formchanging king dor asked if hes a werewolf thats one thing a minor talent if he can change instantly to any form thats another oh sure its any form ivy said with certainty he just needs a little help to get it started hes only a baby you know dor picked her up i hadnt realized that he said with a straight face teasing her in the nice way daddies had i thought perhaps he was an adult like you oh shut up daddy she said kissing him on the cheek irene exchanged a glance with her daughter any form changing himself thats magiciancaliber talent at least ivy agreed she had discovered it so now it was to her credit and the greater the talent was the better after that the discussion became animated and ivy was left out of it but she didnt mind that either she could handle a few more days of neglect until the matter crewel lye of the ghosts blew over it might be interesting having a brother who could become any creature in an instant she could show him how to reach the high cookie jar by chang ing into a snail and crawling up the wall so they would never starve between meals or how to become a little dragon and breathe fire to toast marshmallows and give people hotfoots the possibilities were endless yes life was bound to get more interesting soon authors note in the last xanth novel dragon on a pedestal i used a number of puns contributed by fans listing the credits at the end and suggested that this was punnish ment enough but before that novel was published fans had sent many more puns some sent whole pages of thema veritable pundoras box i used about fifty of those suggestions and give due credit here but this re sulted in such a concentration of puns in the first chapter that the publisher suffered pundigestion you see i have many young readers who write to me in much greater numbers than the older ones do but they are really not the largest audience for xanth despite appearances xanth is intended mostly for adults which may be why the kids like it the question was whether that plethora of puns would alienate more people than it pleased sothat chapter was deleted because it isnt good form to annoy more readers than strictly necessary even in xanth the present version of the novel begins with what was origi nally chapter but for those of you who cant live without knowing what was in it here is a summary of the missing chapter on the eve of her baby brothers arrival ivy went to visit crewel lye crewel lye her grandfather trent along with grundy and stanley she got them all into enormous mischief but the timely arrival of a package from her punpal rapunzel helped them survive it along with tangleman who is a tangle tree transformed into a man now though most of these puns have been deleted im leaving their credits as originally listed so you folk who sent them in will know they really were there this may seem peculiarbut what did you expect from xanth and those of you who remain out there bursting with punsstifle them because theres only so much of this nonsense anyone can take by the time lye burns into print i should have completed the following xanth novel and plans are inchoate beyond that so any puns you might send are apt to be wasted anyway are you ready here are the credits real and potential for lye and if there is some overlap it is because a given pun may have been suggested by more than one person david branson suggested deadstock punpal crabgrass frisbees demonstration which i modified for my own sinister purpose baseball bat the night mare being out other gourd air waves outcry and worry wart andrea desimone and laura t maberry collaborated to suggest sound of mind shadow of a doubt clinging vines cat o nine tails scaredy cat dumb bells screaming meanies copperhead snake snakeeyes and kitty hawk martin musick suggested the dark lantern kitty hawk head stone bear witness and worry wart as you can see i used three of his in a bunch and theres a reason i had a request from a fan who was organizing a dungeons and dragons type game using a xanth setting could i provide some challenges for entry into the good magicians castle that hadnt already been published since all the game players had read all the xanths already so i listed the ones used in dragon which had not yet been published and then sat down and made notes for the equivalent scene in lye which novel i hadnt even started i have neverfailing inspiration which makes me virtually unique among writers but this was a strain so i checked mr musteks list of about ten notions selected three and built my scene around them then i sent off the infor mation to the fan and later wrote that scene when i came to it in the novel i hope they had a successful d d game i never heard most fanpuns i include as a courtesy in this case they were a real help but back to work here greg burns suggested the gold fish silver fish hedge hog hem lock horsetail horse chestnut honey comb and golden rod dave schwartz had the living room david miles the seeingeye dogwood tree katherine a lowe the bum steer and bryce cock son suggested the catchyourbreath karen vinyard sug gested that a girl be turned into a tree to be a companion for justin tree i thought it was a good idea but didnt manage to fit it in this time diane le roux inquired why justin tree didnt become a man again in the time of no magic so that is explained here she also asked a number of awkward questions about the centaurs aging rate obviously it is the same as the rate for human beings contrary to what bink believed in xanth and how come the siren could look at the gorgon in xanth and not in xanth well i think that when the gorgon was young she only stoned male creatures but when she matured so did her talent so she stoned everyone after all we dont want any sexism here everyone should suffer alike and other awkward questions that umlook diane im awfully busy at the moment trying to type a manuscript so if youll just go on to the next author in line and ask him or her some awkward questions instead thats a good girl michael saul also focusing on the gorgon asks how dor could see her wink in xanth when her face was invisible ah michael see that line over there that diane is standing in just take your place behind her and dont shove and i think id better wrap this up and get out of here before those fans reach the head of that next line and spring those questions on that next author i wonder who he is lets see if its alphabetical that must be poul anderson of the society for creative anachron ismsyou know the folk who dress up in armor and authentic medieval swords yes id definitely better get crewel lye crewel lye out of here then again maybe i should shunt those fans to the author on the other side that looks like isaac asimov whose foundations edge is at this writing just about to blast xanth off the bestseller lists but his line is so long that my fans will never reach the head of it well now terry cook suggested that king trent turn a tangle tree into a person keith helgason suggested both ivys talent and dolphs talent after i had worked them out myself but before the novels were published evidently great minds work in similar ways richard rails suggested the leatherstrip body armor for the warrior thats not a pun but a useful device penny jacob suggested the dirty mind after analyzing her fathers nature charles cohen suggested that i include elves in xanth and it did seem to be about time for them chris mcvetta described the contact lens bush ginger gibson suggested xantha claus i regret i was not imaginative enough to fit him in here but what do you expect from someone named pier xan thony and perhaps i should catch up on an overdue credit i borrowed the name of a fan in estonia martin roogna to use for castle roogna way back when mr roogna says hes not sure he has ancestry quite like that but who knows so much for the credits let me ramble on just a bit more before i meander off to my next novel xanth has been quite successful as a series making all the bestseller lists it seems that ninetynine percent of its readers love it the other one percent review it accusing me of things like reveling in sexism and execrable puns however patchen review did say hostility from serious review ers to anthony is out of all proportion perhaps it stems more from jealousy than lit crit i do work hard at what i do a storm came up and splattered water through the cracks in my study while i was typing lye so i had to prop an umbrella over my desk to keep the page dry rather than interrupt my schedule that happened to be the scene in which jordan is recovering from getting stoned no i never get stoned myself pun or no pun and thats no he i dont believe in zonking out my mind for anything short of a medical emergency ive been writing about fifty letters a month mostly answering xanth fan mail and that interferes with my paying writing so id like to cut it down let me address here some of the questions my fans commonly ask me so you wont have to write to inquire such as what other books are similar to xanth well none really i seem to have the execrable pun fantasy market to myself but though have not read asprins myth series i have met the author and understand his puns are almost as bad as mine so you might try his myth con ceptions or others and see for yourself theres also quite a bit of humor in adams hitchhikers guide series if you like candy landscapes and are truly young at heart in the four to eightyearold range id saytry gruelles raggedy ann series moving up from there baums oz books are good and alexanders chronicles of prydain eddings belgariad seems closest in tone and competence to xanth but without the puns you should like it then there is hamblys darwath trilogy and mccaffreys pern series my daughter cheryl also recommends the doctor who books i dont but cheryl is thirteen and im forty nine so she may know better than i do after that youre ready for the hard stuff you can safely sample anything put out by this publisher and proceed with caution to the offerings of other publishers along the way do try the elf quest comics by the pini couple there seems to be a fair overlap in readers between xanth and the elves and these are not cheap or inferior offerings why dont i write more novels featuring dor and irene as teenagers or king trent or bink or the centaurs etc every fan seems to have his favorite character and would like to see a series of novels centering on that one forever unchanging i refuse to do this because in xanth as in mundania life is not a static thing it keeps moving into new territory im not a formula writer i like each story to be different and original within the limits of the larger framework so new characters constantly appear and old ones gracefully fade out thats just the way it crewel lye has to be folks xanth has a few constants such as the geography the puns the magic and the struggle to get into the good magicians castle usually there is a serious romance and the conception organization and literacy are better than the critics choose to perceive beyond that anything can happen dear mr anthony im years old and i want to become a writer this is a direct quote from a letter i received today as i was typing this authors note and it is typical of a number of requests i receive a high percentage of my fans want to be writers so they ask me for advice thats sensible and im not disparaging this approach but its a hellish thing to answer ill try to digest it into a nutshell first catch your rabbit that is read a lot become familiar with your subject leam your syntax and spelling and learn to type editors are a peculiar breed they dont know how to read a hand written manuscript go to the library and read a good book on the subject of writing such as one by jack wood ford and pay attention to what it says then write re write rerewrite and revise until its the best you can do get a copy of writers market or similar find several good prospects and ship your manuscript to the one that appeals to you most in the genres of fantasy and science fiction del rey books will consider your manuscript good luck you fool the odds are still a hundred to one against you it took me eight years of trying to make my first sale and i was twentyeight years old at the time if you are better than i am you may do it faster if your interest is easy money be advised that the average writ ers earnings from writing put him somewhere below the poverty level even if you are successful you will prob ably be lean and hungry now do you see why i dont like to answer this question i really dont like reducing thirteenyearold girls to tears and no part of this is a joke oh sureim not starving any more but i got lucky you can count on the fingers of one foot the con temporary fantasy writers who are more successful than i am but it did take time and luck this leads into my most important advice make sure crewel lye you have some other source of money while youre trying to write such as a working spouse so that you dont starve my wife worked for several years before and after i made my first sale otherwise could not have done it even so it was a narrow squeak talent if you have it is only one of a number of requirements for eventual success you have to be ready to absorb a fair amount of grief along the way another typical question will i autograph thirtyfive copies of my books if they are sent to me sigh id really rather not even one book is a chore to handle and reship and costs me more in working time than the book is worth i prefer to have my readers understand what im saying rather than to dote on a confounded signature scrawl ill sign copies at conventions lots of luck as a rule i dont attend conventions and bookstores otherwise please leave me alone will i dedicate a book to a fan no there are simply too many fans but i am dedicating this paragraph to alan carpenter and his sister karen and finally will there be another xanth novel and whats it ail about yes there will be more puns are already piling in for it the pesky things its titled golem in the gears and its about grundy the golem who rides the monster under the bed on his quest to find the little lost dragon for ivy and how he finds true love and laugh ter with the lovely lonely longlocked rapunzel the dis tant descendant of jordan the barbarian and bluebell elf stop stop ill never get the thing written if sanity doesnt return soon about the author piers anthony lives near the north village ofxanth he and his wife carol recently arranged to buy pan of the gap chasm but hostile magic intervened and longforgotten mundane reversion clauses interfered with all but a fragment of it his daughter penny still rides the night mare but his daughter cheryl now associates with elves instead of ogres cruet lye is the eighth xanth novel smuggled into mundania the first one a spelt for chameleon won the august derleth fan tasy award as the best novel for the year the fifth sixth and seventh xanth novels made the new york times bestseller list the last also peaking at number one on both the b dalton and wal denbooks bestseller lists of course no one inxanth pays attention to such things but mundania is a strange place
