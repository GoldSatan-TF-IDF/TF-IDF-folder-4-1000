the charnel god clark ashton smith mordiggian is the god of zulbhasair said the innkeeper with unctuous solemnity he has been the god from years that are lost to mans memory in shadow deeper than the subterranes of his black temple there is no other god in zulbhasair and all who die within the walls of the city are sacred to mordiggian even the kings and the optimates at death are delivered into the hands of his muffled priests it is the law and the custom a little while and the priests will come for your bride but elaith is not dead protested the youth phariom for the third or fourth time in piteous desperation her malady is one that assumes the lying likeness of death twice before has she lain insensible with a pallor upon her cheeks and a stillness in her very blood that could hardly be distinguished from those of the tomb and twice she has awakened after an interim of days the innkeeper peered with an air of ponderous unbelief at the girl who lay white and motionless as a mown lily on the bed in the poorly furnished attic chamber in that case you should not have brought her into zulbhasair he averred in a tone of owlish irony the physician has pronounced her dead and her death has been reported to the priests she must go to the temple of mordiggian but we are outlanders guests of a night we have come from the land of xylac far in the north and this morning we should have gone on through tasuun toward pharaad the capital of yoros which lies near to the southern sea surely your god could have no claim upon elaith even if she were truly dead all who die in zulbhasair are the property of mordiggian insisted the taverner sententiously outlanders are not exempt the dark maw of his temple yawns eternally and no man no child no woman throughout the years has evaded its yawning all mortal flesh must become in due time the provender of the god phariom shuddered at the oily and portentous declaration dimly have i heard of mordiggian as a legend that travellers tell in xylac he admitted but i had forgotten the name of his city and elaith and i came ignorantly into zulbhasair even had i known i should have doubted the terrible custom of which you inform me what manner of deity is this who imitates the hyena and the vulture surely he is no god but a ghoul take heed lest you utter blasphemy admonished the innkeeper mordiggian is old and omnipotent as death he was worshipped in former continents before the lifting of zothique from out the sea through him we are saved from corruption and the worm even as the people of other places devote their dead to the consuming flame so we of zulbhasair deliver ours to the god awful is the fane a place of terror and obscure shadow untrod by the sun into which the dead are borne by his priests and are laid on a vast table of stone to await his coming from the nether vault in which he dwells no living men other than the priests have ever beheld him and the faces of the priests are hidden behind masks of silver and even their hands are shrouded that men may not gaze on them that have seen mordiggian but there is a king in zulbhasair is there not i shall appeal to him against this heinous and horrible injustice surely he will heed me phenquor is the king but he could not help you even if he wished your appeal will not even be heard mordiggian is above all kings and his law is sacred hark for already the priests come phariom sick at heart with the charnel terror and cruelty of the doom that impended for his girlish wife in this unknown city of nightmare heard an evil stealthy creaking on the stairs that led to the attic of the inn the sound drew nearer with inhuman rapidity and four strange figures came into the room heavily garbed in funereal purple and wearing huge masks of silver graven in the likeness of skulls it was impossible to surmise their actual appearance for even as the taverner had hinted their very hands were concealed by fingerless gloves and the purple gowns came down in loose folds that trailed about their feet like unwinding cerecloths there was a horror about them of which the macabre masks were only a lesser element a horror that lay partly in their unnatural crouching attitudes and the beastlike agility with which they moved unhampered by their cumbrous habiliments among them they carried a curious bier made from interwoven strips of leather and with monstrous bones that served for frame and handles the leather was greasy and blackened as if from long years of mortuary use without speaking to phariom or the innkeeper and with no delay or formality of any sort they advanced toward the bed on which elaith was lying undeterred by their more than formidable aspect and wholly distraught with grief and anger phariom drew from his girdle a short knife the only weapon he possessed disregarding the minatory cry of the taverner he rushed wildly upon the muffled figures he was quick and muscular and moreover was clad in light closefitting raiment such as would seemingly have given him a brief advantage the priests had turned their backs upon him but as if they had foreseen his every action two of them wheeled about with the swiftness of tigers dropping the handles of bone that they carried one of them struck the knife from pharioms hand with a movement that the eye could barely follow in its snaky darting then both assailed him beating him back with terrible flailing blows of their shrouded arms and hurling him half across the room into an empty corner stunned by his fall he lay senseless for a term of minutes recovering glazedly with eyes that blurred as he opened them he beheld the fact of the stout taverner stooping above him like a tallowcolored moon the thought of elaith more sharp than the thrust of a dagger brought him back to agonizing consciousness fearfully he scanned the shadowy room and saw that the ceremented priests were gone that the bed was vacant he heard the orotund and sepulchral croaking of the taverner the priests of mordiggian are merciful they make allowance for the frenzy and distraction of the newly bereaved it is well for you that they are compassionate and considerate of mortal weakness phariom sprang erect as if his bruised and aching body were scorched by a sudden fire pausing only to retrieve his knife which still lay in the middle of the room he started toward the door he was stopped by the hand of the hosteler clutching greasily at his shoulder beware lest you exceed the bounds of the mercy of mordiggian it is an ill thing to follow his priests and a worse thing to intrude upon the deathly and sacred gloom of his temple phariom scarcely heard the admonition he wrenched himself hastily away from the odious fingers and turned to go but again the hand clutched him at least pay me the money that you owe for food and lodging ere you depart demanded the innkeeper also there is the matter of the physicians fee which i can settle for you if you will entrust me with the proper sum pay now for there is no surety that you will return phariom drew out the purse that contained his entire worldly wealth and filled the greedily cupped palm before him with coins that he did not pause to count with no parting word or backward glance he descended the moldy and musty stairs of the wormeaten hostelry as if spurred by an incubus and went out into the gloomy serpentine streets of zulbhasair perhaps the city differed little from others except in being older and darker but to phariom in his extremity of anguish the ways that he followed were like subterrene corridors that led only to some profound and monstrous charnel the sun had risen above the overjutting houses but it seemed to him that there was no light other than a lost and doleful glimmering such as might descend into mortuary depths the people it may have been were much like other people but he saw them under a malefic aspect as if they were ghouls and demons that went to and fro on the ghastly errands of a necropolis bitterly in his distraction he recalled the previous evening when he had entered zulbhasair at twilight with elaith the girl riding on the one dromedary that had survived their passage of the northern desert and he walking beside her weary but content with the rosy purple of afterglow upon its walls and cupolas with the deepening golden eyes of its lit windows the place had seemed a fair and nameless city of dreams and they had planned to rest there for a day or two before resuming the long arduous journey to pharaad in yoros this journey had been undertaken only through necessity phariom an impoverished youth of noble blood had been exiled because of the political and religious tenets of his family which were not in accord with those of the reigning emperor caleppos taking his newly wedded wife phariom had set out for yoros where certain allied branches of the house to which he belonged had already established themselves and would give him a fraternal welcome they had travelled with a large caravan of merchants going directly southward to tasuun beyond the borders of xylac amid the red sands of the celotian waste the caravan had been attacked by robbers who had slain many of its members and dispersed the rest phariom and his bride escaping with their dromedaries had found themselves lost and alone in the desert and failing to regain the road toward tasuun had taken inadvertently another track leading to zulbhasair a walled metropolis on the southwestern verge of the waste which their itinerary had not included entering zulbhasair the couple had repaired for reasons of economy to a tavern in the humbler quarter there during the night elaith had been overcome by the third seizure of the cataleptic malady to which she was liable the earlier seizures occurring before her marriage to phariom had been recognized in their true character by the physicians of xylac and had been palliated by skillful treatment it was hoped that the malady would not recur the third attack no doubt had been induced by the fatigues and hardships of the journey phariom had felt sure that elaith would recover but a doctor of zulbhasair hastily summoned by the innkeeper had insisted that she was actually dead and in obedience to the strange law of the city had reported her without delay to the priests of mordiggian the frantic protests of the husband had been utterly ignored there was it seemed a diabolic fatality about the whole train of circumstances through which elaith still living though with that outward aspect of the tomb which her illness involved had fallen into the grasp of the devotees of the charnel god phariom pondered this fatality almost to madness as he strode with furious aimless haste along the eternally winding and crowded streets to the cheerless information received from the taverner he added as he went on more and more of the tardily remembered legends which he had heard in xylac ill and dubious indeed was the renown of zulbhasair and he marvelled that he should have forgotten it and cursed himself with black curses for the temporary but fatal forgetfulness better would it have been if he and elaith had perished in the desert rather than enter the wide gates that stood always open gaping for their prey as was the custom of zulbhasair the city was a mart of trade where outland travelers came but did not care to linger because of the repulsive cult of mordiggian the invisible eater of the dead who was believed to share his provender with the shrouded priests it was said that the bodies lay for days in the dark temple and were not devoured till corruption had begun and people whispered of fouler things than necrophagism of blasphemous rites that were solemnized in the ghoulridden vaults and nameless uses to which the dead were put before mordiggian claimed them in all outlying places the fate of those who died in zulbhasair was a dreadful byword and a malediction but to the people of that city reared in the faith of the ghoulish god it was merely the usual and expected mode of mortuary disposal tombs graves catacombs funeral pyres and other such nuisances were rendered needless by this highly utilitarian deity phariom was surprised to see the people of the city going about the common businesses of life porters were passing with bales of household goods upon their shoulders merchants were squatting in their shops like other merchants buyers and sellers chaffered loudly in the public bazaars women laughed and chattered in the door ways only by their voluminous robes of red black and violet and their strange uncouth accents was he able to distinguish the men of zulbhasair from those who were outlanders like himself the murk of nightmare began to lift from his impressioms and gradually as he went on the spectacle of everyday humanity all about him helped to calm a little his wild distraction and desperation nothing could dissipate the horror of his loss and the abominable fate that threatened elaith but now with a cool logic born of the cruel exigence he began to consider the apparently hopeless problem of rescuing her from the ghoul gods temple he composed his features and constrained his febrile pacing to an idle saunter so that none might guess the preoccupations that racked him inwardly pretending to be interested in the wares of a seller of mens apparel he drew the dealer into converse regarding zulbhasair and its customs and made such inquiries as a traveler from far lands might make the dealer was talkative and phariom soon learned from him the location of the temple of mordiggian which stood at the citys core he also learned that the temple was open at all hours and that people were free to come and go within its precincts there were however no rituals of worship other than certain private rites that were celebrated by the priesthood few cared to enter the fane because of a superstition that any living person who intruded upon its gloom would return to it shortly as the provender of the god mordiggian it seemed was a benign deity in the eyes of the inhabitants of zulbhasair curiously enough no definite personal attributes were ascribed to him he was so to speak an impersonal force akin to the elements a consuming and cleansing power like fire his hierophants were equally mysterious they lived at the temple and emerged from it only in the execution of their funeral duties no one knew the manner of their recruiting but many believed that they were both male and female thus renewing their numbers from generation to generation with no ulterior commerce others thought that they were not human beings at all but an order of subterranean earthentities who lived for ever and who fed upon corpses like the god himself through this latter belief of late years a minor heresy had risen some holding that mordiggian was a mere hieratic figment and the priests were the sole devourers of the dead the dealer quoting this heresy made haste to disavow it with pious reprobation phariom chatted for awhile on other topics and then continued his progress through the city going as forthrightly toward the temple as the obliquely running thoroughfares would permit he had formed no conscious plan but desired to reconnoiter the vicinage in that which the garmentdealer had told him the one reassuring detail was the openness of the fane and its accessibility to all who dared enter the rarity of visitors however would make phariom conspicuous and he wished above all to avoid attention on the other hand any effort to remove bodies from the temple was seemingly unheard of a thing audacious beyond the dreams of the people of zulbhasair through the very boldness of his design he might avoid suspicion and succeed in rescuing elaith the streets that he followed began to tend downward and were narrower dimmer and more tortuous than any he had yet traversed he thought for awhile that he had lost his way and he was about to ask the passersby to redirect him when four of the priests of mordiggian bearing one of the curious litterlike biers of bone and leather emerged from an ancient alley just before him the bier was occupied by the body of a girl and for one moment of convulsive shock and agitation that left him trembling phariom thought that the girl was elaith looking again he saw his mistake the gown that the girl wore though simple was made of some rare exotic stuff her features though pale as those of elaith were crowned with curls like the petals of heavy black poppies her beauty warm and voluptuous even in death differed from the blond pureness of elaith as tropic lilies differ from narcissi quietly and maintaining a discreet interval phariom followed the sullenly shrouded figures and their lovely burden he saw that people made way for the passage of the bier with awed unquestioning alacrity and the loud voices of hucksters and chafferers were hushed as the priests went by overhearing a murmured conversation between two of the townsfolk he learned that the dead girl was arctela daughter of quaos a high noble and magistrate of zulbhasair she had died very quickly and mysteriously from a cause unknown to the physicians which had not marred or wasted her beauty in the least there were those who held that an indetectable poison rather than disease had been the agency of death and others deemed her the victim of malefic sorcery the priests went on and phariom kept them in sight as well as he could in the blind tangle of streets the way steepened without affording any clear prospect of the levels below and the houses seemed to crowd more closely as if huddling back from a precipice finally the youth emerged behind his macabre guides in a sort of circular hollow at the citys heart where the temple of mordiggian loomed alone and separate amid pavements of sad onyx and funerary cedars whose green had blackened as if with the undeparting charnel shadows bequeathed by dead ages the edifice was built of a strange stone hued as with the blackish purple of carnal decay a stone that refused the ardent luster of noon and the prodigality of dawn or sunset glory it was low and windowless having the form of a monstrous mausoleum its portals yawned sepulchrally in the gloom of the cedars phariom watched the priests as they vanished within the portals carrying the girl arctela like phantoms who bear a phantom burden the broad area of pavement between the recoiling houses and the temple was now deserted but he did not venture to cross it in the blare of betraying daylight circling the area he saw that there were several other entrances to the great fane all open and unguarded there was no sign of activity about the place but he shuddered at the thought of that which was hidden within its walls even as the feasting of worms is hidden in the marble tomb like a vomiting of charnels the abominations of which he had heard rose up before him in the sunlight and again he drew close to madness knowing that elaith must lie among the dead in the temple with the foul umbrage of such things upon her and that he consumed with unremitting frenzy must wait for the favorable shrouding of darkness before he could execute his nebulous doubtful plan of rescue in the meanwhile she might awake and perish from the mortal horror of her surroundings or worse even than this might befall if the whispered tales were true abnontha sorcerer and necromancer was felicitating himself on the bargain he had made with the priests of mordiggian he felt perhaps justly that no one less clever than he could have conceived and executed the various procedures that had made possible this bargain through which arctela daughter of the proud quaos would became his unquestioning slave no other lover he told himself could have been resourceful enough to obtain a desired woman in this fashion arctela betrothed to alos a young noble of the city was seemingly beyond the aspiration of a sorcerer abnontha however was no common hedgewizard but an adept of long standing in the most awful and profound arcana of the black arts he knew the spells that kill more quickly and surely than knife or poison at a distance and he knew also the darker spells by which the dead can be reanimated even after years or ages of decay he had slain arctela in a manner that none could detect with a rare and subtle invultuation that had left no mark and her body lay now among the dead in mordiggians temple tonight with the tacit connivance of the terrible shrouded priests he would bring her back to life abnontha was not native to zulbhasair but had come many years before from the infamous halfmythic isle of sotar lying somewhere to the east of the huge continent of zothique like a sleek young vulture he had established himself in the very shadow of the charnel fane and had prospered taking to himself pupils and assistants his dealings with the priests were long and extensive and the bargain he had just made was far from being the first of its kind they had allowed him the temporary use of bodies claimed by mordiggian stipulating only that these bodies should not be removed from the temple during the course of any of his experiments in necromancy since the privilege was slightly irregular from their viewpoint he had found it necessary to bribe them not however with gold but with the promise of a liberal purveyance of matters more sinister and corruptible than gold the arrangement had been satisfactory enough to all concerned cadavers had poured into the temple with more than their usual abundance ever since the coming of the sorcerer the god had not lacked for provender and abnontha had never lacked for subjects on which to employ his more baleful spells on the whole abnontha was not illpleased with himself he reflected moreover that aside from his mastery of magic and his sleightful ingenuity he was about to manifest a wellnigh unexampled courage he had planned a robbery that would amount to dire sacrilege the removal of the reanimated body of arctela from the temple such robberies and the penalty attached to them were a matter of legend only for none had occurred in recent ages thrice terrible according to common belief was the doom of those who had tried and failed the necromancer was not blind to the risks of his enterprise nor on the other hand was he deterred or intimidated by them his two assistants narghai and vembatsith apprised of his intention had made with all due privity the necessary preparations for their flight from zulbhasair the strong passion that the sorcerer had conceived for arctela was not his only motive perhaps in removing from that city he was desirous of change for he had grown a little weary of the odd laws that really served to restrict his necromantic practices while facilitating them in a sense he planned to travel southward and establish himself in one of the cities of tasuun an empire famous for the number and antiquity of its mummies it was now sunsettime five dromedaries bred for racing waited in the inner courtyard of abnonthas house a high and moldering mansion that seemed to lean forward upon the open circular area belonging to the temple one of the dromedaries would carry a bale containing the sorcerers most valuable books manuscripts and other impedimenta of magic its fellows would bear abnontha the two assistants and arctela narghai and vembatsith appeared before their master to tell him that all was made ready both were much younger than abnontha but like himself they were outlanders in zulbhasair they came of the swart and narroweyed people of naat an isle that was little less infamous than sotar it is well said the necromancer as they stood before him with lowered eyes after making their announcement we have only to await the favorable hour midway between sunset and moonrise when the priests are at their supper in the nether adytum we will enter the temple and perform that which must be done for the rising of arctela they feed well tonight for i know that many of the dead grow ripe on the great table in the upper sanctuary and it may be that mordiggian feeds also none will come to watch us at our doings but master said narghai shivering a little beneath his robe of nacarat red is it wise after all to do this thing must you take the girl from the temple always ere this you have contented yourself with the brief loan that the priests allow and have rendered back the dead in the required state of exanimation truly is it well to violate the law of the god men say that the wrath of mordiggian though seldom loosed is more dreadful than the wrath of all other deities for this reason none has dared to defraud him in latter years or attempt the removal of any of the corpses from his fane long ago it is told a high noble of the city bore hence the cadaver of a woman he had loved and fled with it into the desert but the priests pursued him running more swiftly than jackals and the fate that overtook him is a thing whereof the legends whisper but dimly i fear neither mordiggian nor his creatures said abnontha with a solemn vainglory in his voice my dromedaries can outrun the priests even granting that the priests are not men at all but ghouls as some say and there is small likelihood that they will follow us after their feasting tonight they will sleep like gorged vultures the morrow will find us far on the road to tasuun ere they awake the master is right interpolated vembatsith we have nothing to fear but they say that mordiggian does not sleep insisted narghai and that he watches all things eternally from his black vault beneath the temple so i have heard said abnontha with a dry and learned air but i consider that such beliefs are mere superstition there is nothing to confirm them in the real nature of corpseeating entities so far i have never beheld mordiggian either sleeping or awake but in all likelihood he is merely a common ghoul i know these demons and their habits they differ from hyenas only through their monstrous shape and size and their immortality still i must deem it an ill thing to cheat mordiggian muttered narghai beneath his breath the words were caught by the quick ears of abnontha nay there is no question of cheating well have i served mordiggian and his priesthood and amply have i larded their black table also i shall keep in a sense the bargain i have made concerning arctela the providing of a new cadaver in return for my necromantic privilege tomorrow the youth alos the betrothed of arctela will lie in her place among the dead go now and leave me for i must devise the inward invultuation that will rot the heart of alos like a worm that awakens at the core of fruit to phariom fevered and distraught it seemed that the cloudless day went by with the sluggishness of a corpseclogged river unable to calm his agitation he wandered aimlessly through the thronged bazaars till the western towers grew dark on a heaven of saffron flame and the twilight rose like a gray and curdling sea among the houses then he returned to the inn where elaith had been stricken and claimed the dromedary which he had left in the tavern stables riding the animal through dim thoroughfares lit only by the covert gleam of lamps or tapers from halfclosed windows he found his way once more to the citys center the dusk had thickened into darkness when he came to the open area surrounding mordiggians temple the windows of mansions fronting the area were shut and lightless as dead eyes and the fane itself a colossal bulk of gloom was rayless as any mausoleum beneath the gathering stars no one it seemed was abroad and though the quietude was favorable to his project phariom shivered with a chill of deathly menace and desolation the hoofs of his camel rang on the pavement with a startling and preternatural clangor and he thought that the ears of hidden ghouls listening alertly behind the silence must surely hear them however there was no stirring of life in that sepulchral gloom reaching the shelter of one of the thick groups of ancient cedars he dismounted and tied the dromedary to a lowgrowing branch keeping among the trees like a shadow among shadows he approached the temple with infinite wariness and circled it slowly finding that its four doorways which corresponded to the four quarters of the earth were all wide open deserted and equally dark returning at length to the eastern side on which he had tethered his camel he emboldened himself to enter the blackly gaping portal crossing the threshold he was engulfed instantly by a dead and clammy darkness touched with the faint fetor of corruption and a smell as of charred bone and flesh he thought that he was in a huge corridor and feeling his way forward along the righthand wall he soon came to a sudden turn and saw a bluish glimmering far ahead as if in some central adytum where the hall ended massy columns were silhouetted against the glimmering and across it as he drew nearer several dark and muffled figures passed presenting the profiles of enormous skulls two of them were sharing the burden of a human body which they carried in their arms to phariom pausing in the shadowy hall it appeared that the vague taint of putrescence upon the air grew stronger for a few instants after the figure had come and gone they were not succeeded by any others and the fane resumed its mausolean stillness but the youth waited for many minutes doubtful and trepidant before venturing to go on an oppression of mortuary mystery thickened the air and stifled him like the noisome effluvia of catacombs his ears became intolerably acute and he heard a dim humming a sound of deep and viscid voices indistinguishably bent that appeared to issue from crypts beneath the temple stealing at length to the halls end he peered beyond into what was obviously the main sanctuary a low and manypillared room whose vastness was but halfrevealed by the bluish fires that glowed and flickered in numerous urnlike vessels borne aloft on slender stelae phariom hesitated upon that awful threshold for the mingled odors of burnt and decaying flesh were heavier on the air as if he had drawn nearer to their sources and the thick humming seemed to ascend from a dark stairway in the floor beside the lefthand wall but the room to all appearance was empty of life and nothing stirred except the wavering lights and shadows the watcher discerned the outlines of a vast table in the center carved from the same black stone as the building itself upon the table half lit by the flaming urns or shrouded by the umbrage of the heavy columns a number of people lay side by side and phariom knew that he had found the black altar of mordiggian whereon were disposed the bodies claimed by the god a wild and stifling fear contended with a wilder hope in his bosom trembling he went toward the table and a cold clamminess wrought by the presence of the dead assailed him the table was nearly thirty feet in length and it rose waisthigh on a dozen mighty legs beginning at the nearer end he passed along the row of corpses peering fearfully into each upturned face both sexes and many ages and differing ranks were represented nobles and rich merchants were crowded by beggars in filthy rags some were newly dead and others it seemed had lain there for days and were beginning to show the marks of corruption there were many gaps in the ordered row suggesting that certain of the corpses had been removed phariom went on in the dim light searching for the loved features of elaith at last when he was nearing the further end and had begun to fear that she was not among them he found her with the cryptic pallor and stillness of her strange malady upon her she lay unchanged on the chill stone a great thankfulness was born in the heart of phariom for he felt sure that she was not dead and that she had not awakened at any time to the horrors of the temple if he could bear her away from the hateful purlieus of zulbhasair without detection she would recover from her deathsimulating sickness cursorily he noted that another woman was lying beside elaith and recognized her as the beautiful arctela whose bearers he had followed almost to the portals of the fane he gave her no second glance but stooped to lift elaith in his arms at that moment he heard a murmur of low voices in the direction of the door by which he had entered the sanctuary thinking that some of the priests had returned he dropped swiftly on hands and knees and crawled beneath the ponderous table which afforded the only accessible hidingplace retreating into shadow beyond the glimmering shed from the lofty urns he waited and looked out between the pillarthick legs the voices grew louder and he saw the curiously sandaled feet and shortish robes of three persons who approached the table of the dead and paused in the very spot where he himself had stood a few instants before who they were he could not surmise but their garments of light and swarthy red were not the shroudings of mordiggians priests he was uncertain whether or not they had seen him and crouching in the low space beneath the table he plucked his dagger from its sheath now he was able to distinguish three voices one solemn and unctuously imperative one somewhat guttural and growling and the other shrill and nasal the accents were alien differing from those of the men of zulbhasair and the words were often strange to phariom also much of the converse was inaudible here at the end said the solemn voice be swift we have no time to loiter yes master came the growling voice but who is this other truly she is very fair a discussion seemed to take place in discreetly lowered tones apparently the owner of the guttural voice was urging something that the other two opposed the listener could distinguish only a word or two here and there but he gathered that the name of the first person was vembitsith and that the one who spoke in a nasal shrilling was called narghai at last above the others the grave accents of the man addressed only as the master were clearly audible i do not altogether approve it will delay our departure and the two must ride on one dromedary but take her vembatsith if you can perform the necessary spells unaided i have no time for a double incantation it will be a good test of your proficiency there was a mumbling as of thanks or acknowledgment from vembatsith then the voice of the master be quiet now and make haste to phariom wondering vaguely and uneasily as to the import of this colloquy it seemed that two of the three men pressed closer to the table as if stooping above the dead he heard a rustling of cloth upon stone and an instant later he saw that all three were departing among the columns and stelae in a direction opposite to that from which they had entered the sanctuary two of them carried burdens that glimmered palely and indistinctly in the shadows a black horror clutched at the heart of phariom for all too clearly he surmised the nature of those burdens and the possible identity of one of them quickly he crawled forth from his hidingplace and saw that elaith was gone from the black table together with the girl arctela he saw the vanishing of shadowy figures in the gloom that zoned the chambers western wall whether the abductors were ghouls or worse than ghouls he could not know but he followed swiftly forgetful of all caution in his concern for elaith reaching the wall he found the mouth of a corridor and plunged into it headlong somewhere in the gloom ahead he saw a ruddy glimmering of light then he heard a sullen metallic grating and the glimmer narrowed to a slitlike gleam as if the door of the chamber from which it issued were being closed following the blind wall he came to that slit of crimson light a door of darkly tarnished bronze had been left ajar and phariom peered in on a weird unholy scene illumined by the bloodlike flames that flared and soared unsteadily from high urns upborne on sable pedestals the room was full of a sensuous luxury that accorded strangely with the dull funereal stone of that temple of death there were couches and carpets of superbly figured stuffs vermilion gold azure silver and jeweled censers of unknown metals stood in the corners a low table at one side was littered with curious bottles and occult appliances such as might be used in medicine or sorcery elaith was lying on one of the couches and near her on a second couch the body of the girl arctela had been disposed the abductors whose faces phariom now beheld for the first time were busying themselves with singular preparations that mystified him prodigiously his impulse to invade the room was repressed by a sort of wonder that held him enthralled and motionless one of the three a tall middleaged man whom he identified as the master had assembled certain peculiar vessels including a small brazier and a censer and had set them on the floor beside arctela the second a younger man with lecherously slitted eyes had placed similar impedimenta before elaith the third who was also young and evil of aspect merely stood and looked on with an apprehensive uneasy air phariom divined that the men were sorcerers when with a deftness born of long practice they lit the censers and braziers and began simultaneously the intonation of rhythmically measured words in a strange tongue accompanied by the sprinkling at regular intervals of black oils that fell with a great hissing on the coals in the braziers and sent up enormous clouds of pearly smoke dark threads of vapor serpentined from the censers interweaving themselves like veins through the dim misshapen figures as of ghostly giants that were formed by the lighter fumes a reek of intolerably acrid balsams filled the chamber assailing and troubling the senses of phariom till the scene wavered before him and took on a dreamlike vastness a narcotic distortion the voices of the necromancers mounted and fell as if in some unholy paean imperious exigent they seemed to implore the consummation of forbidden blasphemy like thronging phantoms writhing and swirling with malignant life the vapors rose about the couches on which lay the dead girl and the girl who bore the outward likeness of death then as the fumes were riven apart in their baleful seething phariom saw that the pale figure of elaith had stirred like a sleeper who awakens that she had opened her eyes and was lifting a feeble hand from the gorgeous couch the younger necromancer ceased his chanting on a sharply broken cadence but the solemn tones of the other still went on and still there was a spell on the limbs and senses of phariom making it impossible for him to stir slowly the vapors thinned like a rout of dissolving phantoms the watcher saw that the dead girl arctela was rising to her feet like a somnambulist the chanting of abnontha standing before her came sonorously to an end in the awful silence that followed phariom heard a weak cry from elaith and then the jubilant growling voice of vembatsith who was stooping above her behold o abnontha my spells are swifter than yours for she that i have chosen awakened before arctela phariom was released from his thralldom as if through the lifting of an evil enchantment he flung back the ponderous door of darkened bronze that ground with protesting clangors on its hinges his dagger drawn he rushed into the room elaith her eyes wide with piteous bewilderment turned toward him and made an ineffectual effort to arise from the couch arctela mute and submissive before abnontha appeared to heed nothing but the will of the necromancer she was like a fair and soulless automaton the sorcerers turning as phariom entered sprang back with instant agility before his onset and drew the short cruelly crooked swords which they all carried narghai struck the knife from pharioms fingers with a darting blow that shattered its thin blade at the hilt and vembatsith his weapon swinging back in a vicious arc would have killed the youth promptly if abnontha had not intervened and bade him stay phariom standing furious but irresolute before the lifted swords was aware of the darkly searching eyes of abnontha like those of some nyctalopic bird of prey i would know the meaning of this intrusion said the necromancer truly you are bold to enter the temple of mordiggian i came to find the girl who lies yonder declared phariom she is elaith my wife who was claimed unjustly by the god but tell me why have you brought her to this room from the table of mordiggian and what manner of men are you that raise up the dead as you have raised this other woman i am abnontha the necromancer and these others are my pupils narghai and vembatsith give thanks to vembatsith for verily he has brought back your wife from the purlieus of the dead with a skill excelling that of his master she awoke ere the incantation was finished phariom glared with implacable suspicion at abnontha elaith was not dead but only as one in a trance he averred it was not your pupils sorcery that awakened her and verily whether elaith be dead or living is not a matter that should concern any but myself permit us to depart for i wish to remove with her from zulbhasair in which we are only passing travelers so speaking he turned his back on the necromancers and went over to elaith who regarded him with dazed eyes but uttered his name feebly as he clasped her in his arms now this is a remarkable coincidence purred abnontha i and my pupils are also planning to depart from zulbhasair and we start this very night perhaps you will honor us with your company i thank you said phariom curtly but i am not sure that our roads lie together elaith and i would go toward tasuun now by the black altar of mordiggian that is still stranger coincidence for tasuun is also our destination we take with us the resurrected girl arctela whom i have deemed too fair for the charnel god and his ghouls phariom divined the dark evil that lay behind the oily mocking speeches of the necromancer also he saw the furtive and sinister sign that abnontha had made to his assistants weaponless he could only give a formal assent to the sardonic proposal he knew well that he would not be permitted to leave the temple alive for the narrow eyes of narghai and vembatsith regarding him closely were alight with the red lust of murder come said abnontha in a voice of imperious command it is time to go he turned to the still figure of arctela and spoke an unknown word with vacant eyes and noctambulistic paces she followed at his heels as he stepped toward the open door phariom had helped elaith to her feet and was whispering words of reassurance in an effort to lull the growing horror and confused alarm that he saw in her eyes she was able to walk albeit slowly and uncertainly vembatsith and narghai drew back motioning that she and phariom should precede them but phariom sensing their intent to slay him as soon as his back was turned obeyed unwillingly and looked desperately about for something that he could seize as a weapon one of the metal braziers full of smoldering coals was at his very feet he stooped quickly lifted it in his hands and turned upon the necromancers vembatsith as he had suspected was prowling toward him with upraised sword and was making ready to strike phariom hurled the brazier and its glowing contents full in the necromancers face and vembatsith went down with a terrible smothered cry narghai snarling ferociously leapt foreward to assail the defenseless youth his scimitar gleamed with a wicked luster in the lurid glare of the urns as he swung it back for the blow but the weapon did not fall and phariom steeling himself against the impending death became aware that narghai was staring beyond him as if petrified by the vision of some gorgonian specter as if compelled by another will than his own the youth turned and saw the thing that had halted narghais blow arctela and abnontha pausing before the open door were outlined against a colossal shadow that was not wrought by anything in the room it filled the portals from side to side it towered above the lintel and then swiftly it became more than a shadow it was a bulk of darkness black and opaque that somehow blinded the eyes with a strange dazzlement it seemed to suck the flame from the red urns and fill the chamber with a chill of utter death and voidness its form was that of a wormshapen column huge as a dragon its further coils still issuing from the gloom of the corridor but it changed from moment to moment swirling and spinning as if alive with the vortical energies of dark eons briefly it took the semblance of some demoniac giant with eyeless head and limbless body and then leaping and spreading like smoky fire it swept forward into the chamber abnontha fell back before it with frantic mumblings of malediction or exorcism but arctela pale and slight and motionless remained full in its path while the thing enfolded her and enveloped her with a hungry flaring until she was hidden wholly from view phariom supporting elaith who leaned weakly on his shoulder as if about to swoon was powerless to move he forgot the murderous narghai and it seemed that he and elaith were but faint shadows in the presence of embodied death and dissolution he saw the blackness grow and wax with the towering of fed flame as it closed about arctela and he saw it gleam with eddying hues of somber iris like the spectrum of a sable sun for an instant he heard a soft and flamelike murmuring then quickly and terribly the thing ebbed from the room arctela was gone as if she had dissolved like a phantom on the air borne on a sudden gust of strangely mingled heat and cold there came an acrid odor such as would rise from a burntout funeral pyre mordiggian shrilled narghai in hysteric terror it was the god mordiggian he has taken arctela it seemed that his cry was answered by a score of sardonic echoes unhuman as the howling of hyenas and yet articulate that repeated the name mordiggian into the room from the dark hall there poured a horde of creatures whose violet robes alone identified them in pharioms eyes as the priests of the ghoulgod they had removed the skulllike masks revealing heads and faces that were half anthropomorphic half canine and wholly diabolic also they had taken off the fingerless gloves there were at least a dozen of them their curving talons gleamed in the bloody light like the hooks of darkly tarnished metal their spiky teeth longer than coffin nails protruded from snarling lips they closed like a ring of jackals on abnontha and narghai driving them back into the farthest corner several others entering tardily fell with a bestial ferocity on vembatsith who had begun to revive and was moaning and writhing on the floor amid the scattered coals of the brazier they seemed to ignore phariom and elaith who stood looking on as if in some baleful trance but the hindmost ere he joined the assailants of vembatsith turned to the youthful pair and addressed them in a hoarse hollow voice like a tombreverberate barking go for mordiggian is a just god who claims only the dead and has no concern with the living and we the priests of mordiggian deal in our own fashion with those who would violate his law by removing the dead from the temple phariom with elaith still leaning on his shoulder went out into the dark hall hearing a hideous clamor in which the screams of men were mingled with a growling as of jackals a laughter as of hyenas the clamor ceased as they entered the bluelit sanctuary and passed toward the outer corridor and the silence that filled mordiggians fane behind them was deep as the silence of the dead on the black altartable
