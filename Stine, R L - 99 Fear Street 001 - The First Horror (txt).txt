really stabbed yourself jimmy youd better run upstairs and get a bandage yeah i guess jimmy replied quietly staring at his hand stupid screwdriver he tossed the tool against the wall i dont believe this climbing to his feet he let out an angry groan and furiously kicked the wall with the toe of his heavy work boot both boys uttered cries of surprise as a crack appeared in the wall oh man more work for us andy complained in the circle of yellow light they watched the crack grow wider an inch two inches and then they heard scuttling sounds the scratch of tiny footsteps hey jimmy exclaimed as the first longsnouted rat poked its head out of the crack this is a new house whered the rat come from the rat scuttled out into the light followed by another rat then three more jimmy gaped down at the tiny black eyes the glowing gray fur the snakelike pink tails hey get lost andy shouted he kicked at the nearest rat missed then he raised his eyes in time to see the black shadow start to wriggle out from the crack jimmy saw it too both boys stepped back their eyes wide with surprise at first they thought it was a snake but the shadow grew and changed shape it floated out of the crack in the wall darkening rising up then sweeping around them it swirled faster and faster surrounding the two boys then lowering and covering them like a dark heavy blanket they didnt even have time to struggle or cry out when the billowing shadow lifted a few seconds later they were dead both of them sprawled openmouthed and wideeyed on the concrete floor surrounded by the screeching rats chapter how old is the house cally frasier asked is it really old its pretty old mr frasier replied slowing the car for a stop sign i think it was built in the early sixties it needs work callys mother chimed in her eyes focused out the passenger window on green lawns the house hasnt been lived in for years i dont think its ever been lived in mr frasier said making a left onto a street called park drive huh the house is over thirty years old and no one has ever lived in it callys twin sister kody asked shrilly leaning forward from the backseat how come stop shoving me their nineyearold brother james said grumpily he was sitting between cally and kody and had been complaining the whole way to shadyside dont touch me im not touching you kody declared yes you are james insisted move over i wouldnt touch you youve got cooties kody exclaimed well youve got dog breath james shouted you stink stop it james mr frasier called back sharply were almost there i think he glanced over at his wife could you check the map are we going the right way what school is that cally asked staring out at a long redbrick school building i think thats the high school her mother replied struggling to unfold the map thats shadyside high cally cried i didnt picture it like that its so oldfashioned looking kody finished her sisters sentence for her cally and kody were fraternal twins not identical but they were always finishing each others sentences and thinking the same things at the same time they passed by the school quickly its windows were dark the doors all shut cally caught a glimpse of an empty football stadium behind the school two teenage girls on bikes rode slowly along the sidewalk laughing happily cally sighed she wondered what it would be like to start eleventh grade in a new school oh well i have all summer to worry about it she told herself these houses are nice is this our new neighborhood kody asked can i have a dog james demanded you promised i could have a dog when we moved were going the wrong way dear mrs frasier said softly biting her bottom lip i think you have to turn around fear street is the other way mr frasier uttered an unhappy groan what kind of a name is fear street kody demanded thats so weird who would name a street fear street when can i get the dog can i get it today james asked i think the street was named after one of the towns early settlers mrs frasier replied fretfully still studying the road map it was named after mister street cally joked she took pride in her sense of humor she was always cracking jokes and making puns it was one of the ways she differed from her twin kody was smart and quick but she didnt have much of a sense of humor james gave kodys shoulder a hard shove stop pushing me he screamed he leaned toward the front seat what about my dog the dog will be for all of us kody told him no way james insisted hes mine they promised mr frasier braked the car and eased it to the curb please he wailed could we please have five minutes of silence just till i find the house please everyone was silent for at least ten seconds then as his father eased the car away from the curb james asked so when do i get the dog mr frasier pulled the car up the gravel driveway about ten minutes later cally strained forward to see her new house through the windshield but there were so many old shade trees covering the front yard the house was nearly buried in darkness ninetynine fear street everybody out callys father announced cheerfully they piled out of the car stretching their arms and gazing through the trees at the sprawling house that awaited them well its big at least kody said quietly cally could see the disappointment on her sisters face its really big mr frasier said enthusiastically wait till you see your bedrooms just think their mother chimed in you two wont have to share a room anymore we were so cramped in that old apartment you kids wont know what to do with all this space ill know what to do james declared im going to have my own game room with a widescreen tv for my super nintendo and a real pinball machine good luck cally told james sarcastically rolling her eyes she reached down and messed up his wavy red hair he jerked away from her playfully swinging a fist in her direction isnt this great mr frasier exclaimed his dark eyes glowing behind his silverframed glasses isnt this great our own house cally forced a smile to her face she could see that everyone else in the family was forcing a smile too the house wasnt exactly great in fact it was really dark and depressing between the gnarled old trees the lawns wild tall weeds poked up at every angle through thick clumps of uncut grass fallen tree limbs littered the ground the twoandahalfstory house was nearly as wide as the yard its gray shingles were stained with brown streaks and were weatherbeaten the dark window shutters were peeling several were missing two upstairs windows appeared to stare back at cally like dark unseeing eyes the gutter at the side of the house was bent and hanging loose stainedglass windows on either side of the front door had once been beautiful but now the panes of glass were faded and cracked the pillar supporting the roof of the small porch tilted at an awkward angle and appeared about to topple cally swept her blond hair behind her slender shoulders she felt a cold shiver run down her back its such a beautiful sunny day she told herself staring up through the thicket of trees yet no sunlight filters down to the house no light at all its nearly as dark as night in this yard and the house is so cold and uninviting its going to take some work mr frasier said suddenly as if reading callys gloomy thoughts but thats why we got such a good deal on it i think its cool james chimed in he picked up a piece of gravel from the driveway and heaved it at a fat tree trunk the stone made a loud thonk as it hit get those worried expressions off your faces mrs frasier said to cally and kody well work on the house till it feels like home she raised her eyes to the overhanging trees first thing well do is cut down some trees and let the light in the house is haunted i know it is kody burst out all at once cally laughed you and your ghosts she said rolling her eyes you thought our apartment was haunted too remember and it turned out to be a squirrel trapped in a wall but this house is old kody insisted old and creepy ive read so many books about haunted houses one book said youve really got to stop reading those books mrs frasier murmured lots of old houses are haunted by spirits of the people who used to live in them kody continued ignoring her mother lots but no one ever lived in this house cally declared youre going to be the first one to haunt it kody cally stretched her hands straight out and let out a long ghostlike wail oooowooooooo give me a break kody moaned youre not funny cally i get a little sick of you making fun of me all the time you know cally cut her ghost howl short startled by kodys anger sorry she murmured really cally never wanted to hurt her sisters feelings she knew that kody was jealous of her in some ways cally is the pretty one cally is the funny one cally is the one with all the friends those were kodys complaints when she was feeling down feeling sorry for herself cally always tried to encourage her sister always tried to boost her spirits to remind her of her own terrific qualities maybe theres a ghost in my room james exclaimed excitedly then id have someone to talk to at night enough ghost talk you guys are giving me the creeps mr frasier said he placed one hand on callys shoulder and one hand on kodys shoulder and gently guided them back to the driveway lets start unpacking and go inside yeah james cried enthusiastically following them to the uhaul trailer hitched behind the car i want to see my new room and i want to see where my game room is going to be and i want to see where my dog is going to sleep whoa mrs frasier said softly one thing at a time mr frasier pulled the trailer door open he handed cally the first carton hey this is heavy cally cried be careful with it her mother warned its got our good china inside james stuck his foot out and pretended to try to trip cally youre a riot cally told him making a face at her brother remind me to laugh later walking unsteadily both hands gripping the bottom of the heavy cardboard carton cally made her way toward the front door what do i get to carry give me something heavy too she heard her brother declare behind her on the driveway cally was nearly to the front door when she heard the loud cracking sound above her head it sounded like dress fabric ripping only much louder she looked up in time to see a heavy tree branch break off the tree no time to scream she dropped to her knees and her hands shot up to cover her head first the shadow from the branch fell over her then the branch itself plummeted and landed with a shattering crash chapter cally heard the shrill screams of her family her heart pounded in her chest she sucked in a deep breath of cool damp air she blinked once twice cally forced herself to take another breath then another until her breathing started to happen automatically gazing down she saw that the crash had been the crash of china when the branch fell she had dropped the carton she gazed at the branch one end had caught on the porch roof the porch roof had stopped it from falling on her the roof she saw was damaged the heavy branch had driven a hole right through it the crash of china the crunch of the branch through the shingled roof not her skull im alive cally thought she turned to her family her legs trembled her knees felt all rubbery she didnt know if she could stand with cries of relief and joy they had all surrounded her her mother wrapped her in a tight hug youre okay youre okay her father repeated like a chant they all stood still for a long time in the shade in front of the house stood gratefully glad to be alive you broke the china jamess accusing voice cut through the silence finally cally glanced down at her brother he was bent over the open carton shaking his head studying the shattered contents of the box then suddenly they all began to talk at once what a great greeting cally declared shakily she stared at the fallen branch tilting out from the porch mr frasier made his way over to it and with great effort hoisted it off the roof and lowered it to the ground now we have even more work to do he said sighing now we have to fix the porch cally opened her mouth to say something but stopped when the man appeared behind her father the man stepped silently out of the darkness his face almost all in shadow his eyes fixed on cally and as he drew closer she saw that he had the strangest smile on his face a tense smile that appeared to be painted in place hello everyone okay the man said in a thin scratchy voice mr frasier spun around startled but his expression quickly softened mr lurie when did you arrive he asked mr lurie cally remembered was the real estate agent the man who had sold her parents this house as he stepped over the fallen tree branch and made his way toward them his smile didnt waver he was a short wiry man dressed in an expensivelooking gray suit he appeared to be fairly young but his hair was white and cut very short almost like brush bristles he had round black eyes that remained locked on cally i came to welcome you the real estate agent said finally turning his gaze to callys parents but just as i pulled up i saw the branch fall im so sorry he shook his head but his smile didnt fade were okay callys father replied he shook mr luries hand the kids are seeing the house for the first time and youre disappointed mr lurie asked staring again at cally a little cally confessed its kind of dark and rundown kody answered glumly im sure your parents will do a wonderful job with it mr lurie replied its basically a very solid house it just hasnt been lived in how come james demanded how come no one ever lived here mr luries smile faded just unlucky he muttered lowering his eyes to the ground cally didnt understand what he meant did he mean the owners were unlucky the house was unlucky the real estate people were unlucky who was unlucky she started to ask but mr lurie was handing her father an extra set of keys and saying his farewells i wont keep you he said backing away i just wanted to say welcome to shadyside and best of luck with a quick wave he headed down the driveway walking briskly swinging his arms sticklike at his sides cally watched him until he disappeared into the shadows of the trees that lined the street then she picked up the carton of china and shook it the shattered plates made a jangling sound inside sorry about that cally told her mother put it down and lets go inside mrs frasier replied i want you to see your new home the inside of the house was even less inviting than the outside cally thought as the family explored their new house cally couldnt help but notice every stain on the plaster the cracks in the walls the loose floorboards that creaked and groaned as she stepped on them the house is so dark cally thought unhappily so dark and damp it feels as if the sun has never shone on it as if the house is blanketed in darkness cally shivered how will i ever feel at home in this ugly dark place she wondered cally whats wrong her mothers voice broke into her thoughts huh cally blinked hard what mom you were making the sourest face mrs frasier said putting a hand on callys shoulder are you okay yeah sure mom cally answered quickly she didnt want to say that the house could be a set in a horror movie what would be the point her parents had bought it they were stuck there im just tired i guess she told her mother well come see your room mrs frasier said pushing open the door the floorboards creaked as they all trooped into callys new room cally stopped in the doorway the walls were dark and peeling the closet door was warped and stuck open the brown carpet had a round black stain in the center of the room big huh mr frasier asked eagerly smiling at cally yeah its big all right cally replied without enthusiasm its a lot bigger than my room kody complained how come cally got the biggest room cally struggled to close the closet door but it was too warped to move want to trade rooms she asked her sister well no kody decided but i dont see why you should automatically get the bigger room stop complaining kody mrs frasier said sharply were all tired and i know this house is a bit of a shock but itll feel like home before you know it right mr frasier agreed quickly a little paint a little wallpaper some new carpet and wheres my game room james interrupted weve seen all the bedrooms so wheres the game room well there isnt really room mr frasier replied im sorry james but how about the basement could we have a game room in the basement dad remember billy marcuss house he had a pingpong table and a pool table downstairs remember i dont know mr frasier said thoughtfully the basement in this house isnt finished it would take a lot of work james lets check out the basement james exclaimed he shoved cally out of his way as he burst toward the door come on lets check it out ill bet theres room for a pinball machine and everything down there girls go with him mrs frasier ordered and be careful their father added its probably filthy down there cally and kody obediently hurried after their brother james was already halfway down the stairs to the first floor the banister swaying slightly as his hand slid over it they found the stairs to the basement behind a door in the back hallway james clicked the light switch and a dim lightbulb flickered on at the bottom of the stairs holding on to the walls the three of them made their way down the narrow steep wooden stairs cally led the way followed by james then kody it took cally a moment to realize why her face had started to tingle and itch yuck cobwebs she cried frantically trying to brush the sticky webbing off her face this is really creepy james said softly they stopped under the cone of yellow light from the bare lightbulb cally had brushed most of the cobwebs off but her face still itched she stared into the gray basement that stretched around them cobwebs hung down from the metal beams that dotted the large room against the far wall a huge dustcovered furnace hovered its vents reaching up to the ceiling like arms cally heard the scratching sounds first whats that she asked grabbing james by the shoulders huh whats what he cried shhh listen cally ordered i hear it kody said soft scratching sounds cally gasped as three rats scuttled into view their eyes glowed red in the light their long pink tails swept the concrete floor as they ran ohh cally heard kody utter a low cry right behind her rats james exclaimed eyes glowing angrily the three rats charged forward hissing as they ran they theyre attacking kody shrieked get upstairs cally shoved james toward the steps and then she let out a terrified wail as the biggest rat leapt onto her leg chapter noooooo ignoring her terror cally kicked out with all her might the rat hissed shrilly as it went flying its four legs scrabbling in the air it hit the floor with a disgusting plop cally stumbled to the stairs as the other two rats darted toward her kody and james were ahead of her screaming all the way up the stairs up the narrow stairs into the hallway breathing hard her chest heaving cally slammed the basement door behind her whats wrong whats going on mr frasier called hurrying into the hall whats all the screaming rats all three of them shouted at once rats in the basement cally cried breathlessly one of them jumped on callys leg james exclaimed excitedly it was fat and disgusting three rats they attacked us kody added did they bite you mrs frasier cried appearing behind her husband are you okay cally shook her head it didnt bite me it just jumped on me i never heard of rats doing that her mother said shaking her head fretfully mr frasier sighed he pulled off his eyeglasses and rubbed his eyes one more problem to add to the list well have to get an exterminator here right away yes right away mrs frasier echoed biting her lower lip she forced a smile is anyone hungry mrs frasier asked we should go into town and get some food before anyone could answer the doorbell rang now who could that be mr frasier asked frowning cally followed the others to the door her heart was still racing she shuddered she could still feel the rats spidery legs gripping her leg still hear its shrill hiss mr frasier pulled open the front door a young man smiled in at them from the other side of the screen door he had straight black hair down to the collar of his gray tshirt he wore gray denim overalls his eyes were small and black beneath bushy eyebrows and he had a black mustache can i help you mr frasier asked i saw the uhaul the man said pointing you just moving in mr frasier nodded the man shifted his weight cally saw that he was big very athletic looking my name is glen hankers he said his dark eyes peering in through the screen door im a handyman i mean i do all kinds of work i wondered if theres lots to be done here mrs frasier exclaimed not waiting for hankers to finish we could probably keep you busy for months mr hankers mr hankers smiled at that callys father studied mr hankerss face do you have references he asked mr hankers nodded i can supply them ive done a lot of work for people on fear street can you kill rats james piped up from beside cally james mrs frasier cried got a rodent problem mr hankers asked smoothing his mustache with the fingers of one hand the kids saw rats in the basement mr frasier reported unhappily i can deal with them mr hankers said ive got traps and i have a spray well we need someone to help mr frasier told him eyeing him suspiciously but if youre expensive mr hankers shook his head im very reasonable mr frasier im very reasonable mr frasier you can pay me by the hour or by the week or even by the month callys father glanced at his wife she nodded he turned back to mr hankers pushing open the screen door i think youve got yourself a load of work here beginning with killing those rats when can you start right away mr hankers replied smiling he shook mr frasiers hand just show me to the basement those rats are history later that night her first night in her new bedroom cally sat in bed writing in her diary dear diary i wish i could tell you how happy i am and how much i love my new house but i cant i never expected such a rundown dark gloomy tacky place would you believe that my very first day here a tree nearly fell on my head and i was attacked by rats i get the deep shivers just thinking about it kody seems just as miserable as i am james is the only one whos the least bit excited but thats james he gets excited about a new flavor of bubble gum the movers arrived about an hour after we did we all worked unpacking cartons tonight what a mess ive never seen everyone so stressed now im up in my big ugly room writing in bed confession time all day i kept thinking about rick ive been in shadyside only one day and i miss him already i wonder if hes been thinking about me a couple of times i started to tell kody how much i missed him but i caught myself in time i keep forgetting that kody went out with rick first i keep forgetting that she accused me of stealing him away from her i mean they went out on only one date and it was ricks choice to start seeing me i didnt force him or anything poor kody i hope shell have a better time here in our new town she has such a messedup attitude always blaming me for her problems i hate it that shes so jealous of me what am i supposed to do tomorrow were going into town to look for summer jobs i hope i find something great i hope kody does too cally wanted to write more but her eyelids were heavy and her hand started to ache she set the diary on the floor turned out the light and settled down under the covers the ceiling creaked above her the house seemed to let out a long low groan why do old houses do that she wondered sleepily probably just to scare the people inside well im not going to get scared cally told herself shutting her eyes im too sleepy to get scared the scrabbling sound made her eyes pop open quick scratching noises above her head she shuddered were there rats in the attic too ugly hairy rats running around right above her head was the whole house crawling with the disgusting creatures mr hankers will have to check out the attic tomorrow she told herself she ignored the soft scraping footsteps and forced herself to think about rick a few minutes later she drifted into a deep dreamless sleep are you going to wear that to look for a job mrs frasier exclaimed rolling her eyes in disapproval cally hunched over the card table her dad had set up in the kitchen she blinked her eyes struggling to wake up these jeans are clean she told her mother irritably and so is the tshirt the rest of my clothes are still packed i dont think youll make a very good impression mrs frasier started to say callys father cut her off cally looks fine he said curtly so does kody thanks kody said yawning she had appeared in the kitchen wearing a pale pink polo shirt and crisp white denim jeans her short blond hair was neatly held back in a white headband cold cereal for breakfast callys mother announced i have to go grocery shopping this morning also i couldnt find the bowls so you have to have it on a plate cally laughed cold cereal on a plate it doesnt get any better than this very amusing her mother said setting the box of cornflakes in front of kody i look gross kody whined staring down miserably at her reflection in her plate i couldnt sleep i kept hearing the scariest sounds i know this place is haunted i know it is cally ignored her sister im going to find a great job today she said giving herself a pep talk im going to find a job where ill meet all kinds of interesting glamorous people and itll make me rich and famous before summers over callys parents laughed they were used to her wild fantasies kody continued to stare down at her plate im hoping maybe i can find a waitressing job she grumbled are you sure youre twins mr frasier demanded reaching for the cornflakes box it was a question he asked a lot wheres james cally asked still asleep her mother replied taking her place at the card table i think hes afraid if he comes downstairs well put him to work unpacking cartons hell probably sleep all day cally exclaimed they ate their plates of cornflakes in silence for a while know what we need in here mrs frasier said putting down her spoon this kitchen is so damp and cold we need some fresh air she turned to kody would you open the window lets see if it helps well cut down that big maple in front of the window mr frasier said as kody walked across the kitchen to the window a little sunlight will help a lot cally watched kody slide the window up leaning on the windowsill kody peered out into the backyard taking deep breaths of fresh air its a pretty day she reported cally turned back to her cereal she was spooning cornflakes into her mouth when she heard the loud slam it sounded like a heavy knife blade slicing into a butcher block a second later cally heard her sisters scream of agony my hands my hands chapter mrs frasier got to the window first her husband was right behind her kodys screams were softer now hoarse whispers of pain my hands my hands mrs frasier tugged the window up kody stumbled back holding her arms out stiffly like those of a marionette cally had her hands clamped tightly over her mouth she felt sick she lowered her eyes praying that her sister was okay ohhh my wrists kody moaned still holding her arms in that strange position sort of like a begging dog my wrists mrs frasier hugged kody how awful how awful she murmured try moving your hands mr frasier instructed see if you can move them if your wrists are broken no i can move them kody announced she winced in pain as she demonstrated wiggling both hands thank goodness theyre not broken her father said letting out a long whoosh of air he removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose between his finger and thumb well put ice on them mrs frasier said she started to the refrigerator but stopped oh we dont have any ice we havent made any yet i think theyre going to be okay kody said testing first one wrist then the other i i mostly was scared it slammed down so fast i dont think my hands are too badly hurt she continued bending them testing the wrists how did it happen cally asked finally finding her voice it was so strange kody replied returning to the card table the window was up no problem i was leaning on the sill to smell the fresh air the window suddenly came crashing down with such force it was as if someone were pushing it mr frasier examined the window he raised it then lowered it a few times weird he commented seems okay he turned back to the others when he finishes with the rats ill have mr hankers take a look at it kody groaned rubbing her tender wrists well one good thing she murmured to cally the rest of the day has got to be better at five that afternoon cally found the place where she and kody had agreed to meet it was a small coffee shop called the corner located a few blocks from the high school cally stepped inside breathed in the thick aroma of frying hamburgers and french fry grease and searched for her sister not here yet she realized disappointed she was bursting to tell kody about her day she slid into a booth in front of the window and glanced around the restaurant was empty except for two teenage couples squeezed into the booth against the wall they were laughing sliding a salt shaker back and forth across the table as if it were a hockey puck i wonder if they go to shadyside high cally thought she was startled to see a boy standing beside her table he was very good looking with wavy black hair dark friendly eyes that sort of crinkled at the sides and a nose that looked as if it had been broken at least once he had a small silver stud in one ear he wore a greasestained white apron over faded denim jeans and a blue tshirt hows it going he asked cally great she replied then immediately felt like a jerk for being so enthusiastic you uh want something he asked gesturing toward the kitchen behind the counter just a coke cally told him im waiting for my sister she glanced out the window no sign of kody hey anthony pick up a mans raspy voice shouted from the kitchen through the window behind the counter cally saw two hands set down plates with hamburgers is your name anthony she asked the boy hey howd you guess he shot back grinning cally laughed im psychic she gazed up at him playfully guess my name anthonys dark eyes lit up you already told me he said its psychic weird name cally laughed i havent seen you here before he said fiddling with his apron i just moved to shadyside she told him my real name is cally cally frasier are you going to go to shadyside high in the fall anthony asked cally started to reply but she was interrupted by the impatient voice from the kitchen anthony pick up okay okay coming anthony shouted he turned back to cally ill get your coke he hurried behind the counter to pick up the plates of hamburgers kody arrived a few seconds later a little bedraggled she had removed her headband and her hair was windblown and disheveled she was rubbing one wrist howd it go she asked cally sliding into the seat across from her did you get a job cally nodded a wide grin spread across her face i got a pretty good job she told her sister its in a boutique called two cute huh two cute whats that mean kody demanded fiddling with her bangs its supposed to be a clothing store for couples two get it two cute kody stuck her finger down her throat and pretended to puke real cute she muttered then she added i knew youd find a job how about you cally asked kody shook her head no luck well youll probably find one tomorrow cally said quickly kody glared across the table at her dont you ever get tired of trying to cheer me up she snapped cally opened her mouth to answer but anthony leaned over the table interrupting heres your coke cally he said setting it down he turned to kody hi callys sister what can i get you uh fries and a sprite kody replied her eyes on cally as soon as anthony left kody leaned forward and whispered to her sister he knows your name youve already met a guy he knows im your sister cally couldnt keep the smile from spreading across her face we were just talking for a minute before you came in she told her sister hes kind of cute dont you think kody leaned over the booth to study anthony yeah kind of she said she turned back to cally frowning why didnt i get here first she grumbled why are you always so lucky its not like he asked me out or anything cally replied defensively he will kody said glumly unable to hide her jealousy he will the sun was just starting to dip behind the treetops as cally and kody returned home but as soon as they began to make their way up the gravel driveway cally noticed that it became dark as night were home cally called leading the way into the front entryway she tossed her bag down on the floor beside the coat closet and started into the dark living room were in the kitchen mrs frasier called any luck callys father shouted yeah bad luck kody muttered behind cally why doesnt anyone turn the lights on in here cally complained cally made her way through the dark room their old furniture looked small and unfamiliar in the big living room as cally hurried toward the kitchen to tell her parents her news she didnt see the small dark creature perched on the arm of the couch she didnt see it until it leapt onto her chest chapter a lamp flashed on the creature raised its snout to callys throat down cubby she heard james shout get down cubby its a puppy cally realized laughing the little dog licked her neck then it dove to the floor and scampered across the room to james he scooped it up in his arms for a moment i thought cally started to admit behind her in the living room entryway kody laughed you thought it was a rat it does kind of look like a rat dont say that about cubby james said angrily cubby is not a rat cubby is a labrador retriever he gave the dog some nose kisses where did you get him cally asked her heart still racing dad got him for me at the aspca hes mine james said hugging the dog tightly the dog squirmed and struggled to get down to the floor hes cute kody said why did you name him cubby because he looks like a cubby james replied cally knew better than to question her brothers logic our first dinner in our new home mrs frasier said smiling she pulled her chair closer to the dining room table isnt this great its starting to feel like home mr frasier said unfolding his napkin i cant believe cally thought cubby was a rat james announced rolling his eyes lets not talk about rats at the table their mother replied lets have a civilized dinner okay james james burped loudly then burst into giggles thats not funny cally told him sharply its pretty funny james shot back did mr hankers get rid of the rats in the basement kody asked hes working on it mr frasier replied he was down there all day why are we talking about rats mrs frasier complained i made a beautiful dinner a big roast beef your favorite lets have some pleasant conversation cubby is the cutest

on the front steps just like mr hankers whats her name kody asked spooning mashed potatoes onto her plate her name is mrs nordstrom their mother replied shes starting tomorrow morning shes kind of stern and sour faced but i have a hunch shell be a really good housekeeper mr frasier pulled the roast beef platter closer and picked up the big carving knife hey i just had an idea he said his eyes on kody kody how would you like to have a job right here kodys eyes opened wide with surprise she dropped the serving spoon back into the mashed potato bowl huh what do you mean well theres so much work to be done mr frasier said gesturing with the big blackhandled knife way too much for mr hankers and me to do on our own and you love woodworking and painting and everything kody narrowed her green eyes at her father you mean you want me to stay home and work on the house mr frasier nodded yeah while cally gets to dress up and go to town every day and meet people kody demanded you know you

for the first time that evening great now carve the roast beef dear mrs frasier said impatiently to her husband mr frasier climbed to his feet and bent over the meat platter fork in one hand carving knife in the other this meat looks perfect he said itll be cold if we dont eat it soon callys mother urged she raised her eyes to cally would you do me a favor i forgot the salt and pepper shakers theyre in the kitchen okay cally slid her chair back and started making her way around the table dont step on cubby james warned where is that puppy anyway mrs frasier asked under the table james replied hes licking my shoe james giggled we have to teach that dog not to bother us while were eating mr frasier said leaning over to slice the meat you cant let a puppy develop bad habits cally pressed back against the wail to squeeze behind her fathers chair to get to the kitchen she was nearly past him when she saw him lift the knife to start to carve but then mr frasier jerked forward as if being shoved his eyes bulged wide with shock and the knife blade plunged deep into his side chapter owww mr frasier let out a wail the carving knife fell and landed heavily on the floor cubby went scampering away cally you pushed me mr frasier cried no cally exclaimed raising her hands to her face as she backed away she watched a bright red circle of blood form on the side of her fathers shirt you shoved my arm mr frasier accused her gripping his side no i i didnt touch you cally told him really daddy theres no way i could have shoved the knife into you i know but mr frasiers voice trailed off hes bleeding james announced yuck look at it mrs frasier was on her feet she grabbed her husbands arm stop arguing with cally lets get you upstairs and get that shirt off see if you need stitches stitches mr frasiers eyes were unfocused behind his glasses he didnt seem to understand what mrs frasier was telling him is he in shock cally wondered she leaned her back against the dining room wall as she stared at the widening circle of blood on her fathers shirt why did he accuse me of pushing him blood dripped onto the floor as mrs frasier led her husband out of the dining room cally turned her gaze on kody to her surprise kody was still in her chair and had a terrified expression on her face it was a ghost she murmured a ghost pushed his arm i know it why did you say it was a ghost cally demanded huh kody narrowed her eyes at her sister it was later that night after eleven cally had just finished writing her diary entry kody had wandered into her room to chat their parents had returned from the emergency room at shadyside general at about nine now they were in their room asleep cally was sprawled on her bed wearing the long striped nightshirt she liked to sleep in kody still dressed sat on the windowsill a light breeze through the open window fluttering her hair when daddy stabbed himself you said it was a ghost cally reminded her sister kody crossed over and sat down on the foot of callys bed poor daddy he needed twelve stitches cally pulled herself up higher against the headboard answer my question she insisted why did you think it was a ghost well you didnt shove daddys arm i saw you cally you didnt even come close to him so cally groaned so that made you automatically think it was a ghost kodys cheeks darkened to scarlet i felt a presence in the room cally she said lowering her voice to a solemn whisper a cold presence mistlike i felt it float over the table and then a second later i saw the knife plunge into daddy stop it kody cally warned please just stop it right now your ghost talk will only upset everyone what makes you think you know everything kody demanded with sudden passion she leaned close to her sister her nostrils flaring angrily stop roiling your eyes cally you dont know everything i hate it when you act so smug and superior kody let out a frustrated cry mom and dad didnt believe me either kody you told them this wild ghost story when they got back from the hospital kody nodded it isnt a wild story i felt something in the room i thought they should know she sighed but they laughed at me too kody listen to me cally pleaded there are no such things as ghosts really you ive read books that say there are ghosts kody shot back books by real scientists cally laughed kody jumped to her feet she balled her hands into fists dont laugh at me cally i dont like everyone in this family laughing at me then dont be such a jerk cally replied she shook her head ghosts she muttered scornfully you really are a pain kody cried so are you cally shot back feeling herself lose control kody stomped toward the door hey if a moaning white sheet comes flying down the hall at you be sure to duck cally called after her kody stormed into the hall then slammed the door behind her what is her problem cally thought shaking her head sometimes i cant believe were twins how can a sister of mine believe in ghosts she clicked off her bedside lamp then slid down into the bed and pulled the sheet over her through the open window cally could hear the whisper of wind through the trees in the backyard she forced herself not to think about kody not to think of the frightening incident at dinner instead she thought about the boutique about sally and gene the young couple who had hired her to work there and as she began to relax and feel drowsy she found herself thinking about anthony maybe ill stop at the corner after work she thought smiling just to say hi maybe ill remind him im new in town and dont know anybody maybe ill ask him to show me around thinking these pleasant thoughts cally drifted to sleep three hours later she woke up startled by a sound the sky was black and starless outside her window a heavy silence hovered over the house then she heard the sound again a soft knocking on her bedroom door three knocks then a pause then three more knocks faint and weak whos there callys voice came out in a sleepchoked whisper she cleared her throat whos there kody no reply silence then three more faint knocks gentle scrapes as if from someone too weak to pound whos there cally demanded more loudly she lowered her feet to the floor and listened no reply am i dreaming this she wondered whats going on three more knocks a pause three more knocks cally took a deep breath and held it she tiptoed quickly across the room then she grabbed the doorknob and yanked open her door chapter no one there cally stared into the dim orange light cast by a tiny nightlight halfway down the hall no one an empty silent hallway whos there she whispered suddenly chilled no one there kodys door was closed jamess door stood open a crack revealing only darkness weird cally muttered softly she pulled her door shut hurried back to bed and pulled the sheet up to her chin shivering she shut her eyes and heard three soft knocks and then three more whos there she demanded shrilly silence then three more knocks catty pulled the sheet over her head and pressed her ear into the pillow trying to shut out the sound i couldnt sleep i heard strange noises all night kody complained she rested her chin in her hands she hadnt touched her toaster waffles youll get used to the sounds mr frasier said casually wiping orange juice off his upper lip is there any more coffee dear plenty mrs frasier stepped behind him with the coffeepot how does your side feel this morning not great callys dad admitted he turned to kody im afraid youre going to have to go up on the ladder this morning when we work on the porch roof i dont think i can he gripped his side this thing is still throbbing and i dont want to tear open the stitches no problem kody told him i like climbing ladders she glared at cally did you hear anything weird last night cally finished her orange juice then shook her head no she lied not a sound she didnt tell kody about the strange knocking on the door she wasnt in the mood to hear any more ghost talk from her sister mrs nordstrom the new housekeeper entered a few moments later she was a short squat grayhaired woman with lively dark eyes and a short stub of a nose as she was pulling out mops and sponges to clean the kitchen mr hankers arrived at the back door he greeted everyone with a solemn nod then he hurried down to the basement closing the door behind him the phone rang as cally got up from the table hey our first call she exclaimed she picked up the receiver and talked for a few minutes when she turned back to the others her expression revealed her disappointment that was sally at the boutique she told them theyre doing inventory they dont want me to start work till monday great mr frasier cried cheerfully you can help kody on the porch i dont think im going to be too useful today cally wasnt a skilled worker like her sister and she didnt enjoy carpentry but she knew she had to pitch in and she knew it was important to get the house in better shape so after changing into a pair of baggy faded jeans and an old gap singlepocket tshirt she tied her hair back with a rubber band then she followed her sister to the front of the house the sun was already high in the sky but little sunlight filtered down through the old trees to the front yard the tree guys are coming later this morning kody said staring down toward the street theyre going to start cutting down some trees in the back good maybe well get a little sunlight in our bedrooms cally replied i was cold last night she stopped and brushed her sisters shoulder with her hand hey kody what kody asked coldly sorry about last night cally said softly i mean losing my temper and everything kody avoided her sisters eyes its okay she muttered lets get to work maybe we can drive to town later cally suggested you know just you and me check out the stores maybe grab some lunch at that little restaurant near school kodys eyes lit up you just want to see that boy again anthony she laughed maybe cally replied she could feel her face growing hot lets see how much we can get done kody said turning to the porch im getting paid by the hour remember a tall aluminum ladder was already propped up against the edge of the porch roof stretching above it the tree limb had been pulled away the hole it had made in the roof was visible from the ground im going to climb up and pull off all the damaged shingles kody said the limb crashed right through which means the wood under the shingles is probably rotted she started up the ladder her eyes on the roof i may have to tear the wood planks out too what should i do cally asked brushing a spider off her tshirt sleeve just hold the ladder kody instructed hold it against the porch real steady no problem cally told her sister she grabbed the sides of the aluminum ladder with both hands kody doesnt have much respect for my abilities she told herself watching her sister climb to the roof so whenever we work together im the one who holds the ladder kody is so confident when it comes to this kind of work cally thought gripping the ladder tightly as her sister continued to climb why cant she have the same confidence in everything else wow kody called down the shingles are rotted they all have to go be careful cally said hold the ladder steady im going to see if i can stand on the roof kody let go of the ladder and reached for the roof edge as kody reached out cally felt the ladder start to shake a gentle trembling at first then harder until the aluminum hummed and vibrated hey whats your problem kody called sharply hold it steady i cally gripped the side pieces tightly but the ladder began pulling away from the porch hey stop kody yelled alarmed stop doing that im not doing it cally cried hold it steady kody screamed cally pressed all her weight against it but the ladder continued to swing away from the house kodys hands flailed at the air help me the ladder was standing straight up now cally struggled to push it back against the roof but it resisted with more force than cally had cally help stop kodys frantic screams pierced the air cally raised her eyes to her sisters frightened face saw her hands squeeze the sides of the ladder saw her knees bend saw the ladder topple back back and then cally could hold it no more she let go and jumped out of the way as the ladder fell kody screamed all the way down she landed flat on her back her arms and legs bounced once twice her breath seemed to explode from her body in a whoosh the ladder clanged as it bounced hard and luckily landed beside her in the tall grass noooo a silent protest escaped callys lips how could this happen she ran to kody and bent over her kody how could this happen how kody are you okay cally let out a horrified gasp when she saw that her sister wasnt breathing chapter dear diary you can imagine how relieved i felt when kody opened her eyes the fall had knocked the wind out of her and she had passed out we finally got her on her feet she was really groggy her back and neck were sore but she was lucky she didnt break anything of course she blamed me for letting the ladder tilt over i tried to explain it wasnt my fault it was so horrible when i held the ladder it felt as if a strong force much stronger than me were pushing the ladder backward i felt really bad as if i had let kody down kody was so angry and upset it made me feel even worse mom was quiet the rest of the day and dad seemed totally freaked so many accidents he kept saying over and over shaking his head so many accidents there have been a lot of frightening accidents since we arrived one right after the other thinking about them all gave me the chills i mean why did the ladder move back like that and why did dad think i bumped his arm and made him stab himself when i hadnt even touched him and why did the window slam shut on kodys hands after it had stayed up for a while why why why i keep telling myself its just a creepy rundown old house and the things that are happening to us are just accidents i keep telling myself that but i dont know how long i can go on believing it im really frightened if one more bad thing happens i dont know what ill do oh well its getting late ill close for now im sure tomorrow will be a much better day cally closed the diary and tucked it into her desk drawer then she made her way to bed she yawned wearily her eyes on the blackness outside the bedroom window after pulling back the sheet she slid into bed she had been asleep for only a few minutes when the soft knocking started again three light taps on the bedroom door then a pause then three more taps instantly alert cally crept out of bed she took a silent step toward the door then listened three more soft taps this time im going to find out whos there she told herself three more taps cally grabbed the doorknob and jerked the door open hey her voice echoed once down the empty hall there was no one there cally woke up the next morning saturday blinking into the gray light what was that dark rectangle across the room as her eyes focused she realized she was staring into her open closet she stared at the bare shelves the white plaster closet walls empty the closet was empty and all of her clothes jeans shorts tshirts sweatshirts had been taken out and strewn all over her room they were on the floor over her desk and across the windowsill i dont believe this she cried out loud who was in here she sat up startled to alertness kody kody were you in my room she shouted no reply she leapt out of bed and started to dress quickly picking up a pair of white tennis shorts from the floor then pulling on a blue and whitestriped tank top after she dressed she picked up the tshirts and sweaters from the floor and tossed them onto her bed then she quickly ran a brush through her blond hair and hurried downstairs something weird is going on cally shouted hurrying toward the kitchen she entered a scene of shouting and confusion wheres cubby james was demanding shrilly callys brother was down on his hands and knees peering under the kitchen table cubby cubby he called where is that dumb dog mr hankers hurried past cally with a nod and a muttered good morning he closed the basement door behind him she heard his heavy footsteps clambering down the narrow basement stairs i dont want eggs kody was saying irritably her mother snapped the plate up from the table you told me you wanted scrambled eggs this morning but these are too runny theyre sick kody declared im going to hurl really fine i like them runny ill eat them mrs frasier snarled carrying the plate away wheres cubby james repeated shrilly has anyone seen him i think he went outside mrs nordstrom said her face hidden behind a pile of bath towels she was carrying in front of her i saw him in the backyard a few minutes ago are you going to wash those mr frasier asked yes im on my way to the basement the housekeeper replied but mr hankers told me the basement is still filled with rats mr frasier told her mrs nordstrom kept walking toward the back hallway im not afraid of rats rats are afraid of me she said and disappeared heading down to the washerdryer cubby cubby did she say cubby went outside james demanded cubby isnt allowed outside he pushed open the kitchen door and ran out calling the dogs name james come back you havent had your breakfast mrs frasier called frantically she blew a strand of hair off her forehead anybody want eggs somebody pulled all the clothes out of my closet cally reported managing to get a word in my room is a total mess later callys mother said lets get breakfast out of the way then but mother cally cried sharply didnt you hear what i said whats going on here kody demanded why is everyone screaming and running around like a maniac cubby cubby jamess desperate shouts floated in from the backyard if that stupid puppy has run off mr frasier muttered he set his coffee cup down frowning cally do me a favor go look in the front yard maybe cubby ran around to the front cally obediently pushed her chair back from the table and stood up i wish someone would listen to me she said angrily someone was in my room and please check the front for the dog mr frasier urged impatiently so maybe james will shut up with an unhappy groan cally headed to the front of the house has everyone in this house gone totally psycho she wondered she pulled open the front door stepped onto the porch turned around and gasped the porch was splattered with blood cally raised her hands to her face as she saw the huge bloodscrawled number on the house wall chapter kody was the first to hear callys screams she burst onto the porch and her eyes bulged wide with horror as she saw the blood streaks mr and mrs frasier stopped just outside the doorway staring in silent shock who mrs frasier managed to choke out i knew the house was haunted kody said her voice just above a whisper i could feel the evil as soon as we arrived and now its starting to come out do you think it was neighborhood kids mrs frasier asked her husband some kind of prank mr frasier swallowed hard but didnt reply cally could see the fear in his eyes his face appeared pale and drawn in the gray light filtering down through the trees is it really blood kody asked quietly cally took a few steps toward the front door her legs weak and rubbery timidly she raised a finger to the wall of the house and rubbed it across one of the nines no its not blood she announced quietly its paint paint mr frasier repeated the word as if hed never heard it before the ghost is trying to communicate kody murmured who would smear red paint all over our porch callys father demanded mr hankers and i spent all yesterday afternoon sanding and putting primer on such a mean joke mrs frasier murmured chewing her bottom lip and shaking her head its not a joke kody replied in a low solemn voice its a message its not a joke cubby cubby jamess voice floated onto the porch cally saw her brother wander into the front yard trudging along slowly searching everywhere cubby james turned when he saw everyone huddled on the porch come out and help me he cried in a trembling voice weve got to look for cubby hes run away poor james is about to lose it cally thought seeing her brothers chin tremble and tears form in his eyes ill help you look she called to him anything to get out of here cally told herself wait there james she called ill be right there well search the whole neighborhood cubby cubby james continued to call the puppy his voice becoming more and more shrill cally ran upstairs to her room ignoring the clothing tossed everywhere she pulled on a pair of white sweat socks and then searched under a pile of jeans for her sneakers when she returned to the front yard kody and mr frasier were already opening cans of white primer preparing to paint over the ugly red scrawls cally said im going now and hurried out to join james why did cubby run away james demanded as cally came jogging down the driveway to him why did he do that im sure he didnt get far cally told her brother tenderly putting a hand on his slender shoulder come on well find him keeping her hand on his shoulder cally guided james down to the street well search all the front and backyards she said keep your eyes peeled as soon as they stepped away from their yard sunlight appeared the morning sky was cloudless and bright the air instantly became warm and fresh smelling cubby cubby james called the dogs name as cally led him from house to house the houses are all pretty old and ramshackle on this street cally noticed but none of them she realized unhappily were as rundown and as covered in darkness as her new house is that cubby james cried pointing to a front lawn choked with tall weeds cally turned her gaze to follow where he was pointing no sorry its only a squirrel she reported james uttered an unhappy moan dont get discouraged cally said well find him lets check out this backyard the squareshaped brick house was dark and empty but as cally followed her brother up the driveway she heard the buzz of a power lawn mower as she and james turned the corner behind the garage a boy came into view he had his back to them as he pushed the mower it crackled and roared as he guided it through the tall grass i dont see cubby james shouted over the noise callys eyes were on the darkhaired boy as he turned the lawn mower and started toward them she recognized him anthony cally shouted smiling he stopped pushing but kept both hands on the mower handle his eyes narrowed in surprise hi he called he bent down and shut off the mower anthony do you live here cally called jogging over to him he gazed hard at her wiping his hands on the legs of his jeans i remember you he said from the restaurant right cally realized he didnt remember her name cally she told him cally frasier my sister and i oh right he smiled hows it going he wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his tshirt cally saw that he had blades of cut grass clinging to the bottoms of his jeans and somehow blades of grass had become tangled in his dark hair thats my brother james cally said pointing did you see a dog james demanded hanging back by the garage a little black lab anthony shook his head no were searching everywhere for him cally explained do you live here no way anthony replied seriously his answer caught cally by surprise lets go james urged he ran over to cally and tugged at her arm lets check out the next yard in a second cally replied removing her arm from her brothers grasp she turned back to anthony what do you mean anthonys dark eyes remained serious my family is too superstitious to live on fear street he said i dont understand cally confessed oh yeah you just moved here he said gripping the handle of the nowsilent lawn mower no one told you about this street huh told me what cally demanded lets go james cried impatiently one second cally told him sharply told me what anthony well there are all kinds of stories about this street he replied reluctantly staring down at the mower weird stories cally let out a shrill laugh give me a break she replied playfully just because im new in town doesnt mean you can scare me with that dumb im serious anthony interrupted so you dont live here cally repeated gesturing toward the house anthony shook his head i mow lawns on saturdays you know for extra money i live in old village have you been there its pretty nice i havent seen much of town cally replied thoughtfully hes so cute she found herself thinking even when hes sweaty and covered with grass lets go james insisted tugging on callys arm again okay okay cally replied anthony wiped his forehead again with his sleeve hot today he muttered but im almost finished where do you live on this block cally nodded yeah ninetynine fear street his dark eyes locked on to hers youre kidding right no im not kidding cally replied confused what is your problem anthony thats my address ninetynine fear street he swallowed hard he continued to stare hard at her cally he said quietly dont you know about that house didnt they tell you chapter tell me what cally demanded lets go james cried pulling her arm hard with both of his hands come on cally you promised okay im coming james she said sharply she turned back to anthony youre almost finished here want to come over for lunch she blurted out you can tell me about the house anthony raised both hands as if shielding himself i dont think so he said a nervous smile forming on his lips i mean are you actually afraid to come to my house cally challenged him he grinned sheepishly well not really i mean dont be silly come over as soon as youre finished cally told him she tossed her hair back behind her shoulders i cant wait to hear your story she added lightly but anthonys expression turned solemn i dont think youll like it he said softly i really dont cubby cubby james frantically called the dog as he pulled cally into the next yard i cant believe you invited him here kody exclaimed angrily look at me ive been painting the porch all morning im a total mess he isnt coming to see you cally replied nastily why did kody always have to give her a hard time couldnt she forget her jealousy for one minute well mom and dad arent here they went shopping at the mall what are you going to make for lunch kody demanded ill make tuna fish sandwiches cally told her and i think theres some egg salad from yesterday what difference does it make i want to hear anthonys story about this house dont you youre not interested in his story youre interested in his bod kody accused silence for a moment then they both burst out laughing they never could stay angry at each other for long despite their differences they were still sisters twin sisters cally reached out and rubbed a smear of white paint off kodys cheek you look fine she told her sister im covered with paint im going to change out of these shorts kody said hurrying toward the front stairs no luck finding cubby huh no luck cally replied sadly poor james hes upstairs probably crying his eyes out i told him wed search again after lunch maybe ill come with you kody called from the stairway ive got to get away from the paint fumes the front doorbell rang its anthony cally exclaimed kody disappeared up the stairs cally hurried to answer the door be careful wet paint she warned anthony entered the house reluctantly he had brushed the blades of grass from his hair he had obviously washed his hands and face with water from a garden hose the front of his tshirt was soaked as cally led the way to the kitchen he peered around the living room kind of dark in here he murmured you must be hungry after all that mowing ive got egg salad sandwiches and potato chips cally told him sounds good he had his hands shoved into his jeans pockets he looked so uncomfortable maybe we could eat outside its such a pretty day cally laughed you really dont want to be in this house do you she accused playfully anthonys reply was solemn no i dont i really dont cally kody and anthony sat in the shade of a big apple tree in the backyard and ate their lunch cally had brought a sandwich up to james but he insisted he wasnt hungry and slammed the bedroom door in her face were cutting down some of these trees kody told anthony you know to let in some sunlight its so dark back here cally said shaking her head the sun cant break through anthony concentrated on his sandwich the grass hasnt been cut in ages he commented maybe your dad would like to hire me to mow it cally chuckled you sure you arent too scared to work here tell us the story kody insisted setting her paper plate down beside her on the grass about the house its not a story its true anthony replied seriously he locked his dark eyes on callys a guy came to our class he works in the library hes the town historian he told us about it he said he told you about our house kody interrupted shrilly anthony nodded yeah ninetynine fear street what about it is it haunted kody demanded glancing at cally cally leaned back against the tree trunk her arms crossed in front of her tell the story anthony she instructed him i want to see if you can keep a straight face im not putting you on he insisted really this historian told us the whole thing im not making it up he shifted his weight crossing his long legs in front of him kody had a plateful of potato chips she kept shoving them into her mouth one after the other eagerly waiting for anthonys story there was this guy who lived in shadyside about a hundred years ago anthony began brushing an ant off his arm his name was simon fear is that who the street was named for kody asked stop interrupting him cally snapped yeah anthony replied you know that burned house on the hill across from the cemetery that was simon fears house i went by there yesterday kody said i cant believe no one has torn it down you know cleared it away people are afraid to anthony said darkly simon fear was a bad dude a real bad dude and so was his wife i forget her name i think it was angelica anyway this was all woods back then and they lived in a big mansion in the woods and did all kinds of horrible things to people you mean killed them cally asked there are all kinds of weird stories about them some people say they tortured people and even killed some yuck kody whispered she set down her plate of potato chips what do the fears have to do with our house cally asked impatiently well this town historian told us that when the workers started digging the foundation on this lot it was about thirty years ago he said they dug up a bunch of old coffins coffins in our yard kody exclaimed shrilly they found all these old coffins with the fear family crest on the lids there were bodies inside them skeletons i mean the police figured that this was some kind of burying place you know for victims of simon fear and his wife a secret place where they buried the people they killed wow kody uttered excitedly cally made a disgusted face happy halloween she said sarcastically rolling her eyes im not making it up anthony insisted i havent even told you the really gross part the gross part tell us kody urged grabbing a handful of potato chips you wont like it anthony warned you sure know how to build suspense cally said dryly she didnt want to let on to anthony that his story really was frightening her she wrapped her arms more tightly protectively around herself well the town historian told us about the family that built your house more than thirty years ago anthony said gazing through the tree at the grayshingled house bathed in darkness he raised the coke can to his lips and took a long drink then he continued his eyes still focused on the house the guy who had the house built on this lot had a wife and two kids a son and a daughter when the workers dug up the old graves they asked him what they should do he told them to keep working he said he didnt care about a bunch of old bones so the house was finished anthony continued and the guy brought his family to see it they were going to move in in a few weeks and he wanted to show it to them when they arrived he heard workers finishing up one of the upstairs rooms he went up to see what they were doing he told his wife and two kids to wait downstairs he didnt want them to see the upstairs until it was finished so they sat down on the floor and waited for him the guy was upstairs for only a few minutes but when he got back down he he found anthonys voice trailed off what kody demanded impatiently what did he find cally took a deep breath and held it trying to slow her racing heart his family was still sitting in the living room anthony continued slowly but they were dead their heads their heads were missing what cally shrieked she saw kodys eyes bulge open wide her mouth dropped open but no sound came out all their guts were pouring out anthony continued his face half hidden in the deep shade of the old tree it looked like their heads had been torn off their necks where were their heads cally demanded in a hushed whisper anthony shrugged the town historian said the heads were gone they werent in the house they were never found so what happened kody asked shuddering what happened then what happened to the guy anthony asked he shrugged i dont know i dont know what happened to him but the house the house just sat there no one ever moved in no one wanted to move in the whole town knew the story about what happened to the wife and the two kids and about the hundredyearold graves and so the house stayed empty no one ever lived here until us kody declared with a shiver cally chewed her bottom lip as she studied anthonys face why are you staring at me like that he demanded edgily i keep waiting for you to smile she told him i keep waiting for you to break up to tell us its all a joke its no joke anthony murmured his dark eyes glowing as he returned callys stare i knew there was something evil about this house kody declared i knew it from the moment we arrived all three of them stared at the back of the house the windows all reflected the dark trees but i dont believe in ghosts cally cried defiantly as if directing the words to the ghosts themselves i dont believe in ghosts and evil spirits i dont either anthony replied quietly but he stopped short when he heard the screams they all heard them jamess shrill screams coming from the house chapter james whats wrong cally shrieked she leapt to her feet and frantically started running toward the house she had a hideous picture in her mind a picture of jamess head being ripped off his body by a dark ghoulish monster james are you all right james kody and anthony were right behind her the shrill cries continued and then james burst out of the kitchen door the screen door slammed behind him where is he james called where is he cally watched her brother run desperately around the backyard peering behind trees under shrubs james what are you doing she cried as she caught up to him she grabbed his shoulders and forced him to stand still where is he where is he james repeated almost a chant where is who cally demanded cubby i heard him james told her jerking out of her grasp continuing his wild search james i heard him barking james insisted i was in the kitchen i heard cubby barking cally turned to kody and anthony did you hear a dog they both shook their heads their eyes revealing surprise and confusion we didnt hear any barking cally said following her brother as he ran to the tall hedge growing wild along the side of their yard i heard him james insisted his voice tight and trembling i heard cubby he began to call the dog cupping his hands over his mouth as he shouted you heard him in the kitchen kody asked maybe hes inside the house maybe you only thought he was outside james hesitated his eyes narrowing thoughtfully come on inside kody urged lets check it out with kody leading the way they ran into the kitchen cally carefully pulled the screen door shut behind her what was that racket she saw mrs nordstrom leaning over the sink and recognized the grinding roar of the garbage disposal mrs nordstrom did you hear cubby barking cally shouted the housekeeper clicked off the disposal and turned off the water she turned to cally what did you say cally didnt need to repeat the question she heard the highpitched yips of the dog cubby hear it james demanded eagerly everyone heard it someone go out and bring that dog in mrs nordstrom said she waddled out of the room its definitely coming from outside anthony said listening hard the little dog sounded excited frightened james burst back out through the kitchen door everyone followed cubby cubby he called eagerly cally lingered on the back steps she couldnt hear cubbys excited yips anymore they all stopped to listen silence jamess shrill voice was the only sound as he shouted the dogs name again and again i cant hear him kody declared he must be in the house anthony suggested he started back toward the kitchen kody and cally followed him james remained in the backyard scurrying frantically back and forth shouting cubbys name back in the kitchen they could hear the little dogs highpitched barking clearly it really sounds like its coming from the backyard cally said fretfully but we dont hear it out there anthony replied shaking his head lets search the house kody suggested she pulled open the broom closet cubby are you in here no sign of him the excited yips continued mixed with sad howls cally pushed the screen door open and stuck her head out the sound disappeared james was still searching desperately at the side of the garage kody and anthony were in the dining room bending low to peek under the table and sideboard i can hear him kody said wrinkling her face in frustration but i cant see him cubby here boy cubby anthony called he glanced at his watch oh wow im late ive got another lawn to mow cally walked him to the front door want to go to a movie or something next saturday night he asked as they stepped onto the porch cally was concentrating so hard on the dogs barking it took her a moment to respond great she replied finally come pick me up okay she watched him disappear down the driveway then she returned to the kitchen where she found kody leaning wearily against the counter her arms crossed over her chest the barking stopped kody reported cally could hear james crying in the backyard where is he where is cubby james threw himself down on the grass and started to wail and sob this is so weird cally said fretfully where is that dumb dog she arid kody heard the car crunching up the gravel drive at the same time good its mom and dad kody said hurrying past cally to the door i have to tell them anthonys story about this house no wait cally grabbed kodys arm stop dont tell them cally urged jamess unhappy wails rose up from the backyard kodys eyes opened wide in surprise huh what do you mean theyre already so upset about everything cally said hurriedly her eyes on the door and now they have to deal with james but they have to know kody started cally shook her head wait a while poor dad hes been so nervous and strange totally freaked by everything i think we should give him a break and not trouble him kody glared at her sister you still dont believe the house is haunted do you she said accusingly you still dont believe theres something evil i dont know what i believe cally told her but i do know we shouldnt upset dad anymore she stopped talking when she saw her parents walking toward the house their arms filled with packages she and kody rushed out to help them whats wrong with james mrs frasier demanded handing her packages to cally why is he crying we still cant find cubby kody explained glancing at cally we can hear him barking but we cant find him huh behind his glasses mr frasiers eyes went wide with surprise i dont understand we dont either kody replied sighing we dont either late the next night cally finished writing in her diary yawning she closed her diary and replaced it in her desk drawer usually writing in the diary helped relax her and get her ready to go to sleep but that night because she had written about the search for jamess puppy and about anthony and his strange frightening story cally felt far from relaxed as she lay in bed staring up at the ceiling she tried to force all unpleasant thoughts from her mind she tried to think only about anthony about how cute he was how he seemed to be such a great guy but she couldnt concentrate her mind kept leaping to other matters to the troubling things that had been happening to her family since moving to fear street were kody and anthony right was there some sort of evil curse on the house was it really haunted cally didnt want to believe it feeling tense and jittery cally sat up an idea flashed into her mind she stared across the dark room at the closed bedroom door every night someone or something had knocked on the door the same soft frightening taps every night and every night cally had crept to the door pulled it open and found no one there tonight ill be ready she decided tiptoeing to the door tonight im going to solve the mystery im wide awake anyway she told herself theres no point just lying in bed thinking scary thoughts she wheeled her desk chair over to the door and lowered herself into it perched tensely in the chair she stared at the door and waited when the knocking starts ill be ready she told herself nervously tapping the padded arms of the chair as soon as i hear the first knock ill pull the door open instantly and what will i find she asked herself a ghost an evil creature an invisible spirit nothing but air what will i find she heard creaking sounds the banging of a shutter the soft flap of the curtains at her bedroom window the usual sounds of the house at night tapping her fingers on the chair arm she waited listening to the night house sounds listening to the rush of wind through the trees outside listening to her own shallow breathing she didnt have long to wait tap tap tap the gentle knocking on the other side of the door just inches from her tap tap tap cally sucked in a deep breath and rose to her feet then she jerked the door open and stared out you she shrieked chapter the ghostly figure tried to move away her long white nightdress sweeping over the floor as she turned to run but cally grabbed her arm and held on kody she screamed its you let go kody demanded but cally tightened her grip and pulled her sister into the bedroom why kody she cried why have you been doing this to me you wouldnt believe me kody replied breaking free of callys grasp her long nightdress caught and she stumbled over the desk chair beside the doorway with a low cry of surprise she caught her balance on the doorframe you wouldnt believe she repeated her green eyes burning into callys i had to make you believe believe what cally demanded shrilly believe that theres something evil in this house kody shot back in a hushed angry whisper you laughed at me you said i was a jerk but i know im right cally all the horrible accidents dad and the knife my ladder falling over they werent accidents i know theres something haunting this house something evil cally rolled her eyes and let out an angry groan so you tapped on my door every night to make me think you were a ghost that makes a lot of sense kody i thought it would convince you kody replied lowering her eyes she nervously tossed her hair back with one hand i was desperate i wanted you to believe i wanted you to be on my side so i i haunted you cally shook her head i dont believe it my own sister she muttered and did you pull all my clothes out of the closet too kody nodded yeah and i smeared the red paint all over the porch and painted the number ninetynine she confessed you what cally shrieked in disbelief i figured it was no big deal i knew we had to paint a top coat on the porch anyway kody explained with a shrug i was desperate cally dont you understand i was desperate to get you on my side a little red paint didnt matter didnt matter cally cried furiously didnt matter you nearly gave dad a heart attack dont exaggerate kody cried im not exaggerating cally replied heatedly did you see how stressed out dad was tonight because of james and the puppy did you see how worried he looked know what i heard him talking to himself tonight huh kodys face revealed her surprise in the den cally continued starting to pace back and forth in front of her sister he didnt know i was there he was talking to himself kody muttering about cubby and about the house it it was really scary poor dad kody murmured shaking her head she dropped down onto callys bed stop pacing like that please she begged i cant believe you tried to frighten me cally said ignoring the plea why didnt you just come in and talk to me talk to you kody let out a bitter laugh every time i started talking about the evil in this house you just made fun of me there was no way i could talk to you cally glared furiously at her sister but trying to make me believe that a ghost there is a ghost kody insisted jumping up from the bed and grabbing cally by both shoulders youve got to believe me there is something horrible in this house you heard anthonys story you heard what he said cally sighed yes i heard it she replied wearily but you know how stories get handed down you know how people try to make them more frightening than they are cally gently removed her sisters hands from her shoulders so far kody the only ghost ive seen in this house is you kody let out an angry cry i explained to you ill make you a deal cally said suddenly feeling very tired deal what kind of deal kody asked suspiciously i wont tell mom and dad what youve been doing cally offered i wont tell them that you were the one who painted the porch if if what kody interrupted if you just drop this ghost stuff for a little while cally continued just give it a rest for a week let things settle down thats all kody frowned and avoided callys hard stare can you do it cally asked can you do i have a choice her sister replied grudgingly but then she added okay cally ill try half an hour later cally still couldnt fall asleep she glanced at her clockradio nearly onethirty im going to look like death for my first day at work she thought miserably she sat up and lowered her feet to the floor if only i could turn my mind off she thought if only i could stop thinking about kody and her ghosts if only i could stop thinking about those poor people thirty years ago sitting in my living room sitting right downstairs with their heads ripped off if only i could turn it all off and get to sleep she rubbed her cheeks they were burning so hot she thought im so hot she stood up and made her way through the darkness out into the hall the bathroom was two doors down tiptoeing over the creaky floorboards she made her way to the bathroom and clicked on the light ill splash a little cold water on my face she told herself then ill feel cooler better ill be able to sleep yawning she turned on the tap closing her eyes she cupped both hands under the faucet then splashed the liquid onto her face it took a few seconds for the putrid smell to reach her nostrils and then staring into the gurgling sink cally opened her mouth and gagged chapter chunky green liquid as sour smelling as vomit poured out of the faucet plopping into the sink it ran down callys cheeks dripped onto her neck then onto the front of her nightshirt uttering a low wail of horror she tried to wipe it off with both hands but her hands were also covered in the disgusting thick goo she stared as the green chunks plopped into the sulk ohhh cally groaned the smell was overpowering her stomach lurched she bent over and began to vomit cally are you sick cally kody burst into the bathroom she let out a groan as the putrid odor invaded her nostrils ohhhh cally moaned and retched again her hair fell over her face and she realized she had smeared the green liquid into it what is that stuff kody cried holding her nose she froze for a moment staring at the thick green liquid plopping down from the faucet then she reached out with her free hand and tried to turn the faucet off but the liquid kept pouring down it it wont stop kody screamed the sink was full the green liquid slopped over the sides of the sink and dripped to the floor cally cried out and leapt back as she felt it drip onto her bare feet kody struggled to turn off the faucet but the knob was stuck and the chunky green liquid kept flowing out whats going on mr frasiers sleepfilled voice called from the hallway cally heard his heavy footsteps over the creaking floorboards daddy help us her stomach still churning she grabbed a bath towel off the rack and struggled frantically to wipe the sticky substance off her face oh good lord mr frasier cried appearing in the bathroom doorway he didnt have his glasses so he squinted at the gurgling substance overflowing the sink aaaagh his face twisted in disgust as he inhaled the foul aroma holding his nose he glanced from cally to kody then he stepped into the bathroom and reached for the knob on the sink it it wont turn off cally said gagging before mr frasier could reply jamess shrill cries burst into the room i hear him i hear him cally tossed the towel down james appeared in the doorway his red and white pajamas were twisted so that his pale stomach showed do you hear him he demanded tugging at mr frasiers pajama sleeve do you hear cubby huh mr frasier let go of the faucet and turned to james the green liquid continued to pour out spattering the floor as it overflowed over the steady gurgle cally heard soft barking as if from far away i hear it she cried oooh whats that smell james demanded the barking grew louder highpitched frantic wails i hear it too kody whispered where is he james cried where is cubby he sounds so far away mr frasier said listening hard his eyes narrowing hes downstairs james shouted excitedly i know he is he turned and ran to the stairway cally could hear him calling the puppys name all the way down the stairs she started to follow james but her feet slipped and she grabbed the side of the sink to keep from falling ohhh her feet were covered in the slimy warm goo and now it gurgled over her hands as she grabbed the sink stop it daddy please stop it cally pleaded miserably it its all over me im trying to mr frasier replied twisting the knob and finally shutting it off wheres mom kody asked i i have to get changed cally cried she stepped around kody into the hall in time to see her mother emerge from her bedroom mom cally shrieked oh help me mrs frasier murmured staggering toward cally her arms stretched out in front of her help her hair her face her nightgown were all soaked with bright red blood chapter cally uttered a cry of disbelief and went charging down the hall toward her mother mom are you hurt dad hurry mom needs help i im not hurt mrs frasier said pushing at her bloodsoaked hair with both hands im not hurt the blood kody and mr frasier burst into the hallway their faces reflecting their alarm kody let out a horrified shriek when she saw her mother cally saw the color instantly drain from her fathers face his mouth dropped open and he started to choke im not hurt mrs frasier cried it just dripped on me cally and kody rushed to hug their mother but mrs frasier hung back whats that smell she demanded cally what is that all over you i i dont know cally stammered beth are you cut mr frasier finally found his voice the blood it dripped on me from the ceiling mrs frasier explained pointing with a trembling hand to their bedroom they ran to the bedroom cally clicked on the light she uttered a low gasp as she saw the dark puddle of blood on the ceiling above her parents bed the blood was trickling down in a steady stream splashing onto the pillows and sheets i heard cally screaming mrs frasier said lingering at the doorway gazing up with fear in her eyes at the huge circle of blood i started to get up and then i realized she gestured to the bloodstains on her nightgown it must be coming from the attic mr frasier said he grabbed his glasses off the dresser top and struggled to steady his hands enough to put them on there must be something in the attic he hurried past callys mother heading toward the attic stairs no dont go mrs frasier screamed after him dont go up there but cally heard the attic door open then heard her fathers heavy footsteps as he climbed the stairs i cant find him james cried as he burst into the room i can hear cubby but i cant find him anywhere sobbing he buried his face in his mothers nightgown but he jerked his head back when he felt the wetness mommy im okay mrs frasier assured him im not hurt i ive got to take a shower cally moaned this stuff its so gross the smell is making me sick again wheres daddy james demanded cally raised her eyes to the ceiling she could hear her fathers footsteps over her head is daddy up there james asked wiping tears off his cheeks with both hands mrs frasier nodded something is dripping she pointed to the ceiling the footsteps in the attic stopped a heavy silence fell over the bedroom everyone listened silence upstairs no footsteps not a sound oh no kody moaned she turned and ran out of the room heading down the hall to the attic stairs cally was right behind her daddy are you okay she shouted up the stairs silence daddy cally stared up the steep dark stairs then she turned to kody her eyes wide with fright why doesnt he answer chapter daddy are you all right can you hear me callys thin voice echoed up the steep stairs she breathed a loud sigh of relief as her father appeared at the top of the stairs pressing his hands against the walls on both sides he came down slowly one step at a time when he stepped into the light cally saw that his expression was dazed and confused daddy she started to say taking his hand it was as cold as ice heads he murmured trembling all over he blinked several times as if trying to blink away what he had seen up there huh what did you see up there mrs frasier demanded from the bedroom doorway hheads mr frasier stammered his eyes dancing wildly three human heads a woman two children no no he let out a wailing sob with a shudder cally glanced up the attic stairs no her father screamed dont look dont go up there so much blood the heads the poor heads call the police hurry somebody call the police after the police officers finished their search cally showered for nearly half an hour but no matter how much she scrubbed the sour smell clung to her why couldnt the police find anything in the attic cally wondered why couldnt they explain the bloodstains on the bedroom ceiling a doctor had been called he gave mr frasier something to calm him and help him sleep poor daddy cally thought when the doctor left callys mother had also taken a long shower trying to wash away the dark caked blood the two sisters and their mother worked for hours to clean the disgusting green liquid off the sink and bathroom floor when they finished they all showered again pulling a robe over a fresh nightshirt cally made her way downstairs to get a cold drink the kitchen clock revealed that it was nearly five in the morning cally could hear her mother in the den with james speaking in low soothing tones trying to calm the poor boy cally listened for cubbys barking but all she could hear now was the hum of the refrigerator and her mothers low voice from the den as she poured herself a glass of orange juice kody wearily entered the kitchen its a little early for breakfast she groaned but pour me a glass too cally still felt shaky she nearly dropped the glass as she handed it to her sister now maybe youll believe me about this place kody said her green eyes locked on callys cally felt a cold chill run down her back she nodded solemnly unable to hide her fear yeah maybe i will she whispered but kody what can we do im going to talk to mr lurie callys father said he had to know about the weird problems with this house if he refuses to make everything right im going to demand our money back and ask him to tear up the mortgage it was a little after ten now the family was sitting around the kitchen table yawning resting their heads in their hands trying to choke down toast and tea only mr frasier had slept thanks to the doctors medication the others had been too frightened to return to their rooms and mr frasier had stretched out on the couch in the den cally stared across the table at her father his eyes still darted around rapidly and he was breathing hard he talked quickly in a breathless voice cally had never heard him use before he kept muttering crazily about the three heads and the police he should lie down cally thought worried he isnt really making sense he isnt ready to be up cally had called the boutique and explained that she couldnt go in to work luckily the inventory hadnt been completed and callys new boss didnt need her i cant believe im missing my first day of work cally said shaking her head but i cant go to town while things are all so crazy are you sure you should go out dear callys mother asked timidly squeezing her husbands hand i have to mr frasier insisted i have to find out what mr lurie is going to do about our trouble mr lurie probably didnt know the story of the house kody said quietly despite callys reluctance kody had told her parents the frightening story that anthony had revealed both parents had reacted with disbelief it cant be true their father had murmured his face still as pale as a ghost bodies buried unmarked coffins the heads the three heads mrs frasier had remained silent chewing her bottom lip her eyes narrowed now as the morning light filtered through the kitchen window mr frasier muttered to himself his lips moving rapidly his eyes unfocused mr lurie had to know the story the horrible story he insisted he told me hes been a real estate agent in shadyside for more than thirty years im going to give him a call right now he pulled out his wallet searched through it then pulled out the real estate agents business card hmmm thats strange callys father murmured squinting at the card through his glasses whats strange cally demanded theres no phone number on his card mr frasier handed the card to cally can you find one cally studied the card in small engraved letters the card read jason lurie real estate fear street cally handed the card back to her father just an address she said mr frasier climbed to his feet and walked over to the wall phone cally turned at the table to watch him he punched in information could i have the phone number of the jason lurie real estate agency he asked leaning against the kitchen wall its on fear street a long pause then cally saw surprise on her fathers face theres no listing he asked into the receiver are you sure a moment later he replaced the receiver and returned to the table shaking his head i never heard of a real estate agent without a phone mrs frasier said staring into her tea cup im going over there right now mr frasier declared frowning im not going to spend another night in this house until i talk to him until i find out the truth about this house and make him find cubby too james insisted pouting mr frasier patted jamess disheveled hair i dont think mr lurie can do that he said softly but well find the puppy james i know we will can i come with you cally asked she realized she didnt want to leave her father on his own mr frasier nodded yes come with me i can use the moral support hurry back callys mother called after them dont leave us alone here too long okay cally took a deep breath as she let the fresh air caress her face then she climbed into the blue taurus beside her father the car crunched down the gravel drive when they backed into the street out from under the blanketing trees the sun appeared cally saw that it was a warm beautiful day its a short drive her father said the sunlight reflecting off his glasses as he guided the car slowly down fear street whats the address again he had given the card to cally she read the number off the card four twentyfour she watched the old houses pass by many of them were set far back from the street half hidden by tall hedges and shrubs as he drove mr frasier kept clearing his throat and tapping the wheel nervously poor dad hes in such bad shape cally thought whatever he saw up in the attic last night has totally changed him the fear street cemetery passed by on the drivers side beyond the fence stretched crooked rows of white tombstones gleaming like bones in the bright sunlight cally held her breath until the cemetery rolled out of sight that was one superstition she and kody agreed upon always hold your breath when you pass by a graveyard it should be on your side mr frasier said clearing his throat keep an eye out cally he slowed the car see any numbers cally squinted up at the mailboxes along the street that one is four hundred she said it must be on this block mr frasier slowed the car to a crawl whats that number cally squinted hard at the mailbox on a tilted pole thats four ten she announced they passed the next house a tall stone house with an oldfashionedlooking turret that made it resemble a castle thats four twentytwo cally told her father so its got to be the next one okay mr lurie ready or not here we come mr frasier declared he pulled the car to the curb they both peered out of the passenger window and gasped its an empty lot cally said chapter they both stared out at the tangle of tall weeds low shrubs and wild grass theres nothing here cally whispered mr frasier cleared his throat nervously it it must be the next one he stammered he pulled the car away from the curb and edged slowly down the street the empty lot ended at the corner a large brick house rose up behind a tall hedge on the corner of the next block this has got to be luries office mr frasier said cally leaned out the window no number she said oh wait she spotted a low wooden address sign at the bottom of the hedge its four twentysix but thats impossible her father cried shrilly he grabbed the business card from callys hand and studied it then he backed the car up slowly checking the numbers on both sides of the street an empty lot he said sighing an empty lot his weary voice revealed his defeat hey ive got an idea cally said brightening anthony told us about the town historian from the library maybe hes still working at the library and maybe hell know where we can find mr lurie callys dad gazed at her his expression frightened cally he seemed so far away so lost in his own thoughts she wondered if he bad even heard her suggestion she felt a little relieved when he finally said okay its worth a try but his voice sounded strained and his eyes still seemed focused somewhere far away we gave lurie all our money he muttered more to himself than to cally every penny went for the house every penny they had to drive around for quite a while before they found the shadyside library a square redbrick building in the north hills section of town three blocks from the high school a grayhaired woman at the front desk carefully stamped half a dozen books checking the date on each one before raising her eyes to acknowledge cally and her dad can i help you were looking for a man who is the town historian cally told her does he work here you mean mr stuyvesant the woman replied curtly reference room she pointed down the hall then returned to stamping books mr stuyvesant dressed in a white shirt a narrow yellow tie and black trousers sat hunched over a small metal desk that stood in front of the card catalog as cally approached she saw that he was nearly bald except for a tuft of white hair just above his forehead he had a round red face a thin pointed nose and tiny black eyes which reflected the blue glow of the computer monitor on his desk he flashed them a pleasant smile as they came dose this is the reference mom may i help you find something well were hoping you can help us find someone mr frasier said his voice echoing in the empty room someone told us you were the town historian cally said mr stuyvesant seemed pleased by this his smile widened and his face grew even redder i take a special interest in shadysides past he said with obvious pride were trying to find a real estate agent mr frasier said impatiently the librarians smile faded have you tried the yellow pages mr frasier blushed you dont understand he said irritably were trying to find a man named jason lurie cally interrupted he is the man who sold us our house we thought you might have some kind of town directory i am a town directory mr stuyvesant boasted his tiny black eyes sparkling i know just about every business in shadyside people say i mind everyones business but my own he laughed a highpitched giggle at his own joke have you heard of mr lurie callys dad asked his arms crossed in front of his chest mr stuyvesant wrinkled his bald forehead you sure you dont mean the lowry agency theyre over on division street lurie mr frasier repeated jason lurie hmmm mr stuyvesant rubbed his chin lurie lurie it does sound familiar he stood up from his small desk chair he was a big man and had to push himself up with both hands he made his way to the shelf behind his desk and picked up a large book this is the current business register he said he set the book down on his desk and leaning over it his face just an inch or two from the book began thumbing through the pages judson lurie no jason callys dad replied frowning jason lurie nope mr stuyvesant slammed the book shut not in shadyside he scratched his bald head let me check something for you he made his way back to the shelf and returned with a larger volume bound in dark leather the worn cover indicated to cally that the book was quite old this is a historical record mr stuyvesant told them setting it down carefully on the small metal desk its my own personal record ive kept it myself since the early fifties lets see if your mr lurie exists in here breathing noisily mr stuyvesant began searching through the big volume running a finger down the columns cally and her father stood impatiently on either side of him watching the librarian as he made his way through several pages suddenly his finger stopped he lowered his face even closer to the page and his lips moved silently as he read when he raised his eyes to cally and mr frasier the color had drained from his face and his tiny eyes were wide with shock whats the matter mr stuyvesant cally asked well the librarian hesitated i have a listing here for jason lurie but it isnt quite what youd expect read it please callys father urged mr stuyvesant lowered his face to the book and moving his finger over the page began to read in a quiet voice jason lurie real estate agent in july of found his family murdered in a new house he had built for them hanged himself one month later in the same house house located at fear street chapter dear diary were all so frightened now we want to move away from here to leave this house as fast as possible but dad says we dont have the money to go poor dad has been acting so strange he has a faraway look in his eyes all the time as if hes so upset so lost in his own disturbed thoughts that he cant focus and i caught him talking to himself twice today he was pacing back and forth in the backyard talking out loud to himself a mile a minute he was muttering something about simon fear and bodies buried in the basement that really gross story that anthony told us he was muttering about mr lurie too im so worried about him im worried about james too mom and dad signed him up for day camp i think mainly to get him out of the house when the bus came to pick him up tuesday morning james refused to go he cried and carried on not like james at all he said he couldnt leave cubby yes we still hear cubbys sad cries we hear them late at night now mournful lonely howls james wont give up the search when he hears the dog crying he tries to track the puppy down but he never finds him at least there havent been any more nights like last sunday no more green vomit spewing into the sink no more blood dripping from the ceiling but were all nervous all the time whenever the house creaks we expect something frightening to happen as much as i try i cant stop thinking about mr lurie i met him i shook hands with him how could he have hanged himself in our house thirty years ago there has to be a logical explanation right dad keeps saying hes going to find mr lurie he keeps saying that mr lurie isnt dead that its all a trick by mr lurie to run away with our money but i dont think mr stuyvesant in the library lied to us poor dad he isnt thinking clearly at all at least kody and i have been getting along pretty well i havent forgiven her for pretending to be a ghost and deliberately scaring me but ive had to put my anger aside since we have so many real problems now and i feel sorry for kody shes stuck hanging around the house all day while i go off to my job mr hankers still comes every morning and disappears into the basement i guess hes still fighting rats but no other work is being done my job at the boutique is really fun ive met some great people and i even managed to go to the corner a couple of times to see anthony anthony is a great guy i havent thought about rick in ages tomorrow night will be our first date were supposed to go to the movies at the mall i just had an idea about tomorrow night im going to call anthony right now and invite him to dinner so i have to sign off now more tomorrow cally eagerly picked up the phone on her desk and punched in anthonys number it rang twice then anthony picked up hi anthony its me cally he sounded surprised to hear from her whats up cally i was just thinking about you she said great then she heard him shout to his parents get off the line its for me a loud click mom likes to listen in anthony said chuckling i keep telling her to get a life why dont you come over for dinner tomorrow night cally blurted out you know before the movie huh you mean at your house the invitation obviously caught anthony by surprise yeah she told him we usually cook up a big pot of spaghetti on saturday night how about it well the line went silent cally let out a forced laugh tough decision and then she realized why anthony was so reluctant anthony what is your problem she demanded are you really afraid of this house is that it no no way he insisted im not afraid really then youll come great cally couldnt hide her enthusiasm maybe ill bake a cake or something for dessert sounds good anthony replied what time come about six cally told him she thought she still heard some doubt in his voice youre not really afraid to come here are you no of course not he replied nothing bad will happen i promise cally said cheerfully but as she said the words she felt a chill of fear and she found herself wondering is that a promise i can keep chapter anthony arrived a few minutes after six on saturday evening cally greeted him at the front door he was wearing a green and whitestriped rugby shirt over black jeans it had rained all day making the house gloomier and damper than ever the rain had let up a little before five anthony stopped to wipe his wet sneakers on the straw welcome mat whats up he asked trying to sound casual but cally saw the uncertainty in his eyes as he gazed at the house the spaghetti is boiling and i baked brownies she informed him she held the screen door open i didnt quite bake them enough theyre soft and mushy the way i like them he said flashing her an awkward smile he followed her into the house smells good he said sniffing thats the tomato sauce she told him leading him past the living room hope you like garlic and then before she realized what she was doing cally leaned forward and kissed him it was the most impulsive thing she had ever done she pressed her lips against his and brought her hands up to his shoulders i just need to be kissed she told herself i need to be hugged to be held i need someone to help lift the gloom of this horrible house anthony reacted with surprise at first but then he wrapped his arms around callys waist and returned the kiss yes she thought yes this is what i need right now the kiss lasted a long time finally cally ended it brushing her lips against his cheek they stepped back from each other and she suddenly felt awkward she had never done anything like that before mom and dad arent home she told him holding his hand and leading him to the dining room the table was set for three she saw that kody had forgotten the napkins they went to visit relatives they took james with them so its just you and me he asked brushing back his dark hair with one hand and kody kody said emerging from the kitchen she had a long wooden spoon raised in front of her she tasted it mmmm the sauce is okay she announced a tittle too garlicky you forgot the napkins cally told her kody shook her head fretfully i always forget something she turned back to anthony cally told me youre afraid of our house cally saw anthonys cheeks turn pink thats a filthy lie he said grinning listen were not going to talk about the house tonight cally instructed were going to have a nice dinner and were going to talk only about fun things she glared meaningfully at her sister were not going to talk about dead bodies or ghosts or anything like that right kody turned back into the kitchen uhoh the pot is boiling over all three of them darted into the kitchen to rescue the spaghetti cally had a good time at dinner the best time she had had since moving into fear street kody obediently stayed away from the subject of the house and the frightening things that had occurred in it anthony told them funny stories about shadyside high and the kids he knew there and he told them about a hilarious track meet in which the entire shadyside team anthony included ran the wrong way for a meter event the old house rang out with gleeful laughter for the first time this has been the longest dreariest summer i cant wait for school to start kody declared cally admitted to herself that she was also eager to start going to her new school her old high school had been so small only forty kids in the entire tenth grade it would be fun to meet a whole new group of kids and make new friends as they ate anthony appeared to relax cally was happy to see that the spaghetti was a success they all had two helpings afterward the rich chocolaty brownies disappeared in a hurry when they were finished cally stood up and glanced at the dock wed better clean up fast she said well be late ill take care of the dishes kody offered no itll be faster if we all do it anthony said he stacked the dinner plates and placed the big salad bowl on top of them and carried them into the kitchen hes a great guy kody whispered leaning across the dining room table toward cally cally smiled and nodded kody sighed just think if i had showed up at that restaurant first maybe hed be taking me to the movies cally heard the water in the kitchen sink start to run then she heard the grinding roar of the garbage disposal poor kody she thought frowning at her sister across the table always so jealous youll meet some guys cally said raising her voice over the roar of the disposal as soon as school starts cally started gathering up the forks and spoons she dropped them all back onto the table when she heard the hideous scream anthony his shrill howl rose up over the grinding rumble of the garbage disposal cally lurched toward the kitchen then hesitated in the doorway she shut her eyes she didnt want to see what was happening in there she didnt want to find out what was making anthony shriek in such pain but she had no choice letting out a low cry she stepped into the kitchen in time to see him tugging tugging his arm bending and pulling tugging with all his strength as he screamed struggling to pull his hand from the roaring grinding sink drain finally the hand came free his eyes bulging with horror anthony raised his arm in front of him my hand the hand was a mangled pulp a pink and red mass of skin blood and bone my fingers he shrieked his shrill voice rising over the grinding roar where are my fingers chapter cally hesitated for a second cupping her hand over her mouth as she gaped in horror at anthonys pulpy hand then ignoring the wave of nausea that swept up from her stomach she dove past him to the sink she clicked off the garbage disposal anthonys frantic howls rose through the quiet my fingers my fingers leaning over the sink cally peered down into the drain then sobbing gasping in noisy shallow breaths she plunged her hand down and pulled up the two fingers that had been cut off my fingers my fingers anthony was shrieking holding the mangled hand in front of his face with his other hand kody stood paralyzed by the back door breathing hard her mouth wide open my fingers my fingers wrapping the two fingers in sheets of paper towel cally called to her sister the car start the car weve got to get him to the emergency room kody hesitated raising her hands to the sides of her face how did it happen how kody cally screamed at the top of her voice trying to shock her sister into action get the car kody swallowed hard then obediently ran to get the car keys to the frasiers second car my fingers my fingers anthonys cries sounded more like the wails of a trapped animal fighting back her nausea cally tightly wound a dish towel around the mangled hand then holding the wrappedup fingers tightly in one hand she slid her other arm around anthonys quavering shoulders and gently guided him out to the car cally visited anthony in the hospital the next afternoon he was groggy from the painkillers the doctors had given him his hand lay under an enormous white cast that went up to his elbow he stared at her numbly he answered her questions with short yeses and noes sometimes he didnt answer at all anthonys parents huddled tensely together on the other side of their sons bed they whispered quietly to each other anthonys mother kept dabbing at her eyes with a shredded tissue they sewed the fingers back on she told cally in a choked whisper they sewed them both on but they dont think theyll work he he wont be able to move them she burst into sobs which she muffled with one hand anthonys father tried to comfort hen anthony stared at cally his eyes dilated and watery he didnt say anything hes in shock his father explained hes still very dazed and then he hesitantly said anthony told me he felt as if some force grabbed him and pulled his hand down into the disposal how did it happen i i dont know cally stammered i wasnt in the kitchen i only heard i really dont know she knew she couldnt hold her tears back much longer leaning over the bed she said goodbye to anthony then nodding farewell to his parents she hurried from the room that night mr frasier paced the living room shaking his head as he took his long quick strides james sat on the couch rocking back and forth to a secret rhythm james why are you doing that cally demanded i want cubby was his muttered reply he continued to rock slamming his back against the back of the couch wheres mom kody asked sprawled sideways on the armchair beside the couch a copy of sassy spread over her lap went to bed early cally told her she was upset were all upset mr frasier said turning at the window and pacing back toward them his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his baggy brown shorts upset were upset were very upset he chanted under his breath dad what happened at your cousins house kody demanded you went to see him about lending you money did he no he didnt mr frasier snapped he didnt he didnt come through and now everyone is upset very upset you mean kody persisted i mean he couldnt lend us the money to get out of this place mr frasier shouted his eyes wild behind his glasses his face reddening he said he had had a bad year he has tax problems he couldnt help oh kody sank back into the chair and pretended to read the magazine james cant you stop that rocking cally demanded her brother his eyes on the darkness outside the window ignored her mrs nordstrom entered drying her chubby hands on a dish towel the kitchen is cleaned up she reported to callys dad he stopped his pacing and squinted at her as if trying to figure out what she was saying such a terrible mess the housekeeper said sternly this house it has a curse on it im afraid please dont quit mr frasier begged please mrs nordstrom we need you yes yes ill be back in the morning mrs nordstrom said sighing she turned and disappeared from the room i want cubby james muttered his face drawn into a pout i heard cubby this morning i heard him crying its not really cubby you hear cally told him its just the wind or something squeaking no it isnt james screamed angrily its cubby it is cubby he resumed his furious rocking so what are we going to do kody asked her father raising her eyes from the magazine he didnt seem to hear her he stood at the window staring out into the darkness as if in a trance kody repeated the question well we nave to finish painting the porch mr frasier said without turning around then we have to patch the roof the shingles should be replaced and then no daddy cally broke in sharply thats not what kody meant she meant its bedtime i think he interrupted he stared across the room to the clock on the mantel bedtime for everyone were all just overtired wed be okay if we werent so tired we just stay up too late thats all thats our whole problem cally started to protest but she realized there was no point it was impossible to communicate with their father right then maybe hell be in better shape tomorrow she thought hopefully maybe hell be able to think clearly she crossed the room and gave him a quick kiss on his forehead he was so hot his skin was burning daddy you should take your temperature cally told him he didnt seem to hear her as cally kody and james unhappily climbed the stairs to their rooms cally turned back to see her father at the living room window he was pressing his forehead against the cool glass his eyes were shut tight his shoulders were trembling cally changed into a long nightshirt then she went down to the bathroom to brush her teeth when she finished she noticed the light still on in jamess room she made her over to it and peeked in he was in his pajamas standing beside his bed a picture book in one hand read me this story he demanded seeing cally in the doorway huh cally stepped into the room the air was hot and stuffy warmer than in the hall lets open a window in here she said no dont james cried his eyes wide he moved to block callys path to the window dont please okay okay cally said softly stopping beside him why dont you want the window open i just dont he replied hes afraid she realized james never used to be afraid of anything but now read me this he shoved the book into her hand cally glanced at the cover the picture book was called pug the ugly bunny read it sit here james climbed into bed and patted the mattress at his side but this is a baby book cally protested you havent read this book in at least five years and now you can read it yourself please read it to me he asked in a tiny pleading voice cally felt as if she might burst into tears poor james she thought hes trying to go back to being a baby everything has frightened him so much hes trying to go back to when things were happy happy and safe with a sob she threw her arms around his slender body pulled him close and hugged him he felt so fragile so delicate james didnt make any effort to free himself he just repeated the story please read it to me cally let go of him and wiped the tears off her cheeks with her hands then she settled next to her brother on his narrow bed and read the picture book to him as if he were two instead of nine after she finished reading she set the book down said good night and made her way from the room she stopped in the doorway to peer back at him james had picked up the book and was silently reading through it again shaking her head cally turned and slowly made her way down the narrow hall to her room cally felt like crying again as she thought of james of how fearful he had become how pitifully fearful she had no way of knowing that she would never see her brother again chapter dear diary my poor brother im so worried about him he has started acting like a total baby a few minutes ago he made me read him a picture book he hasnt read since he was three and he has become afraid of everything he is even afraid to have his bedroom window open at night james was never like that before this house is changing all of us mom has become so quiet so withdrawn she barely says a word most nights she goes to her room right after dinner and just lies in bed in the dark when i asked her if she wanted to come with me to the mall to start looking for school clothes she just shook her head and walked away im worried the most about dad he spends hours pacing back and forth talking to himself like a crazy person sometimes he stares at us with this weird expression on his face as if he doesnt recognize us he keeps talking about how hes going to find that real estate agent mr lurie and get our money back but he knows thats impossible then dad will start talking about how hes going to fix this place up get it in really good shape paint it and everything as if thats going to help theres evil here real evil i know i sound like kody but i have to admit that kody was right the stones anthony told us about the fears and the people they murdered and buried under our house and about the poor family who built the house they must be true oh anthony will i ever see you again i called the hospital tonight but his mother came on the phone she was very cold to me she said anthony didnt want to talk to me and didnt want to see me i guess i cant blame him i practically forced him to come here and then cally stopped writing when she heard the first highpitched cry holding her pen above the diary page as if frozen in place she tilted her head and listened mommy daddy the pen fell from her hand as she shoved the desk chair back and leapt to her feet the cries were coming from jamess room shrill frightened cries is he having a nightmare cally wondered james had terrible nightmares when he was little sometimes he would wake up two or three times a night screaming and crying but he hadnt had bad dreams for years mommy daddy come get me lurching toward the door cally stubbed her toe on the leg of the desk she cried out in pain and hopped the rest of the way james whats the matter she heard her father calling heavy footsteps more cries kody appeared in the hall rubbing her eyes callys mother appeared from her bedroom hurrying after mr frasier mommy where are you jamess cry sounded tiny far away ignoring the throbbing pain that shot up her leg cally hobbled after the others down the hall to jamess room james mrs frasier choked out cally stopped in the doorway her father clicked on the ceiling light james where are you the first thing cally saw was the picture book about the ugly bunny it was carefully propped up against jamess pillow but the sheets and blankets were tossed on the floor at the foot of the bed mommy are you there daddy cally could hear jamess voice so clearly he was there in the room with them but where james are you hiding where are you james mrs frasiers voice trembled her eyes were red rimmed wide with fear come get me mommy its dark here its very dark here jamess words sent a cold shiver down callys back she saw kody gasp and raise her hand to her mouth come get me please james begged where are you james mrs frasier cried please tell us where you are its too dark here its too dark mommy callys father tore desperately at the sheets jerking them off the bed he lurched to the closet and pulled open the door james kody dropped to the floor and searched under the bed mr frasier moved frantically to the window and peered out where are you son come get me please come get me im scared daddy just tell us where you are callys mother shrieked tugging at her hair with both hands tell us james tell us where you are its so dark here mommy i dont want to be here i dont want to be here mommy come get me tell us james mrs frasier shrieked in a terrified voice cally had never heard before tell us where you are silence cally gripped the doorframe her hands as cold as ice her heart thudding in her chest james where are you mrs frasier repeated sobbing im coming to get you james callys father said searching the closet again ducking low to look under the computer table dont worry im coming just tell me where you are im right here daddy im right here the tiny frightened voice said its real dark here im afraid please come get me please where mr frasier repeated desperately where where cally jumped startled as her mother let out a shrill scream hes there mrs frasier shrieked pointing hes right there chapter huh where mr frasier turned to gape at his wife callys mother pointed furiously there james is right there cally didnt see anything her mother was pointing to thin air hes there get him get james mrs frasier insisted but i dont see mr frasier started to say his eyes dancing wildly behind his glasses his hands balled into tense fists at his sides in the wall hes in the wall callys mother screamed pointing come get me its too dark in here jamess voice sounded even softer now more frightened with a frantic cry callys father began clawing at the wallpaper im coming james daddy is coming kody moved quickly she grabbed her father by the shoulders and struggled to pull him back daddy your hands mr frasiers fingers were cut and bleeding hes in the wall get him get him out of there mrs frasier shrieked still tugging her hair we need tools a sledgehammer mr frasier declared i ill get it cally said hesitantly she felt so helpless standing in the doorway gripped with terror watching the horror sweep over her family ill get the sledgehammer before she even realized what she was doing cally was running barefoot down the creaking stairs toward the back hall pulling open the basement door clicking on the dim light making her way down the steep wooden stairs the concrete basement floor felt so cold under her bare feet the sledgehammer she thought where her eyes searched desperately over the cluttered floor the moving floor the squirming floor moving ohhhh cally uttered a low cry as the rats came into focus at least a dozen of them their tiny eyes red in the dim light their snakelike tails sweeping along the floor as they squirmed and scuttled why hasnt mr hankers killed them yet cally wondered gaping at the disgusting creatures trembling all over why are there still so many rats cally spotted a sledgehammer and iron pick leaning against the basement wall as she started toward them the rats all stopped moving cally froze the rats reared up on their hind legs their red eyes trained menacingly on her theyre going to attack cally realized a wave of fear made her entire body convulse in a cold shudder a shrill hissing sound rose up from the staringrats a warning cry a call to battle with a desperate wail cally lurched to the wall grabbed the sledgehammer then she spun around turning to the rats she raised the heavy hammer high with both hands the rats didnt move the red eyes glowed brightly their shrill hissing grew louder are they going to attack are they going to charge all at once slowly cally lowered the sledgehammer she grabbed the metal pick then she sucked in a deep breath and plunged back toward the stairs the shrill rat hiss pierced the air a deafening terrifying sound cally struggled to ignore it as she stumbled up the stairs dragging the heavy tools with her her heart pounding so hard it hurt she reached the top and slammed the door behind her at last the hissing stopped cally swallowed hard she hurried through the darkness carrying the sledgehammer and pick up the stairs she could hear her mothers loud sobs as she reached the secondfloor landing and she could hear her fathers frantic shouts were coming james hold on hold on were coming her father grabbed the sledgehammer from cally he dove toward the wall and began slamming it wildly against the dark wallpaper were coming james were coming daddys coming now he shouted as he worked dropping the hammer he grabbed the pick and tore through the wallpaper then clawed away at the plaster underneath cally sank down beside her sister on jamess bed watching her fathers desperate stabs at the wall her hands clasped tightly in her lap cally fought back the waves of nausea that rose up from her stomach kody was breathing hard gasping with each breath her arms crossed tightly protectively around her chest mrs frasier stood hunched against the far wall sobbing loudly shaking her head and moaning im coming daddys coming james the plaster cracked large chunks fell away dropping over mr frasiers bare feet and onto the bedroom floor sweat stained the back of his pajama top as he worked he groaned and cried out with each swipe at the wall james can you hear me im coming for you im almost there and then cally saw the last chunk of plaster fall away groaning mr frasier took a step back they all stared at the gaping black hole he had made the empty black hole james mr frasier called breathlessly his chest heaving he wiped the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve james silence cally leapt to her feet she crossed the room pushed past her dazed exhausted father and stuck her head into the hole in the wall can you see him she heard her mother call is he in there cally pulled her head back its empty she choked out but cally mrs frasier started empty just a hole cally muttered mr frasier let the sledgehammer fall heavily to the floor he let out a long sigh daddy mommy where are you the tiny cry made everyone jump james cally turned back to the wall im afraid im really afraid come get me the voice wasnt coming from the wall he hes downstairs kody stammered pointing yes mrs frasiers expression brightened i can hear him in the living room she turned and stumbled out into the hall james james are you down there callys father picked up the tools and lumbered after her cally and kody exchanged frightened glances none of us is getting out of here alive kody muttered her green eyes clouded with fear we have to find him cally insisted in a trembling voice we have to as they hurried into the hall they heard their mothers scream then they heard the heavy thump of a body falling down the stairs then silence chapter cally got to the top of the stairs a few steps ahead of kody staring to the bottom she saw her mother sprawled on the floor on her side her body twisted at an impossible angle mr frasier was bent over her frantically squeezing her hands is mom okay did she fall is she all right the girls voices competed from the top of the stairs cally swallowed hard her mother wasnt moving wasnt moving at all is she okay is she finally their mother stirred my arm she moaned my arm hurts so much mr frasier gently rolled her onto her back exposing her right arm which had been bent underneath her i i think its broken mrs frasier said through gritted teeth mommy daddy where are you jamess highpitched cry made mr frasier let go of his wifes hand and climb to his feet james are you here ohhh my arm mrs frasier struggled to sit up cally and kody dashed down the stairs to help her weve got to get you to the hospital cally told her mother no mrs frasier protested i cant leave i cant leave until we find james she winced in pain cally glanced at the torn sleeve of her mothers nightgown mom your arm the jagged bone was poking through the tear in her mothers sleeve i cant leave i cant leave mrs frasier shrieked mommy where are you come get me hes up in the ceiling mr frasier declared raising his eyes to the high living room ceiling are you up there james i can hear you up there hey i found cubby they heard james exclaim here cubby here cubby i found cubby cally could hear the puppy barking behind jamess shrill cries yes hes up in the ceiling mr frasier declared breathlessly his eyes dancing crazily in his head dad cally grabbed her fathers shoulder moms arm we have to get her to the hospital the bone its no he jerked out of her grasp i have to get james hes right up there he pointed to the ceiling daddy i found cubby the voice did sound as if it were coming from above their heads but moms arm cally protested ignoring her mr frasier pushed past cally and made his way to the front porch he reappeared a few seconds later dragging the aluminum ladder into the living room im coming james he dragged the sledgehammer up the ladder and began swinging it at the ceiling the plaster cracked sending a fine powder down over him im coming james can you hear me cally crossed the living room to the phone beside the couch im calling for an ambulance she told kody who was bent over mrs frasier trying to comfort her cally lifted the receiver to her ear hey she cried out when she didnt hear a dial tone she clicked the phone several times silence hey the phone is dead with a loud crack a big chunk of the ceiling came crashing down gripping the side of the ladder mr frasier dodged out of the way as the heavy piece of ceiling narrowly missed him james he peered up into the dark hole he had made silence now james are you up there you can come out now silence mr frasier climbed one step higher on the ladder james across the room cally watched in silent dread squeezing the dead phone receiver in her hand james isnt in there she told herself feeling a cold shiver run down her back james isnt there were never going to find him never she watched her father climb another rung of the ladder and then she saw a dark hand reach down from the ceiling hole cally saw at once that it was not a human hand it was a shadow hand a transparent hand gray and billowy as if made of smoke with wriggling long fingers like snakes cally gasped as the hand swirled around her fathers face covering him covering his face in darkness reaching down from the ceiling the hand darkened around him until mr frasier appeared to have no head at all chapter the phone fell from callys hand she uttered a helpless cry of protest and then she saw the shadow hand move upward the dark fingers slithered like snakes as the arm pulled back up into the ceiling gripping the sides of the ladder her father stared blankly at cally i i cant see he cried daddy cally darted toward the ladder i cant see im totally blind her father exclaimed in a voice choked with horror nooooo mrs frasiers wail floated from the stairway help me down mr frasier cried in panic he gripped the ladder more tightly cally help me down i cant see everything is black i cant see a thing and then as cally reached up to help her father a tiny voice floated into the room where are you daddy where are you mommy arent you coming to get me i hate hospitals mrs frasier moaned i cant believe we were there all day i thought wed never get out cally helped her to her bedroom lets get you into bed mom im going to make you a cup of hot tea she said softly then ill start dinner kody help mom okay kody stepped into the room her eyes searching every corner i think id rather be in the hospital than in this house she said shuddering we cant leave not while theres a chance of finding james mrs frasier said her eyes revealing her sadness mom the police were all over the house last night cally replied they searched every inch they couldnt find any sign of james mrs frasier started to sob kody hurried to get her some tissues she flashed cally a warning glance lets not talk about it now kody whispered at least the surgery on your arm went well cally said trying desperately to think of something cheerful to say it still hurts so much mrs frasier complained dabbing her tears with a wad of tissues and how will i manage with this enormous cast i cant even undress myself well take care of you cally replied softly she shuddered she didnt want to be back in this house either she had called their cousins from the hospital she asked if she and her family could move in with them for a short while the cousins generously agreed as soon as mr frasier got out of the hospital they would pack up and drive there then they would be out of this terrifying place but would their mother agree to leave without james cally wondered she hadnt had the nerve to bring up the subject yet she hadnt even told her mother that she had called their cousins do you think theyll let daddy out of the hospital tomorrow kody asked following cally downstairs to help get dinner started theyd better cally murmured i dont want to spend another day here kody i really dont leaning over her desk cally stared down into her open diary the blank page gleamed under the desk lamp i cant write tonight cally realized if i do ill just start to cry and i already spent all day crying crying for james for mom for dad for all of us i dont even know if i have any tears left she stretched her arms over her head everything ached her arms her back i need a hot bath she told herself but no not here not in this house im afraid to get into the bathtub in this house still stretching trying to stretch the aches away she stared down at the blank diary page ive written in my diary most nights for the past three years she thought but not tonight not tonight she pushed the chair back and climbed to her feet what would i write anyway she asked herself bitterly that my little brother has disappeared that my mother broke her arm in two places and is in complete shock that my father has suddenly gone blind and is lying in the hospital talking endlessly crazily not making any sense at all with a loud sigh cally made her way to her bed she pulled the sheet up to her chin but still couldnt stop shaking ill never get to sleep she told herself i cant sleep in this house i know i cant she stared up at the ceiling listening to the heavy silence despite the warmth of the night she had shut the bedroom window tight and locked it her bedroom door was also shut tight will jamess tiny voice interrupt the silence she wondered unable to stop her trembling her chills will i begin to hear cubbys shrill barks james james where are you she murmured aloud and once again the tears began to flow down her cheeks i do have more tears she told herself i have endless tears endless tears her bitter thoughts were interrupted by a startling sound cally jerked up straight sliding her back up against the headboard three knocks on the bedroom door three soft taps then a pause then three more soft knocks kody cally cried her voice a choked whisper kody after all thats happened how could you chapter kody cally called angrily no reply three more gentle taps cally jumped out of bed kody this isnt funny she called have you totally lost it crossing the room quickly cally yanked open the door and stared out into the dark hallway why are all the lights out she wondered i told kody to leave them all on all of them peering into the darkness she saw kody fleeing down the hall her long white nightgown the nightgown she had worn the last time she had tried to scare cally floated behind her as she ran hey kody come back cally shouted lets talk about this why are you doing this kody has snapped too cally realized sadly the horror in this house it has been too much for her and now heres my sister playing at being a ghost once again cally let out a frightened sob am i the only sane one left in my whole family she wondered she made her way down the dark hallway following kody the white nightgown moved in blues and grays seeming to float through the dark shadows kody stop cally pleaded stop this is so stupid and at these words kody stopped and turned back to cally even in the darkness cally could see the strange twisted smile on her sisters face kody what is it whats wrong cally demanded in a whisper kody why are you grinning at me like that her sister didnt reply and as cally drew closer close enough almost to touch her sister she stared hard into kodys face and saw that it wasnt kody after all not kody not kody cally it was cally ohhhh callys eyes bulged wide with horror as she realized she was staring into her own face chapter cally stared in horrified silence at the creature with her face and as she stared the creatures twisted smile grew wider the face floated back deeper into the shadows youre me youre cally cally declared frozen in fright in confusion in terrified amazement they gazed at each other for a moment one face twisted in disbelief the other grinning its chilling grin but why cally demanded ignoring the cold chills that swept down her body why do you look like me go the other cally whispered she raised her hand the long nightgown sleeve fluttering silently and pointed back toward callys bedroom go she instructed i i dont understand cally stammered who are you tell me tell me why you look like me she reached for the grinning girl but her hand pushed right through her shoulder it touched nothing nothing but air go the grin faded as the girl repeated her order go back to your room and read your diary huh cally gaped at herself at the strange duplicate of herself my diary go go now callys legs trembled her heart was racing somehow she managed to turn away somehow she was able to make her way back to her bedroom she clicked on the light she crossed to her desk the diary was open just as she had left it she clicked on the desk lamp she bent over the diary bringing her face down close a new entry there was a new entry on the open page of the diary in callys handwriting cally moved her lips silently as she read it i died tonight chapter noooo cally slammed the diary shut she heard scornful laughter behind her she turned to see the girl with her face floating across the room noooo cally repeated a cry of anger of protest of disbelief i am your ghost cally the girl whispered your diary wouldnt lie cally started to cry out but a sharp wave of pain shot up through her body my feet her feet were burning cally stared down to see the floor bubbling up over them so hot hot and sticky steaming black tar bubbling up over her feet hey cally struggled to run but the sticky tar clung tight pulling and holding her in its simmering heat help me callys plea came out as a choked whisper the burning tar was moving now up nearly to her knees seething and tossing tossing like hot black ocean waves cally bent reached down with both hands and tried to pull a leg up up from the bubbling tar but as she bent over hands reached up for her a dozen hands poking right up through the steaming bubbling tar so many hands tar covered and hot so hot scalding her through her nightshirt scalding her as they grabbed her legs her arms hot sticky hands burning cally burning her pulling her down into the swirling swarming black pit ohhhh help me down down let go let go of me but the hands held on and pulled her even deeper kody she cried as she sank into the bubbling black sea squirming struggling against the grip of the tarcovered hands cally saw her sister in the doorway saw her sisters horrified stare her shudder of disbelief kody help me cally desperately reached out to her pull me out hurry kody stood frozen in terror the seething tar reflected in her gaping eyes kody help me help me as the hands pulled her down as the steaming tar rose up over her waist cally leaned toward her sister reaching out to her pull me out kody pull me out she saw kody hesitate afraid to move afraid she might also be pulled into the seething tar pit but then kodys hands shot out kody leaned into the room reaching reaching out for cally hurry kody cally shrieked hurry im burning im burning kodys hands grabbed at callys missed grabbed again pull me out cally screamed as the putrid tar fumes swirled around her face choking her blinding her pull me out please chapter cally grabbed kodys hand felt its strong tug then felt it slip away kody no kody help me laughter burned callys ears the scornful laughter of her own ghost kody where are you kody and then cally saw the faces emerge from the rolling waves of tar the faces of the dead the hideous decayed faces grinning skulls with their rotting teeth faces with empty eye sockets dark holes where mouths should be struggling struggling to free herself as the tarcovered hands pulled her down down down into the putrid black heat cally stared at the faces as they whirled around her at the torn lips the toothless grins the gaping holes in the flesh of their cheeks so many hideous faces where did they all come from where where where and why are they grinning at me why are they pulling me where are they taking me kody callys last word and then the tar rolled over her neck up to her chin burning her choking her and she had no choice she gave in to it gave in to the darkness gave in to the boiling simmering heat gave in gave in gave in to the evil of the house cally let it bubble over her head over her over her over her and when she emerged from the tar a few moments later she was different in every way the evil the overpowering evil of the house had consumed her cally rose up from the seething tar and as she rose she realized she had become the ghost the ghost of herself she had met in the dark hallway and as she floated up she felt the centuryold rage felt all the anger all the fury all the smoldering evil so much evil that the walls rang out with her scornful laughter the laughter of a hundred tortured souls now triumphant inside her cally floated through the house floated through a new world of swirling dark shadows a ghost an evil ghost in a house of evil unaware of anything but her own hatred and anger two days later when the frasiers returned from callys funeral cally gazed at them and felt only envy gazed at her weeping sister and mother as they led a wind mr frasier into the house gazed at them and wondered why ate they alive and im not why should they be allowed to live when im dead watching kody collapse onto her bed racked with sobs cally felt nothing but hatred and the desire for revenge what are you crying about kody cally thought overwhelmed with bitterness you won youre still alive the family packed up the car the next morning cally watched from the window watched them pause in the driveway she saw mrs frasier cling tightly to callys father both of them finally convinced they would never see james again she saw kody standing close behind as they took their last look at the house that had ruined their lives there she is i see her kody screamed suddenly huh see who mrs frasier demanded in a trembling voice i see cally kody cried there in the window she pointed frantically see her see her mother kody get in the car mrs frasier replied sternly theres no one in the window just turn around and get in the car but kody didnt obey cally watched her as she took two steps closer to the window ill come back for you someday cally kody called i promise ill come back for you kodys solemn vow made cally laugh if you do come back dear sister youll be sorry she uttered to herself a bitter promise of her own youll be very sorry she watched her family climb into the car then as mrs frasier backed down the drive cally let out a long furious wail that shook the walls and rattled the windows it was a wail of fury of hatred of evil that she hoped would follow her family wherever they went epilogue cally floated through the swirling grays in a kind of half sleep she didnt fully awaken until the new family moved in it was an afternoon in early fall she heard mr lurie the real estate agent outside in the driveway peering out of the window she saw his ghastly smile saw his gray suit jacket flapping in a strong breeze saw his bonepale
