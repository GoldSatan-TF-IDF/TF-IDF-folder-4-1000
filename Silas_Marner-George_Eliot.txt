part chapter one in the days when the spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses one often saw certain small pale men in the countryside among the big strong farm workers these men looked like the remains of a disinherited race the shepherds dog barked fiercely when one of them walked by i bent under the weight of a heavy pack and the shepherd himself looked at the pack suspiciously even though he knew that it only contained linen cloth i dont trust weavers thought the shepherd who knows perhaps the devil helps them with their work in that far off time the country people were very superstitious they did not like anything strange or new and strange men who passed through the village were always viewed with suspicion the villagers knew nothing of these mens origins where were their homes who were their fathers and mothers and how can you trust someone if you do not know who his father and mother were to the peasants of old times the world outside their own direct experience was a region of mystery even if someone from distant parts settled in the village and lived there for many years he was still viewed with distrust the villagers would not have been surprised if after years of living peacefully among them he had committed some terrible crime the linenweavers who were emigrants from the town to the country were distrusted even more than ordinary strangers because of their skill any kind of cleverness seemed to the villagers to be like witchcraft they believed that honest people were not very clever whenever a linenweaver settled in a village the local people regarded him as an alien not to be trusted and so he lived in a state of loneliness in the early years of this century a linenweaver named silas marner lived and worked in a stone cottage close to an abandoned quarry near the village of raveloe the village boys were fascinated by the sound of silass loom they would often look through the windows of his cottage and watch him working they were a little afraid of him and so to cover up their fear they laughed at him imitating the strange sound of the loom and the bent shape of his body as he worked when he heard them laughing silas came to the door and the boys ran away they thought perhaps he could harm them by magic just by looking at them with his large brown shortsighted eyes they had heard their parents say that silas could cure illnesses with herbs and they thought that if he could heal by magic he could probably do harm by magic too silas had lived in raveloe for fifteen years the villagers all thought that he was very strange he never came to the rainbow for a pint of beer he never stopped to gossip in the village square his only contact with men and women was that necessary for his work at first the village girls thought he would want to find a wife and they declared that they would never marry a dead man come back to life again they said this because jem rodney the molecatcher had told them a strange tale one evening as he was walking home from squire casss woods where he had been shooting birds he saw silas marner standing still in a field staring before him with the eyes of a dead man jem spoke to him and shook his arm but the weaver did not reply or move he stood there rigid as if he had died standing up then suddenly he was normal again he looked at jem said goodnight and walked off when the villagers heard jems story some of them said that silas must have had a fit but old mr macey shook his head and said that no one could have a fit without falling down he believed that silass soul had left his body that evening and if a mans soul leaves his body it might meet with other spirits or demons and learn things from them mr macey was convinced that this explained silass knowledge of herbs how had he been able to cure sally oates when she was ill none of the doctors had been able to cure her but silass herbs had worked like magic as the years went by the villagers opinion of silas changed little except that they began to wonder about his money he worked all the time and was well paid for his cloth yet he lived very simply and never spent much money where was all that money going the thought that master marner had a pile of gold somewhere made him seem even more mysterious to the villagers even more different from themselves chapter two aithough his daily habits and his neighbours opinion of him had changed very little over the years silass inner life had been a history and a metamorphosis before he came to raveloe his life had been full of companionship and mental activity he had lived in the city and attended chapel at lantern yard the community at lantern yard was part of a narrow religious sect in which even the poorest member could distinguish himself if he could speak well the people at lantern yard had always considered silas a very pious and virtuous young man like many honest and fervent men silas had a strong sense of mystery if he had been better educated he might have found the explanations he sought in inquiry and knowledge but since he had had little schooling he turned to religion for explanations his mother had taught him to recognise and prepare medicinal herbs but during his years at lantern yard he began to think that practising his mothers skill might be sinful he believed that the herbs would do no good without prayer and that prayer might suffice without the herbs therefore the pleasure of wandering through the fields in search of dandelion and foxglove began to seem like a temptation silas had a close friend at lantern yard called william dane he too was considered a pious and virtuous young man however the community thought him too severe with those who were not as virtuous as himself and too proud of his own virtue so that he considered himself wiser than his teachers but silas could see no faults in william he looked at his friend with innocent admiration in his eyes the expression of trusting simplicity on marners face was very different from the complacent expression in danes narrow slanting eyes and thin lips silas and william often discussed salvation silas said that he hoped he was among those chosen by god but he could never feel sure william by contrast declared that he was absolutely certain that he would be saved because he had once had a dream in which he saw the words election sure standing alone on the white page of an open bible silas was engaged to a young woman named sarah who worked as a servant she and silas were saving their money so that they could get married but one evening something happened that changed silass future in the middle of a prayer meeting silas became suddenly still rigid and unconscious at first the people at the prayer meeting thought that he was dead but after more than an hour he returned to normal the people were then convinced that his mysterious suspended state had a spiritual meaning they thought that silas had been chosen by god and they asked him if he had had a vision during the trance a less truthful man might have invented a vision to please them and a less sane man might have believed his own invention but silas was both honest and sane so he told them the truth he had not had a vision william dane said that silass trance seemed more like a visitation of satan than a sign of gods favour he told silas to examine his soul and to confess any sin he had kept secret silas felt hurt that his friend doubted him and he noticed that sarah too seemed to withdraw from him now a short time after these events the senior deacon of the chapel fell ill silas and william took turns watching the old man by night silas would sit by the deacons bed until two in the morning then william would take over until six one night silas noticed that the old man had stopped breathing he touched his arm and found that it was rigid the deacon must have been dead for some time silas looked at the clock it was four in the morning did i fall asleep silas asked himself and why did william not come as usual at two oclock silas went to tell the others what had happened then he went to work but at six oclock william and the minister of the church came to silass house william said silas why did you not come at two oclock this morning as usual i felt ill said william but we came here to talk about something more important there was a bag of money in a locked drawer in the deacons bedside table the bag has been stolen silas and your knife was found in the drawer i swear before god that i am innocent cried silas i must have been asleep or perhaps i had another trance like the one you witnessed at the prayer meeting and the thief must have come in while i was in the trance they searched silass house and william found the empty bag which had contained the money hidden behind the wardrobe in silass bedroom confess silas cried william in a stern voice silas looked at him with reproach in his eyes and said william you have been my friend for nine years when have you known me to lie but god will prove my innocence the people of lantern yard never called the police when a crime was committed in their community they had their own ways of discovering innocence or guilt they decided to draw lots that way god could show them who was the guilty one the lots declared that silas marner was guilty the minister told silas that he must confess repent his sin and give the money back otherwise he would be expelled from the community silas walked up to william dane and said in an agitated voice now i remember my knife was not in my pocket you borrowed it you stole the money and now you are trying to blame me but your sin will not be discovered because there is no just god who governs the earth there is only a god of lies who bears witness against the innocent the community was shocked by these blasphemous words william said i leave our brothers and sisters to judge whether or not this is the voice of satan silas i will pray for you silas looked at sarah but she turned away from him with a look of disgust on her face one month later sarah married william dane and silas left lantern yard it was in this unhappy state that silas had come to raveloe he had lost his faith in god and his fellow man all that remained for him was work so he worked all day every day mindlessly like a spider spinning its web his customers paid him in coins of gold and silver and he kept them in an iron pot as time went on silas began to love those coins every day he worked for sixteen hours but at night he took his coins out of the pot and counted them their shapes and colours became familiar to him he loved to look at them and touch them he removed some bricks from the floor of his cottage underneath the loom and dug a hole there in which to hid the iron pot so year after year silas lived in this solitude with no human companionship and the only love in his life was the love he felt for the gold and silver coins in his iron pot chapter three the greatest man in raveloe was squire cass who lived in the large red house by the church squire casss wife had died many years ago he lived with his sons the villagers thought that the eldest son godfrey was a handsome pleasant young man they hoped that soon he would marry miss nancy lammeter for it was well known that godfrey and nancy were fond of each other but the villagers did not like squire casss second son dunstan they considered him a spiteful fellow who laughed at other peoples misfortunes and wasted all his money on gambling and drink recently people had noticed that godfrey was not as healthy and happy as usual they feared that perhaps his younger brother was leading him astray encouraging him to drink and to gamble one evening godfrey and dunstan were alone in the living room of the great red house dunstan had been drinking brandy his plump face was red and his eyes were bright he looked at his brothers sad pale face with a sneering smile dunstan you must pay me back that money i lent you said godfrey it was the rent i had collected for father and now he is asking me for it but i havent got the money dunstan replied why dont you find the money to pay father back you know dear brother that if i told father your secret he would cut you off without a penny but i cannot find the money to pay him cried godfrey oh im sure you will otherwise ill tell him that his handsome son was married in secret to molly farren she was such a nice young woman until she started to drink too much and take opium perhaps i will tell father everything and after all hell know some time she has been threatening to come to the house and tell him herself if i tell father at least you wont be able to torture me anymore dont be ridiculous godfrey you can sell your horse wildfire and pay father back ill help you to sell the horse do you know bryce the horse dealer in raveloe i know him very well and im sure he will pay one hundred and twenty pounds for wildfire godfrey covered his eyes with his hands and sighed wildfire was the best horse he had ever owned but he had to get the money somehow all right he said take wildfire and sell him but dont spend any of the money the next morning dunstan mounted wildfire and set off for the village he rode past the deep pit of the abandoned quarry and past silas marners cottage dunstan had often heard the villagers say that silas had a lot of money he thought he could probably frighten the weaver into giving him his money but then godfrey would not lose wildfire dunstan preferred to sell the horse because he knew it would pain godfrey dunstan rode to the village found bryce and agreed to sell wildfire to him that afternoon he could have sold the horse immediately and walked home with the money in his pocket but he wanted to go riding first he rode out to the fields to jump some fences he enjoyed riding and jumping for a couple of hours but as he was jumping one last fence wildfire was pierced with a hedgestake and fell down dead dunstan staggered to his feet and drank from the flask of brandy he always carried with him the horse was dead and the hundred and twenty pounds bryce would have paid for him were lost now dunstan would have to walk home and that seemed to him a humiliating thing he always rode on horseback to and from the village it was nearly four oclock and a fog was gathering dunstan started walking home along the lonely lane drinking his brandy and swearing at his misfortune the sky grew darker and the fog thicker as dunstan walked along then suddenly he saw a light dunstan realised that it must be coming from the window of silas marners cottage he decided to knock on the door and ask the old weaver to lend him a lantern once he was inside the cottage he would also ask silas to lend him some money he would promise to pay interest and if silas was still unwilling to part with the gold he would frighten him a little with this plan in mind dunstan knocked loudly on the door of the cottage there was no answer so dunstan pushed the door and it opened a great fire was burning in the fireplace but the cottage was empty dunstan wondered why marner had left his cottage unlocked perhaps he had got lost in the fog and had fallen into the abandoned quarry if so he would certainly drown the pit had been full of water for many years dunstan thought of taking the money if the old weaver were dead no one would ever know that it had been stolen he looked around the cottage searching for a hiding place the brick floor was sprinkled with sand but in one place the sand had been smoothed by a hand dunstan got down on his knees and pulled at the bricks they came out easily and in the hole beneath he saw an iron pot full of coins quickly dunstan replaced the bricks and smoothed the sand over them he took the iron pot and left the cottage closing the door behind him then he hurried out into the darkness chapter four that evening silas had gone to take some linen to mrs lam meters house the fog was thick and it had started to rain as he was walking home by the time he got back to his cottage he was cold wet and tired silas sat by the fire glad of the warmth the long hours of work were over and now was the best time of his day the time when he ate his supper and counted his money silas removed the bricks from the floor but the hole was empty he began to tremble violently desperately he searched the hole again and again he searched the entire cottage but his gold was nowhere to be found he ran out of his cottage and down the lane to the village in the rain the village men would all be at the rainbow now drinking beer and laughing together he would go to the rainbow and tell them all that he had been robbed the company at the rainbow that evening was very merry a great fire was blazing in the fireplace and the air was warm and smoky jem rodney was there and old mr macey the tailor and parish clerk too ben winthrop the wheelwright oates the cobbler bryce the horse dealer and many others they were drinking beer telling jokes and laughing when the door burst open and there stood silas marner soaking wet trembling and as white as a ghost ive been robbed cried silas to the astonished crowd my gold is gone someone has taken it i need the policeman and the judge calm down now master marner said mr snell the landlord coming out from behind the bar to take silass arm come and sit by the fire and tell us what happened silas sat down and told his story the company asked him many questions as the mysterious nature of the robbery became apparent they shook their heads in sympathy at his distress some were of the opinion that the devil had stolen silass gold but others said that it was just some stranger passing through finally they put on their coats and took silas to find the policeman and to tell the judge all about it the next day the whole village was talking about the robbery everyone went up to silass cottage and searched the area for clues the rain had washed away any footprints but they found a tinderbox in the mud near the abandoned quarry mr snell said that he had seen a travelling pedlar with a tinderbox passing through the village the day before the pedlar must have stolen silass gold but mr macey shook his head and said no this was much more mysterious than an ordinary robbery later in the rainbow two camps of opinion formed members of the pedlar and tinderbox camp headed by mr snell were convinced that the stranger was the thief but members of the supernatural camp headed by mr macey argued that god had caused the gold to vanish in order to punish silas for loving gold too much the two camps were involved in an animated argument when godfrey came into the rainbow he was worried about dunstan and wildfire dunstan had not returned home the previous night and godfrey was afraid that his brother had sold the horse and gone off to spend the money on gambling and drink looking around the faces in the rainbow godfrey saw bryce the horse dealer hello mr bryce have you seen my brother dunstan yes indeed said bryce i saw him yesterday what an unfortunate fellow he is what do you mean asked godfrey did he not tell you mr bryce told godfrey all about the accident and wildfires death godfrey left the rainbow even more worried than he had been when he arrived now there was no way he could find a hundred pounds to pay his father it seemed to him that he would have to confess everything now his father would be furious with him and nancy lammeter would never marry him before he had hoped that one day his wife molly would take too much opium and die leaving him free to marry nancy then no one would ever know about his secret past but now he would have to tell his father and his father would tell mr lammeter and he godfrey would lose everything chapter five time passed and no one wondered about dunstans continued absence once before he had disappeared after an argument with his father and had staved away for six weeks godfrey had decided not to confess everything to his father he had simply told him that he had lent the hundred pounds to dunstan and that dunstan had accidentally killed wildfire the old squire had been furious no one was surprised therefore that dunstan had gone off somewhere to escape his fathers fury silas meanwhile mourned for his lost gold he worked all day as before but in the evening instead of spending a happy hour counting his money he sat by the fire with his head in his hands and moaned the company at the rainbow still debated the cause of the robbery the police had been sent in search of the travelling pedlar but they had not found him even so mr snell believed that the pedlar had silass gold whenever he said so old mr macey shook his head and said that some people did not understand the mysteries of the world ever since the robbery the villagers had felt more kindly towards silas and as christmas drew near they brought him presents of food one of these visitors was mrs winthrop the wheelwrights wife she was a very mild patient hardworking woman who liked to help her neighbours especially those in trouble whenever anyone in the village was ill she went to offer her help and dr kimble often asked her to come and help him especially if somebody was dying one sunday after church she went to silass cottage with her little boy aaron and a plate of cakes silas was working on his loom when she arrived but he opened the door and invited her in before the robbery silas would have felt irritated at any interruption of his work but now he felt lonely and bereft and he welcomed any kindness from his neighbours mrs winthrop gave him the cakes and sat down by the fire its a pity you should work on sunday she said everyone needs a rest from work why dont you come to church ive never been to church said silas many years ago when i lived in the city i used to go to chapel dolly winthrop had never heard the word chapel before and was afraid to ask what it meant she thought it might mean something evil well if youve never been to church you dont know whether you would like it or not i think it would cheer you up there is music and singing i love going to church especially when i have troubles it makes me feel as if i had hope it makes me trust in god silas did not want to go to church but he realised that she was being kind and friendly and he felt grateful to show his gratitude he offered a cake to her little boy aaron have you ever seen such a lovely child asked dolly putting her arm around the boy and he has a wonderful singing voice aaron why dont you sing a christmas carol for master marner as soon as aaron had finished his cake he sang god rest ye merry gentlemen in a clear sweet voice dolly glanced at silas and smiled convinced that this would make him want to come to church silas was rather relieved when they left he did not go to church at christmas he had been moved by mrs winthrops concern for his welfare but all he wanted to do was to stay at home with his sorrow meanwhile in raveloe the christmas season was very merry the church bells rang and the villagers all dressed in their best clothes laughed and talked in the streets on the way to church but there was frost in the air so after church they all hurried home to eat drink and be merry there was a family party at squire casss house on christmas day dunstan had still not returned but no one missed him perhaps hell be home for new years eve said godfrey every new years eve the squire held a great party and invited all the ladies and gentlemen of the neighbourhood godfrey was longing for the party so that he could sit next to nancy at the dinner table and dance with her afterwards it would be a fine party and perhaps nancy would smile at him and look at him kindly he tried to think about these pleasant things instead of worrying about money molly had been asking him for money for some time now and he had no money to give her she had said that if he did not give her money she would come to the big red house and tell his father everything on new years eve the snow was falling as the carriages arrived outside the red house for the party miss nancy lammeter looked very lovely as she walked up the steps to the front door godfrey was waiting for her the sight of godfrey made her nervous she had told him quite clearly that she would not marry him but still he sometimes looked at her with loving eyes at other times he hardly spoke to her and he would ignore her for weeks and weeks how could he really love her if he acted so strangely and then she had heard gossip about him in the village she certainly was not going to marry a man who drank or gambled or wasted his money the red house was full of music and light and conversation godfrey led nancy to the dining room and seated her between himself and the old squire as she looked around the splendid table she thought a little sadly what a fine thing it would have been to have married godfrey and become the mistress of the red house she believed that a pure woman loved only one man in her life she had certainly loved godfrey before he had started acting so strangely and therefore she would never marry anyone else but she would not marry a man she could not respect there was a lot of lively conversation over dinner the older men joked with godfrey about how pretty nancy was and asked him if he had asked her to dance yet godfrey and nancy both found these jokes embarrassing but when godfrey did ask her to dance nancy accepted quietly as they moved onto the dance floor godfrey said thank you i thought you would refuse to dance with me i know you are angry with me you are quite right to be angry i have behaved very badly i have acted strangely towards you and i have wasted my money but if i changed would you forgive me nancy i would be glad to see a change for the better in anyone mr godfrey replied nancy but it would be better if no change were needed you are very cruel nancy said godfrey why dont you encourage me to be a better man im very miserable but you have no feeling i think the person without feeling is the one who behaves badly said nancy her eyes flashing godfrey was delighted with those flashing eyes they proved that she still cared for him chapter six while godfrey was forgetting the sorrows of his secret life in the sweet company of nancy lammeter his wife molly was walking with slow uncertain steps through the snowcovered raveloe lanes carrying her sleeping child in her arms she had decided to go to the red house on new years eve to humiliate him in front of all his friends ever since he had told her that he would never acknowledge her as his wife she had been planning this act of revenge he would be at the red house smiling and dancing she would go there and show herself her ragged clothes and her faded face that had once been beautiful and with their child in her arms she would tell the old squire that she was his eldest sons wife she knew that her poverty was not godfreys fault she had spent all the money he had given her on opium yet she felt bitterness towards him he lived in a fine house and wore fine clothes while she lived in misery as she walked on the snow fell more and more thickly she needed comfort and the only comfort she knew was the lump of opium hidden in her dress but she did not wish to take it because she had to take care of her child for a while she struggled against her desire for the opium but finally she lost the struggle swallowed the opium and walked on the wind was freezing and molly walked more and more slowly and drowsily she longed to lie down and sleep finally she lay down by a small bush on a bank of snow she leaned her back against the bush as if it were a pillow at first she held her child tightly to her bosom but slowly her hands relaxed and the childs blue eyes opened wide in the cold starlight mammy called the child but there was no answer there was a gleam of light nearby the child crawled away from her mother to catch the bright thing then she looked up and saw that the light was coming from a very bright place slowly she got up and walked through the snow to the open door of silas marners cottage there she saw a fire blazing in the fireplace she went up to the fire and sat in front of it on the hearth making little noises of pleasure then the warmth made her sleepy and she lay her golden head on the floor and fell asleep but where was silas while this strange visitor had come to his hearth he was in the cottage but he did not see her during the weeks since the robbery he had developed the habit of opening his door and looking out as if he thought his money might be coming back to him on this evening he had looked out more eagerly than usual because his neighbours had told him that it was good luck to sit up till midnight on new years eve and that if he did so his money might come back he had stood by the door looking out at the wide expanse of snow and listening to the silence just as he was about to close the door he fell into a trance he stood there still and rigid with wide sightless eyes holding open his door powerless to resist either the good or the evil that might enter there when the trance was over silas continued the action of closing the door unaware that any time had passed he returned to his chair by the fire the light from the fire was dim now and silass eyesight was poor looking down he thought he saw gold on the floor gold his own gold brought back to him as mysteriously as it had been taken away his heart began to beat violently he stretched out his hand to touch the gold but instead of hard coins his fingers touched soft warm curls silas fell on his knees in amazement it was a sleeping child a lovely round child with golden curls all over her head at the touch of his fingers the child awoke and cried out mammy silas took her in his arms and rocked her to comfort her then he warmed up some soup and fed it to her with a spoon after she had eaten the child began to pull at her boots they were wet and uncomfortable as he took off her boots silas realised that she must have been walking in the snow so she had not appeared by magic after all she had wandered in off the road with the child in his arms silas went to the door and looked out he could see her small footprints in the snow silas followed the footprints finally he came to a bank of snow with a small bush and a dark shadow on it but only when the child cried out mammy mammy did silas realise that the shadow was a human body i must find the doctor cried silas he remembered that all the ladies and gentlemen of the village were dancing at squire casss house that evening so he hurried along the lane towards the big red house with the child in his arms by this time the party at the red house was very merry indeed ladies and gentlemen were dancing and drinking wine the air was full of conversation and laughter godfrey was just about to ask nancy to dance with him again when he heard a disturbance at the door looking up he saw what seemed to him an apparition from the dead silas marner stood there wet with snow and holding godfreys own child in his arms godfrey had not seen the child for several months but he recognised her immediately and his face turned pale i need the doctor cried silas theres a woman out there in the snow i think shes dead godfreys heart leapt there was one terror in his mind at the moment it was that the woman might not be dead generally godfrey was a kind man but anyone whose life depends on secrecy is bound to have evil wishes godfrey joined the crowd of people around the weaver whose child is that asked nancy appearing at his side i dont know godfrey replied i think she belongs to some poor woman who has been found ill in the snow mrs kimble the doctors wife turned to silas and said leave the child here one of the servantgirls will take care of her no cried silas she came to me i have a right to keep her come on said dr kimble pulling on his coat theres no time to lose ill come with you said godfrey dr kimble sent a servant into the village to find mrs winthrop then he hurried out with godfrey silas and the child when they reached the cottage silas took the child in to warm her by the fire dr kimble and godfrey went straight to the snow bank and carried the womans body back to the cottage by the time they got there mrs winthrop had arrived they put the womans body down on the floor far from the fire where silas was rocking the child to sleep its too late said dr kimble shes dead shes probably been dead for hours godfrey looked down at the cold white face of his dead wife he felt an enormous relief and he felt guilty about his evil wishes and his relief he wished that he were a stronger man that he could confess everything now and claim the child as his own and provide for her but then he would lose nancy he looked over at the child by the fire she was not asleep yet and her big blue eves looked back at godfrey with no sign of recognition then she looked away from him and gazed up with loving interest at the weavers lace again godfrey felt relief though mingled with sadness because his own child did not recognise him come on godfrey there is nothing more we can do here said the doctor mrs winthrop please see that the body is prepared for burial and help master marner with the child goodbye marner godfrey lingered a moment by silass chair do you really intend to keep the child marner he asked yes silas replied she is alone in the world now and so am i i will take care of her well allow me to give you something to help buy her clothes said godfrey he placed a gold coin in silass hand and hurried out after the doctor chapter seven that silas had decided to keep the child was a subject of great interest among the villagers the sympathy they had felt for him since the robbery was now increased especially among the women they all wished to help him as much as possible the day after molly farren was buried dolly winthrop brought some baby clothes to silass cottage she laid them out by the fire to warm it is all a mystery to me said silas one day the door was open and my gold vanished another day the door was open and the child came i dont know where the child came from or where the gold went it is all very strange yes said dolly its like the night and the morning sleeping and waking the rain and the harvest one goes and the other comes and we dont know how or why i think you are right to keep the child master marner though there are some who disagree with me ill be glad to come and help you take care of her whenever i can thank you said silas but i want to take care of her myself i would be grateful for your advice about how to take care of her properly but i want to do it myself so that she will grow fond of me i am used to cooking and cleaning the house i can learn to take care of the child too so dolly told silas how to dress the child and he did it himself and the child laughed and gazed at him and pulled his hair as he dressed her there you see said dolly gently shes fond of you already but what are you going to do with her while you work at your loom silas thought for a while then said ill tie her to the loom with a long strip of linen that way she can move about and play but she cannot go too far well maybe that will work said dolly she hesitated a moment then said something that had been on her mind all day and you must take her to church master marner you should do that for the poor orphan child she should go to church and learn to say her prayers like my little aaron does she probably hasnt even been christened yet what do you mean by christened asked silas at lantern yard they had used the word baptism and only grown men and women were baptised oh dear master marner cried dolly did you have no father and mother to teach you how to say your prayers and that there are good words and good things that will keep us from harm yes yes replied silas i knew a lot about that once but it was long ago and far away and our words and customs were different but i want to do everything i can for the child you tell me what to do and ill do it well then began dolly smiling ill talk to the parson about it and arrange to have her christened and you must think of a name for her my mothers name was hephzibah said silas thats a difficult name said dolly doubtfully its from the bible oh well it must be all right then but it is so long and difficult to remember my mother was known as eppie said silas so the child was christened and for the first time silas went to church in his best clothes to share in the religious observances of his neighbours in this way little eppie created fresh links between the weaver and the community in which he lived unlike the gold which had no needs eppies needs were constantly changing in order to satisfy them silas had to keep in contact with the villagers so that they could give him help and advice the missing gold had demanded that he work more and more hours at his loom but eppie called him away from work and in her company he was happy to leave his loom and wander through the woods and fields picking flowers and listening to birdsong she was a bright happy laughing child like the sunshine she warmed him and brought joy into his life as she grew eppie became more adventurous and disobedient you must smack her master marner said dolly when silas asked her advice either that or put her in the coalhole thats what i did with my aaron when shes naughty you must teach her a lesson silas was horrified at the idea of punishing eppie not only did he hate the thought of causing her pain or distress but he feared that if he did so she would stop loving him a few days after this conversation silas was working at his loom and eppie was sitting on the floor tied to the loom by a long strip of linen through the open door she could see the flowers dancing in the wind she reached up to the shelf took silass scissors cut the strip of linen and ran out into the sunshine the loom made so much noise that silas heard nothing he only realised what had happened when he reached for his scissors and found them gone eppie he cried rushing out of the cottage and up to the abandoned quarry he was afraid she might have fallen in silas looked down into the deep pit of the quarry at the smooth red surface of the water that filled it his heart was beating violently and cold sweat stood on his brow eppie eppie he cried then he heard her laughter and turning round he saw her sitting on the ground playing in the mud silas ran up to her and took her in his arms he kissed her and held her tight all the way back to the cottage but then he remembered mrs winthrops advice eppie must be taught a lesson she must be taught never to run away again naughty eppie said silas sternly you must never run away again i must punish you i must put you in the coalhole a nasty dark place silas had thought that the threat alone would frighten eppie and perhaps make her cry but eppie just laughed as if she thought going in the coalhole would be fun clearly the threat was not enough silas put eppie in the coalhole and held the door shut for a moment there was silence then he heard a little voice crying open open silas immediately opened the door and took eppie out she was covered in black dust from the coal silas sat her on the table washed her and changed her clothes saying now eppie will be a good girl now youve learnt your lesson and you will never run away again or else i will have to put you in the coalhole as soon as she was clean silas put her down so that she could play but eppie ran back to the coal hole and shut herself in laughing and shouting eppie in the coalhole this total failure to discipline eppie discouraged silas so eppie was raised without punishment and silas was patient with her naughtiness in the village he became known as the kindest of fathers and none of the village children was afraid of him now whenever silas and eppie went into the village people would stop and talk to them the weaver would answer their questions and smile he was holding eppies little hand and she was gradually leading him back from the narrow lonely life he had lived to a new life of joy and companionship one person watched eppies growth with particular interest godfrey took care not to show more interest than was natural no one was surprised that the kind young squire occasionally gave presents to the weavers little adopted daughter godfrey thought that perhaps one day he would be able to provide for her without raising suspicion he had been a much happier man since that fateful new years eve dunstan had never come home everyone thought that he had gone to the colonies and would never return gradually godfrey stopped worrying that any day dunstan might come back and reveal the secrets of his past life for the first time in years he felt free again now he could marry nancy and his life would be paradise he imagined a future in which nancy smiled at him as he played with their children by the hearth in the big red house but he would not forget his other child that was a fathers duty part chapter eight it was a bright autumn sunday sixteen years after silas marner found his new treasure on the hearth the church bells were ringing morning service had just finished and the villagers were coming out of the church among them were silas marner and eppie silass hair was white now and his shoulders were bent he looked like a very old man though in fact he was just fiftyfive eppie walking reside him was the freshest blossom of youth a blonde dimpled girl of eighteen a handsome young man was walking behind her i wish we had a garden father said eppie as they went out into the lane but to make a garden first you must do a lot of digging and you couldnt do that could you father yes i could do it child if you like why didnt you tell me before that you wanted a garden ill dig the garden for you master marner said the young man and ill bring you some good soil from mr casss garden hed be glad to let you have some ah thank you aaron that will make it much easier said silas eppie blushed and smiled mrs winthrop told me that aaron would be happy to help otherwise i would not have asked it will be so nice to have flowers and sweetsmelling herbs i would love to have lavender too but only fine ladies have lavender in their gardens i can get you some lavender said aaron eagerly i can bring you anything you want from mr casss garden when im working there i trim the plants and usually i just throw them away but if you put them in water they grow roots and then you can plant them in your garden well be careful not to take anything that they would miss at the red house said silas mr cass has been very good to us i wouldnt want to impose on him you wouldnt be imposing on him theres so much waste in any garden why not give it to someone who could use it i often think of that when im working if the land were used properly no one would go hungry i must go home now though mother will be waiting for me ill come to your cottage this afternoon and we can plan the garden if you like oh yes said eppie and bring mrs winthrop with you im sure she would like to help us decide where the garden should be yes said silas shes a very wise woman with her there to advise us we will have a wonderful garden aaron turned back to the village while silas and eppie walked up the lane oh daddy cried eppie kissing silas on the cheek ill be so happy when we have a little garden i knew aaron would dig it for us i knew that very well oh did you indeed said silas smiling affectionately well youll owe aaron a favour if he does all that work for you no i wont replied eppie laughing he wants to do it when they reached the cottage and eppie unlocked the door a small brown dog leapt up to greet them a kitten was sleeping under the loom while the mother cat lay in the sunshine by the window this happy animal life was not the only change in silass cottage many improvements had been made once in a while mr godfrey cass had sent fine pieces of furniture from the red house the villagers thought it was very kind of him but after all it was only right that he a rich man should help the poor weaver who was raising an orphan child after lunch silas and eppie went out to walk around and plan the garden as they passed the small bush where her mother had died eppie said i would like to move the bush into our garden daddy silas had told eppie all about her mother and how he had found eppie on the hearth and how her mother had died in the snow silas had given her the gold wedding ring her mother had worn eppie kept it in a box and looked at it often thats a good idea silas replied that bush is very pretty in the spring when its covered with yellow flowers well need a wall around the garden too otherwise the donkeys will get in and eat all your plants there are lots of big stones by the pit said eppie leading silas towards the abandoned quarry we can use those to build a wall when they reached the edge of the pit eppie looked into it and cried look how much lower the water is than usual ah yes said silas thats the drainage mr cass is draining this whole area so that he can plant in the fields beyond the pit how strange it will seem to have the old quarry all dried up said eppie she lifted a large stone from the ground this is the kind of stone we need to build our wall she said put it down eppie its too heavy for you said silas you need someone strong to help you and im not strong enough now he sat down on the grassy bank and looked thoughtful eppie dropped the stone and sat down beside him father she said very gently if i got married would i wear my mothers ring silas looked surprised at her question why eppie are you thinking of getting married eppie smiled and blushed yes i have been this past week she said ever since aaron asked me to marry him and will you marry him eppie asked silas a little sadly yes some time said eppie i dont know when but if we do get married we will all live together you and aaron and i and you wont need to work any more it is getting difficult to find weaving work these days besides you deserve a rest aaron says he will be as good as a son to you and would you like that eppie asked silas looking at her yes but only if you would like it too father well youre very young to be married well ask mrs winthrop what she thinks im getting old now and i like to think you will have someone to take care of you when im gone then you would like me to get married father asked eppie in a trembling voice i think i would said silas chapter nine godfrey cass was now a handsome man of forty his hair was still blond and his skin smooth but he was heavier than he had been in his youth his wife nancy was still a goodlooking woman though a little pale her clear brown eyes expressed the patience and quiet strength of a woman who has had troubles in her life but has born them bravely fifteen years ago soon after their marriage the old squire had died and godfrey had inherited the red house at first nancy had assumed that she and godfrey would have children she made the red house as clean and bright as possible hoping that soon it would be filled with the sound of childrens laughter but the years passed and no children came slowly nancy gave up hope of becoming a mother it was a terrible disappointment to her but she thought that it was gods will and that her duty as a good christian was to accept it godfrey however could not accept it and this caused nancy further pain and sadness he felt that a life without children was empty and he could not resign himself to it as she could when after ten years of marriage it became clear that they would have no children of their own godfrey told nancy that he would like to adopt a child he said that they should adopt eppie because eppie was an orphan and she was a very pretty pleasing little girl godfrey was sure the weaver would not mind silas marner would want what was best for the child and clearly eppies life would be better if she grew up in the red house and became a lady godfrey never imagined that silas would rather die than part with eppie nancy however had refused to adopt a child she said that it would be wrong to go against gods will this disagreement had caused a lot of pain between godfrey and nancy two years later he had raised the subject again but nancy still refused and there was more bitterness between them but godfrey had not mentioned the idea of adopting eppie for four years now and nancy hoped that he had finally resigned himself to their childless life one afternoon godfrey went to the abandoned quarry to see what progress was being made in the drainage he said he would be home by teatime at four oclock nancy was sitting by the fire reading a book godfrey rushed into the room pale and trembling why godfrey what is the matter asked nancy in surprise i have had a terrible shock he replied its dunstan my brother dunstan who disappeared sixteen years ago they have found him found his body his skeleton the drainage is finished and all the water is gone from the abandoned quarry and there he is he has been lying there for sixteen years at the bottom of the pit they found his watch and his ring theres no doubt that it is dunstan do you think he drowned himself asked nancy no he fell in nancy im sorry to have to tell you this dunstan was the man who robbed silas marner all the weavers money was there in the pit nancy blushed red she fell it was a terrible disgrace to have a criminal in the family godfrey was silent he was staring at the floor and nancy knew that he had something more to say finally he looked up at her and said all our bad deeds come to light in the end when god wills it our secrets are revealed i have had a secret for many years but now i want to tell you nancy you remember the woman marner found in the snow that wretched woman eppies mother was my wife eppie is my child he paused afraid of her reaction to his confession nancy was pale and still as a statue nancy can you still love me she was silent i know i should have confessed then but i was afraid of losing you it was a great mistake to marry her and i suffered for it when nancy finally spoke there was no anger in her voice only regret godfrey if you had told me this sixteen years ago we could have adopted eppie do you think i would have refused to adopt her if i had known that she was yours and if you had told me sixteen years ago we could have had her from the beginning and she would have loved me as her mother our lives would have been more like what we hoped for when we married nancy began to weep but you wouldnt have married me if i had told you said godfrey i dont know what i would have done godfrey but nothing is worth doing wrong for nothing in the world nothing is as good as it seems beforehand even our marriage has not been as good as we thought it was going to be can you ever forgive me asked godfrey yes i forgive you but the person you really wronged was eppie we can take eppie now said godfrey i dont mind everyone knowing the truth now shes grown up now said nancy but its your duty to acknowledge her and provide for her i will do my best for her and i hope that god will make her love me then well go to silas marners house tonight chapter ten that evening silas and eppie sat alone in the cottage on the table in front of them were the piles of gold silass old gold come home at last sometimes said silas when you were first here i used to think that you might turn back into the gold by magic the gold had gone you see and you had come in its place at first i thought that you might go and the gold come back but after a little time i knew i loved you more than the gold i needed your voice and the touch of your little fingers you were little then you didnt know how much your old father loved you but i know now father said eppie if you had not taken care of me i would have been sent to the workhouse and there would have been no one to love me the blessing was mine my precious child if you hadnt been sent to save me i would have lived the rest of my life in misery the money was taken away from me to help save me and now it has come back just when it is needed for you our life is wonderful at that moment there was a knock on the door why good evening mr and mrs cass said eppie in surprise as she let them in we are disturbing you very late my dear said nancy taking eppies hand and looking at her with interest and admiration good evening marner said godfrey and eppie placed two chairs for them then went and sat beside silas im glad to hear you got your gold back after all these years i am very sorry that it was one of my family who robbed you and i want to compensate you for it in any way i can whatever i can do for you will be nothing but paying a debt and i owe you for more than the robbery godfrey hesitated he and nancy had agreed not to tell them that he was eppies father yet he wanted to wait until eppie knew him better silas was always nervous when speaking to gentlemen like mr cass big powerful redfaced men usually seen on horseback i have a lot to thank you for already sir and the robbery was not your fault he replied shyly that may be the way you see it marner but i see it differently you have been working hard all your life now its time for you to rest how old are you im fiftyfive said silas well you may live another thirty years like old mr macey that gold on the table will not be enough to keep you comfortably for all that time for working people that gold seems a lot of money almost too much and eppie and i dont need very much godfrey was finding it surprisingly difficult to come to the point it had all seemed so simple when he had thought about it at home you have been very kind to eppie for the past sixteen years im sure you would like to see her well provided for mrs cass and i have no children of our own we would like to take care of eppie and make her a lady we would treat her in every way as if she were our own daughter im sure you would be glad to see her fortune made in that way as godfrey spoke eppie put her arm around silas she could feel him trembling violently eppie my child said silas what do you think i wont stand in your way thank mr and mrs cass eppies cheeks were flushed with distress she knew that her father was suffering thank you very much madam and you sir but i cant leave my father i dont want to be a lady i just want to stay with the people i know silas grasped her hand and sobbed with relief there were tears in nancys eyes she felt sympathy for eppie but she also felt sadness for godfrey godfrey felt irritated at this unexpected opposition it had taken him so long to do the right thing he had been so eager to come to the cottage and make his offer now he found it difficult to understand other peoples feelings it is my duty to tell you marner that eppie is my own child he said her mother was my wife i have a natural claim on her eppie went pale but silas flushed with anger if you are her father sir why didnt you say so sixteen years ago before i began to love her if you take her from me now it will be like taking the heart out of my body god gave her to me because you did not want her and now he looks upon her as mine you have no right to her she has been calling me father for sixteen years i thought you would be glad that we could give eppie a better life said godfrey growing angry she is now old enough to marry if she stays with you she will marry some low working man i know i should have done my duty before and i am grateful for what you have done for eppie but now i want to do my duty i insist on taking care of my own daughter silas was afraid that what godfrey said was true he certainly did not want to stand in eppies way to deny her the chance of a better life eppie held his hand tightly in her own and said thank you sir and madam for your offers but i would be miserable if i left my father he has loved me and taken care of me all my life and i will love and take care of him for the rest of his life no one shall ever come between us but eppie said silas perhaps one day you will be sorry if you choose to stay among poor people with small houses and poor clothes when you could have had the best of everything no i wont be sorry eppie replied i dont want fine clothes or a carriage or a big house i want a little home where my father can sit in the corner and i can do everything for him i like working people and their way of life and ive promised to marry a working man who will come and live with my father and help me take care of him at this point eppie burst into tears nancy looked at godfrey his face was flushed and his lips were trembling lets go nancy he said nancy took eppies hand and said well come back and talk about it another time remember that we wish you well my dear and you too marner then she followed her husband out of the door as they rode home in the carriage nancy held godfreys hand well thats over he said after a while yes said nancy we cant force her to come to us if she doesnt want to ill do all i can for her in the life she has chosen we wont tell anyone that i am her real father it cant do any good now shes a pretty girl isnt she yes her hair and eyes are just like yours im surprised i never noticed it before will you be very sad godfrey because she wont come to us perhaps for a little while but marner was right i didnt want her when she was little and now its too late but i have no right to be unhappy ive got you if you could resign yourself to our childless state said nancy i think we could be happier than we have been then i will at least it is not too late to change that chapter eleven the next morning as silas and eppie were having breakfast he said eppie theres something i would like to do i have been thinking about it for two years now that the gold has come back we can do it do what father asked eppie go and see the place where i used to live i want to go to lantern yard and see mr paston the minister something may have happened to show them that i was innocent of the robbery mr paston is a very pious man i want to ask him about the drawing of the lots and i want to tell him about the religion of the people here and ask him what he thinks of it long ago silas had told dolly winthrop the story of his time at lantern yard and eppie had often heard mrs winthrop and her father discussing it it had been a great relief to silas to tell somebody after all his years of silent sorrow dolly had listened with sympathy but the religion of lantern yard was so different from the religion of raveloe that dolly found it all very strange indeed she had asked him to explain about the drawing of the lots several times but even then she did not fully understand eppie was delighted with the idea of going on a journey with her father when she came home she would be able to tell aaron all about it aaron seemed to know so much more than she did about many things it would be pleasant to be able to tell him something for a change so the next day silas and eppie set out on their journey when they arrived at the great industrial town silas was amazed at how different it was from the town he remembered many changes had taken place in thirty years i dont think i can find my way to lantern yard eppie said silas its all so changed both of them felt ill at ease standing in the busy noisy street surrounded by strange indifferent faces well ask someone the way father said eppie ask that gentleman over there he wont know silas replied gentlemen never went to lantern yard it was a place for simple working people but i could ask him the way to prison street im sure ill be able to find lantern yard once i get to prison street the gentleman told them how to get to prison street and silas and eppie set off in the direction he had indicated they got lost several times and had to ask other people for directions before they found prison street the dark walls of the great jail cheered silas up at least the jail had not changed and silas now felt confident that he could find the yard what a dark ugly place cried eppie it hides the sky its worse than the workhouse i am glad that you dont live here now father is lantern yard like this street my precious child said silas smiling it isnt a big street like this i never liked this street but i was fond of lantern yard dont worry were nearly there they turned onto a dark narrow road oh father cried eppie i feel as if i were suffocating i never imagined that people lived like this so close together how pretty raveloe will look when we get home you are right eppie now it looks strange to me too and it smells bad i dont think it used to smell this bad here and there a pale dirty face looked out from a doorway they made eppie even more uncomfortable so she felt relieved when they got to shoe lane where she could see a little more of the sky there it is said silas theres lantern yard but how strange people are coming out of the yard as if they had been to chapel we never went to chapel at noon on a weekday suddenly he stopped walking and stared with a look of distressed amazement they were standing in front of a large factory and men and women were coming out for their midday meal father said eppie in alarm whats the matter its gone child said silas lantern yard is gone i know this is the right place because i recognise that house across the road that big factory is where lantern yard was its all gone even the chapel and the little graveyard come into that brush shop father said eppie she was worried that he might have one of his attacks then you can sit down and rest and perhaps the people there can tell you what happened but the man in the brush shop had only been in shoe lane for ten years the factory was already there when he arrived neither he nor any of the other people in the shop knew anything about silass old friends at lantern yard they had never heard of mr paston the minister the old place has been swept away i said silas to dolly winthrop on the night of his return to raveloe my old home has gone ive no home but this now i will never know whether they discovered the truth about that robbery no you wont master marner said dolly there are many things well never know its gods will well never know what happened but he knows and we must trust him yes said silas ever since the child was sent to me i have been learning to trust now she says she will never leave me so i think i will trust until i die conclusion in the springtime when the flowers were blooming the sun was shining and the fields were full of calves and lambs eppie and aaron were married nancy had insisted on buying the wedding dress for eppie it was a very pretty white dress with little pink flowers on it the wedding procession went from the church to the rainbow in the lead was eppie with her white dress and her golden hair looking like a lily one of eppies hands was on her husbands arm and the other held the hand of her father silas after them came ben and dolly winthrop nancy saw them passing by as she stood at the window of the red house godfrey had gone away for the day otherwise people would have expected him to go to the wedding feast he had ordered at the rainbow dolly winthrop saw old mr macey sitting in his doorway as they passed he was too old to go to the wedding feast dolly guessed that he would like them to stop and talk to him we must go and say hello to mr macey said dolly hell be offended if we dont so they stopped at mr maceys door and shook the old mans hand in the garden of the rainbow all the guests were gathered talking about the strange history of silas marner they had come to the conclusion that he had brought a blessing on himself by being a good father to a poor orphan child when the wedding party appeared at the gate the guests cheered and applauded eppie aaron silas and dolly left the wedding feast while the party was still very merry as they walked back to silass cottage they passed eppies new garden and the flowers seemed to smile at the four united people oh father said eppie what a pretty home ours is i think nobody could be happier than we are the end
