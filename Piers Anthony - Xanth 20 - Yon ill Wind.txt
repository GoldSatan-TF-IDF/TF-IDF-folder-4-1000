nimby the demons of the system did not gather frequently unless there were intriguing contests to be made or issues to be settled this occasion was a bit of both you must have cheated the demoness vcew de clared of course the demons did not actually communi cate in words or have any emphasis but for the sake of intelligibility their interactions could be represented as such in degraded prose you have been winning every contest recently i simply learned how to play to win the demon x responded mildly my victories have been fair i wonder the demon e remarked there is something suspicious about the way that foolish mortal boy gave up his game victory at the last moment so that you won our wager and the way that crazy lesser demoness decided the obviously innocent bird was guilty so that you won our wager v agreed i merely have compatible lesser creatures in my do main because i allow them to pursue their own mischief without interference xcan protested he glanced obliquely at e lh in contrast to some if i did that my idiot creatures would destroy my do main ecar retorted arent they doing that anyway v inquired snidely hardly the way your lesser creatures affected your do piers anthony main e th shot back now its all cloud and desert instead of milk and honey we all have made our little mistakes the demon jucpi said soothingly which is why we have failed to gain significant lasting status but it does seem that x has been unusually fortunate recently yes it does v said emphatically agreed e agreed there was a murmur of ac quiescence from the other demons present it is merely my good lesser creatures x in sisted i treat them well and they reward me by behaving well my fortune is in the quality of my creatures the other demons exchanged a hundred and fifteen glances in half a fraction of a moment suppose we put that to the test jucpi suggested xcan grew more interested are you challenging me to a contest yes i believe i am suggest terms if i win i will assume your status as dominant entity in this system agreed and if you lose you will revert to the status of least entity in this system and yield your land to me that was a formidable stricture for it had taken x th three thousand years to work his way up to se cond place and might take longer to do it again still this might be his only chance to depose jtkpi because or dinarily the dominant demon would never put his status on the line agreed conditions jikpi smiled this was akin to a shorttailed comet fragmenting and plastering itself across his face in a series of violent collisions you must subject yourself directly to the whims of these inferior creatures you claim have such good behavior you must assume the form of a mortal entity and go among them for the duration of the contest now this was different but normally we dont influ ence the inferiors in any way so that the outcome is com pletely random or at least not affected by the touch of a demon he glanced darkly at v whom he sus yon ill wind pected of violating that stricture the last time sa nodded and his rings precessed this time you will have license to influence themto the extent you are able x realized that he had been set up the other demons were conspiring to bring him down because they were miffed by his string of victories still he did have good lesser creatures and perhaps they would bring him the biggest victory of all certainly the challenge was ex citing he had on occasion interacted with them when they had intruded on his awareness but never done so for a prolonged period so i can interact whats the catch your awareness can not be limited ju said for you are in essence a demon regardless of the form you assume but for the purpose of the contest your ex pression can be limited you may not tell any creature of your realm your true nature and if any learn of it you forfeit immediately provided no other supernatural entity informs them x th said with another glance at the demoness agreed jl pi said we shall enforce that stric ture anything else you may convey to one person in one moment but he paused meaningfully there will be a penalty when you do thereafter you will lose the power of verbal communication for the duration of the contest but one moment of full communication should be enough xcan reflected his albedo increasing so there was probably another catch what else you will have your full powers apart from speech limited to yourself and one inferior creature of your choos ing to the extent that creature requests them but if i am not allowed to describe my real nature in my moment of communication invent something jucpi suggested anything but the truth but if you come close enough to the truth so that the creature or any other denizen of your domain catches on you lose that too was reasonable he could approach the truth piers anthony but if he came too close so that the inferior creature re alized that he was in fact the demon x he would forfeit but the contest was sdll incomplete what is the penalty for becoming what that creature chooses the power of motion jikpi said after that state ends when the inferior creature terminates the asso ciation and separates from you for more than a moment and more than a unit of distance you will not only be mute but completely immobile you will lose your powers of magical action too other than awareness so you had better achieve your objective before such separation oc curs decision time geography v said that is fair isnt it triple termination no accidents fair to her meant she felt assured of his loss which she desired more than a victory of her own this was getting tough all right he could speak only once and then could act only as long as he kept company with the creature inferior creatures were notoriously fickle at any time for little or no reason the one selected could decide it no longer desired his association and tell him so and depart by the terms of this contest he would not be able to demur but it wasnt yet done this conspiracy of demons meant to see that he had virtually no chance at all he needed to know the worst of it what is the actual item of decision you must be the recipient of at least one tear of love or grief from a creature who has no notion of its signifi cance the creature with whom you associate v ew amended no other and there it was he had to evoke the severe sympathy of an inferior and ignorant creature and how long will i have to evoke this tear as long as your mortal body remains if you become mute and immobile without achieving it your body will behave in the manner of mortal entities it will slowly yon ill wind starve to death when it dies the contest will be over and you will have lost x th considered they expected him to balk and to have to pay a forfeit for that agreed let me select my mortal form for the occasion he was thinking of becom ing a beautiful woman because mortals shed tears very readily over them or perhaps a winsome child better yet no thats the last detail i will select your mortal form but you could choose something difficult exactly it will be a real contest win it and i will concede that your creatures do have good behavior you will concede more than that xany replied grimly i accept your deal and the other demons will watch to see that every aspect of it is honored the other demons nodded this promised to be inter esting then assume your mortal coil demon jlkpi said grandly a dragon ass with the voice of an aqua duck your role name is nimby and before x th could protest he was in the region of madness in the form of a creature whose body was that of a dragon with diagonal stripes of pastel pink and bilious green with the head of a mundane donkey ouch he muttered subvocally but even then it was the voice of an aqua duck a sound like a cross between a goblin holding his nose and the burble of noxious gas per colating through sewer water there was a stir on the surface of the cesspool that just happened to be near an aqua duck poked its head out of the pool evidently thinking to discover another of its kind finding no such thing it ducked below again for such ducks lived underwater and had to hold their breaths to forage for bugs on the surface and his name was now nimby which was an apt de scription a digest of not in my back yard exactly where such a creature would be welcome nowhere he was in trouble how would he convince anyone even piers anthony to approach him let alone shed a tear for him well he could look he extended his awareness cov ering all of the land of xanth he knew what every crea ture was doing and where every plant was xanth was teeming with activity somewhere there should be some one who wouldnt be afraid of a dragon ass who would listen to what he had to say and who would shed a tear for him maybe not immediately but in time after getting to know him because despite his ludicrous limitations he retained considerable power to please if the one he ap proached had the wit to ask for it if that one would take him seriously but instead of finding a suitable person he found an other problem there had been a magic flux the moment he changed form resulting in a temporary weakness of the interface the spell required to fix him in this situation had done it for even the most trifling demon magic was stronger than that of all the lesser creatures combined for the next few hours it would be possible for things to pass through entering xanth without being twisted to some other time that could mean significant mischief ordinar ily he would automatically shore up the interface to pre vent such a nuisance but as nimby he couldnt it was his policy to ignore the activities of his associated region but the interface the local creatures had established was useful and helped keep things quiet so he quietly supported it he just had to hope that nothing really obnoxious passed from mundania into xanth before the interface healed it self it would be nice if the person he approached was ex tremely cooperative and shed a tear for him immediately giving him the victory and freeing him but since he couldnt even say that he needed a tear that being too close to the truth that seemed unlikely however if the person asked him for information he could provide it and if the person asked him to do something about the rift in the interface then he could provided he did it in such a way as to conceal his real nature so there was a chance yon ill wind to fix the problem during the course of the contest if he found the right person he concentrated on that sifting through all the creatures of the land the great majority were plainly unsuitable most were hopelessly locked into their situations and wouldnt have anything to do with a weird monster in fact they would either flee it or attack it depending on the state of their courage he needed someone reasonably openminded that cut the prospects down to few he headed for the nearest this was a pretty young hu man woman named miss fortune she wassmart decent amiable lovely and caring and did not judge others too much by appearances she would make some young man a fine wife but for one thing her talent was bad luck and it always interfered when a really good prospect ap proached her thus she was perhaps ideal for nimby who could if she asked him reverse her luck he would catch her alone present himself and use his one moment of speech to acquaint her with the usefulness of nimby thereafter he would be silent per the stricture of the con test but it should be enough she would get to know him realize that he was not merely a monster ask him to re verse her luck and when he did so she should really ap preciate him of course that would not make her cry him a tear but perhaps that would come later if she came to care for him enough she often did cry for her pets and for family members when they suffered mischiefwhich was rather often because of her talent so this looked rea sonably good nimby trotted along toward the rendezvous his dragon body was actually quite strong and could move well his hide was tough enough to ignore nettles and branches his eyes were good enough to spy out suitable paths his nose was good enough to sniff out all manner of creatures great and small in fact nimby felt his first pang of hunger he was mortal now so had to eat hunger was a new expe rience so he sniffed out a fruiting pie plant and snapped up a fresh cherry pie he gulped it down and slurped his piers anthony tongue around his donkey lips eating was fun he extended his awareness again fortune was starting out to gather a sprig of thyme because her mother was getting rushed and needed a bit more theres no thyme like the present she said go fetch it now so fortune sweet as she was set out instantly to fetch it nimby explored the immediate region with his aware ness there were it turned out several paths to the thyme plant because many families made occasional use of it in fact they found thyme to be quite precious it would not be long before fortune arrived there he considered what he would say to her when they met because he would appear to her as a frightening monster he had better speak to her first reassuring her then when she was prepared he would show her his dragon ass form even so his words would have to be effective because he would have only a moment of speech moments varied in length some were long some short in this case it would be the time until she made a verbal response of some kind to his speech so he would have to forestall her cry or exclamation lest his moment end before he conveyed to her his potential usefulness to her such as being able to reverse her talent for a time he could tell her that he had reverse wood and knew how to use it to help her no she would just ask for the wood so he would instead tell her that his talent could make her what she wanted to be as long as they were together so she would need to keep his company for a while because not only would he be silent after his moment of speech he would be immobile once they formally separated thus his single opening monologue would be of overwhelming importance and he had to do it just right he could in effect win or lose his contest in that moment he reached the thyme plant it was a small one so its effects were limited someone had drawn a circle in the dirt around it showing the safe limit of approach folk who wanted a leaf of thyme had to use a wooden hook to get it because the inanimate was not as greatly affected yon ill wind that was what fortune was coming here to do then she would maneuver the leaf into a magic pouch that stifled its ambiance and take the pouch home to her mother her mother of course would know how to handle it safely mothers were always in need of more thyme nimby ducked down behind a pile of rocks near the plant this form was good at ducking because of the aqua duck component he wouldnt be able to see the girl very well from here but neither would she be able to see him which was what counted of course he could use his awareness to see her without eyes but it was easier just to listen for her approach while he rehearsed his moment of speech he wanted the fewest feasible diversions for this practice how could he get her to listen without speaking maybe if he made a straight quacking noise she would think he was a duck and would pause unworried all he needed was to get the first few words in warning her just to listen and then he could run off the whole spiel fortune with her constant bad luck had surely learned to react cau tiously so well might listen in silence for a time anyway his donkey ears twitched she was here she had ap proached with her soft step while he pondered she was standing at the edge of the thyme plants limit his aware ness saw her human feminine form he had almost missed her he had not an instant to waste quack quack he said in his ducky voice please listen to me without speaking for i have information of interest to you i know of your problem with your talent and i can help you reverse it for my own talent is to make a person whatever she wants to be as long as she is in my company so far so good she had not made a sound but he had to get in the rest before his moment ended i am a friend but i am not human i have an ugly form but i have no wish at all to harm you i need the company of a person like you and i will do my best to make my com pany worthwhile to justify your trust but after this i will not be able to speak again i will be completely mute piers anthony so you will have to tell me what you desire stay with me and you can be what you wish to be as long as we are together i wish only to win your friendship please do not be dismayed by my appearance which is awful i am com pletely harmless to you for i will suffer without your com pany had he covered enough he couldnt tell her more about himself he had come as close to the truth as he dared but maybe he could offer an explanation for his form so she wouldnt scream and run away when she saw him i am an enchanted creature not entirely what i seem my fate depends on you now if you care to look at me look at the pile of rocks to your right i will lift my head and nod and thereafter be silent but you can talk to me and i will understand and do what i can for you please trust me my name is nimby he had said enough now it was makeorbreak time slowly he raised his head and peered over the rocks there she was and it was the wrong girl oha funny donkey the girl exclaimed and now nimby was mute per the contest rule he had had a good long moment longer than expected and had spoken well but how had he come to this mistaken con nection he extended his awareness out and back tracing the girls travel here and in a moment he had it miss fortunes bad luck had struck again there was a crossing of two paths just beyond a wide wallflower and she had collided with another girl the two had had their breaths knocked out and had sat down on opposite sides gasping then they had gotten up brushed themselves off made quick curt apologies to each other though each was sure the other had been at fault and gone on their waysdown the wrong paths fortune had gone on the other girls er rand which was to fetch a nice bow from a bowvine so her mother wouldnt give her a punishmint and the other girl had gone on fortunes errand and had been just re alizing her error when nimby had spoken to her she was chlorine whose talent was poisoning water yon ill wind she was plain stupid and meanspirited in complete con trast to fortune the collision bad been her fault because she had been rushing along without looking too fast for path conditions thus she had given fortune the colossal ill luck to lose her encounter with nimby who could have helped her so much and had given nimby the worse luck to have wasted his opening monologue on her what was he going to do with this wretch of a wench because she was the one he was stuck with chlorine approached him and you cant talk any more she inquired not even to bray she giggled at her own clumsy humor she was asking for it nimby stood up showing his dragon body ohyoure a weird dragon she said ugliest crea ture ive ever seen why should i ever want to keep com pany with you why indeed fortune would have had some sympathy for she was a decent girl but chlorine had a harsh per sonality such as there was of it and now casting his awareness back across her life he discovered something even worse she had once had some sensitivity but it had been beaten out of her by her abusive family she had long since cried herself out and now had only one tear left and she did not know where that one was even if so moved she couldnt cry a tear for him and she wouldnt be moved because she had become cynical and heedless of the feelings of others chlorine was simply no prize nimby stared defeat in the snoot he could hardly have invoked a worse companion all because he had not been paying attention while a girl known for her ill luck had suffered more of it he had come up with the perfect speechfor an undeserving girl he had thrown away his chance for victory he hung his head in remorse still chlorine said if what you said is true this could be my lucky day im going to give you a chance but i warn you if you try to eat me ill poison your water and youll have one awful bladder infection actually piers anthony her language was somewhat more cynically descriptive the key phrase being pied pee but nimby wasnt quite current with inferior vernacular so she wasnt afraid for her safety she could indeed poison any water with a touch which meant she could kill a creature if she had to she couldnt do it to nimby be cause he was a demon but of course he couldnt afford to let her realize that and she was what he was stuck with and the contest had not yet been resolved maybe he still had an outside chance to win so he nodded showing that he understood her warning make me beautiful she said that was easy he focused on her and transformed her various pans he made her straggly greenish yellow hair into luxuriant greentinted golden tresses that curled just enough to be interesting he made her yellowish complex ion into the fairest skin seen in xanth he shifted the sub stance of her body so that her eggtimer torso became an hourglass figure he formed her thick clodhoppered feet into dainty digits in glassy slippers and he adjusted her shapeless dress into an elegant robe that clung to her sud denly firm curves like an artistic lover she was now a stunning creature of her kind she looked down at herself appreciating the change oooo is this real i mean not illusion it feels real she pinched her delightful derriere just hard enough to verify its mindfreaking reality nimby nodded agreeing that it was real as long as their association continued i need a mirror she said i want to see my face nimby made one of his scales mirrorshiny and turned it so she could look she peered at herself thrilled then she reconsidered im not just dulllooking im dullthinking ive been told that often enough can you make me smart too that was phrased as a question but it was actually a request just as the mirror had been nimby concentrated yon ill wind on the spongy interior of her head increasing the effi ciency of her mind she smiled im getting smarter i can feel it im be ginning to understand things i never did before my per spective is broadening immeasurably she paused and so is my vocabulary i never talked like that before nimby nodded he had improved not only the height of her intelligence but also its breadth now she could over whelm problems by force of intellect and have the judg ment to know when to apply it now she really would use the term bladder infection she cocked her head looking at him you know youre quite a creature if im not dreaming this your talent is quite strong but now i have the wit to look a gift dragon in the tooth why are you doing this for me you said you need my company but im sure my company is not unique was it chance or design that brought you to me nimby couldnt answer that so just gazed at her she was quick to understand because of her new intel lect let me rephrase that was it chance he nodded yes he had been looking for miss fortune and ill chance had brought him chlorine instead chance that you found me she said slowly feeling her way through the powerful mind she now possessed becoming aware of the several informational options and their bypaths but you must have had a design did you need me specifically he shook no is your ultimate intention toward me beneficial he nodded yes he had to do her enough good to make her care enough to shed a tear for him but she was too canny now to accept that uncritically beneficial for me as well as you she had caught a significant qualification he really didnt care about her longterm welfare only about his victory in the contest but since he needed her emotion so that she would cryfor him he intended to treat her piers anthony well he wanted her to come to like him to care about his welfare by her definition as he understood it his intention was ultimately beneficial if not totally happy so he nod ded yes so you just need a personand not to eat or otherwise harm he nodded yes of course i cant be sure i can trust you she said sensibly for common sense was now one of her strengths but with the powers you have demonstrated im sure you could have rendered me unconscious and consumed me had that been your desire so the evidence substanti ates your claim you need company he made a small nod but there is more she said sagely yet i could surely guess for days and never happen to discover it ive never been good at the game of nineteen questions or even five questions she paused again startled but i could be good at it now however i see no need as long as i keep your company i can be as i am nowand when i separate from you i will revert to the way i normally am he nodded again so lets see what else i want to be she said getting practical beauty is only skindeep i want to be healthy too he focused on her making her supremely healthy he had already accomplished some of this when he made her beautiful and smart and now her chemistry was good as well as her bones and flesh she would live a long time and never suffer illness and would heal quickly if injured while she remained with him yes i can feel that health coursing through me she said i feel like running and jumping she did so and her body responded perfectly she returned to him what is the range of your am biance with respect to these benefits she inquired ten of my paces a hundred a thousand he nodded yes at the third suggestion she had to be yon ill wind associated with him and while distance wasnt the key it would do as an approximation but she did not think to ask a related question could she go beyond that ambiance formally terminating the re lationship then change her mind and return without losing the benefits she assumed that she couldhis awareness told him thatand that was potential disaster for them both but he couldnt tell her she had to ask another notion caught her fancy i am now aware that though my mind and body have become excellent my per sonality has not i am a cynical meanspirited vixen thats one reason people dont like me can you make me nice she hesitated caught by an errant thought but not too nice because i wouldnt want to be washywishy that was actually another request nimby focused and adjusted her personality to make her nice naturally he did a good job providing her with qualities of integrity com passion sympathy empathy and thoughtfulness she would be about as nice a person as any could be but he added a reasonable dollop of realism so that she would not be as she put it washywishy oh my she breathed i appreciate what a female canine i have been and for such inadequate reason i have some amends to make and i shall make them in due course she looked at nimby again what about my talent can you give me a better one this was dangerous she could ask for the talent of om niscience and if she got that she would soon know all about himand that would lose him the contest her in telligence was already dangerous enough so he shook his head no ah well she said being nice about it but realistic you have already done so much for me that i would be unduly greedy to wish for more still now that you have done all this for me id like to do something similar for you can you change yourself as you have changed me nimby hadnt thought of that of course he couldbut piers anthony should he he concluded that there should be no harm in it so he nodded yes then make yourself into my equivalent in form mind health and character she said by that i mean a princely human man so nimby became a handsome smart healthy nice but realistic princely human man thus efficiently had chlo rine abated his ugliness as well as her own oh yes she breathed you are the kind of man ive always dreamed of but who i knew would never even look at me she glanced appraisingly at him look at me she had the notion that he had to obey her that was not the case but since it hardly mattered he was not con cerned he looked at her embrace me she said kiss me so he held her and kissed her she was now mostly as he had grafted her and his own form was hardly natural to him but he found the experience interesting and mildly pleasurable this was perhaps because he had grafted a complete human man form with its inherent appreciation of any woman who looked and acted the way this one did her exquisitely grafted human female body elicited certain responses in his supremely healthy human male body he realized that for the first time in his long existence he was feeling a tinge of human desire she ended the kiss and sighed too bad youre really a donkeyheaded dragon she said if you were a real man id marry you such illusion but it was just as well that she thought of him as the monster and not as the demon x and youre still mute he nodded appreciating a benefit of this condition he couldnt give his identity away ah well ill just have to do the talking for both of us she paused considering obviously i cant go home in this state she said realistically my family would never recognize me and would be jealous if they did so yon ill wind i think ill just disappear for a few days they may not even miss me she kissed him again rubbing close against him so that his body began to rev up and heat in an alarming though not unpleasant manner then flirtatiously disengaged so lets take a long walk to unfamiliar places in our present forms and when i get bored with that ill consider what next to do because if this is a temporary state i want to make the most of it she eyed him appraisingly i sus pect you havent had much experience in human ro mance nimby nodded in fact he had no idea what she was talking about and though his awareness tried to grasp her larger thoughts there was nothing there to which he could relate what was romance did it have anything to do with the revving of his body when she kissed him chlorine laughed never fear nimby ill teach you i had no use for it before but now that im beautiful and nice i appreciate its value but it must not be rushed so lets set out on our adventure she took his hand and led him down the path away from the thyme plant then she thought of something else you said you could reverse my talent how about that that much he could agree to in the course of a brief yesno dialogue they established that she could not just poison water but purify it actually she could have used her talent this way all along had she realized it because her poisoning was temporary and abolished any bad living things in the water nimby was feeling more positive chlorine had been a mistake but had become considerably more interesting perhaps it would be possible to find her lost tear he knew where it was of course but couldnt tell her unless she asked the right series of yesno questions but she was doing exactly what he wanted building a relationship meanwhile his wider awareness was informing him that the mischief he feared from the interruption of the inter face was coming to pass a significant storm was about to piers anthony forge from mundania into xanth though he could not see the future he knew from longpast experience what that could mean if that storm progressed until it swept up sig nificant amounts of magic dust there would be trouble like none seen in millennia and he couldnt prevent it in fact he now understood how thoroughly the other demons had fooled him they had known that the inter face would waver when he changed form and entered xanth as a character and that a storm was moving toward it they had timed it precisely distracting him so that he would be severely limited at the worst time and he intent on his chance to gain significant status had carelessly let himself be snared happy bottom karen stared avidly out the window of the motor home catching glimpses of the roiling surface of the sea is happy bottom here yet she asked she was seven and interested in everything but home and school thats gladys twerp david said he was her big twelveyearold half brother and he figured he knew everything she didnt hurricane gladys but this rebuke brought her other half brother sean into the fray as was often the case he was seventeen so ranked david by the same amount david ranked karen hurricane happy bottom he said chuckling i like it but no shes not here yet these are only her outskirts enjoy them karen giggled enjoying the halfway naughty reference yon ill wind she saw mom and dad up in the front of the vehicle exchange one of tfaeir significant looks that was proba bly because of the business about the bottom and the skirts adults knew what was fun and avoided it tropical storm gladys mom said shes not yet a hurricane otherwise we couldnt risk this drive across her path now the kids exchanged a significant glance point made about adults and fun ts hb sean remarked innocently then after a pause just long enough to make someone wonder just what naughty notions the letters stood for he clarified it trop ical storm happy bottom ts david agreed with a smirk karen kept her face straight because she wasnt supposed to know what ts really stood for though of course she did knpw tough stuff just as she knew that po really stood for put out but what about hb in the naughty lexicon maybe hard bone she was sure that would set the boys to sniggering though she wasnt absolutely sure why theirs was a modem blended family mom and dad had each been married before and it hadnt worked out karen knew why of course they had been made for each other so their first marriages had been mistakes likewise their first children though it wasnt expedient to say that except in the heat of righteous anger when one of them teased her too hard sean was dads son and david was moms son which led to certain deviously competitive crosscurrents between them in this respect karen ranked them both because she was both parents child and a daughter to boot so they were all half siblings but she was the only one related by blood to everyone else she liked it that way she really belonged but there was only so much excitement to be had from watching water even if it was stirring nicely so karen went back to check on the pets they were in crates to keep them out of mischief while the vehicle was in motion and not happy about it piers anthony hi woofer she said reaching in to pat the big mon grel dog woofer was seans pet but got along with every one in the family especially anyone who had food on his person his fur was almost black matching seans hair and through him dads hi midrange she stroked the nondescript tomcat midrange was davids pet but could be friendly with anyone who sat in one place more than a moment his fur was mangy light matching davids dirty blond hair which in turn copied moms full blond tresses hi tweeter the parakeet was karens own pet and was friendly only with her though he tolerated the others his feathers were tinged with brown which of course was to match her own red curls that was what came of trying to emulate both dad and mom inbetween hair the pets were all glad to see her because she usually paid them more attention than anyone else did the truth was that they were all gardenvariety creatures rescued from pound or flea market accordingto the whims of the various family members nobody else had wanted any of them but karen thought they were all great folk and they evidently agreed with her the vehicle shuddered damn dad said from way up front in the drivers seat motors skipping but we cant stop here mom protested we cant pause at all or the storm she trailed off with most of what she had to say lost in the ellipsis as she tended to do when there was something she didnt want the chil dren to overhear that meant of course that karen definitely wanted to hear it sorry gotta go now she said to the animals and hotfooted it back to her place at the table now she could hear the skipping motor herself it sounded like one of davids model airplane engines when it was feeling balky the motor home was slowing passengers will buckle their seat belts sean an nounced using his airlinecaptain voice we are encoun tering turbulence there is no cause for alarm repeat no cause for alarm he spoke the last words with special yon ill wind emphasis as if the captain were trying to conceal the strain he was under just then a terrific gust of wind buffeted the rv giving it a scary push and shake david and karen laughed at the coincidence it really did seem as if they were in an air plane landing in a storm must be someplace to pull off the road dad said dont want to stall out on a bridge where are we mom looked at the map were crossing big pine key you dont think the motor will not worth risking dad said if this ones big were better off here at least until i can get into the engine emergency landing sean announced in an especially worried pilot tone passengers will remain seated please review the crash procedures and verify your nearest escape hatch and sure enough there was another buffet of wind to add realism repeat there is causei mean no cause for alarm as if the captain had repeated without making the statement the first time really losing it karen giggled but behind the fun she was beginning to get nervous they were on their way home from a week end visit to friends in key west and the approach of ts gladys had hastened their departure they had a lot of long thin exposed causeway and bridge to cover before they got home to miami and the sea was looking increas ingly formidable suppose one of those gusts blew them into the water the skipping got worse cant nurse it along much farther dad said grimly that an intersection ahead yes the other road runs the length of big pine mom said focusing on the map maybe theres shelter there the rv swung through the intersection turning north the wind pushed at it trying to make it slew off the road but dad managed to keep it on then a blast of ram came down making the world outside opaque karen couldnt see much of anything through the side window and doubted that dad was much better off with the windshield this was getting bad she had been enjoying this drive piers anthony and had been intrigued by the notion of a big storm but that delight was turning sour this was definitely getting scary and it wasnt even a hurricane yet she was begin ning to think that such tempests werent as much fun as advertised cant see anywhere to stop dad muttered whats thatanother turn theres an intersection with mom said her voice wearing that carefully controlled tone that made karen especially nervous even the two boys werent jok ing now it was entirely too easy to visualize the rv as an airplane descending through bad weather and karen wished she could get that image out of her mind intersection cant make it out dad said but theres got to be a big building or something we can use as a windbreak i dont dare stop until i have a good place because the motor may not start again the rv limped on surviving the buffeting then mom made a stifled exclamationthe worst kind she was scared now and she didnt scare easy jim how did we get back on a bridge dad demanded seeing it therere two roads mom said i thought we were on the left one but it must be the right one it leads to no name key well whatever its name or lack thereof here we come dad said karen was relieved to see land resume outside the win dow it had been a brief bridge she peered ahead out the windshield and saw a sign saying rockwells then one saying no name they were indeed on no name key and still no place to find shelter finally the motor gasped its last and the vehicle came to a stop they would stay here for a white ready or not here on the nameless key mom wouldnt even let dad get out to check the motor because now things were flying through the air the wind making missiles of whatever was handy all they could do was wait it out yon ill wind safe bellyflop landing sean announced in remote country do not panic we are certain to be rescued before the headhunters locate us but the humor didnt get off the ground so they made sandwiches and sang songs pretending it was a picnic while the wind howled and the night closed around them like some hungry monster the rv was shaken so constantly that they came to tune out the dis traction there was a lull quickly they attended to the necessary things dad went to the motor and the kids took their pets out on leashes to do their natural business actually tweeter didnt need any of that but karen took him out of the cage and cuddled him in her two hands reassuring him he rubbed his beak against her nose his way of kiss ing her he wouldnt do that with anyone else and that was the only trick she had been able to teach him but it was enough the truth was that tweeter was comforting her as much as she was comforting him the winds picked up again and there was a power about them that indicated that what was coming would be worse than what had been everyone bundled back into the rv dad hadnt been able to fix the motorbig surprisebut had found rocks to block the wheels making it a bit more stable mom turned on the radio briefly just long enough to get the weather report expected to achieve minimal hurricane status within the next twentyfour hours karen heard it say and she had to stifle a hysterical laugh if this was subminimal she didnf want to meet a maximum one twentyfour point five north latitude eightyone point three west longitude proceeding west northwest at ten miles per hour mom traced the lines on the map and stifled another shriek thats here she said its coming right here well at least it will be calm in the eye dad said trying for light reassurance but not achieving it there was nothing to do but settle down to wait it out they didnt think it was safe to use the beds so they just piers anthony buckled themselves into their various seats and slept as well as they could in the circumstances there seemed to be no point in confining the pets again so they were al lowed to be where they wished woofer settled down at seans feet and midrange chose davids lap tweeter un easy about midrange being loose decided to fly back into the safety of his cage midrange had never actually made a pass at the bird but karen understood his concern the weather report was right because in due course the winds died out and there was complete calm but they knew better than to leave the vehicle because the winds could return at any time karen listened to the silence for a while then lapsed back into sleep karen woke to the winds of dawn there was no sun in the sky just brightening turbulence she had a mental pic ture of puffy clouds circling the rv firing arrows into it but since the arrows were made of vapor they didnt have much effect however the winds were diminishing so the worst had indeed passed the rv had not been tipped over or blown into the sea now she could resume enjoying the experience as an adventure the others stirred in their seats as the light penetrated they took turns using the bathroom facilities then mom got to work on breakfast while dad went out to try fixing the motor again yo he called surprised karen free at the moment zoomed out to join him carrying tweeter perched on one lifted finger and stopped just outside the door amazed the outdoors had changed they were now near the shore of a huge island not far from the rv was a tree that seemed to be made of metal and whose fruits seemed to be horseshoes and standing not far from the tree was the weirdest horse she had ever seen it was male with regular hindquarters but its front rose up into the torso arms and head of a man it had an oldfashioned bow slung across its back and a quiver of arrows yon ill wind what is that she asked too awed to be alarmed that is a centaur dad said his voice unnaturally level a what a mythical crossbreed between a man and a horse it must be a statue remarkably lifelike the figure moved ho intruders it said what are you doing on centaur isle karen looked at her bird somehow i dont think were in florida anymore tweeter she said dad seemed too astonished to respond so karen did were the baldwin family she said we mustve got ten blown here by hurricane happy bottom tropical storm i mean but wheres this i mean which key is centaur isle key the centaur asked in turn this is a shoe tree not a keylime tree he reached out and touched one of the dangling horseshoes the other members of the family emerged hearing the dialogue geea horseman david said i thought they were fantasy they are dad said we must have stumbled into a freak show perhaps i misunderstand the centaur said are you referring to me as a freak suddenly his bow was in his hand and an arrow was nocked and pointing right at dad karen acted before she thought as she often did dont do that she cried to the centaur running out between them dad doesnt believe in fantasy the centaur was taken aback he doesnt what about magic then that neither she said what kind of a man is he the centaur asked be mused just a regular gardenvariety family man she said from miami from your what karen tittered not your ami silly my ami miami piers anthony the centaur scowled confused what part of xanth is that its part of florida america the centaur tilted his head and swished his tail sur prised are you by any chance from mundania no florida did you come through the gate karen looked around we sure mustve come through somewhere because this isnt much like home the centaur put away his bow this is near the gate aperture the turn key normally supervises it compe tently enough for a human perhaps something went wrong and you came through unaware we mustve been blown through karen agreed it sure was windy till we were in the eye an eye gazed at you she giggled the eye of the hurrycane happy bot tom cheerful posterior the centaur glanced at his hand some rump youre funny the center of the storm ah the storm we shall have to see what we can do let us introduce ourselves i am cedric centaur the tenth of centaur isle im karen baldwin karen said i must say you dont look bald is that a magic hair piece karen felt her wild tangle of blown sleptin hair i dont think so its just the way i grew it its always wild in the morning until mom brushes it down cedric smiled our foals have a similar problem we try to keep the tangle weeds clear but more keep appear ing should we shake hands karen asked uncertain of the protocol cedric lifted one hand and made it shake slightly i do not see the point unless you are bothered by flies yon ill wind she suppressed another titter no i mean our two hands together to show we are friendly how quaint she raised her hand high and the centaur reached his hand low and they shook hands and thats my family she said nodding behind her dad had been joined by the others all appearing somewhat stunned indubitably follow me he turned and walked away karen turned to address her family well she in quired are you coming she knew she had pretty well oneupped them and it was a great feeling the four of them exchanged about six glances in a scant second then they fell in behind without comment the winds remained high blowing the foliage of nearby trees to one side some of the foliage looked like green tentacles it was pleasantly weird cedric led them to a village made of stalls there were other centaurs there stallions mares fillies colts and foals none of them wore any clothing only the smallest paid them any attention they were busy repairing dam aged structures the high winds had blown some of the stall roofs off they came to a central pavilion where a young stallion of about seans age stood i found these mundanes near the shore cedric said they call themselves the bald win family and seem to be stranded here there may be a rift in the gate take care of the matter carleton he turned and trotted back the way they had come carleton stepped forward welcome to centaur isle he said unfortunately you cant remain here unless you care to become servants as mundanes you have no magic which is good nevertheless i suspect you will be better off on mainland xanth among your own kind dad finally got hold of himself just exactly what kind of a place is this carleton paused briefly considering you have no prior knowledge of xanth unless you are referring to a yellow nitrogenous com piers anthony pound xanthine dad paused at the centaurs blank look evidently not then we know nothing of this then perhaps we should exchange information carleton said would you like a meal while we con verse yes karen said as usual before she thought they hadnt had breakfast yet and she was hungry carleton lifted one hand and in a moment a filly centaur trotted over her large full firm bare breasts quivering in a way that made sean and david stare karen felt a tinge of resentment because she knew that never in her fullest fu ture adultmaturity would she ever develop a bosom like that yes carleton she inquired sheilathese mundanes are in need of fodder coming right up sheila agreed trotting bouncily off fodder david asked but soon the filly returned with big bowls of odd fresh fruit and other items she set them on a table under the pavilion yellows greens reds and oranges she said indicating the fruits pink purple black and blue berries a loaf of breadfruit and a butterfly and milkweed pods she glanced at karen including chocolate mom lifted the breadfruit it fell into several slices she picked up the butterfly its wings detached and flew away leaving the butter to be used these will do nicely she said terrifically poised thank you sheila the filly made a partial bow with her foresection that almost made seans eyeballs pop out of his head m fact karens own almost popped and she was a girl she had once sneaked a peek at an xrated video but these were more than those and better formed then sheila trotted off evidently to moms relief karen picked up the chocolate milkweed pod and sniffed it then she bit off the end sure enough chocolate milk and very good meanwhile the boys piled into the variouscolored fruits and berries mom passed a slice of buttered bread to dad and started another for herself the land of xanth is magical carleton said there yon ill wind are many magical artifacts and most human beings possess magic talents one to each person centaurs dont of course we regard magic in our own kind as obscene but sometimes it happens my sister chena he winced but that is irrelevant we centaurs use magic tools on occasion however beyond xanth is mundania a rather dreary region because of its lack of magic the normal route to mundania is to the north and west via the isthmus that may be your route of choice to return to your home land now if i may inquire what are the details of your arrival here dad filled him in on the drive and the storm and how theys stalled out on no name key you mentioned a gate he concluded that must be a connection between our two realms the eye of the storm passed over us and perhaps swept us into this um dimension unless this is after all some experimental project on no name key centaur isle is no experiment carleton said firmly we constructed it centuries ago from the scattered islets of the region it is low on magic by our preference but on the mainland you will see a great deal of magic if you wish however i must advise you that much of it is dan gerous to the uninitiated have you had experience with dragons dragons david exclaimed really can i see one carleton glanced coolly at him i doubt that would be wise dragons are best avoided unless one is proficient with archery or has protective enchantment mom spoke up are you saying that the whole of flor idaof xanthis magical that fantastic creatures abound there exactly we can arrange to notify the human author ities at castle roogna of your presence they may send a detachment to assist you because you surely do not wish to travel xanth alone a castle karen asked excited anew she loved any thing fantastic piers anthony castle roogna is the capital of the human beings the centaur explained their king dor should be interested a king karen exclaimed really truly delighted this lands got everything but we cant leave our rv mom said ruining things with her practicality we have to fix it and drive home not to mention the pets dad added that really got karen woofer midrange tweeter theyre alone theyve been alone before twerp david reminded her there are others in your party carleton asked our pet animals sean explained we encountered you folk so suddenly that we never thought to fetch them out of the rv what manner of creatures are these woofers a dog midranges a cat and tweeters a bird karen said quickly theyre part of the family weve got to get them of course you must before you depart the isle first we have to get our rv running dad said andwheres the nearest gas station carletons brow furrowed i do not believe i know of that creature for gasoline the fuel you dont use gasoline here maybe you call it petrol we do have petrel seabirds however petroleum refined from oil the centaur shook his head i suspect we are on dif ferent subjects our petrels merely fly and seek fish they do make good pets of course but they have no known connection with oil apart from that with which they preen their feathers dad shook his head i think were in trouble but first things first maybe i can get the motor running then maybe well have enough gas left to get us home if we can find the way yon ill wind this creature is ailing you did say that it was limp ing its not a creature dad said its a motor home a recreational vehicle rv the motor was skipping and fi nally quit maybe salt water blew into it would healing elixir cure it dad paused maybe you should take a look at it and form your own conclusion certainly i will bring a vial of elixir they finished their meal and started back karen was openly admiring carletons handsome equine body she liked all animals but especially horses the centaur caught her gaze you are small karen human he said would you prefer me to carry you she was immediately abashed gee noi dont know how tosomeday maybe ill get riding lessonsid just fall off but how she longed to try it you will not fall he said karen looked pleadingly at mom who was sure to say no but maybe possibly just this once might not mom sighed and looked away her way of not quite opposing it so dad picked her up by the armpits and set her on the centaurs sturdy back she grabbed on to the fur in front of her hoping she would be able to hold her position carleton took a stepand karen didnt lose her balance despite the lack of a saddle somehow the way he moved supported her giving her confidence it was as though he were balancing her compensating for the motions he made she was indeed in no danger of falling it was glorious they walked back to the rv now it was time to dis mount but karen wasnt sure how then the centaur put back one hand and she grabbed his hand and steadied herself as she slid down thank you thank you she babbled that was the greatest ride ever he smiled faintly you remind me of my little sister gee where is she she was exiled his mouth closed so firmly that she plersanthony knew he would say no more on that subject they entered the rv where the pets were glad to see them sean put woofer on a leash and david did the same for midrange some folk thought that cats couldnt be leashtrained but so many cats had been killed in the neighborhood mostly getting hit bycars that they had done it with this one and midrange was used to it tweeter was another matter he always stayed close to karen when they went out and would come to her when she lifted a finger for him to perch on so he had more freedom she brought him out proudly perched all three animals were obviously surprised by the cen taur they stood and stared evidently not sure whether to be friendly or hostile there is one on the mainland who has a catpet carleton said her name is jenny elf then he turned to the vehicle this is a house a combination house and motor vehicle dad said you might call it a house that moves a magic house the centaur agreed how does it move the motor is connected to the wheels making them turn and move it forward dad opened the motor com partment here is the motor i couldnt find any loose wires so its something more subtle im not an auto me chanic so my expertise is limited mine is surely less in this connection carleton said i make no sense of this at all can you make it operate now ill try just in case dad got in and cranked the starter the motor coughed once but wouldnt catch amazing the centaur said it does seem to be alive but in very bad health i will try the elixir he brought out a vial and sprinkled a few drops of liquid on the motor karen stifled a smile she didnt know beans about motors but even she was sure that wouldnt do a thing for it she saw the boys reacting similarly dad tried the starter againand the motor caught sud yon ill wind denly it was not only running it was purring several jaws dropped thats either one bleep of a co incidence sean auittered or dad got out leaving the motor running what did you do he asked suddenly its perfect i simply sprinkled some healing elixir on it carleton said normally it has little effect on anything inanimate but your motor creature seems to be animate and i had nothing better to try im glad it helped your house should be all right now because it is completely healed he frowned though i still do not see how it can move watch dad said and got back in in a moment the rv nudged forward it drove in a circle and stopped where it had been then the engine died nosense wast ing gas until we actually go dad said emerging this is phenomenal the centaur said obviously im pressed a rolling house i have not seen such a thing before but there seem to be no paved roads here mom said worriedly and no bridges we have nowhere to drive i believe there is a highway on the mainland carle ton said unfortunately it is a troll pike you have to pay the trolls at every turn were used to that dad said how do we get across to the mainland we shall be glad to ferry you across we can have a craft ready by noon but the winds remain so high mom said worried again it wouldnt be safe we can handleit carleton said in the same tone he had used when assuring karen about riding mom looked dubious but didnt argue so the centaur trotted off leaving them to make ready for the trip dad shook his head i find today hard to believe he said but ill feel better when we get on that highway the others agreed the centaurs seemed nice but this whole business was pretty weird karen was looking for ward to getting home and telling all her skeptical friends r piers anthony about where theyd been nobody would ever believe her that was the fun of it promptly at noon a big raft poled uato view with four muscular centaurs at its comers at the same time carle ton and sheila centaur galloped up from the village again the boys eyes threatened to pop at the sight of the fillys front and even dads eyes might have strained a little moms mouth tightened ever so slightly not the best sign karen was good at reading small signals it kept her from getting into as much trouble as she deserved so she didnt giggle quite i thought you would appreciate something to eat on the way sheila said presenting them with a big bag marked goodies more milk pods honey buns nuts and bolts bolts david asked she brought out what did indeed look like a bolt and gave it to him he sniffed it then bit off the end it seemed to be similar to a nut chocolate flavored he said i could get to like this filly sean murmured though his eyes werent on the bolt sheila tossed back her lovely brown tressmane and smiled at him not at all self conscious the raft nudged in to the shore now if you will have your house creature get on we shall take it across to the mainland carieton said i have communicated with the good magician who says he will send you a guide she will arrive in late afternoon with her companion sheila will introduce you before she returns here sheilas crossing with us seanasked his eyeballs threatening to go into orbit we would not want it claimed that we of the isle were inhospitable to those who found themselves here through no fault of their own carieton said normally we dis courage unauthorized visits but we do allow for special circumstances we are doing what we can to see you safely on your way the good magician is competent and you should be able to progress with the help of his guide yon ill wind uh thank you dad said we appreciate your hos pitality and assistance perhaps we shall meet again this is doubtful carieton nodded then turned tail and trotted off dad went to the rv he is a bit saddened by the loss of his little sister sheila confided if you should happen to encounter her im sure he would appreciate news of her current state why was she exiled karen asked sheilas mouth tightened she was found to have a magic talent she was a good person but that is simply not allowed among centaurs of the isle we consider it obscene i guess you dont want to know what we consider ob scene david said brightly if you are typical of your species you consider your natural body and its natural functions other than eating to be obscene she replied evenly therefore you cover your body with clothing evidently ashamed of it and pre tend that you have no natural functions especially not def ecation or reproductive capacity karen looked at david well i guess she flushed your toilet she said drawing on an old saying she had re searched from a book of dated vernacular i guess she did david agreed bemused i think i like the centaur way better me too karen agreed mom and sean exchanged a significant glance karen made a mental note sean was getting to be too much like an adult the rv started up and moved slowly toward the raft it nudged onto the planking fitting comfortably then david and karen ran to put the blocks at the wheels so it couldnt roll off even if the brakes didnt hold when they were all safely aboard the centaurs shoved off then they unfurled a sail and tied it firmly in place the winds remained quite stiff so this gave the raft plenty of push it moved obliquely against the wind tacking the muscular centaurs clearly knew what they were doing piers anthony each had his station whether at sail tiller pole or guard and was intent on his business this is a good time to eat sheila said it will take a while to cross the channel and thereafter you may be distracted by the things of the mainland mom recovered some of her normal aplomb will you join us in the meal sheila of course the centaur said let me set up toad stools for you she went to a box at one side and brought forth stools that were indeed shaped like toads and when they sat on them the stools made ribbit croaking sounds now thats interesting dad remarked where we come from toads are silent only frogs croak mundania is surely a curious place sheila said po litely our toads accept no such constraints they ate their interesting meal as the raft forged across the channel to the mainland the shoreline seemed to be solid jungle with strangelooking trees but there was a golden beach the gold coast sheila explained in due course they came aground and dad drove the rv onto land i will show you to the landing site sheila said it should not be long now before your guide arrives can your moving house travel at trotting velocity if it has firm level terrain dad said this beach seems suitable it is at the edge of the gold coast the centaur said thereafter you will use the trollway which is certainly firm i shall run ahead and you may follow at such speed as your house can manage they piled into the rv and dad started the engine he turned west to follow sheila the kids all looked out the windshield to see how it went at first the centaur walked as they caught up to her she trotted then as the rv caught up again she broke into a gallop her hairmane flying back i wish i could see her from the front sean murmured yon ill wind you have seen more than enough of her already mom replied primly they got going at about twentyfive miles an hour which seemed to be the centaurs cruising speed soon they came to what looked like nothing so much as a giant pillow sitting on the sand here sheila stopped so they did too my your house does move well the centaur said she was breathing hard which surely provided sean with all the view he could have desired i am beginning to suspect that mundania is not as dreary a region as re puted it does have its points dad said sheila looked at her wrist watch which turned out to be two eyes painted on her wrist they winked at her in what must have been a meaningful pattern your guide should arrive soon she said they settled down to wait for the arrival of the guide chlorine chlorine was enjoying herself it was fun being beautiful and smart in the company of a handsome and smart man but her enjoyment was fading there was no one to see her in her lovely brilliance and nimby was more apparent than real that was to say he had the appearance but not the reality of a princely man and he was the cause of her good fortune so he didnt really count she needed to be among real people whose admiration and envy meant something but she couldnt go to her home village where someone might possibly piers anthony recognize her and know her present beauty for a fraud and she didnt know enough about any other village to go there so how was she to find a suitable place to show off to real people she put her fine new mind to work on the problem then a bright bulb flashed above her head she would go to the good magician with a question that was a legitimate activity and of course she would have to do a years service for him and in all that time she would be able to show off legitimately she might even accomplish something useful assuming the service was of a useful kind and the new niceness in her appreciated that but she needed a question what would be legitimate what did she really want to know after a moment the bulb flashed again how she loved this good mind which performed so much better than her old one had when she posed a question for it it took hold with the power of twenty centaurs she would ask where her lost final tear was she had wondered about that for years and now she could finally find out nimby she announced we are going to the good magicians castle to ask him a question nimby looked at her doubtfully he seemed a bit alarmed maybe he thought the good magician humfrey wouldnt like him not to worry she said reassuringly ill tell him how nice you have been to me though youre really just a donkeyheaded dragon im sure hell understand nimby did not seem entirely reassured but she was sure he would relax when he saw that it was all right the good magician knew everything so he would know that nimby was nice and if he had any doubt he could simply look him up in his big book of answers and immediately learn everything about the mute dragon so there was no call to be concerned on that score but there was one small immediate problem she didnt know the way to the good magicians castle she lived in the northeast section of xanth and the good magician was yon ill wind somewhere in the center of xanth it was surely a long and difficult route there but maybe nimby could help nimby i want to reach the good magicians castle swiftly and safely and com fortably do you know a way nimby nodded yes then show me that way nimby set off at a swift walk toward a neighboring vil lage he soon found a clear path and in three moments and an instant or two they were at the village limit she knew because there was a sign saying jacks on ville oh yes she remembered now every person in this village was named jack or jackie and they all worked to harvest as sorted jacks little jacks were sixpointed twists of wire that children could play with while big jacks were solid metal twists used to lift heavy things so it was a thriving community nimby led her to a metal box beside the sign this was labeled phone jack and there was a little plug dangling on a wire by it so she lifted the wire and plugged its end into a hole in the box a slot opened and a voice brayed whatcha want jackass im not the jackass chlorine said realizing that it had mistaken her for her companion im just looking for a quick way to the good magicians castle well pony up some jack then the voice said chlorine looked around there was a pile of lettuce leaves nearby her bright mind realized that a pony should like that so she picked up a leaf and wedged it into the slot not enough the voice said were jacking up the price so she jammed in more lettuce this guys a knave she muttered to nimby rightthe jack of diamonds the voice retorted now ill run up the union jack to signal a crackerjack cab you have some applejack while you wait so they sat at the nearby table where there was a jug piers anthony of cider and drank cups of it while waiting it had a tangy taste and was very good soon chlorines head was spin ning pleasantly a burly man appeared on the path he had a big double bitted axe slung over his shoulder are you the cab chlorine inquired admiring his muscles im no cad the man protested im just a passing lumberjack he glanced at the jug but youd be best off miss to ease off on that applejack before your head spins off chlorine put her hands up to stop her head from com pleting another revolution it did make her feel less dizzy thank you youre welcome lovely lass the man ambled on chlorine flushed with pleasure at his compliment then she remembered that she really was lovely now so the compliment was well deserved still it was a pleasure she was not well accustomed to so she knew she would con tinue to enjoy it in due course a cloud of dust zoomed up and abruptly stopped on its side was printed speed demon cab a door opened in its side chlorine didnt quite trust this she looked at nimby nimby got up and climbed into the cab so she followed it had a plush seat in the back wide enough for the two of them the door slammed closed the cab leaped into motion with a loud squeal suddenly they were zooming at fright ening speed along the path the tree trunks were passing at a blurring rate are you sure chlorine asked nimby nimby nodded yes so she relaxed there was another seat ahead of them and beyond that a transparent pane and beyond that the onrushing forest they were going somewhere very fast she saw a sign in the front it said your driver de mon strator unsafe unreliable discourteous r yon ill wind for some reason that caused her to be worried again nimby that sign then a creature appeared on the front seat it had horns so did seem to be a demon thats just to scare away low tippers strator said you paid plenty of jack in advance so you have nothing much to fear unless i lose control the cab swerved perilously close to a tree oh chlorine pondered what is a tip from you i will accept a kiss you luscious creature she glanced again at nimby who nodded so she leaned forward and kissed the demon on his right ear the cab zoomed into the air looped and landeti again at speed hoo strator said thats one potent kiss thank you she said blushing it was fun because she had seldom had cause to blush before the cab zoomed on until it came to a squealing halt at the very brink of an awesomely deep crevasse trans fer strator announced the gap chasm is beyond my range thank you chlorine said climbing out of the cab i think youre a nice speed demon this time it was the demon who blushed he turned a rich royal purple and steam rose from him gotta go now he muttered and the cab spun about and zoomed back northeast it was now dusk so the speedy ride had taken at least some time a large dark shape swooped out of the deep shadow of the gap and landed before them it seemed to be a bird almost as big as a roc completely black it clutched a small basket in its talons and on the basket was a tag fly by night chlorine nodded that surely meant that this bird flew only by night so their timing was right nimby climbed into the basket which turned out to be much larger than it had first appeared the birds size had dwarfed it chlorine joined him then the bird spread its wings and hopped over the brink into the chasm chlorines gizzard surged up to her throat as the basket piers anthony dropped not realizing that the rest of her was falling then the wings caught the dark air and things settled into place they sailed not across but along inside the chasm re maining in its pooled darkness while the last of daylight touched its rims and the clouds floating above it chlorine peered down hoping to catch a glimpse of the notorious gap dragon but all she saw was palpable blackness since she didnt feel like palpating it she tried to ignore it then as the darkness rose beyond the gap and spread across the terrain of xanth proper the bird lifted out and flew low over the jungle chlorine saw the lights of little fires be low where the folk of xanth had their hearths or maybe those were dragons pumping up their bellies for nocturnal hunting it was all rather pretty the lights of a castle came into sight showing its walls and turrets that wasnt pretty it was perfectly beautiful chlorine stared in rapt wonder wishing she could visit a castle like that it must be so great to live in such an ed ifice to be a princess or even a serving maid she just felt such longing for the kind of life she would never have she might be beautiful now but when she stopped keeping company with nimby she would revert to her normal dreary self and her dream of the moment would be over she would have shed a tear for her lost dream if she only knew where her last tear was but of course that was why she was going to see the good magician so she laughed instead but there was a deep tinge of regret in it then the bird flew right up to that beautiful castle and landed outside its moat this was her destination nimby climbed out of the basket and she followed thenthe flybynight bird departed swiftly and silently they were alone in the night beside the glorious lighted castle chlorine was sure she knew better than to try to pass the challenges and enter the castle at night she would wait until morning that would give her the chance to get some sleep too yon ill wind then her bright though sleepy mind thought of some thing nimbydo you need to sleep the handsome manform shook his head no so it wont be an imposition for you to stay awake and guard me from possible harm i mean i think youre a great creature but i dont want to wear you out before your time she laughed ruefully in my natural self i wouldnt have thought to ask that because i wouldnt have cared but im nice now so i do care and its practical too because youre all that makes me so wonderful so its okay nimby nodded yes okay you keep watch and wake me one instant be fore dawn so i can see the sunrise im sure ill appreciate its beauty much more than i used to she started to gather some leaves to make a bed then had another thought would it bother you to revert to your natural form so i could use you as a pillow dont hesitate to say no be cause nimbys donkeyheaded dragon form was back he lay on the ground and she lay down and put her head against his side it had scales but now the scales were soft you know you do look funny she remarked but the more things you do for me the more i like you even as you are now i hope that doesnt embarrass you nimby wiggled an ear seeming pleased rather than em barrassed chlorine stretched snuggled down and faded quickly into sleep she woke as something tickled her nose who what she asked surprised then she realized that it was one of nimbys ears touching her she had told him to wake her an instant before dawn and he had done it thanks she said an instant passed and dawnappeared colored rays of light speared up into the sky brightening it nearby clouds glowed then when it was safely light the sun poked its piers anthony face up from behind the trees the sun never came out at night because it was afraid of the dark oh its beautiful just as i knew it would be chlo rine exclaimed thank you nimby for waking me in time she rubbed his donkey ears affectionately she got up and considered you fetch us something good to eat while i attend to my morning ablutions she said nimby trundled off and she found a bush for some busi ness then brought out her brush and went over her hair it was now gloriously luxuriant glistening in the bright ening light of day it was still greenish yellow but now the green was the luster of healthy plants and the yellow was the burnish of gold she gazed into a puddle and saw her reflection she resembled a princess just awakening from beauteous slumber it was really too bad this adven ture would have to end sometime she returned to where they had slept and saw nimby approaching with a mouthful of fresh chocolate and vanilla pies he must have found a good pie tree his mouth in this form was quite large so there was a good collection of large pies and none of them was damaged then she had a second thought will i get fat eating such stuff nimby shook his head no he ought to know as he was the one who had transformed her so chlorine dived in with gusto the dragon watched seeming pleased until her third thought arent you hungry nimby you should have some pie too nimby hesitated then nodded yes but still he looked at the pies somewhat doubtfully oh in your natural form you could gobble them all up and leave no more for me then change into your handsome manform and you wont need as much the dragon disappeared and the handsome man ap peared nimby man took a pie and began to eat he seemed to like it well enough chlorines fourth thought caught up with her biting yon ill wind bugs they must be all over in the nightbut i wasnt bitten were you protecting me from that harm too nimby nodded i dont know what ill do without you when this ends she said im really getting to like this adventure and we havent even done anything significant or naughty yet she eyed the man but decided that naughtiness could wait she had three challenges to pass to get into the castle in due course not one moment overdue they went to stand at the bank of the moat the castle was lovely in the early morning too the moat was calm and seemed to be without a moat monster there was a drawbridge but it was raised no way to cross by foot however there was a boat tied to a stake in the bank she saw something lying in the grass at her feet and stooped to pick it up it was a marking pen the kind that she had used in the past to mark childrens names on cloth ing there was no sense wasting it so she put it in her purse well lets get to it nimby she said briskly its my challenge so you just follow along as i work things out im sure you know how to handle each challenge but i think it wouldnt count if you gave me any hints besides i should enjoy the thrill of it i want to put this good mind of mine to the test she stepped toward the boatand a large ferocious bat appeared from nowhere it flew straight at her then banked and veered away at the last half instant she saw the word com on its underside as it did chlorine was taken aback in fact she almost sat down as she was taken back too far and lost her footing for tunately she recovered her feet before going down when she had been a plain nothing girl it wouldnt have mattered if shed sprawled turvytopsy and showed her panties to the sky but now she was a luscious creature and the hu miliation would have been awful piers anthony thats no ordinary bat she said thats a combat ill never be able to pass it nimby behind her shrugged neither agreeing nor dis agreeing he was being neutral that made her suspicious not of his motive which was surely amicable but that there was a way and he was trying not to give it away and of course there was a way because otherwise it wouldnt be a legitimate good magician challenge she pondered a moment and cogitated an instant and thought a while knowing that this would not be easy un less she found the right approach it wouldnt do to try to get around the bat or to fight it she had to outsmart it or at least figure out the proper way to denature it there had to be something obscure that would be obvious the moment she thought of it because that was the way every one knew the good magicians challenges were he didnt want just anybody barging in to pester him with questions so he made it difficult to reach him but he did play fair by his definition by anyone elses definition he was a grouchy gnome of course but nobody elses definition counted for much here so what was there her fine new mind focused exploring possibilities and bypaths at a rapid rate what was obscure but obvious there wasnt any thing special in the landscape no evidence of doors to underground bypasses or such in fact the only thing even a quarter way remarkable was the marking pen she had found ha that was surely it things did not just lie around the good magicians premiseseverything was here for a reason so this had to be the key she brought out the pen it was just a gardenvariety marker somewhat used but still serviceable how could this ever help her her good mind focused on the problem assuming that this was the key how would it operate it was a pen a marker aa magic marker to mark the combat that seemed unlikely because the bat would destroy her lovely beautiful but not phenomenally muscular or armored body yon ill wind before she got close enough to do that a pen was made mainly for writing for writing suppose she wrote something with it something that would help her like go away combat she fished in her purse and found a little notepad she took the cap off the marker pen and wrote go away com bat nothing happened but of course she hadnt tested it yet she took half a step toward the moatand the bat zoomed up before her threateningly she hastily canceled the rest of her step and retreated and the bat zoomed away obviously that wasnt it but maybe she just hadnt found the right way to use it how else would a magic marker work she couldnt think of anything much de spite her superior mind she glanced at nimby but he remained carefully neu tral and she wasnt about to ask for his help anyway um if you want to take a nap or something no he didnt sleep he claimed maybe play a mental game that entertains you i hate to bore you with my indecisions nimby nodded and went into a state of repose she wondered what a donkeyheaded dragon had to think about at some point she would ask him but now she had other business she crossed out her messageand there was a tiny shimmer around her she looked around afraid that a quake monster might be approaching to shake her up but all was normal so it must have been an indication of magic crossing out the message had canceled it and that had had magical effect if only she knew what it was she focused her mind once more why was she having so much trouble with what should be a simple matter somehow it seemed that even her old dull self would have figured it out by now then a dim bulb flashed over her head maybe this chal lenge was geared to her regular self maybe the good ma gician didnt realize that she was now much smarter or maybe he realized but didnt care so he had set her a piers anthony simple challenge and she was being too intellectual about it so lets try it the dull oldfashioned way she said she turned a page on the pad and wrote combat then she crossed out the c and wrote w and felt the trace tingle of magic had it worked she stepped forwardand there was a small furry crea ture standing barely kneehigh to her it was a wombat it tried to bar her way but she simply stepped around it and proceeded she had done it she had used the magic marker to change the name converting the deadly creature to a harmless one the key had been in naming it and changing the name obviousto a nonintellectual person she came to the bank of the moat now where was that dock and boat she had seen she saw the boat but now it was perched on muck and between her and it was the biggest hugest hairiest awfulest spider she could remem ber encountering it wasnt big enough to gobble her down in a single bite but three or four bites would do it actually spiders as she remembered didnt gobble prey down whole they trussed them up in spiderwebs and sucked the juice out but she didnt want to be juiced either no mat ter how juicy her current luscious body was chlorine was retreating as she pondered it seemed to be the expedient thing to do the spider did not follow in fact it had disappearedand there was the dock she had seen before so she reversed course trying to reach the dock before the spider returnedand the spider reap peared and the dock was gone something was definitely odd the spider wasnt block ing her view of the dock she could see handily around it there simply was no dock was she up against illusion in which case which was the illusion the spider or the dock it made a difference she retreated a step this time watching the spider and the spider disappearedand the dock reappeared they were changing into each other this was a dock spider her fine mind began to take hold this was definitely a yon ill wind challenge and she surely wouldnt be able to handle it by writing the word spider on her pad and changing the sp to c even if that worked what good would it do her since she didnt want cider she wanted that dock so she could get in the boat without muddying her pretty little feet she needed to get to that dock without it changing into the spider how could she do that what was the stupidly simple answer immediately it came to her bribe the spider but what would it want aside from a long session sucking her succulence what else did she have that might appeal to it the magic marker she no longer needed it but maybe the spider would like it if she made a good enough case for it in spider terms she stepped toward the spider though she was prepared to backpedal at a furious rate if she had to hey hand some creature she called how would you like some thing nice the spider wiggled its mandibles and a drop of slaver fell to the ground where it smoked quietly as it digested an unfortunate little poultree that hadnt even yet grown its first chick let alone the roc bird it might have made at maturity chlorine felt sorry for it but knew she couldnt help the tree no you cant have me she said quickly under this pretty exterior im just a plain and rather tasteless person anyway but i have something that may appeal to you more a magic marker she held it up this marker can change things for example you could use it to change a lug to a bug here ill demonstrate she looked around and spied a lug which was a kind of nut from a nutsand bolts tree she picked it up and set it in front of her then she wrote lug on her notepad and crossed out the letter l and replaced it with the letter b and the lug became a bug seejust the kind of magic you have always wanted she said enthusiastically think what you could do with a big lug you could turn it into xanths biggest piers anthony juiciest bug and feast on it snug as a lug in a rug the spider slavered some more it liked the notion and i will trade you this fine magic implement for one favor she continued persuasively all you have to do is become the dock and let me get on board that boat then you can have the magic marker and my pad of paper so that you can she hesitated paused by an awkward thought you do know how to write but the spider shook its head no this was a problem but her fine mind rose to meet it well can you draw let me see if this works with pic tures she found another lug and set it before her she quickly sketched a crude picture of it then crossed it out and drew an even cruder bug and the lug became a bug it did work pictographically maybe the good magician had figured she was too stupid to read and write which was actually a pretty accurate assessment she had never gotten beyond the first year of centaur school so could handle words of only one or two syllables if she had had to write quintessential she would have expired so if you can draw you can use this marker she concluded i confess i dont know exactly how versatile it is but since there are a number of lugs around here at least youll have all the bugs you want is it a deal the spider nodded yes but now she had just the slightest weeest little tinge of apprehension was this spider honorable suppose it grabbed her and the marker but then she concluded that it must be honorable because otherwise the good magi cian wouldnt use it in a challenge so she girded her loinno that would be unmaidenly she lifted her chin and walked into the spiders range if she had misjudged the situation and the spider grabbed her and tried to suck her juice she would turn its juices to poison and make it sorry but she hoped for the best the spider became the dock chlorine set dainty foot on it and went to the boat she climbed in then she set the yon ill wind magic marker on the dock untied the boats tether picked up its paddle and shoved off nice doing business with you she called cheerily the spider reappeared holding the marker in its man dibles it waved at her with a long forelimb she had passed the second challenge oopsshe had forgotten nimby hey nimby she called can you join me nimby walked down to the dock as chlorine returned the spider obligingly changed form allowing nimby to tread its planks and get into the boat maybe it realized that nimby was actually a dragon with impenetrable scales so wasnt anyone to fool with then they pushed off again she paddled across the moat without incident but she knew there would be a third challenge what would it be they were never the same she understood just so long as it wasnt a fierce moat monster because she didnt know what she would do in that case she came to land at a garden within the moat outside the good magicians castle they climbed out of the boat the moment they did the boat wended its own way back across stranding them it was now too late to change her mind she gazed at the garden it was lovely and loathsome the left side was overgrown with foullooking and smell ing weeds and had statuary that was downright disgusting the right side had a multitude of pretty flowers with at tractive scents naturally that was the side she wanted to step into but the path led into the foul side so that was where she went it would have been impossible to go into the nice side without treading on flowers and ripping out beau tiful vines and she couldnt bear to do that but the path was overgrown with burrs thoms nettles stinging vines scratchpads and even a stink hom she just missed stepping on that would have wiped out all her appeal in one swell piers anthony foop for nothing and nobody could stand the sound or stench of stink horn the farther she went the worse it got until it was plain that she could not get through this way this was one mean garden half and obviously a challenge she backed out and rejoined nimby who was inno cently waiting her nice dress was smirched with refuse colored yuck and her arms and ankles were scratched what an awful section she considered the nice side again if only the path were there but it wasnt and though the garden was beautiful it was just as thickly woven as the ugly side was not only would she do a horrible amount of damage if she tried to forge through there she probably wouldnt make it to the far side anyway there had to be a way through but where was it if not the path chlorine looked back and forth between the two garden halves sure that she was missing something now that she took the time to wake up and smell the flowers as it were she saw that the path was lined with purslane which made sense for a lane and trailing arbutus which made sense for a trail there were also primroses making it a primrose path and at the very beginning a trail blazer jacket so no one could be confused about where the path was a dim bulb flashed that trail blazersuppose she moved that to the other side would it then blaze a new path there where she wanted it that might be the answer she reached for the jacket but it was just out of reach she stretched her arm outand got scratched again ap parently that piece of apparel wasnt supposed to be taken so much for blazing a new trail so she couldnt move the path what else was there move the gardens a dim bulb appeared over her head but didnt flash it simply hung there expectantly she hadnt quite gotten her bright notion yet was there a way to change the positions of the gardens yon ill wind so that the same path led through the nice part now she thought there could be it was exactly the kind of inverted thinking that the good magician was noted for chlorine reconsidered the gardens and the path now she saw that the path wound past a nastylooking well she made her way to it stepping carefully to avoid the nettles and thorns and peered in smoky fumes smudged her face and jammed up her nose phew that wasnt water in there that was firewater not exactly poisonous she knew poisoned water when she encountered it that being her talent but not exactly healthy either mean spirits this was one mean well across the path from it was a dingy thyme plant she turned to consider it thyme was tricky stuff she knew it could speed things up or slow them down or even just change the time of day normally she stayed well clear of it but could there be a reason it was growing here so close to the path and the well her bulb brightened slightly mean well mean thyme in the mean section of the gar den it figured but there were other meanings of mean such as when a person meant well then the intention was good even if the result wasnt could this be that kind of well and the thyme plantit affected time and some times time was sort of average and they might call that mean time it wasnt necessarily nasty merely rounded off suppose some of that wellmeaning water were poured by the thyme plantwould that round off the time in a good way her bulb brightened it well might she took the grubby bucket and dipped some of the smoking water out of course it looked awful because its true nature wasnt supposed to be obvious but if she was right she poured the water at the base of the thyme plant it turned greener and healthier almost immediately then night fell what chlorine looked around startled it hadnt been close to nighttime ohthe thyme plant feeling its oats piers anthony as it were had accelerated time bringing the garden rap idly to night maybe she should have anticipated that but what good did it do her it wouldnt be any easier to forge through this tangle by night than by day unless now her dim bulb flashed so brightly that the entire garden lit up sure enough this was now the kinder section of the garden it was a kindermeaner garden and one sec tion was as different from the other as day from night so it was night and suddenly this half was the nice one with the path wending pleasantly through it she had found the way at last come nimby she said as if this were routine we shall pay a call on the good magician and she marched down the path her way lit by pretty glowworms set along the edges the path led right to the castle entrance chlorine knocked on the door and it opened immediately a pretty young woman stood there welcome to the good ma gicians castle chlorine and nimby she said i am wira his daughterinlaw please come this way so she had indeed been expected she was glad she had played it straight and found her own way through the challenges they followed her inside the interior was surprisingly light because rays shone in through the high windows chlorine realized that it wasnt really night that had just been a local effect in the garden which passed when they left the vicinity of the thyme plant how did you know our names chlorine inquired if my memory is correct youcant even see us it is true i am blind wira said but i know this castle well and cant get lost and i overheard magician humfrey grumbling about the situation it seems he had no trouble identifying you chlorine but your friend nimby baffled him he had to look him up in the big book of answers sure that there was no such person but the book had an entry the magician must have forgotten and it said nimby was a dragon ass with the magic talent of yon ill wind enabling himself and his companion to be whatever the companion wished them to be that his full name was not in my back yard because most people didnt like him the magician shook his head not wanting to admit that he had been ignorant of such a creature i fear he is be ginning to feel his age chlorine smiled the book of answers spoke truly nimby is not the man he appears to be but he is much nicer than he looks in his natural form he is welcome in my back yard for i have come to know him by his actions not his appearance his only liability is that he cant speak he is enabling me to have a really nice time for now for now i know it has to end all too soon and i will return to my wretched home life but i will always have this won derful adventure to remember my single shining moment thanks to nimby i intend to make the most of it i fear the good magician means to make more of it than you expect oh no my years service is part of it chlorine said cheerfully i am resigned to that it will extend my ad venture wira brought them to a rather dulllooking woman in a sewing room who was mending a pile of socks mother sofia here are our visitors wira said sofia looked up are you sure you want to broach himself with your question he will require you to per form a most arduous service in return yes of course chlorine agreed i look forward to it the more adventurous the better as you wish wira will take you to him now the blind young woman led them up a dark winding stone stairway to a squeezed crowded chamber there in the shadows sat the good magician humfrey himself he looked grumpily up from his monstrous tome yes where is my last tear chlorine asked it is in your eyes spread across them to keep them moist half of it keeps your right eye well and the other piers anthony half keeps your left eye well without that final tear you would immediately go blind chlorine was amazed i never thought of that of course it must be true it is true humfrey said grumpily now report to the catapult for your service but chlorine being nice but not too nice balked i know i have to serve a years service but for that little bit of obviousinretrospect information that doesnt seem fair please dont argue wira said worriedly that only makes him grumpier nevertheless i will answer humfrey said more grumpily you knew the conditions before you came to me so if you wasted the chance to ask a significant ques tion and receive a significant answer the fault is yours urn thats right chlorine said i did know the terms i apologize for my intemperate remark humfrey looked up from his tome again and glanced at her his eyeballs were yellowed and streaked with purple veins but as they focused on her they brightened and the dingy colors faded out my you are a pretty one he said surprised a sight for sore eyes thanks to nimby she agreed nevertheless pleased to have made a good impression to erase some of the bad impression she had made before in real life im plain and meanspirited yes of course since you have done me the slight favor of resting my eyes i will return it by amending my answer it is not quite as insignificant as it might seem you do have the capacity to shed that final tear if you ever choose to but considering the consequence i suggest that you never allow yourself to become that unhappy you may be sure of that she agreed laughing actually i am not sure of that which is why i have cautioned you there may come a time do not react thoughtlessly nimby standing beside her seemed uneasy yon ill wind chlorine nodded thank you for that amendment good magician i will remember it then she smiled this time the gloomy study brightened and humfrey seemed to lose five years in age oh i wish i could see that wira murmured aware that something good had happened maybe she had felt the heat of the light that had brightened the study you shall humfrey said almost with the illusion of fleeting mellowness imbri then chlorine saw a replay of the incident as if she were another person watching herself wira nimby and the good magician in the study she smiled and the study lighted and humfrey youthened from about a hundred to about ninetyfive oh thank you day mare imbri wira exclaimed i saw it chlorine was amazed the good magician had actually summoned a night mare or rather a day mare to give them all a day dream so that the blind girl could see the event in the only way she could as a dream this was surely something very special and he must like his daughterin law a lot because it was clearly for her he had done it but now the study faded to its natural dinginess and the good magicians slightly less tired eyes reverted to his monstrous dull tome the interview was over chlorine turned and followed wira out and down the steps the girl was smiling with the memory something briefly nice had certainly happened trollway jim baldwin looked around bemused this land looked a lot like florida at a casual glance but any more careful look rapidly dispelled the similarity it wasnt just a matter of the presence of the fantastic female crea ture sheila centaur her phenomenal bare bosom was something he could appreciate regardless of the circum stance though of course he would not admit that in the presence of his family mary was a reasonably liberal woman socially but it was plain that she was not at all easy about the filly centaur for reasons that went beyond the fantasy element correction they surely related to her concern about the male fantasy element especially that of sean and david and jim himself perhaps with reason they were waiting on the beach beside what resembled nothing so much as a giant pillow this was where the guide was supposed to arrive the guide that the good magician was sending after what else he had seen in this weird land jim was prepared to accept the notion of good and bad magicians he hoped the guide was competent he hoped to get out of this situation soon he didnt like the way the wind was building up however intriguingly it played with sheilas hair the storm seemed to have been subsiding but now it was building again that was bad news regardless whether in florida or this land they called xanth the children were in animated dialogue with the centaur filly purportedly eager to leam more about xanth jim caught marys eye and she joined him i dont want to yon ill wind be an alarmist but have you noticed the wind he asked her quietly she brushed her hair out of her face yes her tone was grim so maybe the distraction of the centaur is just as well until we are able to get moving again her answering smile was genuine but somewhat strained thank you for clarifying that jim then something came flying through the air from the north they all half ducked not sure where it was going to land it appeared to be a big rag doll one of the modem type with excellent legs it landed plump in the middle of the giant cushion it bounced and got its skirt smoothed down it was a lovely young woman seemingly no worse for the experience the boys immediately discovered a new creature to gawk at hello folks she said brightly brushing back her goldengreentinted tresses i am chlorine your guide sent by the good magician humfrey in a moment my companion will be along then we must talk before they could do more than get their collective mouths closed another ragdoll figure came flying across and down it too bounced but had no skirt to get in order it wore slacks and was a handsome young man this is nimby chlorine said he is mute but nice he will help me to help you but first i must warn you that a bad storm is coming we had noticed jim said stepping forward hello i am jim baldwin and this is my wife mary and our children sean david and karen were fromi believe you call it mundania we do chlorine agreed with a smile she glanced at sheila thank you for guiding the lost folk this far im sure you are eager to return to centaur isle yes i am before the wind further intensifies the cen taur agreed she turned to the family i wish you the very best it has been pleasant meeting with you and if you piers anthony should encounter carietons sister chena do give her his good wishes too we shall certainly do that jim agreed thank you and carletonfor your kindness in helping us this far welcome sheturned tail and cantered back along the beach the boys watched her until she was out of sight then their eyes reverted to chlorine who was far more decorously dressed but so beautiful in every respect that she was fully as distracting as the bare centaur filly chlorine turned back to jim i dont want to be im polite but what i have to say is of some urgency there is danger for you here the good magicians wife sofia was most specific about that shes mundane herself so appreciates how difficult xanth must be for you i under stand you have a moving house the children laughed motor home mary said but yes it is a moving house could you get it moving there is very little time to escape before the storm intensifies it is my service to guide you safely where you wish to go but it wont be safe here very much longer we can drive it jim said and there is room for you and nimby he wondered at the name but this didnt seem to be the time to inquire about that but we are going to need gas soon or well stall gas the woman asked blankly gasoline petrol fuel itour vehicle eats it drinks it oh chlorine turned to her companion nimby do you know where there isgasfor this creature nimby nodded then show us because we mustnt delay long come on in jim said if nimby knows where it is he can sit up front with me and point the way so they got into the van with the silent young man taking the passenger seat in front chlorine joined the fam ily in back which jim knew thrilled the boys ordinarily he would not pick up hitchhikers but when in romeor xanthit was time to do as the natives did chlorine was yon ill wind certainly right about the dangerous storm apparently hur ricane gladys was reintensifying or turning back to catch them again the last thing be wanted was to get caught in a hurricane in the rv he started the motor there was an exclamation of sur prise from chlorine but the odd nimby took it calmly in stride he pointed to the trollway which was exactly where jim wanted to go it looked like a good solid highway where he could make excellent time storm and gas per mitting at the entrance to the trollway stood a horrendous crea ture dont tell me let me guess jim muttered a troll nimby smiled evidently he understood speech well enough he just couldnt speak himself curious fellow but seemingly amicable he drew the rv to a stop before the troll sure enough there was a sign stop pay troll but there wasnt any indication what the fee was well he would start small heres two cents he said offering two pennies to the troll and the creature smiled a horrendous effecttook the pennies and waved him on maybe it was the thought that counted jim pulled the vehicle onto the pavement and gathered speed he was almost beginning to feel at home here now a sign said highway ahead and of course the road rose up until it was at treetop level a literal high way things tended to be extremely literal here unfortunately this elevation exposed them to the higher winds of the heights are we going to be up here long he asked nimby the man shook his head but gave no other information certainly he was a strange one jim listened to the dialogue of the others the children were eagerly questioning the girl chlorineodd name and she was answering to the best of her ability it was interesting yes candy really does growin xanth and cookies of piers anthony all kinds along the withacookee river chlorine said doesnt food grow on trees in mundania oh sure in a way david agreed fruits grow on trees and vegetables grow in gardens and grain grows in fields but candy and cookies have to be made and paid for thats what allowances are for allowances do you have a concept of money in xanth mary asked certainly it is filthy green stuff that no clean person cares to touch the others laughed thats the stuff we have sean said a heavy gust of wind buffeted the rv oh that re minds me chlorine said i must tell you of the great danger you face the good magician told me to be sure to make you understand you see there has been a weak ening in the interface whose face karen asked the xanth interface it keeps the mundanes out no offense something went wrong and a mundane storm came throughand you folk too the storm is headed for the center of xanth that means it will sweep up a lot of magic dust and magic dust sean asked thats the dust that wells up in the center of xanth bringing the magic she explained without it we wouldnt have magic and it would be horrible but where the dust is too thick the magic is too strong and so there is madness if happy bottom spreads that dust across xanth gotcha sean said everybody goes mad well not exactly but things could get very strange however you dont need to worry about that im sup posed to help you get through xanth and out of danger before the storm gets too bad so we must hurry there wont be much time to stop and sleep r yon ill wind no problem sean said well sleep in the rv while daddrives which meant no sleep for dad jim reflected well it had happened before he didnt like the way the wind was building and would far rather stay ahead of the worst of it if he could sleep no object nimby pointed to the side there was an exit ramp jim steered the vehicle to it the thing spiraled around and around corkscrewing down to the ground he had had no idea they had gotten so high the treetops had vanished without his noticing as they neared the ground nimby pointed again there beside the road was a big ugly purple tree and under the tree stood a big uglier purple monster with greenish gills it looked most uncomfortable jim hoped the discomfort wasnt hunger because the thing was big enough to gobble down a man and a child he hoped nimby knew what he was doing oh theres a gas guzzler chlorine said putting her pretty head close to his so she could peer out she smelled faintly of delight a gas guzzler it figured we can get gas from it yes just make a deal a deal he would have to feel his way through this one as he had with the troll he drew to a stop beside the monster and rolled down the window partway you have gas the monster faced him it belched the putrid odor of spoiling gasoline wafted by in a noxious little cloud you guzzled too much gas jim asked the monster nodded miserably then maybe we can make a deal but at this point jims imagination failed him what would an overindulgent gas guzzler want to trade for i think he needs one of moms antacid pills david said brightly then hand one over jim said mary fished in her purse and came up with an antacid pill jim offered it to the monster this antacid pill for piers anthony one tank of gas he said could this possibly work the guzzler took the pill and gulped it down he belched again this time not quite so awfully then he lifted his tail jim saw that the end of it looked somewhat like the nozzle of a gas pump right here he said quickly turning off the motor piling out of the vehicle and going to the gas tank he removed the cap and pointed the guzzler put the tip of his tail into the aperture there was a liquid flow sound the fumes smelled like gasoline when the tank was full the creature removed his tail and jim put the cap back on thank you he said the monster nodded his gills were no longer green evidently the pill had alleviated his condition so it was a fair bargain jim climbed back in and started the motor then he had another thought we have taken the high road he said to nimby but its pretty windy up there is there a low road nimby pointed ahead sure enough there was a road following the ground jim went for it thanks for a time the road seemed routine jim had a dark suspicion that it wouldnt last but he enjoyed it while it did the motor was running well the gasoline seemed to be good which was a considerable relief so again he listened to the dialogue behind how did you get here karen asked chlorine i mean you just came flying through the air like a para chute with your skirt flying sean added appreciatively oh no chlorine exclaimed sounding appalled did my panties show no jim called back realizing by her reaction that this was a social nuance of some consequence just as the centaurs were evidently quite open about their apparel or lack of it others might be quite uptight the children might not realize and make a social blunder just your legs and what legs they were oh thats a relief she said i would fade away yon ill wind from mortification ifbut never mind the good magi cian had us use the catapult now why do i think thats not what we mean by the term catapult sean asked musingly i confess to being curious chlorine said why do you think that there was half a pause she had innocently enough set the brash teenager back i uh mean that everything else is different with us a catapult is a big engine that hurls things far away yes thats it its a giant cat whose tail springs up and hurls things where they need to go the good magician must have told the cat where to aim im glad there was a pillow to land on this good magician mary said he must be quite knowledgeable oh yes he knows everything i came to him to ask where my last tear was and he told me but then of course i had to perform a years service or the equivalent so he assigned me to guide you folk safely out of xanth you have certainly been a help mary said as was sheila centaur but did i hear you correctly you have to do a years service for the answer to a single question oh yes i was foolish wasting my question on some thing i could have figured out for myself but i really did it for adventure and im getting that you folkthis trav eling housethis is fantastic david laughed you think the rv is fantastic after getting hurled through the air by a giant cat of course lots of people use the catapult but i dont think theres ever been a wheeled house like this in xanth before there arenteven many houses with chicken legs i couldnt ask for a better adventure there was a full pause she had set them back again so jim filled in with a question of his own i do not wish to be impolite or to seek after anything private but since nimby cant speak for himself may i inquire about his background and mission piers anthony oh theres no problem about that chlorine said brightly nimbys a donkeyheaded dragon in manform i could ask him to revert to his natural shape to show you but hed be too big for this little house then we had better take your word for it jim said carefully this young woman like this strange land kept surprising him anew hes doing me a really big favor chlorine continued you see in real life im well plain and not all that smart or nice but nimbys talent is to make himself and his companion whatever she wishes them to be so natu rally i wished to be really pretty smart healthy and nice yeah sean said appreciatively doubtless glancing at her legs or more she was about as healthy a young woman as jim had seen and strong on the other qualities i think maybe you dont believe me chlorine said but that much i can show you because im the same size in real life she lifted her voice nimby show me as i really amfor one moment the young man sitting beside jim nodded and there was a gasp of surprise behind jim turned his head for a quick look the lovely young woman had indeed changed she was now a plainborderingonugly girl in unattractive cloth ing with an irritable expression her hair was a listless stringy unappealing shade of green then the moment was over and she was lovely again her legs and bosom filled out and her dank hair became lustrous she smiled and the interior of the rv seemed to brighten see i owe nimby a lot you sure do sean breathed as jim turned back to watch the road but why is nimby doing this for you karen asked i mean if hes really a dragon wouldnt he rather eat you karen mary said severely ah come on mom david said she does look good enough to eat yon ill wind chlorine laughed thank you i was afraid of some thing like that at first because thats what dragons do but he turned out to be a nice dragon a very nice dragon yeah david agreed i wish i had one like him id have him make me a star football player or something actually he did tell me why when we first met she evidently held up a hand as someone started to protest jim had to keep his eyes on the road so couldnt look yes nimby is mute now but at first he could speak he told me that he needed my company and would do any thing he could to make it worthwhile for me but he warned me that that was his only chance to speak and he has been mute since but he understands me and he can answer me by gestures but suppose he had something important and compli cated to tell you sean asked perhaps becoming in trigued by something other than her appearance such as some terrible danger you didnt know was coming so you didnt think to ask him a yesorno question about it why i dont know nimby is there anything like that nimby turned to face the rear and nodded something important thats too complicated for me to just guess readily nimby nodded again now chlorine seemed out of sorts but how can i ask you if i dont know what to ask she asked plaintively maybe he can write it david said but i cant read chlorine said more than big ob vious signs and short words i mean the signs have spells to make them legible to anyone even animals i cant read anything significant on my own i flunked centaur school so she was functionally illiterate jim realized sean laughed so have him make you able to read there was a flash of light followed by a gasp of awe a lightbulb just appeared over your head karen cried it glowed piers anthony yes of course chlorine agreed i realized sean was right thats a brilliant idea nimby make me literate so i can read what you write no matter how complicated it is and write me what i need to know immediately the young man brought out a pad and sty lus and began writing jim nodded there were definite ad vantages to magic in mundania there were no such shortcuts that reminds me of something else jim said this is obviously not our homeland the rules are mostly dif ferent how is it that you and the centaurs speak exactly our own language oh thats part of the magic of xanth chlorine said everyone speaks the same language here all people i mean animals speak their own languages which are dif ferent from ours so we usually cant understand them but often they can understand us we have animals sean said but they dont speak oh they surely do speak at least here in xanth you just need someone like grundy golem to translate what they say who hes an obnoxious little creature who speaks all lan guages meanwhile nimby had completed his writing soon he passed the note back chlorine took it and looked at the fine script i can read it she exclaimed i really can im literate im utterly thrilled what does it say david asked oh yes she focused and read the note aloud there are goblins along lizard lane who have set a trap for unwary travelers it is an illusion barricade and detour that will lead folk into a trap so the goblins can swarm in and capture them for stew does that mean what i think it does mary asked horrified yon ill wind yes if you think it means that goblins boil people alive chlorine said goblins are mean creatures she returned to her reading because i must protect you from harm and you will come to harm if the mundanes fall into this trap i must tell you how to avoid it do not honor the illusion drive right through it without slowing the goblins will not be able to attack this vehicle at speed why couldnt they just throw some logs on the road sean asked because this is an enchanted path chlorine ex plained the trolls guarantee that there are no dangers along it otherwise no one would use it as it is there is very little traffic because the trollway is new and many folk are wary of trolls also the trolls used to build only bridges but they do know how to make good roads so the goblins cant put up any real barricades but if they trick us into leaving the protected path then they can get us she lifted her voice again oh thank you for warn ing us nimby she said im sorry i never thought to ask after this write me a note any time i need to know something the young man nodded that was an interesting situa tion jim reflected where nimby seemed to know every thing but couldnt volunteer information he had to be asked or instructed to meanwhile this was indeed a good route so this is lizard lane jim said what does that remind me of alligator alley sean said jim nodded a parody of the world we know so if i see a barricade and detour im to ignore it because its illusion nimby beside him nodded jim shut up but privately he doubted that they would encounter any such illusion the scenery was becoming more interesting or alarming depending on ones view florida in the everglades region was flat but it was evident that xanth had mountains al piers anthony ready lizard lane was wriggling between them like its namesake there even seemed to be a volcano in the dis tance in fact the road seemed to be headed in that direc tion jim hoped it didnt erupt while they were in its vicinity there was also a bank of clouds looming to the north east that would be the vanguard of happy bottom as they called gladys here could there be anything to the conjecture about it sweeping up magic dust and becoming a dangerous magical storm after what he had already seen he was not prepared to deny it so they were doing exactly what they needed to driving full speed away from it or at least around it suddenly a barricade loomed up how had he over looked it before the thing was huge and extended right across the road there was a big sign with an arrow point ing right road closeddetour the detour road was clear winding away toward a rest station he barely had time to make it jim trod on the brakes the tires squealed as he swerved no chlorine cried its illusion go through it jim had virtually no time to make his decision she had warned him about this a mistake could be fatal he might regret this in an instant but he trusted her he straightened the wheel and stepped on the gas heading for the collision he barely missed the exit lane he winced as the barrier loomed high and thick and devastating they were going to crash then they were through it without contact the road continued ahead uninterrupted jims pulse started its long trek back down toward the vicinity of normal chlorine and nimbyhad been right gee david said awed just like killer video that about covered it jim glanced at nimby who shrugged obviously his information had been good he had been right about the illusion barrier so probably was also right about the goblins in fact there they were now a horde of small lumpy yon ill wind manlike figures just off the right of way shaking their little fists some carried clubs and some spears obviously they had intended no good that had been one close escape thanks to the timely warning nimby if i may askhow did you know about this ambush jim asked he wasnt sure the man would an swer him but chlorine must have nodded because nimby began to write again soon he passed jim a note jim held it up by the steering wheel and read it have knowledge of events around me that may affect the welfare of my companion but i may not act on them myself i can act only at her behest the goblins were setting up the illusion barricade evidently so and if chlorine hadnt thought to ask they would have fallen into the trap what would nimby have done then maybe he would have reverted to his dragon form and carried her away to safetyif chlorine asked him but the rest of them would probably have been out of luck chlorine must have had a similar chain of thought nimbyi have undertaken to guide these folk safely out of xanth if anything happens to them i will have failed i wouldnt like that at all so please warn me if anything threatens them as well as me i mean if it threatens them without threatening me warn me because thats part of me toothe decent part if they are hurt i will hurt too nimby nodded thank you jim said now they were approaching the volcano smoke was issuing from its aperture is that thing active jim asked yes thats mount pinatuba chlorine said peering ahead the last time it got angry it blew out so much dust that it cooled all xanth by a degree but it doesnt blow its top if you dont insult it volcanoes care sean asked how can they when they arent alive dont speak loudly chlorine cautioned him it might hear you piers anthony indeed that seemed to be the case because the mountain shuddered and blew out a plume of gas oh i didnt mean to disparage it sean saidquickly i think its a pretty impressive volcano the mountain subsided and the plume drifted away in the wind everything cares chlorine said the inanimate can be very sensitive to slights king dor can talk to it and it answers him most things arent too smart but they do have opinions so we have to be careful not to insult them unless we have reason i guess so he agreed clearly impressed mom can i use the privy karen asked its full mary replied we need to stop where we can empty it she was right the storm had confined them pretty much to the rv and they hadnt been able to attend to certain details chlorine is there a rest stop along this road nearby one that isnt goblininfested chlorine consulted with nimby who nodded soon he pointed to the side and jim swung onto an exit road sure enough it led to a pleasant glade with a house in the cen ter he pulled up beside the house and paused this is safe he asked nimby the young man hesitated then nodded the others opened the side door and piled out but jim delayed he hadnt liked that hesitation is there some thing youre not telling us nimby chlorine had gotten out with the others so they were now alone in the vehicle nimby hesitated again then be gan to write a note jim waited and in due course read the note danger is looming close your family will learn it at this site and be alarmed this will make your journey more difficult what danger the storm is stirring up bad creatures they will frighten your children yon ill wind but we will escape unharmedif we follow your ad vice nimby nodded yes thank you jim hesitated then spoke again i wish i could know more about you nimby but i hesitate to inquire maybe some other time then he too got out of the vehicle the region was very nice karen had found a tree and was picking a pie from it jim stopped doing a double take a pie tree yes so it seemed to be so it really was true pies grew on trees here in the magic land of xanth he went to the facilities which were somewhat primi tive but usable what more was to be expected of trolls the wind whistled through the cracks there was no doubt the storm remained near then he thought of the pets and returned to the rv to see to them he found nimby communing with them though they were normally somewhat shy with strangers they seemed completely at ease with the odd young man as jim approached nimby turned to face him he wrote another note these creatures should not be caged you must let them go we do at home jim said but we cant risk it in a strange place woofer would range the neighborhood getting his nose into everything midrange would be chas ing wild birds up trees and tweeter would fly into a bush and get hopelessly lost we have been the route nimby wrote another note they will not do any of these things the magic is enhancing them they understand that you mean well by them and they will neither misbehave nor flee you how can you know this jim asked skeptically this isnt a physical barricade its the nature of ani mals another note know thoughts too it is part of my tal ent i must know what is so i can enable chlorine safely to be what she wishes to be piers anthony that seemed to be true look nimby i dont want to get in trouble with my children ill ask them and if they agree to let the pets go well do it the children were already approaching eating pies they had picked karens hair was blowing across her face and into her pie but she didnt seem to mind jim explained the situation try woofer first sean suggested if he behaves try midrange so they freed the big dog woofer bounded out of the rv went to a nearby tree watered it sniffed the air and returned to the group tail wagging he was remarkably well behaved youre not going to chase all over the region jim asked the dog surprised woof it was a plain negation david went to his pet okay midrange your turn he freed the cat midrange went to a sandy spot and did his business then he too sniffed the air and returned to the group so karen freed tweeter the parakeet flew up to the nearest branch of a tree dropped a dropping and flew back to karens shoulder the increasing wind made the birds flight somewhat erratic but he adjusted rapidly jim shook his head bemused very well pets you have five minutes to do whatever you want to then return here because well be on our way again now the three creatures scattered woofer zoomed through the bushes avidly exploring tweeter circled into the sky and disappeared midrange climbed a nut and bolt tree and was soon lost in the foliage the three children followed them as well as they were able thats more like normal jim said but he was im pressed by the way the animals had waited for his word before acting on their impulses if they actually returned on the schedule he had set he would know that nimbys judgment in such respects could be trusted mary emerged carrying a basket of comestibles the yon ill wind wind did its best to blow her dress around but she re mained in control she stacked the bag in the rv then looked around where are the pets nimby said they would behave if we let them go so we did she turned a quizzical glance on him but did not com ment tweeter reappeared he landed on nimbys shoulder tweeting at a great rate nimby wrote another note and gave it to jim the storm has stirred up enormous birds who may be hostile they are coming this way jim shrugged how big can a bird get a huge shadow crossed the glade they looked up to spot its source it looked like an airplane but it was silent a big glider perhaps then it screeched it was a birdas big as an airliner such a creature could probably pick up the whole rv in its talons if it tried jim mary said urgently right he raised his voice kids pets times up the summoned ones forged in from all directions chlo rine too reappeared looking devastatingly lovely in her windblown state but the boys for once werent looking at her get a load of that big bird david cried pausing to stare get in mary said tightly they piled in so did jim after checking to make sure all was in order nimby had told him that bad creatures would frighten the children instead it seemed to be mary who was frightened perhaps with good reason he started the motor and moved onto the access road there was no troll booth here fortunately they were able to proceed without delay the children peered out the windows at the monstrous bird thats a roc sean said awed fantasys biggest bird i never thought id see one tweeter chirped jim glanced at nimby who wrote a note he says that isnt all piers anthony whats that karen cried a dragon sean said he wasnt joking his tone was serious now a huge and grotesque shape loomed in the sky before the vehicle it was indeed a dragon karen screamed jim looked at nimby this road is protected nimby hesitated and nodded but theres a but jim said lets have the qual ifier the note came the winged monsters can not attack anything on the enchanted path directly but they can pre tend to do not be swayed and children can be frightened jim said nimby nodded yuck david cried karen screamed again and this time mary made a stifled exclamation of alarm jim looked from one window to the next all around craning his neck but didnt see anything this is an en chanted road he reminded them nothing can hurt us while were on it physically mary responded tightly what did you see it was a harpy chlorine said they are very ugly and nasty a humanheaded bird jim asked whats so bad about one more fantastic then a filthy thing appeared before the windshield it looked like a thoroughly soiled vulture with the head and breasts of an old woman ghaaa the dirty bird screeched before veering up over the vehicle her legs had glistening discolored talons jim fearing a collision and revolted by the sight almost veered onto the shoulder of the road now he understood what had been bothering the others can this house move faster chlorine asked yes but with these crosswinds i havent wanted to push it yon ill wind i think you had better the woman said concerned the harpies may not be able to touch us directly but if they think to lay any eggs on us messy sean remarked not exactly their eggs explode they might do dam age explosive eggs jim decided to accelerate regardless of the wind there was an angry screech outside as the harpies re alized that their target was escaping theyre coming af ter us dad david exclaimed and the dragons too jim goosed the gas as if to join in the fray the wind increased becoming more gusty the vehicle swerved slightly as jim fought to keep it steady he didnt like this kind of driving neither did the others the kids were now uncomfortably silent but now they slowly forged ahead of the winged mon sters jim was even able to ease up on the gas a bit he appreciated nimbys warning about the children being frightened if they hadnt paused at the rest stop they might have stayed safely ahead of the dirty birds but that stop had been necessary all the same he hoped not to stop again if he could avoid it nimby wrote another note jim took it and propped it before him so he could read it without taking his eyes off the road soon you will come to the gap chasm where you will have to stop for the ferry it is protected but perhaps not comfortable for you whats this gap chasm jim asked between his clenched teeth oh thats a big chasm that crosses xanth chlorine answered it once had a forget spell on it so no one ever remembered it was there but that started disintegrating during the time of no magic and now most folk do re member it its said to be very impressive you havent seen it jim asked he was learning not to take the features of xanth terrain lightly not exactly she said i never traveled far from my piers anthony home village until this adventure which is proving to be a great one i did cross it but by night i really didnt get a good look into it but of course i had heard about the gap chasm theres a big green dragon in the bottom who steams and eats any creatures it catches there nimby says well take the ferry then maybe we wont have to get past the gap dragon chlorine said relieved i dont know about the ferry but if nimby says it it must be so but not comfortable for them jim remembered he had better prepare the children kids we may have another difficult passage ahead so brace yourselves there was a moderate groan from behind obviously this magic land was losing some of its appeal nimby pointed ahead jim didnt see anything but wasnt about to ignore the signal he slowed the rv it was just as well for in a moment he saw that the road ended abruptly at the brink of an awesome cleft in the ground it seemed impossibly wide and deep the last thing he would have wanted to do was zoom at speed off the lip into the depths imp erial mary watched the dreadful chasm approach as pects of this strange realm had first been unbe lievable then disturbing now they were becoming downright alarming but she didnt want to ex press her burgeoning concern lest it upset the children they had already been frightened enough by the terrible yon ill wind flying creatures oh how she hoped it didnt get any worse there was a small house at the brink another troll stood there jim fished in his pocketfor more change were taking the ferry he told the troll as if this were routine she had to give him due credit he had excellent poise in this most trying situation and it was working the creature accepted the coins and nodded but there was no boat just the yawning deeps of the chasm is it safe to get out here he asked nimby the odd man nodded mary knew that nimbys help was in valuable but she was privately afraid of him there was something so utterly different about him as to be unclas sifiable she far preferred chlorine who though not in her ordinary form which was downright plain was at least completely human but perhaps jim and the children had some caution for they elected to remain inside the rv just in case the mon sters should return they watched as a cloud detached it self from a cloud bank above the chasm and drifted in their direction it seemed to have a kind of foggy keel below oh no could this actually be their ferry mary kept her dark suspicion to herself hoping it wasnt true but it was true the cloud came to dock at the brink of the cliff so that the road now led onto it it looked solid but how could that possibly be jim looked at nimby she wished he wouldnt look to the strange man for guidance so much onto that nimby nodded yes this must be the ferry chlorine said when i crossed i was carried by a flybynight jim started the motor jim mary cried truly alarmed he looked back their advice has been good so far do we stop trusting them now mary swallowed feelingand surely lookingrather pale drive very slowly he inched forward the front wheels nudged onto the piers anthony cloud surface and held it was as solid as it looked gee david said staring out and down do you believe in group nightmares sean asked rhe torically definitely but mary stifled her retort of course there are night mares chlorine said they bring the bad dreams to the people who deserve them dont they go to mundania too oh sure karen said i get them all the time something tells me were not speaking quite the same language sean said are you talking about just dreams chlorine and that was another thing mary was quite uneasy about the lovely young womans effect on the im pressionable seventeenyearold boy seans eyes were at tracted to her as if compelled by magnets he tried to conceal his fascination but mary saw it chlorine was not trying to be flirtatious but she didnt have to be her mere presence was more than sufficient it was clear that she had not had a lot of experience being beautiful she tended to show too much flesh and it really was by accident the girl was fairly innocent which actually made it more awk ward the dreams and the mares chlorine replied and the night stallion who governs them they gallop out each night to carry their carefully crafted creations horses david cried he too was all too much in trigued by the unconscious wiles of the woman theyre real horses l of course chlorine said except that you cant usu ally see them you cant see mare imbri either though she comes by day with nice day dreams her eyes misted for a moment perhaps seeing such a dream well at least their dialogue and chlorines appearance were distracting the children from the unbelievable thing that was happening the rv now had all four tires on the cloud jim set the brake and turned off the motor we are safely aboard the ferry he announced yon ill wind aboard anyway mary murmured tightly the cloud began to move it carried them out over the depths of the chasm those depths were now darkening for it was late in the day the slanting sunlight illuminated the steep side but then cut off before the bottom the shadow was not impenetrable there were trees and rocks in the lowest part oh theres the gap dragon chlorine cried point ing they all peered down there in the deep distance was a tiny wormlike thing wriggling along but mary was sure that it would be considerably more formidable up close she was glad it wasn t close karen came to climb into her fathers lap daddy is this real she asked im not sure he admitted but i think we had better assume it is until we get out of it with that mary could agree emphatically she no longer doubted the reality of this realm and she most certainly wished to be out of it then the wind rose again oopsthat looks like fracto chlorine said who fracto the worst of clouds he always comes to rain on picnics now he must be coming to mess up our crossing i dont like this a malign storm mary asked an ugly shiver running through her she did seethe cloud developing and it looked just exactly like a thunderstorm there were even jags of lightning projecting from it oooh its got a face karen said the weird thing was that the child was right there was a kind of pattern forming that did look like a vaguely hu man face it had small foggy eyes and a big cruel mouth with hugely expanding cheeks as if it were taking in a breath so as to blow a blast of air at them oh i hope the ferry is enchanted so fracto cant blow us away chlorine said ask nimby david suggested piers anthony chlorine smiled at the boy of course why didnt i think of that nimby was already writing a note he passed it back to her the ferry is enchanted she read what a re lief she was no more relieved than mary herself was pre sumably that meant that the storm could huff and puff and threaten but couldnt actually blow them away the storm was evidently going to give it a try however the face loomed up hugely and the mouth exhaled a stream of mist shot out right toward the ferry cloud but it turned aside as if encountering a shield and passed above them fracto looked angry mary chided herself for personi fying the cloud but the expression was unmistakable boy hes mad now david said with a certain sinister relish hes going to get us if he can he stuck his tongue out at the thing please dont do that mary said experiencing a thrill of fear its not polite awww but this was routine thus mary didnt have to admit that her main motivation was concern about mak ing the storm furious what were the limits of protective enchantment she did not want to findout and of course she didnt want david getting into bad habits anyway the cloud certainly tried but all his huffing and puffing couldnt blow their house down they continued their san guine float across the chasm and in due course came to the far brink karen returned to the back so her father could drive i could get to like trolls jim remarked as he started the motor and nudged the rv onto solid land mary felt her tightness dissipating they had made a safe crossing she had always been a bit nervous about air travel and this had been a most precarious flight the trollway is the way to go she agreed gee that was great david said even chlorine glanced at him obviously not as pleased with the experience as he had been yon ill wind the rv got up speed but now the day was dimming and it was clear that they would be another day on the road before escaping xanth they could of course con tinue driving except do we have enough gas mary asked no jim replied less than half a tank left well need another gas guzzler soon nimby chlorine said the man wrote another note and passed it to jim there is one ahead but theres a problem jim said its off the enchanted path and there may be danger thats all we need mary muttered but they would have to have more gasoline what kind of danger nimby wrote another note a blobstacle course jim announced a what karen asked alertly jim seldom punned thats how its spelled blobstacle i hesitate to in quire further oh sure theres one of those in a computer game i play david said you just have to be ready to dodge fast dodge city sean said he in contrast often punned jim looked at nimby just how dangerous is a blob stacle course the man made another note jim read it aloud in this moving house not very dangerous if you avoid the blobs but it can be disgusting jim glanced back dis gusting i can handle how about the rest of you yeah david exclaimed mary wasnt sure but the thought of getting stranded without gas bothered her more we had better try it dear she said you call him a deer chlorine asked surprised mary smiled tiredly in a fashion nimby signaled the tumoff and jim drove down the side road almost immediately the blobstacle course man ifested a series of huge discolored blobs sitting on and piers anthony about the road they looked like giant poisonous fungi which might be what they actually were jim slowed so as to steer around the first without going off the road because the terrain on either side was rough it seemed to vary from steep hill to bog not something to stick a tire into he got around the first then made an s tum to get around the second on the other side so far so good this at least was manageable mary thought bogy at three oclock high sean announced peering up out a window something was definitely looming there rapidly ap proaching oh no chlorine said peering with him at any other time mary would have objected to the way her bosom was nudging his shoulder that looks like a meat ier shower a meteor shower jim said without taking his eyes from the road that sounds like a mundane phenome non no its another language problem chlorine said i have trouble hearing what you say and you have trouble hearing what i say maybe its because you didnt pass through the regular interface when youcame to xanth you can talk our language but the nuances dont come through thats meat as in flesh meatier shower those arent completely dangerous but they arent much fun ei ther so its going to rain hamburgers and hot dogs sean astea no it will shower meat or am i missing another nu ance never mind sean continued to look out then some thing solid struck the roof of the rv hey just how big are the pieces all sizes chlorine said from gnat legs to boiled rocs and they can be rotten depending how long they have been traveling dad sean said lets get the bleep out of here then he looked surprised bleep that isnt what i said yon ill wind how old are you chlorine asked seventeen why that means youre still subject to the adult conspir acy you cant say bad words until you pass eighteen sean was astonished i cant not in xanth she said firmly mary suppressed her smile this land of xanth wasnt all bad i can live with it karen said not managing to damp down her own smile let me try davidsaid bleep he looked sur prised hey its true bleep bleep stop it mary said but how could you tell what words i was trying to say he asked plaintively i can read your lipsand your mind oh yeah he was deflated there was a heavy dull thud on the roof of the rv damn jim muttered and it almost seemed to mary that the air in his vicinity turned slightly smoky he goosed the engine trying to get through the blobstacle course faster something reddish brown splatted against a window dark juice oozed from it ugh karen cried whats that part of a bleeping raw liver i think sean answered im going to be a vegetarian she declared the vehicle slewed around another blob an outer wheel riding up a bank then squished through some stuff that surely wasnt ice slush theres a guzzler dad david called pointing got it jim said he slid to a halt by the creature who looked exactly like the other one got another pill mary mary dived into her purse yes here she fished out the bottle and opened it spilling several pills she picked one up and passed it to her husband he gave it to the guzzler the creature swallowed the piers anthony pill then looked for the gas tank but of course it was capped jim started to open the door no mary cried youll get hit by meat jim hesitated closing the door somebodys got to take off the gas cap he pointed out and not you or a child chlorine perked up nimby without a word the young man opened his door and got out a huge mass of something bounced in front of him hell be hit mary cried chlorine pondered for half a moment nimby assume your natural formwith tough scales she called then the young man disappeared to be replaced by the ugliest creature mary could have imagined it looked like a mule from the front being muleheaded and some kind of ancient dinosaur from behind with huge overlapping scales furthermore it was striped pink and green the pink was halfway pretty but the green was wretched so this was the real nature of the creature no wonder she had been uneasy about him but she reminded herself that he was doing them a fa vor she watched as he made his fourfooted way around the front of the rv chunks of meat struck his body but did no apparent harm his scales were indeed tough as chlorine had suggested but rapidly getting badly soiled he came around to the gas tank and used his equine teeth to twist off the cap the guzzler stuck in its tail and the gas flowed when the tank was evidently full nimby used his teeth again to put the cap back on and screw it tight then he trundled back around the rv when he reached his door he reverted to manform just in time to get hit by a big blood blisterfrom the sky it didnt seem to hurt him but he was completely soaked get in before you get killed mary screamed ap palled the man opened the door and climbed in oooo ugh karen said with a certain relish what a sunk she was right nimby now smelled of rotten guts yon ill wind cant be helped jim said starting the motor come back here mary told nimby ill see if i can clean you up she felt somewhat guilty because he had gotten splatted while doing them a favor nimby came back the children drew away from him turned off by the sight and smell of him but mary had cleaned up messes before well have to wash you off and give you some clean clothes she said in motherly fashion do you know how to use our facilities he nodded then do so pass your clothing out and ill pass fresh things in he did so relieved mary set about a search for cloth ing hell have to use some of yours she told sean hes about your size its in a good cause for sure he agreed wryly she dug out a shirt jeans underwear and an old pair of sneakers then when the lavatory door opened she ex changed them for the sodden things nimby had been wear ing it was hard to breathe with the stench of them she bundled them up and dumped them in a basin for laun dering meanwhile jim was navigating the blobstacle course back to the main road it seemed easier now the meatier shower was abating and the blobs seemed to be shrinking apparently even bad things didnt last long in xanth soon the road cleared and they were back on the main haul that was another considerable relief nimby emerged garbed correctly now he looked ex actly like a barelybeyondteenager seans clothing fit him well enough let me fix your hair mary said she fetched a brush and trained his wet hair back in a conventional part gee he could pass for one of us david said i mean like one of the family say do you want to be my brother karen asked him nimby looked blank theyre teasing you mary piers anthony said you dont have to be part of anyones family she realized as she spoke that her attitude toward the young man had changed she had been wary of him because she didnt understand him now she had seen his natural form she understood him better he was surely somewhat un comfortable among human beings and she wanted to al leviate that because he was helping them significantly of course she knew it was because he was chlorines com panion doing what chlorine wanted and chlorine had been assigned to get the family safely through xanth still she appreciated what he was doing she put away the brush and adjusted his collar she realized that he was looking at her im sorry she said embarrassed im so used to taking care of my family i just automatically do these things i know youre not a child nimby smiled then he found his padactually it just seemed to appear in his hand along with the penciland wrote a note she noticed with surprise that he actually held the pencil still and moved the notepad against it to do the writing he tore off the sheet and gave it to her thank you for your attitude no one has treated me like a person before except chlorine i am glad to be thought of as part of your family why thank you nimby mary said pleased she gave his hand a little squeeze then she returned to her seat if you want to be family you have to help entertain the kid karen said come here to the table nimby and play solitaire no you dont have to do that sean said dont let her push you around what is solitaire chlorine asked its a card game karen said actually there are many kinds and some can be played by two or three peo ple at once ill show you sean and david moved out and chlorine and nimby joined karen at the table for instruction in solitaire soon yon ill wind they were deep into it chlorine had the usual miscues of a beginner but nimby seemed to be a natural player ei ther he was extremely smart or his general awareness of things acquainted him with the identities of the hidden cards or maybe both how could a donkeyheaded dragon be so talented mary wasnt sure but suspected that the relationship of animals to humans was different in xanth animals were smarter here that business with their own pets was eerie it was just as if they had developed almost human intel ligence and restraint and tweeter had warned them about the approach of the flying monsters back at the rest stop or had he nimby had claimed to listen to the bird and written a note it could have been nimby doing it it became important for mary to know the drive was quiet now as sean accompanied jim up front and both nimby and chlorine were involved in karens game da vid was watching the game about to get involved himself so she should be able to do a little experimentation without attracting attention she went back to where the pets were woofer she said and the dog perked up she unsnapped his leash free ing him how smart are you now she asked quietly woofer wagged his tail suppose i tell you to look out the left window the dog looked out the left window mary controlled her reaction suppose i ask you to open tweeters cage woofer turned to the birdcage set teeth and paw to the catch and worked it open tweeter suppose i tell you to go perch on karens head the bird flew out and landed on the girls head karen was so preoccupied she didnt notice midrange the cat sat up and gazed at her suppose i ask you to roll over this was not a trick the cat had been taught piers anthony midrange rolled over you animals do understand me dont you the cat nodded if we treat you three with the respect due intelligent and disciplined entities will you behave accordingly midrange nodded then we shall do so do you know why you are now so smart the cat shook his head i think it is because of the magic of this land it seems that magic dust is getting stirred up and causing numerous disruptions including enhancement of the intelligence of animals she was speaking in a deliberately advanced manner testing the limits does that make sense to you midrange considered then slowly nodded but as you know there are also some formidable dan gers here mary said surprised by how readily she was accepting this new relationship with their pets so i hope you will remain close by when we go out of the rv and will also warn us as tweeter did when the situation war rants midrange agreed again then wandered off to find a suit able place to catnap mary returned to her seat she had satisfied herself that nimby had not been faking it he had understood bird talk and the bird had talked now mary realized that night had fallen she had been distracted by her investigation and not realized it they had spoken of driving through the night but now she was not at all certain this was wise she didnt want jim suf fering deadly fatigue when any accident could strand them in a really strange situation dear maybe we should look for a place to stay the night she called is it safe to stop that long he asked chlorine looked up from the card game is it safe nimby yon ill wind nimby wrote a note this vehicle has outdistanced the storm it is safe to pause until dawn good mary said she was catching on to the way of these things where is a good place to stay a camping park with some facilities would suffice but i think id rather find a hotel where we can really unwind for a few hours there is an imp settlement near the imps are courteous to visitors from afar if the right village is chosen then that is where we should stop mary decided soon nimby indicated a side road and jim took it it led to a sign saying impossible with an arrow to the right but nimby indicated that this wasnt the right one a little farther was a sign saying imp rison with an arrow to the left but it seemed this wasnt right either mary was in clined to agree she wouldnt want to stay at either im possible or imprison considering the literal tendencies of this land finally a sign said imp erial and this one was good mary was glad imperial had a quality ring to it the village was small but elegant the jungle had been cleared back somewhat and there were neat little gardens and nice little houses in fact everything about this com munity seemed small scale following nimbys indications they drew up to the largest building in the village its structure suggested that it was an enormous hotel but it was only about two human stories tall though it was night tiny figures were scurrying about carrying torches each was under one foot tallthe fe males significantly under but apart from that they ap peared to be fully human they were carrying things from their little houses into the forest what are they doing chlorine asked nimby wrote a note they are carrying their gems to the safety of a deep cave oh because of the approaching storm chlorine said that makes sense they got out of the rv stretching their legs after the piers anthony long confinement woofer tweeter and midrange joined them perfectly behaved the hotel door opened and a man and a woman emerged he looked to be in his seventies by the human scale and she in her fifties hello huge folk the woman said her voice clear despite her tiny size i am quieta imp and this is my father imp ortant we are the leaders of this community so we run the hos pitality domicile do you wish to accept our hospitality there was a pause then mary stepped in yes we do please but wewere not sure your building is big enough for us she glanced meaningfully at the foothigh main door oh it has an accommodation spell quieta said it will do come in somewhat dubiously mary stepped forward as she ap proached the building it seemed to shimmer and suddenly it was human size quieta and ortant imp were human size too what happened mary asked startled you have been accommodated quieta said see the others in your party havent yet mary turned there behind her stood several giants thirty to forty feet tall even their animals were terrifyingly large oh she said feeling faint quieta stepped up to take her arm im sorry i didnt realize how new this must be to you are you by any chance mundane yes mary said faintly the spell is harmless it merely makes the various par ties seem to be the same size so we are about two and a half times as big and you are about one two and a halfth as big or small as the case may be but those outside the spell region dont see that and to them we all look imp ishly small while to us they look humanly big to be sure mary agreed not able to argue whatever point there might be now chlorine stepped forward she shimmered and be came marys size arent accommodation spells won yon ill wind derful she asked rhetorically ive never been in one before but i love it i thought they were only for when folk of quite different sizes wished to summon the stork to what mary exclaimed shocked but she realized that in this land of magic storks might be literal and that interbreeding of humans and imps might indeed be pos sible i mean im surprised thats all chlorine beckoned the others and one by one they stepped in including the animals who seemed almost as surprised as the humans gee karen said summing it all up come in quieta said i will show you to your rooms while my father prepares the evening meal they followed her to an omate staircase that wound up to a sumptuous second story quieta opened the door on a truly splendid suite will this do she asked somewhat timidly it has four bedrooms and lavatories with facil ities for your animal companions but we cant afford anything like this mary pro tested afford what does this princely suite cost cost imps dont charge for their hospitality chlorine mur mured but we cant accept this mary said quieta looked embarrassed im sorry i thought it would be adequate i will try to find better rooms for you no no mary said its not that its that this suite is so fancy we dont have any right to take it especially not without paying but you are guests quieta said mary looked at chlorine this is the way of it all thiswith no charge just because we stopped here yes i thought you knew of course if we had stopped at rison it would have been much less comfortable imprison sean murmured appreciatively then its all right quieta asked hopefully piers anthony oh my dear its wonderful mary said i simply had no idea it would be so fancy wewe are used to much simpler accommodations we imps take pride in our hospitality quieta said evidently relieved will an hour be enough time before supper yes of course mary said and thank you quieta thank you so much this is really nice you are welcome the imp lady said and departed they explored the suite there was a huge master bed room and three smaller ones and a sitting room with sev eral couches and an alcove with what looked like dog food cat food and birdseed as well as the two bathrooms the master bathroom had a tub the size of a small swim ming pool while the other had a shower this is just so amazing mary breathed just to be hospitable the three pets were waiting expectantly mary realized why certainlyindulge yourselves she said they im mediately went to the pet nook and started eating how about us david asked you adults have the master bedroom with the great bath and chlorine and nimby have the first regular bedroom but how do us kids split the other two mary considered if one of you wants to sleep on a couch in the sitting room you can all have rooms to your selves but one of you will have to share a bathroom with the one on the couch can you work that out between you all three nodded enthusiastically then lets try to be ready for supper within the hour she glanced at chlorine i didnt thinkyou do wish to share a room with nimby if not thats fine chlorine said come on nimbyyou still have some of that meatier shower stink im going to scrub you clean she led the young man to their bedroom sean looked after them i wish could get scrubbed clean by a creature like then he realized that his yon ill wind mother was looking at him and cut off somewhat but perhaps not sufficiently embarrassed jim and mary entered the master bedroom and closed its door who first she asked glancing at the enormous tub what not together he asked you think this is our honeymoon she inquired archly in this suite it feels like it he was right together she agreed but dont get fresh she went to run the water this turned out to be interesting there was only one tap but when she turned it on the water came out exactly the right degree of hot the two towels were small but when she touched one with her wet hand it dried the hand immediately there was one tiny bar of soap shaped like a stoneobviously a soapstonebut when she dipped it in the water it made a big fluff of scented bubbles there just might be some magic here well she was getting used to that in this magic land and this was one of the first really pleasant surprises it had had for her soon they were both in the tub scrubbing each other and it was wonderful jim did get fresh and she allowed it because it did indeed feel like their honeymoon if every day were only like this she murmured i think we have been selling xanth short he agreed its like a powerful new computer program at first you run afoul of all its traps and they mess you up and drive you crazy but then you start getting really into it and you find out how nice it can be mmnun she agreed luxuriously after that things got somewhat out of hand but it was worth it just so long as none of the children barged in on them they were ready by the time the hour was up bright and clean and in fresh clothing so were the children amazingly and the pets who evidently intended to join them downstairs piers anthony but mary started then she remembered how ad vanced the animals had become of course the others glanced at her in surprise but didnt comment quieta appeared promptly right this way she said they found themselves in a very nice dining chamber sized just about right for their party quieta went into the adjacent kitchen and emerged pushing a cart with a number of platters and pitchers these turned out to have an as sortment of meats vegetables pastries breads and bev erages i would serve you but i am notsure of mundane tastes so i brought a selection that you could choose from yourselves she explained i shall be happy to answer questions about what may be unfamiliar to you sean reached for a pitcher this looks familiar what is it boot rear he smiled sure he poured himself a cupful he took a good gulpand jumped halfway out of his chair hey karen tittered boot rear i get it serves you right mary eyed what looked like something scavenged from the meatier shower what is this please that is steak from a steakout tree mary decided to risk it and was rewarded with an ex cellent entree the others followed suit and did seem to enjoy the strange meal they finished with eye scream which turned out to resemble screaming eyeballs but tasted much like the confection they knew in mundania as they finished imp ortant returned i shall try to entertain you while quieta does the dishes he said maybe we should help with the dishes mary said feeling guilty again because they werent paying for this no the spells wouldnt work for you how may i best help you to enjoy yourselves i for one would like to know a bit more about your village your society jim said i havent encountered imps before david and karen looked as if they would yon ill wind rather watch tv but mary stifled them with a warning glance ortant however saw and understood the glance per haps the children would prefer to remain and watch the magic mirror he suggested while i give the adults a tour of our village magic mirror karen asked her interest suddenly revving up the imp went to a large mirror at the end of the cham ber mirror would you like to entertain two mundane children he asked a mouth appeared on the glass it seemed to be a re flection but there was nothing it could be reflecting from why not ill show them the magic tapestry of castle roogna a tapestry david asked disappointed the tapestry shows any scene of xanth you wish to see ortant explained most children find it quite inter esting of course it wont violate the adult conspiracy awwww they said together but it does show historical battles where dragons chomp people men throw women into pits and blood flows in rivers gee they said together again their interest restored mary winced apparently xanth had the same standards as mundania in this respect david and karen set chairs before the mirror lets see that river of blood david said the mirror showed a country scene with a bright red river flowing in the manner of a normal brook aw thats just colored water karen said the mirrors reflectmouth appeared superimposed on the scene why dont you ask me to have the tapestry trace up to the source of that river where the blood is spurting from a wounded giant yeah they said together quieta arrived with a plate of pastries shaped like little vanilla wheels with chocolate spokes here are punwheel piers anthony cookies for you to eat while you watch she said mary masked her sigh it seemed the children would be quite satisfied right this way ortant said walking to the door jim mary sean chlorine and nimby followed him mary hoped the tour wouldnt be as boring as the children had feared but they had to take it as a matter of courtesy to reward the imps for their hospitality with luck it wouldnt be long then they could settle down for a night of blissful rest the three pets came too that made mary think of something woofermaybe stay with the children she asked the dog cocked his head at her then nodded and turned back he was seans pet but he would guard the children thank you mary murmured relieved she had no reason to be suspicious but she did not feel easy about leaving the children entirely alone among strangers they would come to physical harm literally over the dogs dead body and woofer would probably enjoy the exploration of the river of blood too decision meow midrange said imperatively sean smiled and bent to pick up the cat nat urally midrange didnt want to walk when he could ride since seans dog was staying with david da vids cat would take over sean then tweeter flew up to perch on seans hair that surprised him karen had managed to impress on midrange yon ill wind that any bite out of the bird would swiftly lead to a worse bite out of the cat so tweeter was tolerated unmolested but the two had not been exactly bosom buddies now with the magic they seemed to be getting along better and all three animals had become eerily smart so maybe tweeter figured the cat would understand his concerns bet ter than human beings would they stepped outside the dining room and outside the hotel the wind was rising it buffeted them imp ortant lifted a lantern from a hook beside the door and strode out into the street uh what about the accommodation spell sean asked the imp who now looked exactly like an old human man i mean if we leave the hotel wont we revert ortant lifted the lamp which cast its glow more widely there is a duplicate accommodation spell built into this magic lamp he explained as long as you remain in its light the spell will hold this is best because we shall be going into some places way too small for normal human folk so they had it figured sean returned to his normal in terest which for the past day or so had been chlorine she was the sexiest woman he had encountered oh sure he had caught that glimpse of her when she reverted to her normal state but that wasnt the way she looked now so who cared consider nimby who had turned out to be a muleheaded dragon talk of damsels and dragons no body seemed to be having any problem accepting nimby as a manin seans clothes yetso why should he sean have any with chlorine nobody was very pretty on the inside anyway it was all blood and guts and brain tissue by the time chlorine reverted to her regular dull appearance hed be back in mundania anyway so he might as well enjoy it while he could sean slowed his pace a trifle so that he fell back in the group and nimby and chlorine caught up to him now if she would just walk in front of himbut maybe that would come he had caught enough glimpses of her bosom piers anthony and thighs to keep him floating for some time she evi dently wasnt used to the fancy clothing she wore now and didnt realize quite how much it tended to show he sure wasnt going to tell her tweeter cheeped faintly in his ear eyes left at least that was what it almost sounded like startled he looked leftand chlorine was moving close to him those are nice pets she said her voice dulcet was tweeter speaking to you yeah he told me something lovely was coming up on my left she smiled thank you tweeter i think youre lovely too the bird did a little dance of ecstasy fluffing his feath ers sean youre the first young man ive met since nimby made me beautiful she said i think i am prac ticing on you to see how loveliness works i hope you dont mind iyouyou practice all you want sean said star tled by her candor how he wished he could get her alone and do some real practicing you see all my life men have scorned me because i was plain she continued so i really dont know how to act around them i cant practice on nimby because hes not really a man please let me know if i bother you i dont think you could bother me if you tried he said feeling lightheaded she laughed i could in my normal state but i had nimby make me nice as well as beautiful and smart but intelligence doesnt substitute for experience thats for sure the possibilities were setting his pulses pounding she wanted romantic experience but now they had arrived somewhere just when it had been getting really interesting too bad they entered what seemed like an ordinary building this is where we prepare the raw stones ortant said atient here is a very fast worker sure enough the imp yon ill wind man was working with blinding speed doing things to a collection of pebbles on his table the gems were of sev eral colors and seemed to glow or actually to be burning these are safe fire stones used for making fires that will not get out of control sapphires mom murmured she had a good eye for gems what are these chlorine asked indicating several red gems that looked like little letter ls and were rapidly spinning spinels ortant said they are valued for their flash ing color they left the building and passed a mound covered with gravestones an imp was using a scoop to pull shining bits of stone from it this is a die mound ortant said it is not safe to walk on it unless you wish to die then you never leave it diamonds are forever dad remarked fortunately robable is able to harvest stones from it without getting caught ortant said improbable sean muttered catching on they passed a garden with yellowish rods growing from the ground an imp was rubbing them collecting some thing in a bag goldenrods ortant explained radical is harvesting their pollen which we use to powder other jewelry with golden glitter they passed a glade where many bees were buzzing several of them buzzed the party threateningly but didnt actually sting midrange batted at those that approached sean and tweeter flapped his wings with annoyance whats the matter with them mom asked irritated why are they so pointlessly hostile they are rude bees ortant explained ede will stop them and an imp walked out toward the bees his very presence seeming to hold them back imp ede rude beesimpede rubies sean murmured youre so clever chlorine said batting an eyelash she was improving with practice he felt foolishly flattered piers anthony they came to a pool where another imp was working with a bucket shaped like an rovise is using the pail to try to dip out the matriarch of pearls opalmotherofpearl sean said chlorine batted another lash he felt twice as clever as he was then they came to a pen in the water where several fish tailed equines were confined one neighed ohsea horses chlorine exclaimed thrilled in a corralcoral sean said working it out ose is doing his best to tame the horses in time ortant said in time for what dad asked in time to save them from the magic storm that is approaching our wares are very sensitive to changes in ambient magic something we might not notice could cause them to go wrong we need to clear the entire village by tomorrow night that is why we are working so hard to night we need to complete our work and get our things to safety he frowned unfortunately these horses are ill at ease now and not cooperating well chlorine touched the water with one finger no won derthis water is germy yes the storm is polluting it with weird forms of life but theres nothing we can do i can fix it she said she touched the water again but arent you poisoning it sean asked anxiously yes but not so much it will hurt the horses it will just wipe out the germs then my poison will fade and leave it pure for a while sean did a double take of coursechlorinethe chemicalwe use that in mundania to clear our water ortant was surprised you poison your water to clear it i thought there was no magic in mundania sean laughed it does seem crazy but it works the horses already seemed to be doing better we thank you ortant said to chlorine we never thought of purifying the water by poisoning it yon ill wind they moved on and ortant showed them other aspects of the imp operation but mom said troubled but shouldnt you and your daughter be helping in this effort instead ofof tending to us but you are guests ortant said we must see to your comfort mom did not seem quite satisfied but she said no more ortant brought them to a burning portal this is the gate of fire through which we must take our wares to safety he said ressed will show us the vaults fire agate sean murmured impressed im impressed chlorine murmured you are just so so clever she was beautiful anyway but by this time she would have looked lovely regardless of her appear ance so are you he replied oh she said caught by surprise by his return com pliment then she smiled it works both ways doesnt it yes thats what courtship is all about he said feel ing very wise jim mom said with quiet urgency perhaps we have seenenough dad said picking up on moms mood we should get a good nights sleep certainly if you wish ortant said i shall lead you back forthwith sean knew that they didnt want to take more of the imps time when it was clear that the village had such a lot to do he understood the sentiment he also knew that the notion of children growing up and finding love made mom nervous she thought no one ever crossed the line to adulthood after her own generation as they traced their route back to the hotel chlorine expressed her curiosity i hadnt realized that imps made so many gems i thought that jewel the nymph handled that imps make all the gems ortant said proudly from piers anthony the sparkles of light in morning dew to the most enduring treasure where do you think the nymph obtains her sup ply i had thought it was from a barrel that never emptied because we imps are constantly working to replenish it we fashion the gems the jewel nymphs place them for others to find so it has ever been oh im so impressed she exclaimed i mean not the imp but the surprise the awe of your accomplish ment i understand ortant said looking pleased it was clear that her art was working on him too they arrived at the hotel david karen and woofer remained engrossed by the magic mirror mom rousted them out and packed everyone upstairs after a flurry of preparations for the night the others were in their bedrooms and sean was in the suites living room with the animals he stretched out on the largest couch discovering how tired he was he would lull him self to sleep with mental pictures of chlorine innocently undressing he knew their relationship wasnt real but it was one hell or rather heaven of an illusion and he wanted to savor it while he could all three pets approached him oh you want to share my bed he asked well okay but dont bleep on it he noted with bemusement that he still wasnt able to say poop that evidently being on the proscribed list for his age seean tweeter chirped sean glanced at the bird i swear it sounded as if you said my name tweeter nodded taalk he chirped you want to talk to me this is getting hard to be lieve taaalk midrange meowed rrryess woofer agreed but im making the effort to believe sean said what is it so important that you guys have to tell me yon ill wind the three seemed at a loss aaaask woofer said oh you mean its hard for you to talk human so id better play twenty questions all three nodded okay can i take it for granted that you three remain friendly to our family despite your new intelligence and wish us no harm they nodded um maybe we can simplify this how about a single woof meow or tweet for yes two for no and three for id better do some more asking about that one there was a small chorus of single sounds maybe wed better have a single spokespet sean said smiling i think tweeter makes a single sound most readily so ill address him but if anyone else has some thing to say cut in he pondered a moment is there some danger to us tweet does it relate to the storm were trying to outdis tancehappy bottom tweet well were going to get moving on north in the mom ing isnt that good enough tweet tweet how about the crack of dawn and gobble breakfast while driving tweet okay ill go tell dad now he wont be asleep yet sean started to get up tweet tweet tweet um sean considered again something more i should know about this tweet now let me figure you guys mustve learned some thing we humans didnt but you were with us all the timetwo of you with me one with the kids so it cant besay was it from before did you talk with other an imals somewhere along the way piers anthony tweet and they know something the humans dont tweet tweet tweet okay that we dont how about the imps they know tweet which is why theyre getting the bleep out of here the storm but we already knew about that tweet tweet tweet something more about the storm apart from stirring up things and maybe blowing us away but i cant figure what woimps woofer said sure im a wimp but i still cant figure this out woof woof oh im not a wimp then what were you saying meoimp midrange said oh the imps theyre friendly arent they tweet and the storm means trouble for them too because of the magic dust its stirring up which can bring madness when theres too much so they are clearing up and out tweet tweet tweet more on that sean pondered again they know what theyre doing dont they theyre on schedule tweet tweet oho theyre not going to make it in time tweet because we delayed them by taking up their time and effort the three pets exchanged glances tweet tweet tweeter said doubtfully but we might have at least we made it rougher for them by making a distraction when theyre desperately busy tweet now i got it so is there any way we can help tweet yon ill wind by like maybe carrying thingssay if we stepped out of accommodation wed be huge compared to them and could carry a whole lot for them then theyd get done in time tweet ill ask dad this time there was no protest as he got up he went to the master bedroom and knocked on the door in a moment dad opened it what is it sean the pets told me the imps arent going to get their stuff all moved in time maybe because we delayed them we could maybe help them well inquire dad said he stepped out and they walked out of the suite and downstairs the pets came along there was no one there they must be out working sean said and they never said a word to us well find them they went out the main door and dad took the magic lantern we need to stay accom modated for this i think they had hardly started down the path before quieta appeared her apron was mussed and her hair coming loose as if she had been hectically busy oh im sorry i must have neglected you she cried what do you need we are concerned that we have delayed you at a crit ical time dad said can we help you to do what you have to do before we move on she shook her head that is a very courteous thought but though we could use your assistance it would be at too great a cost you have just time to get clear of xanth before the dust intensifies if you start at dawn and do not stop i used the mirror to talk with the good magician who is always correct you must not delay at all if you remained to help us you would be caught and then you would not be able to escape xanth you might be trapped here a very long and bad time we would be terrible hosts if we let that happen piers anthony maybe we could help now at night before dawn sean suggested no i do not mean to disparage your effort but you are mundanes you would blunder in the dark and be of no use only by daylight could you help and that is when you must be gone dad looked at sean i dont like this but i think we had better depart on schedule i guess so sean agreed reluctantly the best thing we can do for these good folk is to get the bleep out of their way dad turned back to quieta we apologize for delaying you we shall depart at the crack of dawn dont take any trouble for our breakfast or anythingwell move out on our own thank you she said but there is food you can take woofer knows where it is i wish you well on your jour ney she turned and went back down the path i feel like a heel sean muttered so do i dad agreed but its the best we can do they returned to the hotel sean settled down on the couch again and the pets set tled on or around him he closed his eyes and saw a men tal picture of chlorine wearing a filmy nightdress now if he could just get to sleep with her beside him before dawn the parents were up and knocking on doors sean never knew how they did it but they were always alert when they needed to be chlorine looked sleepy but still lovely while nimby looked the same as ever neutral while the others were blearilygetting washed and dressed dad started loading things into the rv and mom went to the kitchen with woofer to fetch the food left there for them sean went from room to room and collected the used sheets for the laundry trying to save quieta that much effort he still felt guilty he took the pets out for a quick walk so they could do their business it was weird stepping out of the accom yon ill wind modation spell suddenly they were all giants beside the dollhouse hotel he took the pets on to the rv knowing how important it was to have no delay for any reason just before dawn they were all bundled into the vehicle and dad was starting the motor the imps were still hur rying around doing their work sean thought he saw quieta and waved to her but wasnt sure she saw him she looked tired they drove back along the access road to the trollway suddenly there was a loud ripping noise and a jagged crack appeared in the dark sky and the whole landscape lightened what happened david cried startled oh that was the crack of dawn chlorine said to let in the light sometimes it gets stuck on night and the sun wont come up because its afraid of the dark so the shroud of night has to be cracked open even karen evidently found that somewhat farfetched but it did seem to be the way it was in xanth they broke out the food the imps had left them which had made the accommodation change with them there was something for everyone ranging from miraculously stillcold eye scream to dog biscuits even in their absence the imps were excellent hosts the drive quickly got tedious so sean took a hand and taught the others how to play poker for matchsticks chlo rine tended to let her cards show as she did other things which was part of her appeal but mute nimby turned out to be an unbluffable player heobviously knew which cards everyone else held soon he had all the matchsticks and the game lapsed did you notice that there were no women or children other than quieta mom remarked from the front seat i think they were already in the safe cave chlorine said all that was left were the men finishing all they could which isnt enough sean said they arent going to make it on time before the dust of madness comes and spoils their remaining stones piers anthony they arent chlorine asked concerned how do you know the animals told me sean said petting woofer they talked to other animals chlorine looked at nimby who nodded couldnt we help david asked evincing a rare sign of social conscience not without being caught by it ourselves sean said grimly you mustnt do that chlorine said quickly i have to get you safely out of xanth but the imps were real nice karen said we should have helped them but if it just got you caught for the madness that would be as much harm as good chlorine said yeah i guess karen agreed reluctantly sean under stood her feeling because he shared it time passed sean got tired of looking out the window and it was hard to look too much at chlorine without being obvious so he wound up snoozing as the others got into more solitaire a game nimby couldnt dominate as com pletely he woke when the rv turned off the main road he glanced at his watch hours had passed and it was now near the middle of the day are we leaving xanth he asked actually somewhat disappointed dad needs more gas karen informed him sleepy head sean looked out where are we tall hassle david said tallahassee that sounds familiar it isnt this is xanth remember those are tall hassle trees out there there were indeed some very tall trees tall hassle sean agreed not wanting to get into a hassle tall or short while chlorine was watching we are looking for a car pool where there should be yon ill wind a cargo of gas at a carport karen said relishing the puns cause theres no gas guzzler here oh who says nimby says that did seem to settle it sean looked out to see if he could spot the car pool there it is karen cried pointing she had the sharp blue eyes of innocent youth sean looked there indeed it was a body of water in the shape of a huge car rolling across the land on watery wheels i should have known he muttered dad honked the horn the car pool seemed to hear be cause it rolled to a stop by the side of the road dont get out dad warned there may be danger nimby nodded sure enough a giant tigerlike creature made of water came bounding toward them a carnivore it loomed over the rv and tried to bite it but its water teeth couldnt dent the metal it made a wet roar and bounded away again an old woman walked out of the water she was made of water too but she had a certain carisma perhaps be cause of the water carnation in her hair i wouldnt give two cents for a tankful of gas dad called but i would give one thats carma karen said i will take it the water woman said my son will give it to you she turned and called toon a garish water man waded out of the pool followed by a shaggy little carpet coming ma he burbled he brought out a big bottle of winecolored liquid and that must be the carport sean said dad got out and unscrewed the gas cap and cartoon poured the liquid in sean hoped this was really what they needed suppose it wasnt gasoline but wine because port was a kind of wine it seemed to be okay because the motor started up well enough but of course there would still be some of the piers anthony old gasguzzler juice in the tank so it was too soon to be sure thank you dad called as he put the vehicle in mo tion carma waved affably then a huge shadow crossed their path sean looked upand saw a giant bird a roc he cried the mon stersve caught up again but nimby wrote a note no that is a rocette they congregate in the tall hassle grove to practice their danc ing that explains everything sean said sourly the big bird circled peering down i think she thinks were going to molest her nest or something david said shes eyeing us dad was concerned too that bird is big enough to pick us up and dump us in the sea he said how can we get away from her nimby wrote another note there is a bhave near the bs will dissuade her just show the way dad said gamely nimby went up front exchanging places with mom so he could indicate the direction i shall be quite glad to get out of this weird world mom said in mundania all we have to worry about are thieves and muggers she smiled to show this was in jest to a degree but what about the imps karen asked mom sighed i confess i do wish we had found some way to help them they were so kind to us despite the extremity of their situation they were approaching what looked like the worlds biggest fiercest hornet nest that would be the beehive or bhave as nimby called it just what kind of creatures are these dad asked war ily oh bs are all right if you dont rile them chlorine said their stings are mainly emotional i sure get emotional when i get stung karen said dad evidently acting on nimbys written advice rolled yon ill wind down his window and addressed the big insects buzzing there i bheld your nice hive er have and blieve you can do something on my bhalf if you care to bfriend me can i bguile you to make the roc bgone and he held out an old nylon comb the bs clustered about the comb this was evidently something new and exciting to them in a moment they picked it up and carried it into their havehive they had accepted the offering then another swarm formed into an arrow and shot up to intercept the roc wheeling above in a moment there was a loud squawk and the bird zoomed away so swiftly as to leave a sonic boom behind karen giggled i guess that salted her tail bnighted mission accomplished sean said that blies our concern about bs he glanced at mom who was known to be nervous about insects of most types dad looped around and made his way back to the troll way i am really getting to appreciate the protection of the beneficial spell on this road he remarked when ever we leave it we get into trouble except for the imps david reminded him except for the imps dad agreed as they resumed speed you know we are now close to the boundary of xanth in a couple of hours well be clear of it and back in the normal realm yet i almost wonder well have to say goodbye to chlorine sean said stricken by the realization and nimby he added not wanting to be too obvious who have helped us as much as the imps did mom added is anybody else thinking what i am dad asked sean was suddenly excited likelike maybe not leaving xanth right now but we have to get home mom protested were late already to school karen said making a wry face to chores david said ґ to work dad said piers anthony to research mom said it occurs to me that though i love my work researching archaic languages there may be a unique chance for similar research here it may have escaped the notice of the rest of you but we are no longer speaking english we are speaking the universal magic lan guage of human xanth just as the pets are speaking the universal animal magic language of animal xanth such an opportunity should perhaps not be passed by sean grinned mom always did have a problem com municating what shes trying to say is shed just as soon stick around here awhile longer yea karen cried clapping her little hands dad glanced at mom when you give a scholarly ra tionale you always have an underlying gut motive what is it surely you arent thrilled with meatier showers or harpy bombs its the imps she confessed they were so nice to us and we may have imposed at the worst time i wish we could help them but we would get caught by the madness sean re minded her though he was as eager as any to remain in xanth mom required careful managing as dad knew it wasnt safe to agree with her too quickly lest she argue the opposite case in an attempt to be quite fair yes yet it seems that all of xanth faces that same threat is it right for us to escape what they cant she was begging to be persuaded what would clinch it sean had an inspiration lets ask the pets before anyone else could speak he addressed the animals what do you guys have to say do you want to stay here in xanth longer all three nodded but that wasnt necessarily enough he needed a good solid argument for turning back what do you know that we dont woof woofer said he tried again woimp something about the imps sean said the ones running the hotel quieta ortant woof yon ill wind ortant hes not what he seems woof something bad woof woof they were zeroing in on it something good woof woof woof hes more than the innkeeper chlorine asked catching on to the mechanism woof a lightbulb flashed above chlorines head i remember now hes the mayor of the village woof the mayor mom exclaimed i had forgotten the most important imp is always the host for guests chlorine said because they feel that hospitality is the most important function of a village i had forgotten too i didnt pay proper attention in centaur school or i would have realized right away but surely the mayor should have been supervising the business of clearing out the village dad said meow david looked at midrange i guess soafter taking care of the visitors yes sean said ortant and quieta were off inthe village when dad and i went down at night they thought we were safe asleep so they were getting back to their business without bothering us about it such courtesy is rare in mundania dad said yet it begs to be returned in kind that did it we must go back mom said decisively can we get there in time dad asked it will be evening and thats when they have to be done nimby chlorine asked nimby nodded and you mom said to chlorine this will be ex tending your job we dont have the right to im happy to chlorine said this has been more fun for me than anything and i like the imps too piers anthony sean was very glad to hear that now he would get more time with chlorinemaybe a lot more time so she could practice whatever she wanted on him like maybe pro gressing beyond the verbal interplay dad slowed the rv getting ready to turn it around i hope we dont regret this he said but he didnt look regretful madness david was glad they were going back this magic world of xanth took some getting used to but he was getting there and it certainly was more inter esting than mundania he knew that eventually hed be back in dreary school but at least hed have a good subject for the how i spent my summer report now they were heading into xanth instead of out of it and the winds were stiffening it was bound to be a long hard drive that made him thirsty as long drives always did he saw a sign apple cola river hey dadhow about stopping to get some of that apple cola to his surprise dad listened maybe dad was thirsty too he pulled to the side everybody get out and get anything done you want because we wont be stopping again soon he said oh that was fair warning they piled out and found assorted bushes then david got a jug and went to dip out all the apple cola he could that was one of the good things about xanth the way things were literal if the sign said apple cola the river was made of it just as that river yon ill wind of blood in the mirrortapestry had been genuine hot led giant blood so copious it flowed for miles in a river down to the sea this river sparkled with its effervescence and sure enough it was appleflavored cola he drank several cups of it before he left so as to keep the jug full he turned to return to the rv and saw a fire a series of small flames was traveling along the ground between him and the others he wasnt worried because they were little enough to step right over but he wondered how they had come about so he paused to look they were ants little red ants fire ants he ex claimed catching on wouldnt you know it sean said i found some block parents he gestured and david saw several stone blocks in the shape of people that figured hey look what i found karen called from the other side laughing flowers they looked but didnt hear any laughing though she stood in a patch of pretty flowers where david asked here she picked a funny red one and brought it to him smell it he smelled itand burst out laughing the curious thing was that he hadnt intended to it just happened whats so funny sean asked suspiciously smell karen said handing him a funny blue flower sean sniffed itand guffawed then looked as sur prised as david felt then he smiled i get it these are scents of humor yeah karen said satisfied woofer came running up woof he said urgently pointing his nose toward the vehicle times up sean said we have to get back in be fore dad takes off without us they hurried back to the rv because dad didnt bluff when he was in a hurry the rv was already starting to move slowly of course mom wouldnt let him actually leave them behind but they got the message and ran the last fifty feet piers anthony did you see what i saw dad asked as they pulled back onto the trollway the flyfishing what is noteworthy about that mom asked she was sitting up front now her normal place when they didnt need special instructions they were frogs with fishing polescasting for flies mom laughed musically and you mean that literally of course of course and do you know what i saw mom asked in turn what did you see dad dutifully inquired a thim bull a thimble a thim bull a thin bull a male bovine in the shape of a thimble dad laughed grazing on pins and needles of course david decided not to try to tell what the kids had seen because it simply wasnt remarkable in this magic land its good to see them enjoying it sean murmured david realized that he was right the parents had been somewhat tight and terse recently but now they were get ting into the spirit of xanth that was an excellent sign david looked around the animals were snoozing karen was fiddling with the deck of cards sean was sneak ing peeks at chlorines legs where her skirt rode up care lessly high chlorine herself was looking out the window but then he saw her eyes flick back and he realized that she knew seanwas looking at her she was showing her legs on purpose now that was really interesting but all this left nothing much for david to do he could play solitairebut he was tired of that so he considered nimby nimby was one pleasantly weird character really a donkeyheaded dragon in the shape of a young man who never spoke so would he nimby turned to face him could nimby read his mind suddenly david wasnt r yon ill wind bored at all this could get really truly superinteresting can you he thought nimby nodded gee but hed better test it what am i thinking of now he imagined a really ugly cartoon face nimby brought out his pad and pencilthey just ap peared from nowhereand drew the ugly face gee again so they didnt have to speak to nimby they could just think their questions to him but maybe it wouldnt be smart to announce that nimby looked questioningly at him because people like to keep secrets david thought loudly like seans looking up under chorines skirt get ting a real charge from her legs but he doesnt want any one else to know and shes letting him do it and she doesn t want him to know so i guess you can pick up on that he paused and nimby nodded but you better not let them know because theyd both be embarrassed to death because theyre both adults or close to it i guess its like that adult conspiracy that stops us kids from say ing words like bleep nobodys supposed to know any thing i guess if you peek into their minds youll see im right nimby paused then nodde looking surprised david was pleased he had taught the man who knew everything something and nimby nodded again david realized that he didnt have to work to project his thoughts nimby could pick them up at conversational level but if he could read everybodys mind so well why did he seem so well innocent nimby wrote a note and handed it to him david read it am aware of what is happening around me but there is so much that i dont think to do it unless guided there are so many thoughts that i usually pay no attention i also have trouble comprehending human mo tivations and emotions david couldnt resist giving some more advice if piers anthony nimby wanted to seek mature human perspectives and mo tives he should peek into dads and moms minds if he wanted hot adolescent thoughts sean was the one for naive childish attitudes karen would do but for a central sensible viewpoint david himself was the best source nimby nodded accepting it but david was really curious about one thing and maybe nimby would give him the answer he could ap preciate why sean wanted to see under chlorines skirt as david himself found that intriguing he really did want to see someones panties but why was chlorine letting him see nimby wrote a note she has not been beautiful long and wishes to ascertain exactly how beauty works and what its limits are so she is practicing on sean who is the closest approach to an ordinary man to which she has current access she believes that what works on him should work somewhat similarly on other men yes it should so it was really a scientific experiment on her part she didnt really care for sean nimby wrote a note scientific he didnt know about science okay david would tell nimby all about mundane science if nimby would tell david exactly what he and chlorine did overnight in their room at the imp hotel she slept i sat up and watched xanth what no mush no adult conspiracy stuff david wasnt sure he believed that chlorine has little romantic interest in a dragon ass a what my natural form she seeks human interaction nimby didnt have to sleep my type doesnt sleep but nimby was in human form now wasnt he as least a little interested in what chlorine looked like with her clothing off david was only twelve years old but hed just love to see chlorine bare naked nude fashioned her present form and mine i can in any yon ill wind event see her natural body at all times as i can those of everyone else this has no novelty for me evidently not but with such powers why did nimby hang around a dull family like them and never speak there is a geis on me to be silent until i have accom plished my mission oh like a knightly oath david could see that still keeping constant company with a beautiful creature like chlorine didnt nimby get even a little curious about what human love and bleep was all about would like to learn about human emotion yes it does intrigue me so far it does not seem very logical well that was because he was analyzing it instead of feeling it he was being like a teacher in school who could make anything deadly dull in an instant kids fell asleep in sex ed class after all in real life people had emotions they cared they got all heated up about some stupid ball game and they really got excited about boygirl business maybe nimby should try that sort of really get into the feel of it lack the emotion of the human kind how can i ex perience the feelings humans do well he might try tracking davids own emotion for a while david would do his best to feel things strongly so nimby could get the idea thank you i shall do that now ill think through science david thought the way i see it its the mundane way of doing what you folk in xanth do by magic maybe theyre the same in the end just different ways do you know what a lever is and so they communed as the rv zoomed on and karen played her cards and sean and chlorine played their little games of show and look somewhere along there it began to rain at first david thought he was imagining it but then he was sure the rain was colored red green blue and yellow drops struck the windows was this normal yes for xanth this storm is raining heavily ahead so r plersanthony that by the time we reach the next river it will be flooded the trolls are about to shut down the trollway as unsafe but we have to get to imp erial today to help them move their stuff will be able to guide you safely there if you ask me well sure do that david said aloud forgetting him self karen looked up from her cards do what nimby says were headed into a bad storm and the river will flood and the trolls will shut down the high way we cant afford to get detoured now dad said we have to go on through nimby can show us how david said if this is a magic storm he may have to dad replied grimly the rain intensified exactly as nimby had written dad slowed he had to nimby wrote a note stop here the road was not flooded but dad obeyed nimby got out assumed his dragon form and trundled into the rain he will return im sure chlorine said and in a moment nimby did clenched in his donkey jaws was a branch with leaves and several fat bright cher ries cherries karen exclaimed happily reaching for them but nimby held them away shaking his head those look like cherry bombs chlorine said only theyre bigger and fresher and clearer than any ive seen before id better hold them she took the branch and held it carefully while nimby reverted to his human form and got back into the rv he was of course soaking wet so mom came back and bustled him into the lavatory for another change of clothing mom just couldnt help moth ering folk cherry bombs grow on trees david asked as the vehicle started moving again everything grows on trees chlorine said except yon ill wind people and sometimes they do too she sat down and her extreme care with the cherries caused her to forget how her clothing was positioned twigs of the branch snagged on both blouse and skirt david saw sean swallow but these must be a special variety why cant i eat a cherry karen asked rebelliously she got that way when balked because theyre cherry bombs stupid david in formed her they go boom he felt enormously supe rior boom yes they explode when dropped or thrown chlorine said she managed to unsnag her skirt and then her blouse the material fell back into place covering what it was sup posed o david heard sean resume breathing that exposure had really been by accident actually it had been a pretty good view david had begun to get interested in such things only in the last few months and suspected he would be more interested in the next few months chlorines body was fascinating but so was the notion of cherry bombs growing on trees does anything else do that he asked i mean explode certainly pineapples for instance theyre more dan gerous than cherries because theyre larger nimby emerged dressed in more of seans clothes but it seemed sean didnt care he was too busy watching to see if any more twigs snagged anything exactly what variety of cherry bombs are these chlorine asked him nimby wrote a note no one else seemed to notice how his pad and pencil appeared from nothing when he needed them and disappeared similarly when he didnt he handed the note to david these are new clear cherry bombs he read aloud much more powerful than the regular kind we will need them for the river nuclear cherry bombs sean exclaimed ill bet theyre powerful piers anthony then david noticed a ps to the note when you saw inside chlorines blousewas that emotion david smiled yes it was of a sort but to fathom the full effect of it nimby should have peeked into seans mind because if david got slightly warm sean would be a furnace and considering nimbys apparent age he should be reacting like sean nimby sat in a vacant seat david was pleased to see that he was now looking at chlorine in much the way sean was surreptitiously but persistently he was learning uhoh dad muttered in an ominous tone david peered ahead there was a barricade with a sign detour a troll stood by it wearing a glowing helmet dad drew up to the troll where does the detour go he asked back to the tall hassle grove which is safer during the storm but we have to get to imp erial before nightfall dad protested the trollway may be impassable there is flooding making it unsafe suppose we are willing to risk it the troll stared dourly at him you may proceed at your own risk we will not be responsible for your safety but the road remains enchanted we cant be attacked on it the path remains enchanted but water goes where it will the flood could cause you mischief regardless of the enchantment understood well proceed fool the troll muttered and stood aside youre probably right dad agreed driving forward david looked out whats that building shaped like a huge bottle chlorine looked oh thats a whinery sean laughed a winery shaped like a bottle it fig ures yon ill wind meanwhile the rv was forging through increasingly tempestuous rain colored fluid streamed across the win dows and splashed up in fleeting rainbow patterns mist from it drifted in the open slits of the almostclosed win dows then some of that water seemed to get into davids eyes for they were flowing he was cryingand he didnt know why he looked blearily around and saw tears in the eyes of all of them except nimby even dad was blowing his nose what was going on did we just drive through an onion field karen asked tearfully i see a sign mom said it says we are coming to the crimea river cry me a river chlorine repeated that explains it the whinery must use that water for its whine but we must have crossed it on the way up why didnt we cry then it wasnt flooding then dad replied i saw the wa ter passing low under the bridge we were past it before we got a whiff of it the vehicle slowed again david saw why they had reached the flood tearcolored water surged across the road it looked too deep and swift to drive through i dont understand how this flooded so deeply so quickly dad said there was ample clearance below the bridge it has been raining but there has not been time to raise the water level twenty feet nimby wrote a note he gave it to david who read it to the others nimby says the goblins have dammed the river just off the enchanted rightofway thats why it backed up so fast goblins i should have known do we have any way to handle this nimby wrote another note thiss why i fetched the new clear cherry bombs david read they will de stroy the dam so the water will newly clear the road piers anthony but wont the goblins attack us when we go there mom asked worriedly not if we remain within the enchanted path and float the cherries down to the dam david read but the cherries might go right over the dam before they explode sean said well have to use a rope to put them in place lets get to it dad said at that point the rain eased becoming only a light windy drizzle dad mom nimby chlorine and sean got out you kids stay put sean called back insultingly they sat in the open doorway in the side of the rv and watched the adults depart colored mists were rising from the landscape making a pretty vertical pattern there was the cheerful clangor of a bell hey i want to see that karen exclaimed jumping out of the rv it sounds like a cowbell hey were not supposed to go anywhere david re minded her its dangerous on the enchanted path pooh she ran on back along the road following the music of the bell she liked bells and just had to see any that she heard tweeter was perched on her hair chirping wamingly but she ignored him david was torn between running after her and staying put he compromised go after her woofer and make sure shes safe woof the dog agreed and bounded out then david heard the beat of a drum it was a powerful throbbing sound that seemed to penetrate to the very center of his head what kind of drum was making it david liked drums because they made a lot of noise with little effort before he knew it david was walking toward the sound but midrange ran after him meow the cat screeched wamingly that jolted david back into responsibility he was doing the same thing karen was running after the first intriguing sound that was dangerous because it was coming from yon ill wind the side off the enchanted path so he stopped but he did pause long enough to peer in the direction of the sound hoping to see the drum from here he was successful it was in the shape of a huge ear it was an ear drum no wonder it had such power over his own ears he picked midrange up and walked slowly back to the rv he hoped karen wouldnt go off the enchanted path but she was a child her judgment wasnt good the bell rang again surely she had seen it by now and should have returned where was she finally he could stand it no longer i gotta find her he said midrange you stay here and tell the folks where i am if they come back before we do the cat nodded and stretched out on the floor by the door david ran in the direction of the bell soon he found it a cow with a clapper ringing as it walked a cow bell what else but karen wasnt there she must have gone on beyond foolish girl he spied a big orange apelike creature wearing a placard saying utan was it dangerous this thing looked so com ical that maybe it was harmless hey utanhave you seen my stupid little sister he asked it the thing paused then pointed the way david was go ing so david ran on only after he was well beyond the creature did he realize what it must be an orange utan he saw a cat hey i told you to stay in the rv he cried advancing on it the cat turned its face toward him then david realized that it wasnt midrange it was a strange catvery strange it wore a flatbrimmed hat and a vest with the word ion on front ohsorry david said embarrassed i thought you were my cat the cat stared witheringly at him and stalked off then david realized its nature it was a cation probably headed for a catamount or catboat he must be going to get pos itively charged before he lynx up with friends david muttered as he went on this business of punning was infectious piers anthony there was still no sign of karen he was very much afraid she had wandered off the enchanted path should he go and tell mom that would surely get him in trouble for ever letting karen get in trouble though something came flying though the air david ducked afraid it was going to hit him but it sailed on by he got a good glimpse of it as it passed it looked like a painting then another flew by and a third what was going on but a moments thought brought the answer art illery he said someones hurling art at me kaaren he called kaarenn there was no answer not even a woof this was not a good sign he continued searching but karen was nowhere he could see that meant she must have gone off the en chanted path which meant in turn that he couldnt wait any longer he had to get help in a hurry he turned and ran back to the rv halfafraid he would discover it gone but it remained as solid and reassuring as ever midrange remained on guard anyone come back he asked the cat and received a shake of the head well at least that meant he would be able to report his disaster himself instead of seeming to be caught like a fleeing rat for whatever slight good that might do him where are the others he asked midrange got up and came to him david picked him up and set him on his shoulder his normal riding position meove llefft david bore left following the course of the flooded river now that he was closer to it his eyes were tearing he couldnt stop them so he just kept blinking to clear his vision soon he came to mom who was watching sean tie a framework fashioned of driftwood together mom was holding the cherry branch somewhat nervously and tears were streaming down her face his own eyes had been flowing but he had ignored it after the first few minutes beyond them the rushing river had pooled into a small lake with what looked like a dam fashioned from brush and junk yon ill wind david hesitated to give her his news she might drop the branch so he sort of slid by it mom theres a prob lem wheres dad it didnt work what problem she demanded sharply turning her swollen eyes on him david wiped his eyes on his sleeve i ah karen went out and out alone her voice was getting shrill that was not a good sign woofer and tweeter went with her jim she called imperatively there was no answer but then chlorine and nimby appeared hes spying on the goblins chlorine reported through her bleary visage her eyes looked as if they were trying to cry but not succeeding so they were turning red instead it probably felt like dry heaves if he calls theyll know hes there can we take a message mom considered no maybe you can help another way karen is lost could you find her oh sure nimby will know where she is she turned to nimby who alone had no trouble with his eyes shes all right nimby nodded then lets get there in a hurry you turn dragon and ill run along behind you she knows what we look like so she wont be frightened nimby became the weird dragon and they ran off in karens direction mom turned to david you let her go there was ice in her tone despite the tears in her eyes he wondered whether tier tears were freezing into sleet as they fell she wouldnt stop for me mom he pleaded tear fully she heard this cow bell and she just went mom nodded that is the way she is she agreed sniffing then she smiled tightly so she wasnt blaming him nevertheless david felt guilty david i dont want to go anywhere while im guard ing the cherries mom said in a moment would you piers anthony go carefully and see if you can see what your father is doing sure he walked in the direction chlorine and nimby had come from soon he saw dadsurrounded by ugly little manlike creatures with big heads and big feet gob lins they had spied him and he was probably off the enchanted path because they were closing in purposefully dad david cried watch out but it was too late the goblins burst across the last little distance and swarmed all over dad he tried to fight them off but he was a physics prof not a warrior and they were many in a moment they had him helpless david knew he had to do something but he didnt know what the goblins were carrying dad away there were too many of them for anyone to fight dad should never have gone beyond the limit of the enchanted path just as karen shouldnt have did the goblins have her too nimby could have warned himbut nimby was off fetch ing karen because david hadnt stopped her from leaving the rv mom sean he cried running back theyve got dad oh mom exclaimed looking faint one chance sean said grimly as he blinked away his tears this notations too slow give me the bombs mom handed the branch of cherries to him her eyes were staring as well as tearing david had never seen her so distraught see if you can distract the goblins from me sean said he walked purposefully toward the dam from you not from dad right do it sean seemed to know what he was doing so david did his best he started running and screaming and waving his arms hey goblins he cried you cant catch meeee david dad called spying him dispite his own dis yon ill wind tress parents were like that get back on the enchanted path but david didnt he was terrified but he had to distract the goblins and this was the only way he knew how so he made an adult conspiracy gesture at them and ran on it probably looked like a mere bleep to them but it did stir them up they charged after him unfortunately goblins turned out to be swifter runners than he had figured they could run faster than he could he dodged and ducked but soon they caught up and laid their grubby hands on him instead of rescuing dad he had gotten himself caught some help he had been what possessed you to do that dad demanded as the goblins hauled them together silence morsels the goblin chief cried wiping his eyes or well cook you slow instead of fast cook them suddenly david realized just how awful a fate they faced all because he had let karen get loose then had taken nimby away from helping dad so that dad got caught by the goblins david deserved to be cooked there was a deafening boom behind them followed by a great rushing sound the dam a goblin screamed the dam went sean had blown the dam he must have gotten close while the goblins were distracted and thrown the cherry branch on it now the water was bursting out and down and the goblins were below it the great frothing surge of it was already bearing down on them they let man and boy go and fled run for the road son dad cried for sure they ran together through the flying froth while the goblins ran the opposite way fleeing the water the goblins werent being smart they had panicked or maybe the water represented more of a danger to them because they were so much shorter than human beings that was fine with david they made it to the enchanted section the water level was dropping the river seemed to be chasing after the piers anthony goblins maybe it was getting back at them for damming it david hoped they all drowned mom was waiting where she had been only now the water had receded and her tears were slowing dad ran up to her and embraced her it had been one close call then mom thought of something else wheres sean he mustve been caught by the water when the dam blew david said horrified he just wanted to get that dam so as to save you dad oh no dad looked down to where the scattered remnants of the dam lay there was no sign of sean jim mom said in that tone ill find him dad said he ran backtoward the dam then david saw chlorine karen wont come with us she said her eyes still red but dry shewhat hap pened here she stared at the diminished water aston ished sean blew thedam david said but now we dont know where he is oh hes all right chlorine said nimby gave me a message to say to you that sean is on his way i didnt know what it meant he must have been washed away by the water david said so now he has to make his way back from wherever he got washed to but hes okay that must be it mom agreed evidently relieved now whats this business with karen shes been deceived by wraiths chlorine explained now she thinks were wraiths and she wont come with us nimby doesnt know what to do because he doesnt really understand minds just things we must go to her immediately mom said freshly alarmed i think id better wait here for sean dad said he may be physically sound but hell need a familiar face to orient on yon ill wind but im not sure youre physically sound mom pro tested those goblins didnt hurt me dad said mom turned to nimby true nimby shook his head thats what i thought mom said severely you must be bruised and bitten all over let me see dad hesitated and david realized that dad probably was battered but didnt want the children to know ill go fetch karen he said she knows me too its my fault she got lost it wasnt your fault mom said and he was glad to be officially exonerated again but thank you for help ing lets go david said indeed nimby knowing his mind was already starting to move and chlorine with him the landscape became weird even compared to what it had been the trees seemed to be growing sideways or even upside down and there were blobs of water floating haphazardly but in a moment he realized that they were moving toward the three people what are those puddles doing out of their beds david asked ducking to avoid one that came too close nimbys pad and pencil appeared he wrote a note chlorine took it and read it ponds come pond scum david asked making a face unfortu nately the face detached from his head and floated away distorting grotesquely he clapped his hands to the front of his head and found that his regular face was still there it was only a copy that was drifting away ponds come to us she said carefully i think theyre getting confused as the magic dust increases we may all suffer from its madness as we get farther into the storm i think im suffering from it now david said as the face copy collided with a pond and made a splash they encountered a man whose face was odd in another way the lower part of it was transparent david could see piers anthony his tongue and teeth inside and they were also transparent the man never paused to greet them he hurried on to wherever he was going that man had a glass jaw chlorine said surprised i never saw one before neither had david but there were stranger things ahead one of the floating ponds had settled into a glade and there were creatures in and by it facing away from him one had the head and arms of a human being the forelegs and torso of a horse and the tail of a fish another had the head of a person the wings of a vulture and the body of a serpent david knew he shouldnt pause but his curiosity over came him say if its okay to askwhat are you he called to the two creatures both turned to face him presenting full pairs of breasts we are doublecrossbreeds the one with the fishtail said i am a cenmaid centaurmermaid for long my friends a harga or harpynaga butbutim a child david said stupidly staring at their fronts im not supposed to see stuff like that which was just exactly what he hadnt wanted to say the madness had fouled him up the two lovely faces smiled dont be concerned the harga said we are merely dreams brought to you by our friend the cenmare a centaurnight mare crossbreed bye both waved and vanished david stared at the space they had vacated diddid you see that he asked chlorine see what she asked so it was true he had dreamed of those strange cross breeds well at least it meant he would not be in trouble for violating that adult conspiracy but he wished he could have seen more of those creatures before they van ished they reappeared you do the cenmaid inquired in haling yon ill wind gee david said can you be my dreams any time i want certainly while the madness lasts the harga replied brushing out her hair and feathers just desire to see us i will he promised but right now i have to go rescue my little sister you had better hurry the cenmaid said shes about to get in trouble the creatures faded david wasnt sure how much he should trust dreams but he took the advice to heart can we hurry he asked breaking into a run certainly chlorine agreed pacing him say its nice being healthy i couldnt keep this up in my natural state david glanced at her you would drive sean crazy if he saw yon running really i must be sure to run for him they found karen perched in a fork of an enormous tree the trees leaves looked like swatches of cloth and its twigs looked like pins and needles its trunk seemed to be made of overlaying patches she must be all right chlorine said thats a tree mendous i can see its very big david said but she could still be in trouble no a treemendous mends anyone who climbs into it chlorine explained theres one not far from my home village she chose the right tree to get into but she wont be safe much longer hesaid remem bering the dreamcreatures warning how can you know that chlorine asked but then she saw nimbys nod i guess you do know though but she wouldnt come for us she thought we were wraiths whats a wraith david asked an apparition usually of a living person but wraiths arent real they may just lead someone into mischief be cause the victim thinks the person is real and means well while the wraith doesnt mean well usually we dont see piers anthony many wraiths but the madness must be giving them more power david had learned enough about xanth to be cautious things werent always what they appeared to be suppose this wasnt karen but a wraith trying to fool him into thinking he was saving her he had seen a scary movie once about a child who got stolen by a vampire or some thing who had left an animated doll in her place and the parents never knew she was gone the only way to tell the difference was that the doll had perfect manners try calling her he said chlorine did karen karen its chlorine please come with us get away from me karen screamed climbing higher in the tree youre just another fake at least she had the wits to realize she was being fooled chlorine murmured but now she cant tell when shes not being fooled i can fix that david said he approached the tree karen get down from there before mom catches you and grounds you for a week you stupid little snot david she cried gladly she came down so fast she almost tumbled she leaped for him and plastered a sloppy kiss on his cheek stop slobbering on me you brat he said weve got to get back to mom in a hurry yes brother dear she said then she aimed a kick at his shin but he got his leg out of the way in time he knew her ways as she knew his sean blew the dam and got washed away he said but nimby says hes okay but theres danger coming here so weve got to move are these really chlorine and nimby she asked chlorine was trying to make me go into a dark cave i heard something big breathing in there i grabbed her hand and there wasnt any thats when i freaked out well grab her hand now he said she hesitated but chlorine extended her hand so karen yon ill wind took it her face lighted when she found that the hand was solid im sorry i doubted youif it was you last time she said it was me last time chlorine agreed but you did the right thing waiting until you were sure but how were you sure it was david and not another wraith the wraiths seemed nice she said davids never nice unless he has to be suddenly david stopped the pets he exclaimed woofer and tweeter were with you where are they i sent them to fetch you karen said isnt that how you found me no they never reached us they stared at each other horrified catatonic midrange stretched and stood as he saw david re turn karen was with him so that had worked out but where were woofer and tweeter david rushed up to him midrange weve got a prob lem nimby says sean will be back here in twenty minutes and theyll have to take off then or the madness will make it impossible to reach imp erial tonight so well have to go but nimby cant tell where the other pets are because something is hiding them there are phantoms of hundreds of dogs and birds looking just like them and nimby can see them all but he cant tell which ones are the right ones not without going to them and that would take too long because the chances of finding the right ones in time are too small but he says he can rescue them if he knows piers anthony which ones they are he found two pieces of reverse wooddo you know what that is well neither do i but he thinks it will help if we can find them in time do you think you could find them midrange was insulted of course he could find them if he chose to it was just a matter of sniffing them out but i gotta tell you david rushed on if you look for them and get lost yourself then well have to go with out you too and nimby thinks theres danger because whatever is making all those phantom dogs and birds must be trying to hide them from us and it will try to stop you from reaching themor it will try to capture you too so if you dont want to do it midrange knew that if he didnt do it david would think it was because he lacked courage he didnt care for that indignity so he would rescue the mutt and bird he had known them for some time after all he got ready to sniff them out but nimby does have a way to help youby doing the same thing back to it that its doing to us making copies he found some catatonic you can take thatll make you spin off hundreds of copies of yourself youll be a real copycat then the thing wont know which one is the real you and you should be able to get through without getting caught yourself we think woofer and tweeter are caught in a cave because the wraiths were trying to get karen to go into a cave and if she had shed probably also be caught now so maybe look for a caveand watch out if you can find them within fifteen minutes even if you do get caught yourself nimby can come and rescue you in his dragon form he thinks theres nothing around here that can handle a dragon that size then hell bring you back and well catch the rv and get on our way okay midrange nodded this was a challenge worthy of his feline mettle okay heres the tonic david said giving him a cap sule with awfulcolored ick sloshing inside it each time yon ill wind you make a sudden move another copy will spin off and look and act just like you but its really illusion itll go seek oneof the dog or bird illusions and when they meet the two will go poof canceling each other out under stand midrange nodded he took the ugly capsule in his mouth and swallowed it the thing was weird but not incapaci tating then he bounded off sniffing the air for woofers canine doggy scent he couldnt sniff out a trail as well as woofer could but he could do well enough there was also tweeters smell good enough to eat that would help it might take him a few minutes to orient but he would get them he bounded in the direction he had last seen woofer that trail was still fresh as it had been only an hour or so he could see the dogs claw marks in the ground and smell the canine odor not only was it doggy it was spe cifically woofer no problem there but what about tweeter the bird had been riding on karens head so the scent was very faint and overridden by karens much stronger human traces but that should improve when tweeter left his associate and went with woofer each of them had a pet human child they had settled on that long ago to make sure no child felt ne glected because children were generally more fun than adult humans they were more active got into more mis chief and spent more time in the dirt so tweeters pet was karen the smallest going to the smallest midrange had david in the middle and woofer tried to keepsean out of trouble if woofer had been with sean sean prob ably wouldnt have gotten swept away by the dam burst then he had muffed the rescue of karen woofer just wasnt the most competent dog extant but of course no dog was really smart that was why cats existed there needed to be a gifted animal in every family to keep it functional but when a family scattered to different locales it was hard to keep up with all its parts that was why there was so much trouble now humans were incredibly piers anthony dense about the need to remain close enough together for proper supervision it was time to test the phantom cat phenomenon mid range jerked to the sideand an image of himself fis sioned off and bounded straight ahead it made no sound and had no odor but it did look solid and it ran well it even maneuvered around a tree it would do to fool the dull senses of a human observer maybe even an animal observer from a distance he jerked again and another nondescript cat peeled off running in the direction he had been going so he could steer them in any direction good enough suddenly he saw a dog woofer he bounded toward the caninethen realized there was no smell this was a clone one of the phantom dogs put out to confuse the issue so midrange jerked aside sending a clone cat ahead to intercept the thing he hid behind a rock to watch the encounter this just might be interesting the clone cat leaped right into the phantom dogand both vanished in a puff of nothing the two illusions had destroyed each other exactly as they were supposed to very well he would send more cats after more dogs the more phantom dogs he eliminated the easier it would be to locate the real one he jerked and dodged frantically sending clones bounding off in all directions a veritable horde then he resumed the sniffing of woofers trail he saw a bird tweeter but even as he spied it so did a clone the phantom cat leaped catching the bird in his mouthand disappeared two more images had canceled each other out it served the cat clone right midrange thought the point was to rescue tweeter not to consume him birds were fair prey but tweeter was a friend friends did not eat friends he came to a large tree with funny leaves the smells of animal bird and child were strong here so this was where karen had fled the phantoms so it should be pos yon ill wind sible to follow her trail back to the cave she had not en tered but would that be the one where woofer was surely the dog couldnt be that stupid to enter the same cave they had avoided before so that was probably not the one there just wasnt time to check every prospect five minutes were already gone so midrange sniffed out woofers fresher scent going in another direction now tweeters smell joined it still faint but clearer than before because he had been flying beside the dog low to the ground every so often he perched on a stalk or twig and the scent became complete at those places this was a much easier trail to follow but midrange did not forget caution the hound and bird had walked blithely into some kind of trap and the cat was not eager to walk into the same trap so once he was sure of the trail he left it looping around slinking behind rocks and brush and trees as if stalking prey every so often he let fly another clone to further confuse any possible watcher then he would sneak up on the trail and verify it in passing as if not noticing it it would be hard for any observer to tell exactly what he was up to he came to a deep crevice the trail came to the brink and followed along it presumably the dog had found a place to cross it the thing was too wide to jump so how was midrange to cross it without slavishly following the exact route of the hound which he didnt want to do because that might be right where the trap had sprung he sniffed around and found some flowers what good were flowers so he went on then something snarled at him from the brush midrange leaped onto the nearest tree trunk he looked down and saw that it was only a little doglike creature what are you he demanded annoyed because he had been affrighted while offguard im a snarl the little canine growled cant you tell pussy this creature was not endearing himself for reasons he didnt care to go into midrange did not like to be called piers anthony pussy especially in that tone no i cant tell you look more like a yelp to me he retorted where did you come froma sick tangle tree not quite i was brushed out of a girls hair but she dropped me and left before i could adopt her as a pet im not pleased thats why i remain in a snarl he glanced at midrange i dont suppose youre looking for a pro prietor midrange opened his mouth to say something truly catty but caught himself this creature just might be use ful it obviously wasnt a phantom i may be looking for a companion he said carefully if hes useful useful im looking for a big dog and a small bird have you seen any such actually i did about two barks ago they were fol lowing a wraith bleep a wraith what the humans have this stupid adult conspiracy that forbids them to say the name of a female dog in the pres ence of a child since i derive from the snarled hair of a child i too am bound by it idiotic i know but there it is oh you did see them which way did they go that way the snarl pointed his pug nose the wraith was one extremely fetching bleep i must say if shed been of my species i would have followed her too she even smelled right the bird protested but couldnt stop him which seemed to be one difference between a wraith and a phantom the wraiths could emulate creatures com pletely except for their solidity so woofer the big male idiot had followed her and tweeter had had to go along lest they be separated midrange decided to trust snarl a bit mainly because it might help him get on with his mission i need to cross this cleft but i cant see a way do you know a way yon ill wind certainly just use one of those daisies there the nose pointed at the flowers what good are they theyre upsydaisies they grow into ladders to help you up if you pick them and invoke them by saying their name well now midrange went to the flowers and picked one he carried it to the edge of the crack and set it down upsydaisy he said the flower expanded its petals became spokes they formed into a growing ladder it was just long enough to bridge the chasm help me put this across midrange said i shall snarl took part of the ladder in his teeth and midrange pawed at the end and they managed to swing it awkwardly around until it fell across the gap then they walked somewhat gingerly across the rungs midrange of course had excellent feline balance but snarl didnt he almost fell but fortunately his legs poked through inside the ladder and he was able to scramble back up they started walking along the far side in the direction woofer had gone let me know if you pick up the trail midrange said he could pick it up himself but wanted to see whether the animal was playing straight with him one of the smarter qualities of cats of the multitude of good ones was not to trust anyone too readily every so often midrange flung off another clone cat though nobody seemed to be spying on them thats a nice magic talent you have snari said admiringly mid range didnt bother to clarify how he had come by it the little canine had no need to know soon they came toa narrowing of the chasm and sure enough the trail resumed there got it snarl said good enough the canine was playing it straight lets loop around and intercept it farther along midrange said not explaining why snarl agreed he seemed to be quite companionable now that he had a companion he proba bly would have made that little girl a good associate t piers anthony then midrange thought of something im new to xanth he confessed from mundania actually how is it that we animals learned to talk everyone talks in xanth snarl explained because of the magic and the magics getting much stronger now for some reason because of the storm blowing magic dust in mid range said but soon it will be too strong and there will be madness you have learned a lot snarl said admiringly not enough we animals always could understand most of what the human beings were saying and we un derstood each other in a general way but since coming into xanth we have all grown much smarter and now we can talk fluently with each other and with other creatures we couldnt do that before its because of the xanth common languages snarl said i have heard though it surely isnt true that in mundania humans speak all different languages and cant understand each other at all the same must be true for animals and plants in xanth all humans speak the human language and all animals of a certain type speak their own language that is all mammals have one language and all reptiles have one and all insects have one and so on there are dialects so that the way i speak isnt quite the same as you and wed both have trouble with a unicorn and centaurs dont even bother with mammalian they pre fer to speak human it has nuances that others dont be cause humans are always talking you surely had trouble understanding the bird i did midrange agreed if i hadnt known him well he would have been unintelligible so it was because he spoke avian yes insects are harder yet and plantsits not worth bothering dragons arent too bad though they have a bar barous accent but its not safe to get close to a dragon anyway this was very interesting it clarified what had been hap yon ill wind pening to them but this business about dragonsare there many dragons around theyre all over firebreathers smokers and steam ers winged land and water big larger and huge theyre always hungry theyre sort of the top of the food chain best thing is to stay away from them so midrange had already gathered but now they had to stop talking because they were coming to a cave the trail entered it he even caught the faint perfume of the bleep who had lured woofer in thanks to snarls help it had taken him only another five minutes now he had five more minutes to assess the situation and summon nimby is there another way into this cave he asked the dog probably ill sniff out one the little canine circled to the right sniffing so midrange circled to the left soon he found a wind ing aperture just about right for slinking through so he slunk through it it was dark inside but he was comfortable with that it was another of the myriad ways in which cats were superior to other creatures he sniffed and smelled woofer that helped him nav igate the various side crevices coming ever closer without going directly there because there still could be more trouble than he wanted if he got discovered then he heard a yip that was snarl the dog must have entered by another passage why had he given himself away midrange slunk closer until he could see into the central chamber there were woofer and tweeter just lying and perching there they werent even trying to escape though nothing held them snarl slunk in to join them his tail between his legs he was definitely unhappy but he was obeying someone yet there was no one there just a pile of metallic junk in the center of the cave faintly glowing then snarl spoke i did not come alone there is a cat who is coming to rescue the other dog and bird piers anthony why the little traitor he was blabbing the mission had midrange trusted a spy the cat is coming in another way snarl said in fact he is crouching behind you that did it midrange leaped up tiger fashion woofer tweeter get out of here he cried ill pounce on it something swiveled around to face him it was a tv screen with icons on it one picture expanded a cat going splat against an invisible wall in midair splat midrange suited action to picture and fell to the floor in a heap outraged he gathered himself together for another pounce but a picture appeared on the screen showing a cat wading through supersticky dense glue and he found he could move only excruciatingly slowly a picture of a dog talking appeared with that woofer began to speak this is a machine called sending who was originally a program animating magician grey mur phys mundane computer he helped grey and princess ivy go to xanth provided they took him along now he is scheming to conquer xanth this will take timea few thousand yearsbut he is patient he is in the process of assembling a group of creatures and things to do his bid ding the recent influx of magic dust has enabled him to act more strongly thus he was able to lure me into his cave though he failed with karen thats all right hell get her and the other humans when the magic intensifies enough but how does he do it midrange asked sending has the power to change reality in his im mediate vicinity woofer said just as his sire corn pewter does pewter prints whatever he wishes reality to be and it is then true near him only sending works better with icons which he expands into pictures when he wants to invoke them so he has made us captive by luring us into his ambiance then invoking magic icons to control us it is not possible to oppose his will because he defines will here yon ill wind thats why i had to blab about your mission snarl said the icon made me im sorry now that midrange had been snared by sending he un derstood how it was you had no choice he said but he realized that he midrange had better exert some choice because otherwise the wicked machine could force him to blab about nimby coming to the rescue he had to distract sending a few more minutes maybe the machine was subject to flattery i thought i would find woofer and tweeter and rescue them i guess i was pretty fool ish an icon expanded into a picture of a clown laughing sending thought it was very funny but instead i just got caught myself he continued but im curious about one thing how did you get those wraiths to help you by luring folk into your cave they were running far beyond your ambiance midrange was sure of that because otherwise sending would simply have changed reality for miles around and made all creatures and people serve him the talking dog picture appeared again he explained that to us while we waited for others to try to rescue you and thus to fall into his power woofer said he made a deal with the wraiths that if they helped him achieve power he would enable them to achieve solid form again they are eager to gain some substance so they cooper ate substance midrange asked how is that possi ble it is our substance they will be given woofer said sadly the wraiths will inhabit us and take over our bod ies and minds but this is barbaric midrange protested the laughing clown appeared on the screen then there was a sound outside a wraith hurried in a damsel and a dragon it cried silently shes lovely but it has a donkey head it forged right to this cave theyre coming in piers anthony the screen faced midrange a picture of a cat talking appeared suddenly midrange was compelled to tell all he knew it is chlorine and the dragon ass called nimby he blabbed they are coming to nullify you and rescue us i have been stalling to give them time to get here unob served they have two pieces of reverse wood the screen flickered violently evidently the mention of reverse wood bothered the machine then the image of a door slamming closed appeared too late a wooden ball rolled into the cave and came to rest before the screen a picture showed dogs cat and bird hastily shoving the ball out of the cave but before they could act the ball fell into two parts and sendings screen went dim lets get out of here before he recovers midrange said the four of them freed from the machines power charged out of the cave there was the striped dragon with the lovely young woman she was still leaning forward evidently just having rolled the ball into the cave hi fellows she said brightly the two pieces of reverse wood nullified each other but when they fell apart they nullified send ing hell be helpless until that wood gets moved out of his cavewhich will be hard to do now we must hurry because the moving house is about to start moving they hurried all of them ran following the dragon who knew where they were going snarl came along too they made it to the road panting there was the rv just starting to move the water had all drained away leav ing the surface drivable they dont see us chlorine gasped nimby snapped up a piece of wood held it between his donkey teeth lifted his head and gave what sounded like a whistle in ducktalk it was an awful noise but it worked the vehicle slowed nimbyyou can talk chlorine cried as they raced up to it but the dragon shook his head and midrange yon ill wind knew why he had made a sound but it wasnt talking the whistle had been artificial because of air blown past the piece of wood and meaningless except in the sense that it signaled the whistlers presence it was just noise not talk chlorine realized that after twothirds of a moment you made it but it wasnt you i should have realized she smiled so im not a whistlers mother ill survive they got there and nimby changed back to his man form woofer and tweeter scrambled into the rv and chlorine followed but midrange paused what about you snarl he asked the dog snarl hesitated nobody here needs a companion he asked plaintively the dog had helped midrange accomplish his mission in time generosity was not really midranges forte but there was an implied deal companionship for help get on in he told the dog well figure something out nimby had paused now he picked up snarl whose legs were too short to navigate the steep step up and set him on the floor inside then midrange bounded in and nimby came last you did it david cried picking midrange up and hugging him you rescued them i knew you could cause youre my cat disgusting display of sentiment but somehow midrange wasnt entirely displeased he extricated himself after a moment he had indeed done the job though perhaps some small credit should be given to the catatonic medicine and to snarl and to nimby also the rv was moving gathering speed snarl was in chlorines lap peering out a window fascinated by this magic vehicle suddenly he barked its her what now midrange looked out there was a discon solate darkhaired girl walking by the edge of the road she seemed to be looking for something who is her midrange asked the dog piers anthony my ideal companion the girl whose hair formed me maybe shes looking for me midrange wasnt sure about that but it was worth a try he ran up to the front where jimdad was driving meop he said in as plain human as he could muster jimdad looked at him you want me to pick up that girl we dont have room for mneo midrange said meust meop he wished his cat tongue could form the clumsy human words better he was trying to say nojust stop jimdad sighed and braked the vehicle he came to a stop by the girl who paused to stare at the rv in aston ishment obviously she had never seen a monster like this before but at least she wasnt running away from it snarl leaped to the floor and charged for the front his stubby legs slipping on the unfamiliar surface he arrived just as the girl was answering jimdads question im ursa im just looking for my dog i was distracted and lost him and i cant find him anywhere im afraid hell be hurt by the madness if i dont find him and take him home quickly have you seen then snarl launched himself out the door ursa saw him and plucked him out of midair snarl youre here youre safe she hugged him joyfully and his stubby little tail wagged ferociously so snarl would not be traveling farther with them he had found his ideal companion midrange looked out the window as the rv resumed motion the girl waved and snarl barked then they were gone karen wiped away a tear and midranges own eyes were wet but of course that was because of the lingering effect of the crimea river after that the drive became boring jimdad was driv ing fast trying to get where he was going before the mad ness made it impossible there was no other traffic on the road which helped but still it wasnt the safest mode of travel the children were settling down to normal fidget ing while sean was oddly subdued as if he had suffered yon ill wind some great forgotten adventure of his own midrange tuned all of it out and catnapped he woke when the rv swerved no wonder the flying dragons were back they were swooping down to strafe the vehicle and jimdad was trying to dodge their reach ing flames but a flame caught it anywayand did no harm illusions jimdad said disgusted trying to trick me into swerving off the road because its still enchanted and they cant really attack us here after aat he drove straight ahead even when a dragon came right down to smash into the windshield and there was nothing midrange sat up and watched because this was getting interesting suppose one of those dragons turned out to be real and jimdad didnt dodge it if maybe there were a flaw in the enchantment letting one monster through but soon the phantom dragons gave up probably because it was no fun when the vehicle wouldnt be bluffed then there was a sign junk shun what do you sup pose that means jimdad asked rhetorically i dont remember it from before it soon turned out to be a crossroads where there was a huge pile of garbage refuse and junk was it realor more illusion a lot of that junk was in the middle of the road the vehicle could suffer damage if it plowed into it at speed delay is disaster jimdad muttered and maintained speed he won they passed through the junk without con tact after that there were various weird images in the sky and on the ground at times it looked as if the sky was solid with mountains growing on it while the land was gaseous with birds flying through it the road was a rib bon of asphalt winding between them now tunneling through the hills and then floating on water at one point it headed straight out into space with the ground showing far below but jimdad just forged on ignoring all the effects and in the end prevailed his natural mundane dis piers anthony belief in magic was helping him reject the illusions as dusk threatened they reached the turnoff to imp erial as they pulled carefully into the village they saw that the imps were desperate they were still working but they looked haggard piles of boxes and bags of gems sat on the walks not yet carried to safety obviously they were not going to make it the rv drew to a stop quieta appeared her nice dress sweatsodden her nice hair in disarray but we thought you were safely out of xanth by this time she cried we came to help you complete your job jimdad said tell us how to do that quieta wasted no time on amazement you can carry those piles of gems to the cave ersonal will show you the way they trooped out not bothering with the accommoda tion spell this time each of the humans including nimby picked up a pile and carried it carefully each load was perhaps ten times what an imp might have carried they followed imp ersonal along a path that was really too small for full humans but it had to do because if they reduced to imp size they wouldnt be able to carry their burdens they came to the cave it looked like a rathole so small that even the imps had to crawl into it they set down their burdens and returned to the village midrange watched as did woofer and tweeter they werent fit for carrying but they could still help when the humans returned each animal showed some of them to a new pile that way the imps didnt have to carry the piles to the staging region they could be picked up directly from the buildings when the imps saw that they increased their efforts to get their wares out on the steps there were bar rels of beryls each gem of which was a miniature barrel that would cause anyone who invoked it to bare all men liked to give these to innocent women the imps explained there were lapfuls of lapis which would cause people to weewee unexpectedly midrange presumed those were for yon ill wind unfriends or those with certain bodily complications there were pails of fire opals which were little shaped pails that would safely carry fire there were chairs loaded with citrines which were gems that caused folk to sit and if they then took up a latrine they would sing and more there were collections of topaz which were toeshaped candies yellow peach white and blue there were tiger eyes through which one could catch a view of a tiger in fact there were so many kinds of gems that midrange lost interest long before assimilating them all what kind of goofy creature are you an imp de manded midrange stared at the imp who was no larger than midrange himself you must be olite he remarked in animal language not expecting to be understood how did you guess caterwaul the imp asked rudely now get your carcass out of my way so i can set these nix stones down where your fat rump is onyx to be sure midrange got out of the way it was good to know that not all the imps were sickly sweet in the manner of quieta as david came to pick up the collection here two more imps passed by you know end those huge humans have really helped us one said too bad this is only the beginning of xanths mischief youre right asse the other replied they have enabled us to save our wares in time for which we are deeply grateful but the fate of the rest of xantb seems worse f i hope that when we emerge from our safe cave enough of xanth remains to make existence worthwhile end said his tone suggesting that he doubted that would be the case the two walked on checking the various houses to make sure all the goods had been taken but midrange was bothered by their implication this wasnt the whole job then what was the point he didnt like thinking that they piers anthony had taken all this trouble to accomplish nothing really sig nificant so he ran after david with whom he could communi cate most readily the boy was just setting down his last load as dusk became darkness meavid he said david saw him and picked him up whats with you hero he asked stroking his fur in the way he tolerated merouble confound this clumsy human speech trouble david asked i thought we just took care of it now were going to use the accommodation spell and join the imps in their safe cave and wait for the mad ness to pass midrange wasnt sure of that but he couldnt get through to the boy fast enough even if he knew exactly what the problem was meimby ask nimby okay at that point nimby approached he always seemed to know when someone wanted to talk to him the imps say there is clanger for all xanth he thought to nimby who could read minds what is it can we help tell david nimby wrote a note and gave it to david there is danger david cried and we can help chlorine approached there is more danger she asked david gave her the note she read it and sighed then i suppose well have to tell the others though i fear this will lead to complications david nodded i guess this isnt great for you huh its more work with the duffers chlorine tousled his hair midrange saw the effect it had on the boy if sean was threequarterssmitten by her beauty david was halfsmitten really i dont mind but how did you know to ask nimby about it midrange told me chlorine looked at midrange with mock severity so youre the one she tousled his fur too and he too loved it there was just something about a stunningly beautiful woman with a nice personality even if he knew yon ill wind it was all an enchantment made by a donkeyheaded dragon and the truth was that this was the best adventure mid range himself had ever had it had everything a dragon a damsel peril magic mystery and madness what more could a bored tomcat desire questions chlorine went to find the adult members of the fam ily jim baldwin was just returning from his final load of gems she intercepted him excuse me please she realized that she didnt know how he pre ferred to be addressed mundane father he smiled call me jim that made it easier jim i have learned that there is more danger not just for the imps but for all xanth da vid asked nimby nimby didnt volunteer it because it wasnt to us personally but we were able to help the imps but helping all xanth is surely beyond our power he said we need to use the accommodation spell now and join the imps in their safe cave until the storm passes the imps are afraid that there will not be much left after it passes she said id better talk with nimby the way the wind is rising we cant delay about a decision i know where he is she led him back to david midrange and nimby nimby whats this about danger for all xanth and how does it concern us jim asked piers anthony nimby had already written a note he gave it to jim the storm is unique because it is foreign jim read it will continue to grow in strength and the magic dust it spreads will devastate all of xanth if not stopped those who live underground or take cover there will sur vive but those who remain on the ground in the water or in the air will suffer grievously most of the vegetation will be blown away what remains will be a paltry rem nant but it is possible for this party to ameliorate it if we take immediate and effective action at some risk to our selves some risk chlorine said but im supposed to get you safely out of xanth we negated that when we turned back from the bor der jim remarked wryly the other members of the family had assembled during the reading dad we have to take that action sean saul yeah karen agreed he looked at mary yes she said grimly but that probably means danger he said nimby surely isnt fooling about some risk and were already tired and all the other folk of xanth face possible extinc tion mary said he faced nimby what can we do nimby was already writing another note jim read it he looked at chlorine it seems we shall have to split up he said but i must see you safely out of xanth chlorine repeated thats my mission i cant leave you until then nimby believes that you will not be able to accomplish that mission until xanth itself is secured jim said so it seems we shall have to take the risk you must go with nimby to fetch the windbreaker we must go to castle roogna to get help in enlisting fracto cumulo nimbus in the cause of saving xanth wow david exclaimed yon ill wind chlorine was amazed she looked at nimby he nodded well it will be your fault if i fail to complete the good magicians service she said i certainly hope you know as much as you think you do nimby nodded again he was so sure he knew when obviously he couldnt know everything that was about the only aggravating thing about him then he wrote another note it said know what is going on in xanth not what will happen i know that fracto and the windbreaker can save xanth but not whether they will i know the best way to achieve these things but not whether they will be achieved i do not mean to be aggravating and how could she be mad at him he was making her beautiful smart and healthy and helping her have the greatest adventure of her life im sorry for what i thought she said for of course he had made her nice too she knew she wouldnt much care about his feelings in her natural state but she was glad to be the way he had made her she felt so much better about herself this way and not just because of the way others saw her she owed nimby everything then so let it be jim said chlorine suspected that he too was beginning to enjoy this adventure which was surely quite different from his ordinary life in drear mun dania we shall drive to he glanced at the note nimby had given him castle roogna we should be able to make it by morning mary took his arm you have driven enough dear she said i will drive there while you get some necessary rest karen stared at her mom you can drive the rv stop teasing me you little bleep mary said with a third of a smile unlike the others she actually said the word bleep it wasnt a conspiracy expurgation but how will we find our way there without chlorine and nimby to tell us david asked good point jim said piers anthony quieta had joined the group we really appreciate the way you helped us complete our task in time at the ex pense of your own freedom to leave xanth she said we have not known how to repay you but now perhaps we can we shall provide a guide but then that person wont be safe in the sanctuary cave mary protested she will be safe at castle roogna perhaps especially if you succeed in saving xanth here is my daughter tren ita a younger imp woman stepped forward she looked to be in her midthirties then we are constrained to accept your kind offer jim said now i think the madness is closing in you must close your cave and we must be on our way so they bid a second parting to the imps who chlorine suspected were just as glad not to have to entertain the family in the sanctuary cave and went their ways the baldwin family piled into their traveling house and moved off mary at the wheel with trenita imp lifted into the seat next to karen chlorine and nimby saw them off it looked as if the vehicle were stretching and twisting like a giant caterpillar but she knew that was just the effect of the madness then she turned to her companion so how do we find this windbreaker she asked he wrote a note it is one of the possessions of sending we must obtain it from the ambitious program sending the one we just messed up to rescue the mundane pets were doomed not if we approach him properly sending is rational so how do we approach him we must bring him a suitable gift and answer his twenty questions twenty questions i may be smart now thanks to you but im not sure i could answer that many without a stum ble what happens if we miss one we become two of sendings artifacts nuhuh nimby i already have an assignment and yon ill wind after that ill have to go home and become dull again i cant get locked into slavery for some cold machine but i can answer the questions oh if youre sure how do we get there it was a long fast ride in the mundane moving house and i dont think we could walk that far tonight even without the interfer ence of the madness not to mention the wind for the wind was rising again blowing her skirt up and about and trying to tangle her hair enough to form a pack of snarls now that sean wasnt here to goggle at her legs she found this inconvenient nimby led the way to the side of the road but if we go beyond the enchanted limit monsters can get us she said but she knew nimby was aware of that and wouldnt lead her into danger there was a big puff of cotton caught in a tree no it was cloudstuff she realized maybe some of the cloud that made the gap chasm ferry had detached and drifted here naturally nimby knew where it was so she helped him wrestle it out of the snags of the branches and twigs but the small cloud wanted to float they couldnt get it down to the ground then nimby boosted her up onto it she fell into its bowllike surface her legs in the air her skirt halfway to her head nimby climbed up on the other side and rolled into the cloud bowl he too landed mostlyupside down but his trousers left him decorous no fair she said when i climbed in i showed my panties to the sky you didnt show anything and you probably saw my panties too nimby nodded and youre not even embarrassed she said severely he nodded again or freaked out now she was annoyed but then she realized that he was after all only a dragon who didnt see human beings as prospects for anything social why should he care about panties she got herself in order and poked her head over the piers anthony edge of the cloud it was still floating and the wind was blowing it north along the highway at increasing velocity so they were being carried in the direction they wanted to go obviously nimby had known that this would be the case the trollway was bare and the trees along the sides of it seemed to be shirting colors textures and natures because of the distortion by the intensifying madness but they also channeled this gust of wind so that the cloud was floating straight along the channel and still gaining speed well if were going to float there lets get some shielding from the wind she said she took handfuls of the cloudstuff at the rim and shaped it up into higher walls and then all the way into a dome over them the material gleamed faintly lighting the interior with a gentle yellow glow it was fun to work with cloud because it was so soft and pliable just the way a woman is supposed to be she said as she finished the job she didnt have quite enough material to make the dome complete so she fash ioned a round window in the top through which they could view the stars now they shared a spherical chamber and apart from a certain bounciness it was hard to tell that it was moving now lets get comfortable she said and shaped two pillows for them we can just lie here until we get there im sure youll know when that is nimby nodded they floated comfortably along but the novelty soon wore off chlorine would have slept but it was early in the evening and anyway she had snoozed while riding in the traveling house so she was wideawake and becoming bored nimby exactly what are you she asked i mean i know youre a donkeyheaded dragon who knows whats going on and you can make me beautiful and yourself handsome but i never heard of any creature like you be fore where did you come from what did you do all day yon ill wind nimbys pad and pencil appeared he wrote a note and gave it to her she read it aloud i am a special variety of monster i contest endlessly with others of my kind for status we live only for games whose rules are somewhat arbitrary and stringent if we violate them we lose the game some games are brief while some take centuries she looked up centuries your kind must live a long time nimby nodded apologetically she resumed reading status is indicated by the de limiters ordinary status is parentheses and the next stage is brackets and braces and angles though for convenience we usually just use parentheses she broke off again you must lead the dullest life imaginable nimby no wonder you came to share an ad venture with me its bad enough being a donkeyheaded dragon but to be limited i mean delimited in braces you poor thing she tossed aside the note which dis solved into a wisp of smoke and disappeared nimby nodded oddly he looked more relieved than limited but chlorine remained bored and it was obvious that nimbys background was even more boring so she made a decision nimby back when we first got together i said i would teach you romance when the right time came i think that time is now we have a lot of adventure behind us and probably a lot more ahead of us but right now we have none since we cant be sure that everything will work out for the best we might as well make the most of what offers right now she glanced at him do you have any idea what im talking about nimby shook his head she laughed you can read my mind but you cant understand what im thinking because youre really a striped dragon with a donkey head and you dont under stand human emotion well because i know what you are there cant be anything serious between us no lasting re lationship just as there couldnt be with young sean mun dane though it was fun having him watch me though the piers anthony past few hours he ignored me even when i came perilously close to exposing my she severed that unpleasant thought and you will surely never break my heart and make me cry though oddly nimby did seem to look sad at that point but i do appreciate what you are doing for me nimby and i think it only fair to repay you in my fashion so ill show you how to act as if you were really a handsome human man and not a laughably weird exotic creature who knows the information might come in handy sometime and maybe itll be fun she glanced at him again do you understand anything yet he shook his head well you will find out i am going to show you how to summon the stork too bad its not for real but well pretend it is now i think i have practiced enough with sean to know what turns a man on if i can turn you on ill know im getting there are you ready nimby looked doubtful chlorine smiled so were starting from neutral good now since you cant speak i shall have to speak both our parts but you can perform the actions for yourself its all like a play put on by the curse fiends and we know we dont mean any of it but it may be interesting anyway whatever i say ill do ill do and whatever i say youll do youll do understand nimby nodded still dubiously you say with masculine boldness what is your name pretty girl and i nutter my eyelashes demurely and re ply chlorine handsome man and what is yours and you say i am nimby im a dashing dragon of a man i have come to take you away from all this and i say oh sir how romantic i think i will kiss you and i do she turned to face him as they lay side by side within the bowl and kissed him firmly on the mouth despite her artificial dialogue she was getting into it and the kiss felt real for one thing nimby was kissing her back so he did understand that much and then you being a man have mainly one thing on yon ill wind your mind she continued and that is summoning the stork so you say chlorine you are very pretty but i think you would look downright lovely with less on and you put your hand on my knee and squeeze gently she took his hand and set it there when he hesitated and i say innocently oh do you really think so would you like me to show you my panties and you are so excited at the prospect that you cant even speak at the moment so you just nod and smile and then she broke off for there was a face at the window with two big eyes what is this she cried annoyed she threw a cloudfluff pillow at it the pillow struck the head and fragmented into smithereens then she saw that it wasnt a head it was a rotating set of blades as they turned they formed the face it was a window fan such creatures loved to peer into windows that really turned them on so that they spun faster fortunately her thrown pillow had gummed up its works and blinded it it would peer in her window no more now where exactly were we she inquired recov ering her bearings as she unbound her greengold hair to float in a luxuriant mass around her shoulders oh yes the high point of any mans life to see the color of her panties no we wont mention that you made nice ones for me that isnt part of this script you are now in in nocent homy male mode i have just made the supreme offer and you are gaga at the very notion so you nod yes you are hot to see them for they are surely xanths most delightfully naughty sight and by this time i am hot to show you knowing that it will probably freak you out not to mention inflame your passion beyond endurance requiring me to kiss you and stroke you back to some semblance of sanity so she loosened her dress and drew it up and over her head of course you cant see them yet because im wearing a slip under my dress i am such an awful tease as is required by the big book of rules for adult conspiracy indiscretions however piers anthony there was a shuddering in the cloud and the sound of heavy tromping what now chlorine demanded her patience showing a sign of wanting to wander if not to get lost nimbys pad and pencil appeared but before he com pleted his note the cloud cover shook violently sending chlorine tumbling slip over flying hair then another face appeared in the window i thought i got rid of you she said but then she realized that this was a different face huge and fat and vaguely masculine any ogres here the face inquired licking its thick lips her patience slipped another notch do i look like an ogre she demanded swinging her legs in his direction he blinked but evidently was not sufficiently human to freak out at the sight no you look like a luscious morsel of a damsel girl with pretty good legs he had been doing okay until the last three words her last nerve frayed on the verge of snapping pretty good she demanded and just what do you consider to be good legs why ogre legs of course ogre legs ogre legs she screeched in what might have passed for harpy fashion if one had that low a mind what kind of creature are you im an ogre eater of course he explained an ogre eater you mean you eat ogres i never heard of that before well there arent many of us because ogres dont taste very good he glanced again at her legs but i suppose if there arent any ogres you might do your legs have a fair amount of healthy meat on them oh no you dont she snapped clapping her legs to gether i need these legs myself go find a real ogre okay the ogre eater said the face disappeared and the tromping and ground shaking resumed in a diminish ing cadence yon ill winti chlorine returned once more to the business at hand she saw nimby holding his note never mind that she told him i found out for myself now lets resume our activity before something else interrupts i wish this cloud floated just a bit higher so sundry folk couldnt just peek in nimby started to get up no dont see about doing something about it she said quickly thatll just distract us i want to get the bleep on with this before we arrive where were going and its too late can you appreciate that nimby looked appreciative in fact she had the impres sion that he was definitely getting intrigued by her ongoing lesson of love good it was nice being so beautiful as to inflame mens minds and so sexy as to force them to think of only one thing summoning the stork she had verified that it worked on sean mundane but he was young nimby was mature she lifted her slip to knee height tantalizingly nimby looked really interested she was ready to lift it all the way clear but didnt her hands just wouldnt do it what was the matter with her here was her chance to do what no man had been interested in doing with her before yet she was stalling why nimby wrote another note because you know i am only a donkeyheaded dragon and you want a real man she realized it was true she could playact all she wanted and craft any script she wanted but down under neath she knew it wasnt real because he wasnt real in fact she wasnt real either she was just a plain and some what omery girl making a pretense what was the use of that yet if she didnt take advantage of her opportunity now her adventure might be over before she had another chance so maybe pretense was better than nothing at all dam it nimby lets do it anyway i want to show my panties to someone and you may never get to see another girls panties i mean not when shes not thinking of you piers anthony as some stupid beast who doesnt count would you like to go ahead nimby nodded chlorine took hold of her slip again then watch this and be amazed she took a twohanded grip and hauled it right up and over her head she flung it away and stood proudly in her pale greenyellow bra and panties but nimby didnt freak out because not only was he a dragon it was his magic that had made this limited cloth ing as well as her present body none of it was new or novel to him oh this isnt working she cried frus trated anew im just going through meaningless motions and boring you to oblivion im sorry nimby nimby wrote a note and handed it to her am not bored but she knew better how can you be interested in what you yourself made i might as well revert to my natural state where my panties dont even pretend to be interesting let alone manfreaking she fetched back her slip and put it back on i apologize for dragging you through this embarrassing charade nimby i wont do it again i could just cry with frustrationbut i cant risk even that nimby looking alarmed started to write another note no dont do it she told him firmly dont try to tell me something you think will make me feel good lets leave the illusions for those who dont know better nimby looked sad but his notepad disappeared chlorine fetched her dress and donned it but i want you to know that i do like you nimby and respect you and if you were a real man i would have done it with you even if you were a nearman like a curse fiend or maybe a demon demons know how to appreciate mortal women physically at least but a dragon all this must be utterly laughable to you so i wont bore you anymore i owe you at least that much you have been a really good sport her dress was done she started on her hair then on yon ill wind sudden impulse she went to nimby and embraced him thanks for being my friend she said and kissed him the two half tears in her eyes brimmed but fortunately didnt lose their positions nimby froze his eyes glazed had she freaked him out after all but in half a moment he recovered and wrote a note you are more than welcome chlorine she smiled at least we understand each other maybe thats better than the other he nodded though he looked as if he had come close to some phenomenal achievement and lost it maybe she should have done the stork routine with him after tempting him so but no she had done her best to do the right thing and that was to save the stork summoning for a man she really loved rather than wasting it on a game the cloud floated on sublimely unconcerned with their troubled thoughts soon nimby wrote another note we are there already she asked surprised but she realized that the cloud had been moving along with deceptive velocity so it could be so her opportunity to do something naughty was indeed gone she regretted and resented that even though she had made the decision herself nimby scrambled up and out the top window and held down a hand for her he pulled her right up she was surprised by his easy strength until she remembered yet again that he was really a dragon they perched on top and she saw that the cloud was indeed moving along at a good clip the wind was higher the sound had been muf fled by the cloud wall so that she had forgotten it the ill wind was still intensifying nimby reached out and caught an overhanging branch he kept his feet hooked into the top of the cloud so that it couldnt go anywhere but neither did it sink to the ground it was still about twice a mans height up that ogre eater must have been huge how do we get down she asked nimby nodded toward his legs this required some in piers anthony terpretation he was going to climb down he shook his head and she rememberedagainthat he could read her mind so all she had to do was think the right thought she put her bright mind to work she must have some thing to do with his feet take them out of the cloud but then it would float away with her unless she hung on to them aha she could swing down on his legs that would get her low enough so she could drop the rest of the way without harm she saw that the ground was soft there piled with pine needles surely by no coincidence nimby always knew what he was doing but how would he get down he must be strong enough to handle the drop and he nodded okay nimby she said im trusting you with my safety i guess i might as well having already shown you my panties for all that they bombed out she leaned into him and grabbed him around the thighs i hope i dont pull your pants off she said but she knew that wouldnt happen nothing ever went wrong with nimby that thought made her regret for one or two in stants that she hadnt continued her script in the cloud at least up to the point of getting his pants off she was cu rious aboutbut that was an unmaidenly thoughtand what was he thinking of it now she refocused and scrambled off the cloud she dropped down seeing his legs release the cloud which quickly floated on downwind in a hurry to get where it was going she swung back and forth like a pendulum her body slid ing down past his knees and feet until she was just about all the way beneath him then she dropped landing neatly on the needles which were rusted and crumbly not still sharp fortunately she was surprised by how readily she had done it then realized that it was her good health that accounted for it the health nimby had given her how ever she still lost her balance and sat down health did not give her perfect judgment on a landing someone laughed it sounded like the voice of an ass but it wasnt nimby who was still hanging above waiting yon ill wind for her to clear the landing site she looked around there was a man emerging from the forest beside the road he wore dirty clothes and had a large rusted metal can for a hat do it again sister he brayed maybe this time ill see something interesting chlorine knew his type he was a junk malewho trav eled around to take up the attention of people who didnt want him and acted like trash there were way too many of his kind cluttering up the space of decent folk she knew exactly how to handle him is this interesting enough she called sweetly as she got to her feet when she was sure he was watching she turned around and flipped up her skirt and slip there was silence she let her clothing fall back into place and turned around the junk male was lying on his back staring at the sky not moving a muscle he was absolutely stiff he would remain that way for some time because he had freaked out chlorine smiled she had now proved the potency of her panties then she remembered nimby who was still hanging by the branch she hastily got out from under you may drop down now she called sweetly i have disposed of the trash he dropped smiling he understood that was one of the things she liked about him he was strong silent help ful and understanding they walked past the freakedout male and into the for est toward sendings lair nimby knew the way without hesitation of course despite the darkness when she stum bled he took her hand and led her securely along firm footed paths they didnt need to worry about dangers because nimby avoided them automatically and knew how to deal with them anyway chlorine realized that she felt safe with him and she liked that too soon they came to the dastardly devices cave nimby walked right in without fear so she did too but it was even darker here until nimby found a glow fungus that piers anthony served as a lamp he just always could put his hands on the right thing in the central chamber the two halves of the reverse wood ball still lay on the floor nullifying sending nimby picked them up and put them together again he handed her the ball but she said almost dropping it in her nervous ness then she realized that it was safe as long as she kept it together so she held it excruciatingly carefully it wouldnt do her harm anyway because if it reversed her magic she would be able to sweeten water instead of poi soning it but she wondered how nimby himself was able to handle reverse wood without getting reversed the glassy screen lighted a picture of a man appeared with a big question mark over his head evidently the ma lignant machine was confused after being knocked out by the reverse wood nimby glanced at her ohshe had to do the talking sending she said firmly we have come to make a deal with you you cant change our reality because i have this ball of reverse wood and if anything happens to me ill drop it and the two pieces will fall apart and stop re versing each other and resume reversing you as they did before you will become an unmagical collection of junk do you understand the screen blinked the question mark faded out we want to obtain the windbreaker she continued i understand you have it and we can get it from you if we answer your twenty questions is that correct the screen brightened the man figure smiled then the screen split with the upper section showing an icon of a pretty young woman holding a jacket and the lower sec tion showing the young woman and a young man in chains if we answer all the questions correctly we get the windbreaker she said interpreting if we dont we both become your slaves for life she paused glancing a bit apprehensively at nimby was he sure yon ill wind but nimby nodded so she took her courage in one trembling hand and proceeded that seems fair we agree the two of us will consult on each question and decide on the answer only when i address you directly sending will it count agreed a smiley face appeared on the screen very well she said briskly just as if her heart werent palpating her gizzard proceed now print appeared on the screen so sending could print when he chose to he wasnt limited to icons and pictures first a sample question to be sure we agree on the manner of the questions and answers this is for demonstration purpose only agreed chlorine suspected that there were rules about such things and sending didnt want his prospective victory to be nullified by a technicality question sample referring to the third of the muses historical texts of xanth when magician dor then age twelve tried to stop the forget spells countdown in the year it did not re spond since it was able to speak only by his magic which enabled him to speak to the inanimate and have it answer why did he not simply withdraw his magic so that it could no longer speak chlorine read the question and quailed she remem bered from her centaur history classes before she flunked out that prince dor had traveled eight hundred years into xanths past and detonated the forget spell making the gap chasm be forgotten for eight hundred years until the time of no magic broke up the enchantment but the logic of this was beyond even her enhanced intelligence if this was typical of the questions to come she would be doomed before she started but nimby was writing a note he gave it to her and suddenly the answer was clear he did not do that be cause it would not have been effective she read the forget spell would merely have counted silently and det piers anthony onated anyway the countdown could not be stopped once started the screen went blank for a moment sending had ev idently expected her to get it wrong and was disconcerted but in another moment it recovered corrbct that was an easy one of course the real questions will be more difficult are you prepared to address them chlorine bit her tongue to get some saliva in her dry mouth and responded with fake confidence of course lets see a nice challenging one but the machine wouldnt be bluffed question when magician trent first attempted to conquer xanth in the year it was said that he changed men into pish and let them expire on dry land he denies it what is the truth she quailed again worse how could anyone ever know what had happened seventyfive years ago but nimby was writing a note she took it and read it aloud knowing that if it wasnt the correct answer she would not be able to do any better on her own magi cian trent did transform men into fish but he did it by a river where they fell in and swam then he walked away but some of the fish thinking that they were still men scrambled back onto land and perished magician trent never saw those ones so did not know if sending was impressed or disconcerted he did not show it his screen flashed the next one question magician binks talent is that he can not be harmed by magic thus the gap dragon being a magical creature could not harm him despite making the ef fort yet he was choked by chester centaur and al most suffocated by a tangle tree both of which are magical creatures how can this be so chlorine was amazed thats binks talent i always thought he had no magic so you will think again for others are not al lowed to know you will forget this question and its answer after this session is over yon ill wind meanwhile nimby was writing again she took the pa per and read it this is a deceptive question you im plied a connection that does not necessarily exist bink can not be harmed by magic but can be harmed by magic creatures if they do not employ magical means that is a dragon could chomp him mechanically but could not en chant him magically his talent does not regard threats or even bruising to be harm only permanent physical dam age so there is no conflict the screen faded for a long instant or short moment she had set the disreputable device back again rather nimby had her respect for his intellect was verging on awe how could a funny dragon know so much sure it was his talent but so was the way he changed the two of them into a lovely human couple how could he have two magic talents nimby passed her another note only the form changing is magic the knowledge is inherent in my nature oh of course but he was still one supremely remark able creature the next question was on the screen question the forget spell controlled the gap chasm until the time of no magic in the year so that only those actually within it could remember it yet when magician trent returned from mundania in he remembered it how can this be chlorine whistled inwardly these werent mere ques tions of who did what when they were crafted to require extraordinary comprehension of all xanth history only the good magician humfrey could possibly know all the an swersand nimby she could almost have suspected that nimby was the good magician if she hadnt seen them together maybe they were related and nimby was per forming a service for humfrey just as she was for the good of xanth the next note came the magic of xanth has little effect in mundania she read and magician trent had been there twenty years it took time for the forget piers anthony spell to reassert itself with him in due course he did forget it again question when bink and chameleon in the guise of smart ugly fanchon left xanth that same year they were able to understand the mundanes they encountered how could this be as mundanian is unintelligible to xanthians she simply read nimbys answer because as usual she had no idea this is another trick question bink and chameleon never heard mundanian they remained in the fringe of xanth magic and the mundanes were automati cally talking xanthian so it continued how could girard giant know of ma gician murphy who had been banished over seven hun dred years before girard was delivered by an exhausted stork because girard did know some history why did the ghost writer write never a cleavage when he saw luscious nada naga when the gorgon and irene and any number of buxom nymphs and centaur fillies had similar figures because the ghost writer had not yet en countered those others and in any event he was speaking hyperbolically as writers do why didnt the centaurs teach prince dolph how to spell because they had tried with his father dor and failed spectacularly there had to be some learning ability in the student or even a centaur couldnt make much of an impression why did prince dolph sometimes change form slowly instead of instantly for variety why did magician humfrey take lethe elixir to forget rose of roogna for eighty years but forget everything else in that period too because there was too much of her in their time together to remember the rest without her would have led to lethenulling paradox chlorines head was reeling with all this arcane infor mation but nimby had all the answers no matter how devious the questions and sendings efforts were all blocked she read off the answers hardly assimilating their de tails until she came to it wasnt that it was any less yon ill wind devious or difficult but that she realized that they were reaching the end this one and one more and they would win that gave her sudden shakes in one of the muse clios volumes of the history of xanth we are told that the night mares are con fined to the land of xanth in another we learn that night makes also service mundania how can this be chlorine dreaded that seemingly innocent query know ing that it wasnt innocent at all it was a challenge had the malignant machine caught the muse herself in an error then how could the question be answered definitively her knees felt like noodles in heating water but nimby never paused he wrote his note and gave it to her she read it and was delighted with the simplicity and clarity of the answer so obvious in retrospect mundania like xanth changes over the years some times the borders are closed and the night mares are con fined to xanth at other times the portal at no name key is opened and the mares go through unimpeded the muse notes the situation at the time of that particular volume there is no inconsistency when time is taken into ac count the screen dimmed the surly system had thought he had a winner and had not only one more question and it was bound to be the worst question human colonization of xanth dates from the year zero defined by the arrival of the first wave years ago yet the sea hag is known to be thousands of years old how can this be now chlorines knees definitely softened she knew of the wicked sea hag who had indeed lived for thousands of years by taking over the bodies of young folk and using them until they were old and womout by her awful life style and degraded attitudes where could she have come from if she was older than human colonization of xanth she couldnt have been mundane for mundanes had no piers anthony magic she had to have been delivered in magical xanth she was despite her haggishness definitely human could nimby answer this one nimby could she cursed herself for falling into another neat little trap as she read his answer sullen sending had played it sneaky right to the end the sea hag dates not from the first wave which signaled the beginning of continuous human occupation of xanth but fromthe first lost human colony of xanth circa minus that col ony faded out three hundred years later having been careless about lov springs and crossbred with other crea tures forming harpies merfolk naga sphinxes ogres goblins elves fauns nymphs fairies and other species so the sea hag is approximately three thousand two hun dred and ninetysix years old normally simplified as thousands the evil entitys screen turned furious red roils of smoke crossed it lightning jags flickered sending was not a good loser but he had lost and knew it take the windbreaker a panel opened in the cave wall behind the screen revealing a closet where a motley white jacket hung thank you ever so much chlorine said super sweetly you have been excruciatingly nice and of course the conflagration on the screen just got worse as she had hoped she stepped up to the closet and took the windbreaker it seemed entirely ordinary but she knew it wasnt it was the key to the solution to xanths current crisis may i ask one question of a personal nature the screen inquired over its burning background chlorine glanced at nimby who shook his head no she answered with deep satisfaction and walked out of the chamber she knew the destructive device wanted to know how nimby knew so many answers so sending could nul lify that ability if they ever met again the cave exit became a blank stone wall sending was changing reality nuwa chlorine said lifting the re yon ill wind verse wood ball she still held in her other hand she could drop it and nullify the mangy machine at any time and would do so the moment any untoward print or picture started to form on the screen the exit reappeared they used it and emerged into the night of xanth proper chlorine was about to set down the ball but nimby shook his head so she put it in her purse then she donned the windbreaker it was very comforta ble so their part of the mission had been successful she wondered how the mundane family was doing princesses trenita imp sat beside karen because it had turned out that she couldnt see anything from in front and karen was thrilled david was asleep but she was wideawake and bored now that the accommodation spell no longer affected them she could appreciate just how small the imps were trenita was thirtyseven years oldthe same age as mombut only nine inches tall the seat belt looked monstrous on her and was surely a heavy weight but she didnt complain as the rv moved down the trollway right through the increasingly realistic phantasms formed by the thickening madness brought by the ill wind karen questioned her companion do you travel often no this is my first time away from my community but then how do you know the way to castle boo gie castle roogna trenita said patiently just like mom piers anthony everyone in xanth knows where that is i have studied centaur maps and of course i know the way of enchanted paths you mean like nobody can attack us on one yes of course but also where they go and where they stop they stop trenita smiled when you get where you are going in this case castle roogna is that a nice place i am sure you will love it it has an orchard where all manner of things grow such as pie trees geeeven chocolate pies especially those the royal children have insisted on them and on bubblegum trees there are children there yes princess ivy and prince dolph grew up there of course theyre grown now and married and prince dolph and princess electra have their twins dawn and eve they are now five years old do they have magic talents of course the imp woman replied every descen dant of magician bink has magicianlevel magic dawn can tell anything about any living thing while eve can tell anything about any inanimate thing geei wish i had a magic talent even a little one trenita shook her head mundanes lack magic you have to be delivered in xanth to have it delivered by the stork of course you mean its literal here babies arent bom bom you know from their mothers oh borne the storks deliver them to their proper mothers of course after they have been ordered ordered you mean like from a novelty catalog from a cat a log no a message is sent to the stork yon ill wind gee things really are different in xanth how do they send the orders i must not tell you that the adult conspiracy abso lutely forbids it so things weren t so different this woman was the size of a doll but she was a typical adult same as the bleep huh but why arent children supposed to know because then they might summon storks themselves and not take care of their babies karen considered that she knew of cases in mundania where exactly that had happened but the wordswhy forbid them they arent babies they wont suffer if chil dren say them will they but others would suffer have you seen the burned foliage where harpies roost would you want human chil dren to do that geei could bum things with words if i knew the words id love that trenita sighed well the full name is the adult con spiracy to keep interesting things from children thats more like it karen agreed vindicated oh i must direct your mother to the bridge over the gap chasm trenita said before she misses the turn ill do it karen said eagerly mom mom turn coming up but were approaching the ferry station mom called back the ferry will be closed because of the high winds trenita said we must use the bridge makes sense mom sean said coming to life he had been pretty quiet recently maybe because now there was no sexy chlorine to gawk at wind blows clouds very well i see a diverging lane ahead but will it take us off the enchanted path no the paths to castle roogna are all enchanted trenita said reassuringly mom made the turn karen returned her attention to trenita whats it like being an imp piers anthony much like being human i suspect did you find our hotel strange when you used the accommodation spell no it was great especially that magic mirror with the historical pictures it was showing you the magic tapestry of castle roogna you will be able to see the original there gee that and a chocolate pie tree will be about as good as candy and tv at home did you eat fun stuff when you were a kid trenita smiled of course and my mother quieta disapproved did you have lots of pretty gems to play with no just the sparkles of morning dew that my mother made it was only more recently that my father became mayor and had to supervise the making of more permanent kinds of gems how did ortant get to be mayor trenita smiled reminiscently my grandfather had once been ambitious then my grandmother died and he lost his ambition he got caught by an alligator clamp which was slowly chewing off his leg until a big ugly ogre named smash roared it off it occurred to my grandfather that if a creature that horrendous could do such a favor for one so small the least he could do in return was to become worthwhile so he resumed his ambition and worked hard and lived up to his name and became important karen said liking it thats nice the rv slowed that bridge is too small mom said no it is the right size for whatever uses it trenita said unlike the invisible bridge or the oneway bridge just go on it maybe id better hold you up so you can see for ward karen said this is getting scary yes let me stand on your shoulder karen lifted the imp carefully until she stood on her right shoulder holding on to a hank of her hair what yon ill wind pretty red trenita remarked and karen felt unreasonably pleased dad had been snoring in the back with the three pets now he woke hey dont drive into the chasm he exclaimed alarmed go back to sleep mom retorted as the rv nudged cautiously toward the footpathsized bridge the perspective changed and it became apparent that the structure was wider than it had seemed in fact it was also more solid by the time they drove onto it it seemed quite sufficient magic is weird sean muttered the gap chasm had been impressive by day on a cloud it was awesome by night on a bridge just wide enough for the vehicle there was a faint glow below hinting at its depth and darkness around the edges that seemed to loom twice as close the moment her eyes turned elsewhere then the glow and the darkness clarified ahead was a dead end with nowhere to go but into the dark depths the rv squealed to a stop the bridge is out mom said her voice deceptively calm no it isnt trenita said thats illusion the bridge is enchanted and will not harm you as long as you stay on it just drive on mom hesitated understandably karen sympathized that was one frighteningly realistic dropoff remember the fake goblin roadblock she called true mom agreed the vehicle nudged forward as the front wheels crossed the brink the illusion dis appeared the bridge was back but it curved to the side theres no curve trenita cried the bridge is straight thank you mom said grimly driving straight illusions can kill you sean said shaken if you heed them trenita agreed now a huge dragon face formed ahead its mouth opened showing gleaming glistening glittering teeth the most noxious possible smoke surged out to encompass the piers anthony rv it coalesced around the vehicle becoming blood streaked slime i wish the enchantment was effective against illusion trenita said oh i dont know karen demurred mischievously we can have some fun with this sean gotcha sean agreed catching on he came to join her they faced out the window hey slimeball karen called whatcha eating tonight how about fried worms and dayold squished cater pillars sean inquired the slime quivered it might be illusion but it heard them that was the great thing about xanth even the in animate had feelings even things that didnt exist could hear and react karen had sort of figured it would be that way and it was good to be back in form with sean i should have known you were a dragon without guts karen said just slimy smoke pretty puny effort if you ask me sean agreed loudly i thought at least wed see a decent show the slime became guts they were gruesomely realistic oozing juices and slipsliding over each other karen was on the verge of nauseated but she controlled her reaction ive seen better guts on a drunk she declared on a drunk pig sean agreed this sure is a boring place maybe the next illusion will have some oomph to it the guts became a roaring furnace this illusion was angry now good karen faked a yawn booring she said for sure sean agreed lets make faces at each other karen thatll be scarier anything would be scarier she agreed she put her fingers in her mouth and pulled it wide as she stuck out her tongue sean pretended to gouge out his own eyes and hand her an eyeball karen accepted it and popped it in her mouth yon ill wind she made a burpy swallowing sound yuck its raw neither of them looked again at the illusion outside its gone trenita murmured right sean agreed our act is so bad theres noth ing that can stand it he smiled at karen nice going twerp thanks bleephead she replied as he returned to his seat thatwas interesting trenita remarked i never saw anyone drive away an illusion before its mundane talent sean said nobody can stand us in our normal state trenita laughed you nevertheless have your appeal the rv reached the end of the bridge and pulled back onto solid land trenita returned to her side of the seat karen felt something relax she had been really tight knowing that if the illusion had succeeded in scaring or confusing mom they could have plunged into the dreadful abyss but they had driven it away but she was not yet relaxed enough to sleep despite the lateness of the hour so she asked the imp something that was bound to be boring why is it that all the men imps have punny names like ortant or atient while the girl imps dont because the men are the ones who need the reassur ance of meaningful names trenita replied we women already know our worth so choose pretty names instead it works for me karen said and snoozed off when she woke dawn was threatening and the rv was approaching a thick forest sean was asleep in the back seat while dad was up front with mom tweeter was perched in her hair and woofer was on the floor by sean so the night was done and mom must be good and tired but they had to be close to where they were going she looked out the window massive tree branches swung down to block the way karen blinked and rubbed her eyes had she really seen that piers anthony tell them you have come to save xanth from the ill wind trenita called mom rolled down her window and spoke those words the branches swung out of the way and the rv drove on the guardian trees are very protective of the castle trenita remarked but they feel the effects of the magic dust now they came into a lovely orchardand sure enough there were pie trees galore castle roogna karen cried well have chocolate pie for breakfast that woke david wow he said gazing out the castle came into sight it was just about the most beautiful building karen had ever seen framed by the morning sunlight so that it glowed with sparkles radiating out it had a moat and wall and turrets and cupolas and pennants and just everything a castle should have ooooo she breathed appreciatively ooooo david mimicked her mockingly but his heart wasnt in it because he too was impressed they had seen so much of the jungle and illusion of xanth that this was a wonderful change the drawbridge was up but now it lowered and a girl in blue jeans ran out she was slender and pigtailed maybe about sixteen years old obviously a serving girl hi she cried as she reached the rv you must be the mundanes welcome to castle roogna im electra yes we are the mundane family mom said we understand that we can help save xanth from the ill wind if someone in the castle can tell us where to go and how to do it sure come on in electra said you must be tired after being in that moving house so long we are mom agreed but were in no shape to enter a royal castle if someone can come out and give us directions well be on our way oh no you must come in the girl cried king dor insists yon ill wind but were grimy and rumpled and dirty mom pro tested and hungry david called he would sure electra agreed brightly well get you nice and clean and fed and we have three animals with us mom said they are welcome too the girl said enthusiastically she looked back to where a nondescript young man was approaching theres dolph now hell tell you if youre sure mom said doubtfully trenita spoke up shes sure thats princess electra and prince dolph princess karen squeaked certainly i should have recognized her by her descrip tion shes very informal and thats her husband prince dolph i made the connection when i heard his name mom had evidently heard and adjusted in the smooth way of her kind we shall be glad to come in electra but we do have important business so cant stay long yes the good magician sent grey murphy to attend to it electra said he will talk with you as soon as youre ready come on ill show you where they piled out of the rv karen lifted trenita carefully down to the floor and then to ground outside the imp lady had made it clear she appreciated such nofuss assis tance in the giant human realm oh an imp lady electra exclaimed happily i am trenita imp of erial village the woman said formally i guided the mundane family here i will not be able to return immediately so i hope it is not an im position if i remain for a few days oh no its great having you electra said we have lots of space and you wont take up much of it she turned to the prince dolph why dont you give trenita imp a ride to the magic mirror so she can tell her village shes safe the young man became an impsized centaur get on my back and ill carry you there he said piers anthony thank you so much trenita said karen lifted her to the creatures back where she got a good handful of mane to steady herself but dont get fresh with me because my wife would screech dolph said smiling i will not electra screeched afterthem then she broke out laughing and the rest of them joined in princess she might be but she was obviously a fun person if you dont mind my saying you are the happiest princess i have met mom remarked thank you electra said happily they followed her to the castle karen looked longingly back at the pie trees but realized that they would have to wait though she was suddenly ferociously hungry as they approached the moat a horrendous green head rose out of the water karen screamed and the others stepped back oh thats just souffle electra said castle roognas moat monster and babysitter he loves children she raised her voice its okay souffle the good magician knows about these mundanes the mon ster nodded and disappeared back under the water they crossed the drawbridge and entered the castle it was huge with stone passages leading in assorted direc tions there were tapestries on the walls and thick rugs on the floors karen loved it at first sight right this way electra said stepping into a side pas sage in a moment they were in a nice bathroom with sinks and mirrors and all we really should change our clothes mom fussed if we are to meet royalty we already met it karen reminded her wash your face and get your hair done mom snapped but her tone had no edge soon they were reasonably ready they returned to the main hall where electra waited the king and queen will see you now she said then you can have break fast karen was glad of that and knew the others were too yon ill wind they entered a spacious hall there were a number of people there how are we supposed to address them dad whispered urgently we dont wish to give offense but just speak when spoken to a voice said beside them startling them karen looked but there was only a vase there turned out to be no difficulty the king was strid ing toward them with trenita imp on his shoulder hello mister baldwin the king said extending his right hand i am king dor we are very glad to see you you can say that again the voice said this time karen was sure it was the vase there must be something in it dad shook hands with the king thank you your maj esty he said we oh just call him dor the vase said everybody does the king smiled i should explain that my magic talent is speaking to the inanimate and having it answer at times it gets rather impertinent but the vase is correct we prefer informality especially since our business is urgent and vital to the welfare of xanth standing on ceremony takes too much time thank youdor dad said this is my wife the sorceress irene the king said a rather pretty woman of about quieta imps age stepped forward her hair was distinctly green much more so than chlorines yellowgreen but less luxuriant dad introduced the members of the family but it ap peared that the king already knew them or at least trenita was whispering them in his ear even the pets then the king got to business the good magician informs us that you and a woman called chlorine are able to help xanth in a way that no others can but that you need a guide to mount rushmost where the winged mon sters congregate winged monsters mom exclaimed queen irene touched her arm reassuringly they are piers anthony not our enemies in this crisis they wish to save xanth as much as we do indeed roxanne roc herself is now fetch ing your friends to that place a rock mom asked karen nudged her the big birds but the winds are now so high and the magic dust so pervasive that it isnt safe to let the rest of you travel that way king dor said so we are arranging for you to use one of the demon tunnels however not all demons can be trusted especially in heightened madness so we are trying to locate one who can i can do it a handsome man said stepping forward the king shook his head we must keep you here at castle roogna prince vore as liaison with the demons we can trust no one else in this particular crisis the man nodded and stepped back hes a demon the vase murmured wait till you see his wife princess nada naga so we shall now adjourn to the dining room while we wait for the demoness to arrive the king said we re alize that all this may be somewhat confusing to you es pecially the children so jenny elf will assist you a girl no taller than karen stepped forward her ears were pointed and her hands had only four fingers includ ing the thumb but apart from that she seemed normal she even had freckles like electras i was new to xanth too she said im jenny from the world of two moons karen seized her opportunity can you find us choc olate pies to eat instead of healthy adult stuff jenny glanced conspiratorially around sure ill tell the kitchen she slipped out they took places at a huge table dad mom and sean were absorbed in deep discussion with the king and queen not paying attention to anything else which was a good sign they didnt notice when a maid brought choc olate pies and chocolate milk for karen and david and dishes of dog cat and bird treats for the pets jenny elf yon ill wind joined them having some pie herself and her cat sammy joined the pets seeming to get along well enough with midrange soon they were full to bursting with pie boredom was hovering like a specter the adults remained oblivions whats there to do around this joint david asked in his crude boyish way joint jenny elf asked perplexed joynt bones is not here a mundane term for a lovely castle karen said quickly shooting a dark look at her half brother some times she wished he were a quarter brother or eighth brother would you like to meet the children jenny asked no david said he was being difficult no he would rather see the magic tapestry karen clarified but would love to meet the children right this way jenny said she set off across the hall and they followed her and the four animals followed them and the adults never noticed their departure jenny showed them upstairs to a pleasant room there on the wall was a huge tapestry depicting endless scenes of xanth it will show anything you want she ex plained just concentrate david concentrated suddenly the entire tapestry went dark and stormy with angry flickers of lightning there was the odor of burning hemp and a faint fuzzy image of a pair of scorched panties except adult conspiracy stuff jenny added oh david did not look pleased it was all karen could do to keep from giggling served him right midrange looked at the tapestry it clarified into a pic ture of the catapult a monstrous cat with a basket on its tail then woofer looked at it and a pack of wolves ap peared turning human as they came upon a human village then tweeter looked and the tapestry sky filled with great birds orienting on some hapless landbound creature below piers anthony jenny drew karen away that will amuse them for some time she whispered sammy will find more in teresting things for them if they dont he can find any thing but home but tweeter saw them going and flew to rejoin karen that pleased her they went to another room and received a cheery come in in response they went in and there was princess electra braiding the hair of two sweet little girls not a whole lot younger than karen herself one had golden light hair and the other had shadowy dark hair these are electras children dawn and eve jenny said dawn can tell anything about any living thing and eve can tell anything about any inanimate thing they are both sorceresses hi dawn hi eve karen said she was amazed that they could be electras because electra seamed so young and carefree the two little girls turned suddenly shy letting half a titter escape electra smiled they dont see many little girls here ask them to tell you about something animate or inanimate what about my bird karen asked dawn smiled and lifted her hand tweeter flew to it oh you are from beyond xanth the girl said you were hatched from the third egg in your mothers nest and taken to a nasty cage where karen rescued you two years ago it was clear by the birds reaction that this was ac curate since then you have been happy except that she goes away every day and leaves you in a cage i have to go to school karen protested id rather take tweeter with me but the school wont let me tweeter nodded forgiving her and flew back to her hair now karen dug into her pocket and brought out her nylon comb she passed it to eve the girl focused on the comb you are strange she said you started as a blob of goo buried deep in the ground until a big pipe sucked you up and you got run yon ill wind through something like a dragons gut and then got squeezed out into the form you have now karen found you in a drawer with many other combs just like you but now you are the only one for her once she lost you under theunder a moving housebut found you the next morning you have combed out fortyone snarls a hundred and fortytwo tangles and several thousand curls but are ready for more none of them lived for some reason karen was impressed she hadnt counted the snarls and tangles but the numbers sounded right and she had in deed once lost the comb under the rv and found it by chance in the morning eve had gotten all that just from holding the comb for a moment the snarls and tangles didnt live because they werent in xanth she explained in mundania they are just pulled hair oooo both twins said with bigeyed horror why dont you girls go see the triplets electra sug gested i have to get princessly sure the twins said together and dashed for the door all their shyness had vanished after they demon strated their talents jenny and karen followed they went to another room there was a big basket swinging gently from a tripod in it were three little babies these are melody harmony and rhythm jenny said they are too young to show their talents but we found out anyway whatever they sing and play together will become real when they are separate their individual tal ents will be less but since theyll mostly be together its a very strong talent the centaur tutors will have a time making them behave thats a lot of magic karen said impressed hello it was an adult woman whose waistlength hair was light and very faintly green oh hi princess ivy jenny said we were just ad miring the triplets the stork brought you this is karen mundane so i gathered ivy said with a bird hes tweeter karen explained shyly my brothers piers anthony have a dog named woofer and a cat named midrange so but she saw that the woman didnt understand theyre mundane words i can see why the dog and cat would be named as you have them ivy said but shouldnt the cat be meower karen tried again in mundania a speaker system that is something that makes soundshas a big cone called a woofer and a small cone called a tweeter and a middle cone called a midrange so oh i see ivy exclaimed midrange how clever but she seemed a bit uncertain lets go see demonica dawn said brightly yes shes more fun eve said darkly they headed for another room karen paused bye mrs ivy she said politely youre welcome the princess said with an obscure smile as they left when its the wrong time of the month we call her poison ivy jenny confided in a whisper karen would have laughed but she wasnt sure it was funny what did the time of the month have to do with anything unless it meant a holiday demonica turned out to be the halfdemon daughter of prince demon vore whom they had seen downstairs and princess nada naga a woman who would have popped seans eyes right out of their smoking sockets she was rocking her baby as they entered but was willing to let karen hold her but arent you afraid ill drop her karen asked no she would just bounce back up nada said karen was set back is that a joke nada smiled no demonicas demon heritage pre vents her from being physically harmed by such things she can become tenuous or solid as she chooses she cant do it as rapidly as her father can of course but it does protect her however i agree it is better not to drop her shes cute karen said taking the baby already de yon ill wind monica was changing shape in the way karen was coming to understand her face was growing larger and her body smaller until finally she was nothing but a head then she became light and floated out of karens arms dawn caught her i told you she was fun she said i could tell you everything about her but everyone al ready knows shell be even more fun when shes old enough to play she rocked the baby in her arms i dont want to ask something stupid karen said but stupid things are the most fun eve said that emboldened her there seem to be a lot of princes and princesses and little girls here is it always this way that is not a stupid question nada said laughing no it is unusual when we received news of the devel oping storm we all felt that the children and babies should be brought to the safest place in xanth so we all came to castle roogna which is enchanted to protect its occupants especially royal ones so grey and ivy came from the good magicians castle and vore and i came from my father nabobs cave and of course electra and the twins were here to begin with this is really our first reunion since the deliveries ivy electra and i have been great friends since we were girls oh i should have realized you had no way to know dear now as to why all our offspring are femalethat does seem curious we think it is just coincidence and that there will be males in due course but were happy with what we have so are we dawn said boys are a pain karen laughed agreeing i should know i have two brothers there was a swirl of smoke two eyes appeared in it i resent that the smoke said hi mentia one of the twins said you came in too late we werent calling you a pain we were calling boys a pain the other said thats what i heard the smoke said forming into a piers anthony beautiful woman with her dress on sideways karen wasnt sure how that was possible but it was the case seeing as how the stork brought my better half a boy a boy karen asked the woman looked at her youre new here arent you so you dont know how my better half metria moved half of xanth to get the attention of the stork last year and finally served it with a magic summons so it had to deliver so now she has ted on whom she dotes he will grow up to love children too disgusting karen managed to put it together demon mentiade mentia she was a bit crazy as her clothing indicated de mon teddemented demon voredevour she laughed these demons had a certain sense of word just as the imps did what brings you here mentia nada inquired were you curious about how the other halfdemon baby was doing that too mentia said they should be great play mates maybe theyll grow up and marry one day but i came here because i was summoned it seems xanth needs me xanth certainly needs something nada agreed but im not sure its a crazy demoness we already have too much madness stirring up madness thats it then the madder the environ ment the saner i get nada nodded so thats it then you had better go see the king theyve been waiting for you pronto the demoness agreed vanishing in another puff of smoke we had better go down too jenny said that means the journey to mount rushmost is about to start they left the children and hurried into the hall a regal young woman was approaching from the stairway she was just about perfect in every way but there was some thing odd about her oh hi princess ida jenny said this is karen mundane yon ill wind yes i just met her family ida said i was coming to fetch you down karen but i dont need a princess to guide me karen pro tested embarrassed the oddness was related to the womans head ida smiled think nothing of it right now there are so many princesses in the castle that we are having to find ways to make ourselves useful karen finally identified the oddness there was some thing moving around the princesss head it looked like a pingpong ball princess if you dont mind my asking you are curious about my moon ida said not at all offended it arrived last year and i didnt have the heart to send it away its really no trouble and it reflects my moods you may look at it if you wish but dont try to touch it for it will avoid you she angled her head so that the plane of the moons orbit swung down and karen got a good look the surface was sunny with little seas and land masses showing there were islands and conti nents and ice caps at the poles a little cloud bank came into view as the moon turned and there was a rainstorm over one section it was a complete world in itself oh how cute karen exclaimedand the moon brightened whats it called why we dont have a name for it ida said sur prised what do you think it should be called gee i dont know karen said pondering then she had such a bright idea that a bulb flashed over her head brightening the moon further back in mundania theres an asteroid called ida and it has a little moon and i learned in school how they named it dactyl which means something or other but since this isnt that it needs an other name so lets call it ptero terra jenny asked what a funny name no its got a funny spelling peeteeeerro thats why i like it you see theres this sort of dragonlike flying reptile that used to exist called a pterodactyl and this is a flying moon so piers anthony thats a wonderful idea ida said moon do you like that name the moon did a little dance of pleasure karen hoped it didnt shake its rain cloud off so ptero it is ida said thank you for the idea karen i would not have been able to think of it myself oh im sure you karen started to protest but jenny jogged her elbow we must go on downstairs jenny explained be fore they miss us oh of course karen had been so intrigued by idas moon that she had forgotten that they were supposed to be going somewhere they started walking you have a difficult mission ahead jenny said do you think you will be able to reach the top of mount rush most and convince fracto to help fight the ill wind oh sure karen said confidently dad can do any thing he puts his mind to hes a physics professor im sure he can ida agreed im sure he will be able to convince fracto jenny seemed quite pleased about something and so did ptero moon though karen couldnt see what they stepped downstairs sure enough everyone was gathering there even david had been dragged from the tapestry the demon guide has arrived king dor announced hear hear a chair said the mission will be successful jenny exclaimed fracto will help that is good to know the king said and idas moon is called terpfter ptero ida said firmly karen named it pteroas in feather or wing dad asked no as in dactyl karen said he laughed surely so i see you hit it off well with the princess for sure a rug said thats good the king agreed nodding in a signifi cant manner yon ill wind yes karen said getting shy again had she been too familiar with princess ida everythings fine ida said im so glad to have a name for my moon karen was relieved that she had committed no offense but she suspected that there was something important she was missing jim baldwin saw his daughters cute confusion and wished he could ease it butthis was not the occasion she had done far better work than she knew i think we must be on our way he said we thank you king dor for your assistance it is we who thank you for yours the king replied graciously and his buxom greenhaired wife smiled agree ment you did not need to risk your family to help xanth jim glanced at trenita imp who now sat on queen irenes shoulder i think we did after the hospitality of the imps which presaged yours trenita smiled it still will not be easy the king said our best hopes go with you yeah we dont want to get blown away the kings crown remarked lets go d mentia said floating toward the exit she had finally managed to get her clothing on straight which was just as well a demoness might not mind what she showed as long as it wasnt her underwear but it could be distracting r piers anthony they followed her out the madness had intensified jim could feel its oppressive effect despite the protective am biance of the castle indeed this was unlikely to be easy despite their seeming assurance that they would succeed the king had made that plain ordinarily such a trip with a demon guide would be routine but with the stirredup magic dust changing things nothing was certain that applied to idas reassurance too princess idas sorceressclass talent was the idea whatever she believed was true but the idea had to come from elsewherefrom someone who didnt know idas magic that was what limited it the elf girl jenny had cleverly solicited karens innocent endorsement of their mission and ida had agreed which meant that they would indeed succeedif the rising madness didnt interfere no one knew exactly how the madness might affect idas talent so the outcome was not after all sure but he did not care to tell the children that mary and sean knew but they would keep silent too they got into the rv with the demoness taking the front passenger seat so she could show him the way as nimby had before the sultry creature was now in a tight clingy sweater and a tooshort skirt he wasnt sure whether she was trying to flirt with him or provoke mary or if this was her natural manner of appearance among humans south along the main enchanted path she said and move rapidly because the dust is getting worse how can you tell he asked her not that i doubt you but with the effects of the dust could that lead you astray no this is why they summoned me you see i am only half a demoness i am metrias worser half and nor mally i am slightly crazy as you may have noted but i have been in madness before and found that it reverses my nature making me increasingly sane i feel that sanity closing in now you are mundanes so arent much af fected by it but the surrounding effects will bring mis chief it is best to avoid as much of it as you can half a demoness who got sane while others got mad yon ill wind this land never ceased to produce novelties how did you come to separate from your better half metria was always a mischievous creature then she got married to a mortal inherited half his soul and fell in love in that order i her soulless crazy aspect couldnt stand it so i fissioned off and had my own adventure unfortunately it led me into madness and i suffered sanity i came to accept metrias situation and must confess her halfdemon baby son is cute so we two halves have rec onciled but because i alone among regular xanaly crea tures can handle the madness the king asked me to help and because the rising dust makes me unconscionably sen sible i agreed you will be able to trust my judgment when you cant trust your own well i am becoming accustomed to trusting the judg ment of inscrutable creatures after nimby who nimby is a striped dragon with the head of a donkey who knows what is going on he assumes human form and travels with chlorine a beautiful young woman who was sent to guide us by the good magician i dont know her either whats her talent poisoning water garden variety but that dragon you describethere must be some mistake he might be able to turn human or to know things but not both theres a pretty strict limit of one talent per person i think he said that one was a talent and the other was inherent maybe but im pretty sane now and that sounds wrong there is something strange about nimby jim laughed there is something strange about this whole land better than the excruciating dullness of mundania to that he had no answer they made good time and in due course mentia indi cated the tumoff road now were leaving the enchanted path she reminded him it may get nasty piers anthony i know there had been a time two days or two millennia ago when he would have laughed at magic now he felt a dread respect for it but instead of turning ugly the scenery turned beautiful hey look at the flowers karen cried peering out her window those look like carnations mary said a whole field of them mentia looked uhoh those look like reincamations growing wild and strong in the madness jim experienced a chill what magic will they do regular ones arent too bad the demoness said se riously polk sniff one and have a strong memory of a loved one if they sniff several together they may actually see and hear the loved one but this is a whole broad expanse strengthened by the magic dust i think you should try to avoid smelling them close the windows he called back to the others but he was too late david had opened his the thick perfume of the flowers was circulating in the vehicle suddenly jim saw his father standing by the road wav ing he slowed to pick him up he hadnt seen his father since five years ago when keep moving mentia said dont stop get on out of here but thats my father jim protested drive onor ill drive for you that jolted him out of it for a moment a demoness can drive an rv metria learned how last year so i know it too this thing is similar to a pickup truck keep moving his father had disappeared and he realized that it had indeed been an illusion his father was dead you didnt stop for grandpa sean said go back dad hes dead jim said sean was set back i forgot thats weird oh like a wraith karen said dont believe them yon ill wind a woman appeared on the road oh theres my god mother mary said i must talk to her woofer growled no jim said grimly but we cant leave her here she said releasing her seat belt and getting up shes not real he said accelerating jim im surprised at you how can you say such a thing hes right mom karen said its the magic dont be fooled then they drove beyond the field of flowers and the fragrance faded mary returned to her seat of course that couldnt have been her she said but she seemed so real they do mentia said but if you stop for them at this strength of fragrance you might never get away again as soon as you escaped the ambiance of one flower an other would get you probably they would have gotten you anyway had you been afoot but in your rapidly moving truck you were too fast for them thats why i said not to stop you were indeed the sensible one jim agreed mary nodded appreciating the ability of the demoness sense was likely to be what they needed most in the next few hours a mountain loomed before them thats it mentia said we cant drive up that jim protested glancing at her and catching a considerable eyeful of her burgeoning cleavage where had her sweater gone apparently she had changed into something more comfortable in her magic fashion this is a recreational vehicle not a tank the demon path is inside i will guide you to it that is why i am here sorry i forgot was that another effect of the dust of madness no probably merely the distraction of her changingly provocative form wheres the entrance piers anthony follow me she floated from her seat through the windshield and ahead of the rv keen creature sean remarked peering ahead not your type mary said a bit sharply sean did not argue but it was clear that he believed that anything that looked like that was his type jim couldnt blame him the demoness was about as well endowed a creature as was possible without stretching the masculine imagination beyond repay those entities who could choose their appearance usually seemed to choose impres sively chlorines appearance was chosen after all actually he was glad to have seans reaction because the boy had been unnaturally quiet since his cipse call with the goblin dam not evincing much interest in anything jim was afraid he had suffered a concussion or some other hidden injury when the water swept him away now he was reverting to normal an excellent sign mentia led them to a large old tree she pointed to its trunk jim now having had some experience with such things drew the rv slowly up to that trunk which seemed to expand and into it sure enough it was an illusion covered aperture an entry into the mountain they entered a dark tunnel jim turned on the head lights they speared through mentias clothing silhouet ting her shapely body then the clothing thickened and the effect was lost the demoness floated back through the windshield and into her seat this spirals up inside the mountain just keep going she paused those bright lights caught me by surprise did you see outline no panties jim said quickly she relaxed we do try to honor the conventions we dont show panties to anyone we arent prepared to se duce its nice to have standards jim agreed she didnt show pantiesbut she did show everything else it seemed that in xanth the underclothing counted for more than what it covered how is it that the demons maintain this tunnel when you can float wherever you wish to go yon ill wind actually its an old vole burrow she confided but we find it handy when we want to spy on the ceremonies of the winged monsters they can see us in the outer air but not in here there must be mighty big voles in xanth as big as this truck in the old days she agreed today only the diggle is this big and it normally doesnt make tunnels it simply phases through the rock without disturbing it the passage ahead came to a halt in a pile of rubble so did jim perforce there must have been a cavein he said regretfully let me check she floated out again she phased through the rock then her arm came back beckoning him forward so it was more illusion he nudged forward and passed through the seeming pile of stones beyond the tunnel opened up again curving up and out of sight the long climb was upon them mentia floated back this time she didnt pass through the windshield but came to the far door she gestured to come in her cleavage was so full it threatened to burst its boundaries ill get that sean said coming forward he opened the door and the demoness started to enter then a second demoness appeared this one shot through the windshield close that door she cried startled sean paused looking from one to the other both looked the same except for the lower decolletage of the one at the door two of you he asked then fangs sprouted in the mouth of the one at the door she hissed and her head dived for seans arm the one inside extended one arm to twice its natural human length the hand intercepted the fanged face and shoved it back out the door close it she repeated thats a hostile phantasm but it looked just like you sean said shaken closing the door except no need to explain mary said tersely piers anthony it can be dangerous to judge by appearances mentia drew her body up to her arm so that all of her was by the seat and sat down yeah karen said from behind jim realized that the demoness had inadvertently taught sean a good lesson he hoped the boy would heed it in more normal circumstances whats the difference between a wraith and a phan tasm karen asked she was the one who had been led astray by wraiths so naturally she was concerned they are similar but phantasms are more versatile and malignant mentia said and they have some sub stance how come the spook had to come in the door while you go through the window david asked king dor arranged to have a protective spell put on this vehicle the demoness said im on your side or on xanths side so it lets me pass but the phantasms are enemies of the natural order so they are barred but if you let them in why not simply lock the doors and ignore all creatures outside the rv mary asked because you might want to let in a friend and the spell has no way to tell friend from enemy being unintelligent so has to go by your judgment if you decide to let some thing in then you overrule the spell sean was letting in that phantasm she glanced back at the young man dont let anything in unless your father or mother tell you to especially if it has unusual sex appeal or anything else thats evocative your lives may be at stake her sculptured decolletage had been replaced by a conservative but still quite attractive blouse got it sean agreed shaken but we were fooled too mary said the first time good point adults learned well from experience but jim had a concern of his own when you go out we cant tell you from the imitations how will we know its yon ill wind really you signaling us ahead and not a phantasm they could hurt us by misdirecting us and causing the rv to wreck um let me ponder the demoness became thought ful her head swelling to twice its normal size then she returned to regular beauty i think you will have to come out with me next time then you will know its me but then ill be at risk outside the enchantment i will try to protect you a demon has more power here than the phantasms do because they are intruders perhaps in normal times jim said but these are not normal times the dust is strengthening aberrant ele ments she glanced sidelong at him you may be mundane but you are catching on well he realized that this was a compliment and he was un wisely flattered of course appearances were not to be trusted but she looked just like a supremely beautiful young woman and her favor sidestepped his rational mind to register on a deeper level mundane physics can de velop some strange aspects particularly at the quantum level he said i am accustomed to thinking rationally in seemingly irrational settings in my normal state i would not admire that she mur mured implying that in her present artificially sane state she did if mary had been concerned about seans fascination with chlorine now she would have a similar concern about her husbands reaction to mentia with perhaps some reason he had learned to tune out the occasional wiles of lovely coeds who tended to admire intelligent men or who merely wanted higher grades but the magic ambiance was laying siege to his judgment and his fancy was testing its limits the phantasms were not the only threat this mission posed the endless turn of the upward spiral brought them sud denly to a division in the tunnel one fork curved away left the other right which one he asked piers anthony ive got to check mentia said floating out of her seat and a phantasm will imitate you and signal wrong he said even if i see you i wont know which one is the real you oh right you will have to come out with me and we shall have to maintain contact contact she smiled evidently well aware of his concerns well hold hands she extended her left hand to take his right then she floated through the windshield with only her forearm and hand remaining inside jim knew mary was watching but holding her peace there was after all good reason to hold mentias hand however incidentally suggestive it might be he opened the door and slid out and her arm slid with him through glass and metal without impediment yet her hand re mained solid and warm it was amazing how she could do that he would have thought that a solid hand could not be supported by an insubstantial wrist or arm curious he paused to pass his other hand through her seeming arm flesh verifying that it was insubstantial indeed the laws of magic were not those of regular physics then the arm abruptly firmed is there more of me you wish to touch she inquired dulcetly her blouse becom ing translucent ah no he said quickly embarrassed he closed the door and stepped out into the glare of the headlights still holding her hand he knew she was smirking she might be increasingly sane but her basic mischievous nature re mained they advanced to the fork he expected the left one to be the one because the spiral had been counterclockwise but there was solid rock there the passage was illusion he stroked his left hand across the cold hard surface amazed it still looked open it was as if a perfectly clean glass wall barred them from a real tunnel i would have driven into this one he said chagrined yon ill wind never take illusions on faith she said they walked to the other side and mentia put out her free hand thats what i thought she said jim reached for itand encountered another glass pane but they are both illusion she said now we check outside their range outside she led him on beyond the right fork aha she squeezed his hand its here he felt the streaked stoneand there was nothing il lusion stone he exclaimed illusions come in all types she said it can be as dangerous to mistake a passage for a wall as a wall for a passage but this is unusually sophisticated deception for phantasms suggesting that the dust has considerably enhanced them he said or that some more sapient entity is in volved exactly so we had better explore a bit more before trusting the truck to this passage she drew him through the seeming rock face and into the tunnel beyond this was completely dark i cant see he said sorry ill illuminate she began to glow the soft light seemed to emanate from her person rather than her clothing which made for some interesting effects since her clothing was demon stuff as well as her body he pre sumed the effects were intentional they walked on through the tunnel then jims foot landed on nothing and he plunged down through the sup posedly solid floor but the demonesss hand held his with surprising strength preventing him from falling all the way into the void the hand expanded to grasp his whole arm and she hauled him back up he scrambled to set foot back on the real as opposed to the apparent surface missed and found himself caught in her embrace her body was exceedingly sexy against his well now she mur mured piers anthony she moved back carrying him and his feet found the rock he stepped into her and through her emerging be hind her all of her body was exactly as solid or permeable as she chose it to be thank you he said as he recovered his balance and mental equilibrium for it was clear that however seductive she chose to be she had in this instance elected to put him safely onto land she could have embarrassed him in the process far more than she had there is a time for games and a time for business she said we can afford no distractions until this mission is done thereafter she shrugged turning to face him she still glowed but now her clothing was opaque she had not let go of his right hand her left had passed through herself in the same fashion as he had this is evidently not the correct route either he said there are occasional side passages she said we arent sure what the voles used them for but assume it was to allow them to pass one another presumably they had no problem with falling being natural earthboring creatures the main passage is sure to be somewhere i hope so he said still shaken from the narrowness of his escape they walked back toward the illusion barrier from this side it looked like dirty glass it was evidently a oneway illusion the rv was visible but its lights were muted as if filtered through thick curtains mentia paused before we step back into sight of the others she said extending her right hand toward him if i may may what he asked uncertainly straighten you up somewhat her hand became a small mirror in which his hair and clothing showed tou sled and mussed then her hand became a large comb which she ran through his hair then it became a hand again as she straightened his collar she was prettily busi nesslike reminding him oddly of mary your wife might otherwise misunderstand yon ill wind oh thank you he waited while she put him in or der they still held hands after what he bad seen of the phantasms he was not about to let go of her how is it that you have such sensitivity for family relations for two years i have been the third member of a two person couple she said smiling darkly that has been instructive in several ways third parties are not necessar ily welcome for sure he was embarrassed and in a moment re alized why i apologize for wronging you in my thoughts mentia oh you thought i might do this she asked inno cently and suddenly stepped in close pressed her provoc ative breasts and hips firmly against him and kissed him for shame for shame he echoed weakly though fleeting it had been a kiss of such competence that it left him light headed naturally i wouldnt do a thing like that she said drawing back and disengaging a thigh that had somehow gotten wedged between his legs what do you think i ama demoness im afraid i did think something like that he agreed this creature was no one to play games with but if i chose to i believe i could make an impres sion she murmured i apologize for my apology she laughed you have a certain poise dont be em barrassed ithat is metriahave in my day seduced a married king i am satisfied to have you know what i could do and am not doing in the interest of xanths welfare rationality can be such a curse a curse he agreed they stepped on through the veil of illusion and into the glare of the headlights jim shaded his eyes from the brightness and was able to make out the faces of his fam ily peering through the windshield he waved several piers anthony hands waved back they must have been concerned when he disappeared they walked across to the other side of the tunnel and there they found another hidden passage they explored it far enough to know that it was the real one then returned to the rv jim opened the door and climbed in the de moness floating around and through him to the adjacent seat he pulled the door closed were sure glad youre back dad sean said you wouldnt believe what the phantasms were pretending try me jim said as he eased the vehicle forward and to the left into the illusion rock wall they pretended they were you and her kissing da vid said eagerly but we knew it wasnt so cause there were five or six couples and wed seen you go through the wall and we knew you wouldnt do anything like that any way karen chimedin thanks for your confidence jim said shaken in a new manner the phantasms had tried to tell on him they were getting more clever by the hour trying psychological tricks when the physical illusions didnt work the success of this mission was by no means assured in fact then familys survival was not assured this sometimes pleasant land of magic was becoming steadily more deadly after that the trip became less eventful apparently the phantasms had tried their best but failed so gone in search of easier prey the motor heated with the continued strain of the climb but didnt reach the point of quitting to his relief at length they emerged on a moderately sized plain and came to a stop it was early afternoon the wind was fierce there was a reddish haze the sky itself seemed to bend and sway as if painted on a some what flexible dome and the sun wavered in place the magic dust was kicking up worse and the plain was a mesa with a frighteningly abrupt and deep dropoff now we have to gather wood straw dried animal yon ill wind dung anything that will bum jim said we are going to make a big fire great david cried he loved fires the bigger the better dont go near the edge mary called as the boy dashed off awwww david and karen cried together but they heeded the warning because the drop was awesome is mere going to be enough to bum sean asked this place seems pretty barren he seemed to be getting subdued again he tended to look around as if searching for something indefinite king dor said wed get some help jim reminded him he hoped the king was right somethings coming mary said but i fear not good jim looked i fear you are right i think those are har pies the awful creatures were battered by the winds but compensating heading for the plateau from the south jim looked around for sticks that could be used as clubs or staffs they were going to need defensive weapons unless they retreated to the rvin which case they wouldnt get their job done ill check mentia said she assumed the form of a huge harpy and flew out to meet the dirty birds something else mary said this was from the north and it was huge in fact it looked very much like a roc no sticks would beat off that monster even the sanctity of the rv might not suffice against a creature that size look at that sean exclaimed a basket it must be chlorine and nimby mary said relieved they are supposed to rejoin us here carried by a roc jim agreed remembering with all the other distractions it slipped my mind the dust does that she agreed he wasnt quite cer tain what she might mean by it and didnt care to inquire piers anthony the monstrous bird glided to a landing on the middle of the mesa carefully setting the basket down from it three emerged chlorine nimby and a splendidly spar kling huge chick the roc folded her wings and settled down like a huge hen but her eyes were watchful they were the eyes of a mother or a guardian jim had seen that look on mary on occasion the family convened and approached the new arrivals as a group remember jim warned the children that bird is sapient she understands everything we say and she is a figure of considerable importance in xanth treat her like royalty for this was one of the things that king dor had explained there would be no threats to their mis sion as long as roxanne roc was present it wasnt just the power of the roc which was formidable it was that it was backed by all the other winged monsters of xanth and indeed most other creatures including humans chlorine greeted them with hugs that even the children didnt seem to mind she wore an incongruously mundane windbreaker jacket that did not succeed in making her less attractive then she made introductions this is roxanne roc the third most important bird in xanth she made a little bow to the roc who nodded her head affirmatively and this is sim short for the simurgh junior the second most important bird in xanth roxanne is minding him for his mother the most important bird the simurgh we all will protect sim with our lives if necessary yes jim agreed for the family chlorine turned to face the roc and this is the mun dane family baldwin jim mary sean david karen woofer midrange and tweeter may the animals play with sim the huge head nodded jim was surprised by the trust shown but realized that roxanne too had been briefed the three pets were now intelligent and disciplined and they also understood the lustrous chick stepped forward he was about woofers size and his every baby feather gleamed irides yon ill wind cently in the sunlight as he moved cheep woof meow peep then all four fell over laughing it seemed that either they had shared some animal joke or were all in excellent humor now menda appeared coalescing from a swirl of smoke oh hello roxanne she said im menda me trias worser half we met during your trial the huge head nodded again remembering the demoness turned to jim the harpies arent here to fight theyre bringing wood for the fire word has really gotten around nobody wants xanth to be blown away indeed jim saw that the dirty birds were swooping over the edge of the mesa and dropping sdcks of wood that would be a great help thank them fy us he said i did they say that more winged monsters will be coming with more fuel this is their sacred meeting place and its under chronic truce no quarreling here unless someone really asks for it so you wont have to fear the monsters but dont push your luck thats a relief mary murmured she had been watching the children and pets somewhat warily sxactly as the roc was they were playing a game of lines and boxes in the sand taking turns drawing the lines and scratching in the xs and all were similarly intent if you will excuse me i have a job to do jim said mary looked doubtful i should help you she said but she was evidently reluctant to leave the children and pets unattended ill help you menda said so will i chlorine said then of course sean was interested and nimby but mary did not look reassured menda floated over to her this is the safest place in xanth for children she said roxanne guards sim and anyone sim associates with and all other winged monsters piers anthony and most of the rest of xanth supports her in this we know jim said but mary wanted more specific reassurance she looked at nimby who nodded then i will join you she said clearly relieved so was jim it was not that he minded the proximity of lovely creatures like mentia and chlorine but he felt easier if mary was also close and he shared marys concern about sean who was too obviously intrigued by those same creatures neither of whom was exactly shy with men they went to the growing pile of wood the harpies had gone but other winged monsters were bringing more dragons griffins and some he couldnt exactly classify some were of considerable size but they were all business they dropped their loads and flew on but the wind was still rising and the haze of magic dust was thickening he saw how it affected the flying crea tures who were becoming increasingly unsteady as if on mindaltering drugs he felt just enough of the effect to appreciate its likely potency on the magical creatures a significant part of the reason this mission had been given to a mundane family was its lack of magic not only could jim and the others not do any magic they were resistant to its effects so like the sane demoness they could carry through while others were going crazy many hands did make light work soon they had a fine bonfire going sending up an enormous plume of roiling smoke now the winged monsters brought buckets of wa ter which they dumped at jims directive this made a huge hissing and added swirling steam to the mix the result was a burgeoning cloud that loomed over the plateau and extended beyond it as the wind tugged at its fringes magic dust infused the cloud animating it a gaseous face formed glaring around jim would have thought he was imagining it but the others saw it too make a noise he yelled at it show us what youre made of fogface for even the inanimate even illusions had feel yon ill wind ings in this magical realm he had come to appreciate that when he had seen sean and karen employ mockery to drive off ugly illusions the cloud obliged by rumbling you can do better than that he told it what kind of a wisp of vapor are you this time the roar of sound was explosive it could surely be heard for many miles which was the point then there was a sound behind him of a different na ture he looked and saw roxanne roc taking off wheres she going he asked alarmed nimby wrote a note che and cynthia centaur are get ting blown away by the ill wind so roxanne is rescuing them che is sims tutor oh of course the sparkling chick would need compe tent education so had a centaur tutor and the wind was now so fierce and dusty that even the dragons had sought refuge on the mesa they had done their part the smoke steamdust cloud was now a hovering monster who is watching the children mary asked sharply who indeed they hurried across to where the children and animals were still engrossed in their game there was a huge dragon matron watching them wisps of fire show ing as she breathed it seemed that the roc had arranged for a substitute jim and mary turned back to the bonfire only in xanth would parents see a dragon looming over their children and depart with confidence then a speck appeared on the horizon it grew rapidly it was the roc clutching a tiny creature in each great set of talons as she came closer they saw that each creature was a young winged centaur one male the other female each would have been about eleven years old in human terms we had better meet them mary said jim agreed and they turned back roxanne landed simultaneously depositing the two cen taurs safely on the ground demoness mentia appeared piers anthony che and cynthia centaur she said introducing them jim and mary mundane we heard how you turned back to help xanth cyn thia said she was a pretty thing whose brown tresses matched her equine hide she was barechested but not yet developed che looked at the child and pet game this may be an opportune time for a math lesson he remarked youre teaching that chick math already jim asked surprised he is a very bright bird and he has a great deal to learn che said he has to know everything in the universe by the time hes mature cynthia added jim nodded agreed that is a great deal but can you teach math when your judgment is being distorted by the growing madness quantum math che said insanity is an asset to that study startled jim had to agree centaurs were indeed ex tremely intelligent say wheres gwenny goblin mentia inquired dont you have to be her companion she released me from that obligation che said she is grownup now with good vision and posture and she governs goblin mountain so is in no further danger of awkward questioning but we shall always remain close friends and i expect to visit her often sim should like to meet her too in due course it works for me the demoness agreed the centaurs went to join the young folk and jim and mary returned to the bonfire do you think this is going to work she asked worriedly if it doesnt well be left stranded on a mesa with no safe way down he said evasively she did not challenge that they came to the fire which was still burning smokily but now the wind was so strong that the cloud was being blown away as fast as it formed yon ill wind had it been enough there would be no more wood the winged monsters could no longer dare fly and were now too crazy anyway the madness had them writhing on the ground and growling at nothing actually chlorine was looking somewhat distorted though nimby seemed unaffected jim kept seeing fantas tic things with his peripheral vision which faded when he looked directly at them the madness was laying siege to them all look chlorine cried fracto and there on the horizon to the north was the edge of a looming black cloud fracto was coming the manifes tation of a rival cloud had gotten the mean mists attention the magic dust enhanced fracto too in two and a half moments the baleful cloud expanded to ugly proportions purple blisters swelled and burst graygreen depths turned brownblack they became malignant eyes a cruel mouth formed there was a whistle of wind as it inhaled getting ready to blow out an icy blast it was time to act fracto jim called cumulo fracto nimbus king of clouds listen to me i have a deal for you the cloud hesitated surprised the blast did not come xanth is in trouble jim called xanth needs your help the mouth resumed inhaling fracto did not care about xanths welfare we can offer you something really nice jim called the cloud paused again the eyes narrowed a curl of mist formed in the shape of a question mark romance another storm onlyfemale this sounded crazy but it was a crazy situation king dor had reviewed it carefully with him and now he retained sufficient sanity to carry it through not this smoke cloud that was only to get your attention a real storm the strongest xanth has seen ideal for you the spongy face showed definite interest fracto seldom had any prospect for compatible companionship he must piers anthony be really hungry for it the mouth formed a perfect and a gust of wind emerged he was asking who her name is happy bottom jim called shes from mundania the cloud face recoiled no wait she is no longer mundane she has swept up a lot of magic dust and become magic but she doesnt understand it doesnt know how to use her new power she is wasting it with random blowing not realizing her potential shes becoming so strong shes going to blow xanth away then shell fade of course but with proper instruction she could leam to be the kind of magic storm she could be with all that magic dust and turn xanthian but she will need a teacherand only you have the ca pacity to teach her this only you can tame this shrew only you can calm yon ill wind if you do you will have a wonderful female of your kind i leave the rest to your imagination he wasnt sure just how much imagination a cloud could have but it was clear that this cloud was conscious fracto considered then the mouth formed another shape more like ow that would be how we must work together jim said relieved that the dialogue was going well we must push happy bottom away from the concentration of magic dust but we cant make her go in any particular direction you must do that by luring her into the region of air once she is there she will not know how to escape until you teach her how she will be yours to seduce the cloud considered fracto was definitely interested but obviously uncertain about trusting a mortal creature the mouth formed a windy that would mean true how could he prove he was speaking the truth he couldnt blame the cloud for being suspicious fracto had no friends and a mundane mortal was the least likely per son to believe fortunately king dor had prepared him with this answer too here is a contract he called un yon ill wind rolling a large poster signed by the good magician him self a gust of wind swept the paper out of his hand it flut tered through the air toward the cloud but wasnt being lost fracto was reading it then the face changed it became less threatening more agreeable the mouth opened essss it blew fracto had agreed to the deal now all they had to do was work out the details jim settled down to those explaining how they would take chlorine behind happy bottom and use the wind breaker to drive her forward fracto would beckon her to ward the region of air in north central xanth it would be a job but they should be able to herd and lure her there if they made no mistakes he was buoyed by the progress already made soon enough they would complete this mis sion and then be able to go home to florida he looked forward to the return of familiarity willow sean stamped out the last of the fire in his section near the edge of the plateau and turned to look after the dissipating trail of smoke they had done it they had made the signal and summoned the cloud and done the deal of course there would still be some work for someone before the ill wind was contained but the comer had been turned xanth would be saved and they would go home it had been interesting and even fun but he was ready to return to dull mundania yet there was something lacking why should he be piers anthony ready to go home when lovely chlorine was here and that supersexy demoness mentia he should want to see as much of both of them as possible though he knew that neither was for him they were just dream material pinup fanciesbut when had unavailability ever stopped him be fore he should want to catch every last glimpse he pos sibly could yet he didnt somehow he had lost interest oh he was showing some interest but that was because the other members of the family had begun to glance at him strangely and he realized that they would figure he was sick if he didnt strive for every last glimpse of hidden female flesh but his heart was no longer in it was it the rising madness in the air it didnt affect mundanes much because of their determined unmagical ity but it did have some effect he was feeling light headed and some things he knew were straight like the surface of the ground seemed wavy or insubstantial but that was perception it shouldnt deplete his normal young man interest in beautiful women neither should it give him an inexplicable sense of loss he walked to the far side of a lingering smudge of smoke and used its cover to answer a brief call of nature in a moment he faced back toward the rv and the others he stepped around a deep hole in the ground that might or might not be illusion his job here was done it was time to rejoin the family then something appeared at the brink of the dropoff catching the comer of his eye he looked realizing that one of the monsters might be returning from a scouting flight for an instant he thought it was a harpy for it was a winged female but then he realized that its body was fully human and clothed it was a winged girl she rose above the plateau level and moved forward now he saw that she was terminally tired her wings were fluttering weakly and her head was lolling she had ex hausted her strength flying up to the mesa in this stiffening wind yon ill wind her dainty feet touched the ground her wings folded and she fell to her knees sean went to help her she was so delicate so vulner able that he had to do something are you all right he asked extending one hand her weary head turned she looked into his face sean she cried and collapsed into the hole he had just avoided seans whole world changed in that instant willow he cried and leaped in after her he caught her as they landed on a pile of soft debris that glowed slightly his mind was reeling oh sean you remember she breathed i feared you would not you called my name he said everything came back but how could i ever have forgotten you walked through a forget whorl she said i followed you here now i know what i was missing he said it was you willow i love you he kissed her and savored the overwhelming sweetness of the returning memory they had stopped where the water flooded the trollway the goblins had dammed the crimea river causing it to back up and drown out the bridge and road so that the rv couldnt safely pass dad had taken the branch of super cherry bombs down toward the dam then left them with sean and mom while he went ahead to explore the dam for the best place to put the charge but he had gotten caught by the goblins they had been going to float the bombs down to the right spot so as to be well clear of the explosion but when dad got caught sean knew he couldnt wait for that david made a distraction so that sean could do what he had to do so he grabbed the whole branch of cherries and made for the dam and just tossed them on it and dived for cover the blast had thrown him away stunning him but he must have landed in the water because suddenly he was piers anthony choking and floundering fortunately he was a good swim mer so after a moment of disorientation he managed to stroke strongly for the shore but he didnt know exactly where the shore was rush ing dirty water was everywhere carrying him along there were branches in it from the blown dam jostling and get ting in the way weakened by the shock of the close ex plosion he was tiring where was the shore a figure flew above him it was a large birdno a girl a winged girl here she cried pointing ahead she must know so he followed her and soon threaded his way through the maze of debris to the shore but in the process he wore himself out the adrenaline that had kept him going drained away andhe sank down in the muck at the edge the girl flew down to help him you must get clear because more is coming she said she put her little hands under his shoulders and tried to lift him up but instead her feet slipped in the mud and she landed beside him thoroughly grimed your wings he exclaimed appalled the nice white ness was hopelessly soiled i can wash them come on she tried again to lift him up putting her arm around his waist hurry now he heard a change in the background noise of the flowing water indeed the channel was shifting it was probably cutting a more direct course through the terrain and would catch him again he hauled himself up with her help and staggered on her body was quite slender and her support was more moral than physical but he did ap preciate it they reached a steep bank and used saplings to haul themselves up just as the water surged through behind them they were safe for the moment thanks he said i probably would have drowned yes i didnt know who you were but it didnt seem right to let you drown when i could help she paused cocking her head who are you yon ill wind i am sean baldwin sean from where he smiled thats my surname your sirname are you royal he laughed far from it im mundane she shrank away mundane well that doesnt mean im a bad person he said it doesnt you must have heard some badstories about mun danes we arent all like whatever youve heard i hope not she said he looked at her under the gobs of mud she was a pretty young woman with fair hair to her waist tiny hands and feet and rather well proportioned in between her face was elfin with enormous green eyes please i hope to persuade you that you havent done wrong to rescue me from the torrent will you tell me who you are oh of course she said flushing i am willow elf youre an elf like jenny jenny where is her elm elm her elf elm all elves associate with particular elms thats how we are identified i dont think she has an elm he said shes from the world of two moons no elm she must be strange indeed well she does have pointed ears and four fingers willow held up one hand which definitely had five digits then touched an ear which was round it must be a very odd world all xanth elves are like me except for some things oh what things well my tree is a winged elm so we have wings unlike other elves my tree is very large so we are very large large you seem beautifully petite to me large for an elf most are far smaller than we are they are also bound much more closely to their trees piers anthony bound to their trees you dont know remember im mundane i am supremely ignorant oh of course she agreed seriously all elves are bound to their elms close in they are very strong but they weaken as they go away from their trees until they are too weak even to live so they have no territorial am bitions but even an ogre would hesitate to try to abuse an elf elm because the elves there would be stronger than he was you are weak away from your tree yes but its not nearly so pronounced for flying elves so we can go quite far i think its because our tall tree presents a direct line of sight far afield with no interfer ence by mountains houses or vegetation nevertheless we are subject to the constraints of distance at the edge of xanth i would hardly be able to stand while beside my elm i could carry you in the air with one hand the vari ation is much less extreme than for other elf species and it enables us to fly freely my elm is in east central xanth so im inbetween here neither strong nor weak other wise i might have been able to help you more you helped me enough he said i really appreciate it i used cherry bombs to destroy the goblin dam but got caught by the rush of water we dont like goblins very well she said we dont like them at all he looked around the rushing water was subsiding i had better get back to my family and i had better get back to my elm she said thank you again for helping me i dont know how to repay you oh i do not seek repayment she said flushing again it was a thing of the moment normally we dont interact with humans at all were very shy but i couldnt let you drown i understand i would have done the same for you had yon ill wind you been the one in trouble and not just because youre a pretty girl oh she cried flushing much worse im sorry he said quickly i didnt mean to be of fensive nobody ever called me pretty before im a quite or dinary female of my kind and im covered with mud oh he realized that she had not been joking about being shy maybe you just look better to me because you helped me and the mud is my fault is there a pool or something nearby where we could wash up before going our separate ways i mean he was concerned about re turning to his family as dirty as he was because mom would throw a fit about the upholstery in the rv but he also found himself not too eager to leave this interesting creature immediately it was a long shot but he might get to see more of her if they washed up together i did see a pool close by she said if you dont mind the delay i dont mind so she led the way to the pool she had spied it was small but attractive with sparkling clear water willow began to remove her dress then hesitated i have heard that mundanes are veryi dont mean to be offensive butdo you object if i strip not at all he said gallantly he remembered the time he had skinnydipped with friends was he going to get to do it with this lovely little lady do you object if lalso of course not how else can you get clean he laughed relieved no way else but i warn you i wont be able to help looking at your body she smiled and pulled her dress off he wondered about her lack of reticence about her panties but in a moment understood she wore none in xanth it seemed nakedness was no problem just underclothing her nudity was not only natural but exquisite it was the way he imagined chlorine would look only willow was more well wil piers anthony lowy suddenly he liked slendemess very well so he pulled off his clothing and joined her in the pool quickly because he did not want to stand exposed and maybe embarrass himself with a male reaction the water was just right neither hot nor cold it caressed his bare skin in a special manner making it feel wonderfully good willow turned to face him sweeping her hair behind so that her small but perfect breasts were clear shall i wash your back she asked innocently meeting his gaze for the first time since entering the water then she froze sean froze too he had been admiring willows body and face now that admiration exploded into an over whelming emotion beautiful she was ravishing it was as if she were framed in glorious light with the sweetest possible music playing in the background oh no she cried its a love spring a love spring he had heard those mentioned you mean were but there was no need to say more for he already knew it was true he loved her i never thought she said chagrined dodo you feel the same way i do he asked yes she said moving toward him i love you butthiswe cant and i love you he said meeting her halfway though we are of two different worlds we shouldnt do this she said putting her arms around him his own arms circled her passing beneath the feathery softness of her wings i know he kissed her half the dreams he might ever have had were realized in that moment after an eternity she drew her face away just enough to speak you are mundane i am magical we can not be together how can we be apart he kissed her again and she met him avidly in time the spell will fade she said as they broke for breath how much time yon ill wind she considered about four years i think but often the magic love is replaced by natural love in that time so there may be no escape other than separation i couldnt stand that he was about to kiss her again but this time she beat him to it neither could i she said after another precious pause oh willow i know this is all magic but idont even want to say what i want to do with you that was the other half of his dreams not yet realized i want to do it too she said the storks get a lot of business from love springs but i beg you to wait while we consider alternatives anything you ask of me i want to do he said he made a supreme effort and withdrew from her but i cant stop loving you i am making the greatest effort of my life to be ob jective she said ii believe i would die in your realm youwould not be comfortable in mine your people and my people would oppose our union we would be pariahs our love cant be yet it is he said so we must end it i think there is a way oh willow we know it is not natural she said we know it cant work so we must be sensible if there is a way to get us out of love that is best that is best he echoed but i hate the very notion so do i but we are not brainless or soulless creatures we know what is right and we have the will to do right so we must do it he didnt want tobut he forced out the words how can we cancel our love i saw an old forget whorl nearby a what a fragment of the original forget spell on the gap chasm it broke up at the time of no magic but some whorls remain they are invisible but i could tell because piers anthony i saw insects fly though it and lose their bearings itmakes you forget yes they used to make any creature who passed through them forget everything but now they are good for only half an hour or so that is the creature forgets the last half hour he has lived and that amount of time would make us forget our love he exclaimed would make us forget our love she agreed sadly please understand this is not a thing i want to do but i think it is best for us both my rational mind is at war with my emotion and i have always prided myself on being sensible so have i he said so i guess we shouldnt do anything that we might regret when we are out of love yes im glad you understand i understand that i dont want to mess up your life and if loving you will do that i should try to stop loving you he smiled grimly but it gripes me that maybe the hardest noblest thing i will ever do in my lifei wont remember she nodded agreeing about the irony for them both lets get clean she said the spring can not do any thing more to us then we can go to that whorl yes he was clamping down as hard as he could on his emotion but you know i think if i had gotten to know you without the love spring i could have loved you anyway because you are a remarkably smart and sensible woman as well as being lovely thank you she said as she scrubbed his back with her gentle hands observing your restraint when i know the desire you feel i suspect i could have loved you too despite your origin and you are not unhandsome thank you he turned and she turned and he did her back working carefully around her lovely wings and splashed water on the feathers until they were clean too then they both ducked under the surface to get their hair clean finally they hauled their clothing into the water and rinsed it and donned it wet yon ill wind they waded out of the spring and willow led the way to the forget whorl it was as she had said invisible but he believed she knew whereof she spoke who goes first he asked half hoping she would change her mind i can readily fly home now that my wings are clean but you are in a strange land i would prefer to watch and make sure you are safely reunited with your family before i go through that whorl then i will be able to be in peace i think so be it he looked at her but can weone last time she flung herself into his arms and kissed him several times then she hauled herself away now go quickly before i shame myself and do what i must not she said tears streaming down her cheeks he nerved himself turned away from her and strode toward the forget whorl part of him hoped it wouldnt work but it did work he said concluding his intense mem ory i found my way back to the rv and never thought of you again i know she said i watched you the tears he remembered were still on her face but why are you here he asked when i returned to the forget whorl it was gone she said i think it was in its last stage very faint and you used it up so i could not forget oh no he groaned i should have let you go first no my love i would not have you suffer so they kissed again but how is it that i remember now and why did you follow me once you complimented me on my sensibleness but perhaps it was unwarranted i was able to rein my emotions for the time we were first together but not thereafter i wanted you so much she shrugged i did try i flew home and talked to my family and to the elders of our tree they knew of no other forget whorl i could use piers anthony and they pointed out something i had not thought of that if the whorl was so close to extinction when you used it it might not have done the full job you might come to remember after some time had passed then i would have done you no favor so they suggested that i do two things first that i meet you again to see whether the forgetting held if the sight of me made you remember men you would have remembered later on your own but if you did not remember then the spell was holding and you would be safe it did not hold sean said it was weakening before i saw you i know that now yes for your sake i hoped it would hold but for my sake i hoped it would not i was shamefully selfish shamefully he agreed kissing her again but what now we still are not right for each other we still are not right she agreed i think we shall have to go to the good magician for the answer he surely has potions damn it he swore noting peripherally that he had managed to override the adult conspiracy on that one maybe it was because love was adult business we tried to do the right thing why must we try again is our love really so wrong not wrongunworkable she clarified you must return to your realm and i must remain in mine but hasnt this sort of thing ever happened before how do other forbidden couples work it out she smiled wanly when animals meet at a love spring they simply summon the stork and go their ways when human variants do they try to make the best of it but im not sure that those unions work out as well as normal love does sometimes there are unfortunate reper cussions but none of them have had the problem we do a xanthmundane liaison i would be willing to stay in xanth to be with you but you have no wings you cant fly you cant go where i go yon ill wind if you want to fly away from me i cant stop you he said and wouldnt if i could i would never want you to be tied down but i would be tied downby love she pointed out so i think the good magician is our alternative though he does charge horrendously for his information i suppose youre right but we cant do that until the present crisis is over first xanth has to be saved then our incidental problem can be dealt with are you being ironic you bet i am what do we do in the interim not what we would like to do the constraints are still upon us i wish we could just forget those she gazed levelly at him if it is your choice i will not deny you sean i know you wont he understood all too perfectly she could stop herself from thowing herself at him but would lack the will to resist his approach just as he could restrain himself but could never actually push her away if shebut i think i must deny myself lets get out of here at least i can introduce you to my folks but how could they approve of me how could they not well just have to explain the situation yes as i did to my people she said sadly they were horrified they understood getting caught in a love spring but not with a mundane they chided me for my carelessness sean laughed they were right you should have flown right past when you first saw me and let you drown how could i he shook his head you know youre not doing any thing to discourage my love youre a lovely person she flushed in that fetching way he remembered nei ther are you discouraging me they embraced and kissed again but then he forced himself to pull partway away if we dont get out of here piers anthony soon all our noble resolutions will count for nothing yes she grimaced cutely and pulled the rest of the way away he looked around the cave then up at the hole in the sky that was the cave entrance it was too high and the walls were too steep for them to reach he considered lifting her up on his shoulders but even so it was too high the cave was too narrow for her to spread her wings so she couldnt fly out either they were definitely stuck weve been here for maybe half an hour he said i wonder why my folks havent come to check on me thats true she agreed surprised she glanced at the eye on her wrist in fact an hour i was so glad to be with you again that lost all track of time surely they would not depart without you surely they would not he agreed it should have taken them maybe five minutes to realize i was gone and five more to check it is almost as ifyes there it is there what is a thyme bomb see theres the sprig of thyme she pointed to a driedup leaf lying on the cave floor let me guess sean said in xanth thyme plants affect time so when you get close to one yes usually the living plants slow things down and their seeds speed them up but when leaves get separated and dry out their effect reverses and they stretch time out in the manner of the seeds so time expands explosively in their vicinity and we call them thyme bombs usually they are harmless because all folk have to do is walk away from them but but we cant he finished so were stuck in the fast lane in a cave she corrected him gently he didnt bother to clarify his reference so how do we get away from it so we dont die of hunger before anyone finds us oh i can nullify it she said brightly i have a nap yon ill wind sack in my purse she produced a small purse and rum maged in it pulling out all manner of things clothing slippers fruits a mirror a fancy hat a bedroll and a col lection of pretty stones ah there it is she said draw ing out a strapped pack sean was amazed how can all that fit in that little purse its magic of course dont mundane women have purses sean remembered how much mom could carry in hers yes but if you have a complete change of clothing in there why didnt you use it when we came out of the pool instead of putting your wet things back on i knew you lacked a change of clothing so i did not wish to embarrass you how do i love thee he murmured let me count the ways i tried to count but there were too many ways she said even though i know its all just because of the love spring she opened the napsack and put the sprig of thyme in then she rolled up the napsack and put it back in her purse that should take care of it i dont understand he said why does putting it in there change anything because anything in a napsack sleeps she explained in fact i seldom put it on because then it makes me take a nap too but it is useful for storing perishable food as it wont spoil while sleeping and the thyme bomb has little effect while napping sean shook his head knapsacknapsack i keep for getting how things work in xanth but if our time is now normal how come i dont feel any different we didnt change she explained patiently the time around us did now we are aligned with the time outside thyme bombs normally speed time up tenfold so perhaps six minutes passed during our hour if it requires ten minutes for your family to find you piers anthony got it lets make our remaining three or four minutes count he held her and kissed her hey whatcha doing down there david called from above trust my little half brother to arrive at the least op portune time sean muttered turning her loose but he was glad to have been found im kissing my girlfriend punk he called up whats it look like like making time with a strange woman david called but its too dark down there to see any detail do you have your clothes on yes we have our clothes on sean called now go fetch some rope or something to haul us out of here okay the head disappeared he turned back to her quick lets finish our kiss willow laughed and obliged then the other members of the family were there at the cave entrance what happened dad called i fell in a hole with a girl sean called back gee karen called is she pretty yes willow blushed then dad was letting down a knotted rope weve got it anchored can you climb can you climb sean asked willow yes i have recovered from my fatigue and this is closer to my elm than we were before then you go up first ill wait till youre clear thank you she kissed him again quickly and put her hands on the rope he put his hands on her petite waist and helped her up he let go when she climbed beyond his reach he looked up to be sure she was all right but realized that it was now possible to see under her skirt and hastily averted his gaze in xanth it just wasnt done and he would never embarrass her in any way he could avoid even though he had seen the whole of her before and knew she didnt wear those forbidden panties he yon ill wind would look at her only when she wished him to because he loved her your turn dad called down sean grasped the rope and hauled himself up it was hard work and he realized that willow had climbed faster than he was she had not been fooling about the way her strength increased near her tree she was probably stronger than he was now despite her delicate physique he heaved himself up through the hole panting and dad caught him the whole family was there as well as chlorine and nimby the pets and sim and willow what happened dad asked i love her sean said before he thought we washed in a love spring back near the goblin dam a love spring chlorine said she was wearing what looked like a mundane windbreaker jacket but didnt you know we thought it was a regular pool willow helped me out of the rushing water she maybe saved my life but we both got all muddy so but you returned alone mom said i went through a forget whorl but she couldnt and when i saw her againit all came back it would have come back anyway before long i still love her we had better get back to the rv dad said i pre sume willow will join us yes she will sean said going to her we cant separate again the others hesitated but chlorine clarified the matter when two people meet at a love spring they are in love nothing else matters much not even species it is useless to object they must marry no willow said chlorine glanced at her you were not in the love spring i was in it i love him but i am a winged monster he is mundane we cannot marry monster david cried laughing piers anthony thats what they call themselves dolt karen said in superior fashion all the winged creatures it doesnt mean they are ugly then why did you follow him here chlorine asked willow i could not help it but if we go to the good magician we can get a potion to nullify the love we cant go anywhere until xanth is saved dad said after that of course willow said and he charges a years service or the equivalent chlorine pointed out im on service for him now how could sean do that when he has to return to mundania with his family i will serve his time too willow said no you wont sean protested you would never have gotten into this trouble if you hadnt stopped to help me im not sorry the memory will be worth it the memory of the love you will no longer have chlorine asked yes the love spring did it but i know he is worthy of it sean david asked incredulously ill serve my own time sean said but then you would have to stay in xanth chlorine pointed out he glanced at her she was still absolutely lovely and sexy but he no longer cared so so if you have to stay anyway why not stay in love with her sean was astonished she was right maybe take the potion after the service is done he said looking at wil low but she demurred if we are not to marry it would only be torture she said and i know you have business in your own world i am native i will serve the time for us both this is the practical thing yon ill wind she was right too yet it wasnt fair they were now at the rv i think willow will be with us for a while mom said briskly the rest of you show her the rv while jim and i discuss something outside sean was not sure that was good news but there was nothing to do but go along with it come willowwell show you our magic moving house i have seen it from afar willow said i do not mind where i am as long as i am with you chlorine shook her head if this is what a love spring offers im going to find one when im ready to marry you should sean agreed its total that was the understatement of the day complications mary got jim safely out of earshot of those in the rv that girl she said with wings he agreed as if he didnt know her concern they cant be together mary they cant be apart either theyre in love you know what i mean hes going to want to sleep with herand shell let him he nodded this is the nature of young love youre not taking this seriously he looked at her on the contrary im being realistic i have heard about those love springs they will not be denied when animals get into them jim were not animals in certain respects we are when it comes to piers anthony dont be impossible what are we going to do mary hes seventeen and shes about the same thats old enough its not old enough how old were we when thirtyone and twentynine our second marriages he reminded her how old were you the first time you had sex dont be uncouth sorry the first time you tried to signal the stork that has no relevance doesnt it i was seventeenseans age how about you fifteen she answered reluctantly but i didnt en joy it its allright only if you dont enjoy it thats not what i mean that girl would love to but she had to stop because he had already shot down that approach anyway it was different in our day yes we were teens now were mature fogies whose sexual energies are diminished so we can safely condemn contemporary teens for having our past urges i didnt say that then she made a counter sally did you bring the girl into your house and tell your par ents he laughed think i was suicidal they were just like usas we are now that stung but she plowed on are we to give them space in the rv toto share a bed with david and karen knowing that concept finally set him back point made but let me play devils advocate a moment there is no passion quite so strong as unrequited or unconsummated love isnt it possible that if we provide them with mundane antistork devices and let them indulge their passions they would get over that aspect and be able to make a more rational de cision when the time comes to separate yon ill wind did our indulgence cause us to reconsider marriage she asked evenly he raised his hands in a surrender gesture no i liked you even better after than before he pondered a moment we have not had long to observe them but it is my impression that they have not yet indulged they were alone less than ten minutes plus their bath in the love spring they resisted temp tation because they knew the relationship had no future i think that must have been mostly willows doing because sean never showed all that much maturity in decisions before she strikes me aswell as a woman who would be worthy of him in other circumstances wings or not no question mary agreed surprisingly shes a sensible and generous person what little i have seen of her so far i like very well but the fact is that they are not for each other being of different realms and different species and xanth is stricter about babies out of wedlock than the real world is but as you say young passions are strong how long could they hold out if we put them constantly together fifteen minutes so what do we do he sighed we move willow in with karen or chlo rine and sean with david we keep company with them constantly but im going to feel like a jailer it is necessary then satisfied with her victory she kissed him ill take that as a promise for the time we get alone he said to be sure they returned to the rv it was crowded because there were now nine people in it counting the demoness plus the pets at least the big chick had returned to his govern ess they and the dragons would remain on the mesa until the winds abated this had been the most remarkable me nagerie she had encountered even in imagination she was privately amazed at herself for taking it all in stride but piers anthony what else was she to do she was a long way from her specialty of archaic mundane languages jim took the wheel and she the front passenger seat the others were arranged all around the main section of the vehicle sean and willow were holding hands while david and karen were eagerly questioning them about everything especially love springs if david and i fell in a love spring would we fall in love karen asked yuckk david cried but willow had an answer i think not because you are not party to the adult conspiracy but you might quar rel less were you nekked together in that pool david asked yuck karen said for nuisance value yes naked sean answered we washed each others backs and thats all we did that last was for marys benefit she knew she appre ciated it except for kissing willow said jim nudged the rv forward he circled toward the de mon tunnel the passengers opened the windows and waved to the roc and dragons who napped a wing and snorted smoke or fire into the air respectively in response it had indeed been a good joint effort and successful but there was more to do mentia floated out through the metal in the unnerving way she had and stretched her arms impossibly wide to indicate the outline of the tunnel entrance which was oth erwise invisible jim steered for it and the vehicle seemed to sink into the solidlooking rock then the surface of the ground closed overhead and jim turned on the headlights to illuminate the curving tunnel the demoness caught by surprise again was shown in phenomenally full breasted nudity sans panties of course but recovered after too long a moment and formed a tight dress around her voluptuous torso a man could get to like xanth jim murmured in a tone just loud enough for her to hear yon ill wind oh mary said in a tone just loud enough for the demoness to overhear suppose she became a raving monster mentia obligingly became a raving monster with spikes at every joint and enormous dripping fangs ive been set up jim muttered as mary and mentia laughed the drive down was slow but uneventful the phantasms did not reappear when they emerged from the base it was evening do we have time to camp for the night jim called to chlorine in back she checked with nimby yes if we dont mind the madness well stay in the rv he said but well forage outside for food et cetera cetera willow asked he means natural functions sean said isnt everything natural poop david said then paused in surprise hey i got the bad word out no bleep the madness is overriding the adult conspiracy mentia explained but dont let it go to your head mary called se verely well i wouldnt want it to go there the boy retorted what a mess karen agreed but are you sure your face isnt made of it whats on my face nothing thats the way you look all the time things were getting back to normal mary was pleased to note in the rearview mirror that willow was blushing definitely a refined creature if only sean could meet someone like her in miami nimby directed them to a reasonable place and jim parked the rv pee break david cried reveling in the newfound freedom from bleeping they got out and spread out accomplishing their vari ous purposes and mentia found a good pie tree mary piers anthony would have preferred something more nutritious but had pretty much given up on that particular fight in this realm pies were simply too abundant and convenient and popu lar then they set up the rv for the night and neither sean nor willow made any objection to marys bedding assign ments they did indeed comprehend the risks of doing otherwise they settled down for sleep which wasnt ideal because of the presence of chlo rine nimby and willow their beds were all full so that she and jim had to sleep in the front seats jim simply slumped down with his pillow against the door and zonked out but it took her longer to settle down and naturally she heard something someone was stirring in the rv the sound was slight suggesting that whoever it was didnt want to disturb any one else was it a toilet call the children had been cau tioned not to go out alone because xanth really was dangerous especially at night the spell on the rv pro vided considerable security but that was no good outside mary was about to inquire but decided to keep quiet it wasnt that she was a snoop but she did want to know exactly what was going on there was too much about this magic land that was disturbing in the best of times and the dust of madness made it worse and night made it worse yet and the addition of that winged girl however nice a person she undoubtedly was made it even more so she loved sean without doubt the human signs were all over her but that was its own complication was she get ting up to go out for a solitary flying session or to be alone with sean there was little doubt what the two would do if they got alone together so maybe mary should follow them out just making her presence known and scotch that at the start the side door opened amazingly quietly and closed someone had exited the rv who she thought by the sounds that it was just one there had been no whispered yon ill wind dialogue that argued against sean and willow then who was it and why there was a light tap at her window she jumped caught by surprise the person far from hiding was signaling her she looked it was nimby oh he followed his own rules and certainly wasnt bound by theirs but what then of chlorine if nimby and chlorine wanted to indulge themselves together it certainly wasnt marys place to oppose it as long as it wasnt in sight of the children but chlorine hadnt left her bed mary could recognize her particular pattern of breathing nimby beckoned what could he want well she would find out he was a strange one and she knew he was really a dragon but she had no fear of him had he wished to do them any ill he had had countless opportunities cer tainly he wouldnt find her a romantic objectnot with chlorine there so it was something else she opened the door carefully and got out closing it as carefully behind her then she turned to face nimby yes she inquired in a low whisper for answer he became the donkeyheaded diagonally striped dragon this time she noticed two things she hadnt noticed before either she had been unobservant or he had changed she suspected the latter one change was that his scales were glowing outlining him in the darkness so that she had no trouble seeing him the other was that the scales in his center portion were formed into the shape of a saddle you want me to ride you she asked the equine head nodded he surely had a reason he seemed to know everything that went on in the vicinity so he must know something now the head nodded again why you can read my thoughts she exclaimed another nod so he had known she was awake and listening and had piers anthony come for her but why was there some danger one more nod and they could alleviate it by taking action now nod then they had better get busy she approached him and climbed into the saddle it was surprisingly comfortable there were projecting scales in front that served as perfect handholds surely by no coincidence even some below for her feet to rest on nimby was the perfect mount the pastel pink stripes turned red why nimby youre blushing she murmured because i compli mented your status as a mount embarrassed nod then nimby moved mary had had her youthful fling with horses so had a fair amount of experience riding nothing fancy but she was competent nimbys gait was oddthen less oddarid finally exactly like that of a good horse he was accommodating her memory of riding he was certainly easy to get along with they got up speed mary strained to see where they were going in the darknessand then nimbys eyes glowed brightly sending out beams of light as if they were headlights showing her everything ahead thank you she murmured patting a scale no wonder chlorine kept company with this versatile creature and he had made chlorine look the way she did he was really a remarkable entity just how powerful was his magic for a moment the dragon seemed nervous about some thing mary looked around but saw nothing dangerous and knew that nimby wouldnt let anything bad approach she returned to her chain of thought no potent magic wasnt necessary to explain nimby he was making the most of his shapechanging and mindreading abilities so seemed much more talented than he perhaps was possibly he drew on the mental powers of the person he was with thus enhancing his abilities that would explain a good deal he was probably a very specially talented animal yon ill wind who became more than that when associated with a human being nimby seemed to relax and now he reached his des tination there was a big old dead tree with a splintered trunk the wood looked firm and dry not rotten despite its evident age in fact it looked a bit like those two pieces of reverse wood that chlorine had reported using to nullify that nuisance machine that had captured woofer and tweeter nimby nodded reverse wood she asked startled you brought me here to fetch reverse wood nod mentia appeared what are you two up to in the dead of night she asked then she spied the tree oopsi cant touch that she vanished and as a mundane i can handle it without suffering reversal of my magic mary said while you might be in trouble very well how much do you need it turned out that he needed a bundle she pulled frag ments from the tree and bound them together with a vine then held the bundle in her arms as nimby carried her back toward the rv then she laid pieces of wood in a large circle around the rv spaced only a few feet apart that should be one insidiously effective defense perimeter she thought nimby nodded mentia reappeared deadly she remarked they finished the job and returned to the rv before she climbed back in mary kissed one donkey ear its nice to have you looking out for us she said even if it is just to help chlorine complete her assignment the ear blushed mary settled back in her seat and nimby resumed his human form and rejoined chlorine in back no one had missed them this time mary went right to sleep piers anthony at dawn the others didnt even notice the circle of wood but mary saw that enormous tracks came directly toward the rv touched the circle and became hopelessly con fused probably a hungry land dragon had sniffed them out but been balked by the reversal of its nature or magic nimby must have seen it coming and quietly taken the measure required to abate the menace to protect chlo rineand her mission it was really nimby the good ma gician had sent them in the guise of sending chlorine mary gathered up the wood and tied it back into its bundle now it neutralized itself as it did when in its orig inal tree trunk but its potential remained she stacked it in the rv for future use now chlorine consulted with nimby to see what route they should take where to get the windbreaker where it would be most effective to their surprise he did not rec ommend the trollway instead it turned out that they would have to seek the help of a number of individuals scattered across the area the first was modem that looks a lot like a mundane term jim remarked surely coincidence they found a gas guzzler and refueled then set off on a tortuous trip through the forest until they came to an isolated shack the windows were boarded over but not because it was deserted the family was battening down for the terrible storm that was building the rv stopped beside it chlorine was about to get out but nimby restrained her and indicated mary oh well there had to be a reason mary had a good deal of respect for nimbys awareness of things she got out and knocked on the shacks door go away spook a voice called from inside im not a spook mary protested though she had a notion what kind of apparitions had been bothering this house im a dull mundane woman looking for modem the door opened a crack held closely by a glittery hand a gnarly eye peered out and im the hag of this hut what do you know of modem yon ill wind only that we need him to help save xanth from the ill wind the door cracked wider let me get a look at you the hag said why youre someones mother yes then it must be all right see that he doesnt get into mischief hes got weird magic she called back into the hut modem lad go with this mother yes haggi ma a boy about davids age appeared tousled of hair and ragged of garb now it was clear why mary had had to be the one nimby had known thank you she said to haggi she took the boy by his grubby hand and led him to the rv well try to bring him back safely she called then to the boy we have a magic moving house you may look out the window after you wash your hands you will sit with my son david you may call me mom for now yes mom he replied dutifully chlorine came out to meet them this is modem mary told her in a motherly manner clean him up and find out the nature of his magic give him the window seat beside david she really meant for chlorine to find out from nimby also the boy would more likely hold still if chlorine washed his face and hands chlorine riad a certain effect on males of any age might as well make positive use of it hello modem chlorine said i am chlorine she smiled chee the boy looked stunned that meant he was socially normal they resumed driving looking for the next name on nimbys list this was keaira off in another direction while jim navigated the twisty turns of the almost track less jungle chlorine washed the stunned modems face and hands and dulcetly questioned him it turned out that modems magic was indeed related to the mundane term it was what he called a magic mirror piers anthony only it was inside him he could communicate with corn pewter with who willow asked corn pewter chlorine explained the evil machine turned good the one who first sent sending he changes reality in his vicinity yes modem agreed when i connect with him i can do it too but only because im a wowor work station jim called back yes thats what he calls it thats nice chlorine said can you show us at that point the rv reached a deadend trail a huge tangly tree with dangling tentacular vines barred their way watch it mentia said thats a tangle tree karen giggled like my hair not exactly watch the demoness floated out and assumed the form of a little girl she walked up to the tree suddenly the vines writhed they wrapped around her and hauled her into the tree a big wooden mouth opened in the trunk the tentacles stuffed the girl into that orifice wooden teeth clamped down then the mouth opened and spat out the girl the trunk turned green the tentacles wilted mentia resumed luscious woman form and floated back into the rv any questions yuck no karen said looking a bit green herself yeah david said what made it spit you back out the demoness smiled in a female dog way i gave it a whiff of stink horn of what mentia made a foulsmelling noise the most ghastly imaginable stench filled the vehicle like that she said only stronger ghaa karen cried rushing to open a window mary quietly did the same that was nosenumbingly dreadful only nimby wasnt choking yon ill wind great david cried and thats what that dumb tangle tree bit into im afraid so the demoness said with mock regret then they were all laughing even modem despite the awful odor i can change it modem said when i connect then please connect with corn pewter chlorine told him and change it to roses modem closed his eyes concentrating suddenly a beau tiful rose scent permeated the rv reality had changed do you know i begin to see why this talent may be useful jim remarked can he get us past that tangle tree chlorine spoke to the boy the tangle tree became a pie tree mentia went out and harvested the best pies and brought them in for consumption as they drove on chlo rine returned to her seat beside nimby and brought out a greenish bug she passed this across her mouth whats that karen asked a lips tic of course it colors my lips indeed they were now a much firmer green what else mary thought they entered a wmdswept plain the power of the storm continued to rise and the flying dust made visibility short blasts of it struck the rv pushing it around and scattered phantasms flew by sword blades seemed to rise out of the ground threatening the tires but nimby indicated and mentia verified that they were mostly illusory still mary would not care to plow through much more of this keairas residence was an oasis amidst the barrens pretty flowering softwoods surrounded a larger dust colored tree with a fancy tree house oh a cottage in dust tree chlorine said pleased since when do pine trees flower jim muttered since we came to xanth mary replied they pulled up near the dust tree despite its name there was no dust flying here the air was calm and sweet piers anthony which was surely this seemed to be an enchanted spot why keaira had chosen to live here the door of the tree house opened and a young woman with brown braids emerged a traveling house she asked surprised mary approached her yes and we would like you to join us if you are keaira we are on a mission to save xanth from the terrible storm and we need your help but my power over weather is very small keaira protested i can affect it only quite near me i couldnt do anything about a giant magical storm like this your talent is weather control mary exclaimed catching on thats why your house suffers no bad weather yes of course keaira agreed but only as far out as you see thats not very much it should be enough to enable us to get through the increasingly bad weather we face mary said will you come with us of course if it will help xanth will it take long we hope not but it could be several days we have to travel behind the storm and herd it north keaira looked wistfully at her house but if i am away too long the ill wind will blow my house and trees away and it has taken so long to cultivate them mary appreciated her reluctance but she had a notion maybe we can do something about that she turned to modem can you change her reality so that her oasis wont suffer the boy considered would a dome over it help not if it got suffocatingly hot under it mary said maybe a thyme plant to keep it unchanging sean suggested but we dont have a thyme plant chlorine protested yes we do sean said willow has a sprig of thyme in her napsack what knapsack mary asked for the girl had no more than her little purse with her yon ill wind it wouldnt help willow said it would speed things up when they need to be slowed down how about with reverse wood sean asked moms got some stashed with the luggage yes that should do it willow agreed surprised so sean got out two pieces of reverse wood and willow pulled a knapsack out of her purse and a sprig of thyme from that they set the thyme in keairas tree house but nothing has changed mary said sean smiled yes it has mom look beyond the oa sis she looked the dust was still flying out there but very slowly as if embedded in syrup i dont understand were living ten times as fast as usual he ex plained outside is normal the thyme has speeded us up but the moment we put the reverse wood with it it will have the opposite effect and the oasis will be a tenth as fast as the outside now it was coming clear except for one detail how will you get out of there once the reverse wood reverses the thyme i wont ill simply throw in the two sticks and when they land theyll separate and take effect thats how chlorine nulled sending way back when she told me mary looked at nimby he nodded it seemed that it would work as specified then it seems you can safely come with us if your oasis will last for a day or so of its time yes that should be all right the young woman agreed they cleared the oasis and sean hurled the two sticks of wood in they landed beside the dust tree and bounced apart and the scene seemed to freeze the magic had taken effect the rv was yet more crowded but that couldnt be helped or could it mary had a notion modem do you know what an accommodation spell is a corn a days in he repeated blankly piers anthony the imps use it to make their tiny house seem big enough for fullsized folk it isnt really butwell maybe it is i was wondering whether you could make this moving house seem larger inside without being larger outside mom youre a genius sean exclaimed yes i guess the boy agreed doubtfully if pewter knows it he concentrated suddenly the rv was twice its former size there was room for everyone mary was seated on a seat big enough for two the roof was twice as high jim was manhandling a monstrous steering wheel but when she looked out the window she saw that the rv was taking up no more road space than before it was big only inside isnt magic wonderful she breathed for sure jim said shifting to get to the edge of his seat so that his feet could reach the pedals but outside the weather still buffeted the vehicle the gusts of wind were becoming frighteningly powerful and visibility was diminishing alarmingly something had to be done or they would be blown into disaster mary had an idea keairacan you give us calm weather in the vicinity of our moving house certainly the girl said and suddenly they were in an aisle of calm beyond it the ferocity of the storm was undiminished but no gust touched the rv and the air surrounding it was clear thank you mary said much relieved then she set about finding some blocks of wood or something else to enable her husband to reach the pedals more comfortably she didnt want him to lose control of the vehicle the next name on nimbys list was chena centaur i recognize that one mary said sifting through her mem ory carleton centaurs little sister he asked us to relay his greeting to her if we saw her youre right jim agreed surprised but im not sure how a centaur will fit in here even with our increased interior space nimby wrote a note chena wont come inside yon ill wind chlorine read shes a winged centaur winged mary asked im sure carleton didnt say anything like that she must be a regular centaur but nimby as always turned out to be right they came up to two somewhat bedraggled winged centaurs taking shelter in the lee of a large chest nut and bolt tree chests of nuts and bolts were scattered everywhere harvested pre maturely by the wind mentia went out to talk with the fillies who were some what taken aback by the rv then the two stepped into the calm surrounding the vehicle evidently relieved shak ing out their wings the folk inside stepped out to make introductions the two were indeed chena and her friend crystal but how is it that you are winged mary asked your brother carleton sends his greetings and goodwill but he said nothing about wings i wasnt winged then chena explained i was a normal centaur but then i met che centaur and well i had a wishing stone and it made me winged crystal was a human girl whom i talked into converting you see we need more flying centaurs of different derivations if we are to have a viable species so now im out recruiting crystal here agreed that her prospects would be better as a centaur i have been showing her the centaur ways as we look for more recruits but wont you need male flying centaurs too mary asked crystal flushed yes chena said we are looking for suitable males of any species to recruit mary studied them both were healthy fillies in the equine portions and slender girls in the human portions with the rather full breasts that the centaur species tended to have t suspect you will succeed but i can provide an expert opinion if you wish you can crystal asked speaking for the first time mary glanced to the side sean if you were not oth erwise attached would you consider becoming a winged piers anthony centaur in order to be with one of these fillies you bet sean agreed then he had another notion and mary could have bit her tongue for not anticipating it say i could be transformed to a winged elf to be with willow but willow herself countered that to marys great re lief no my love magician trent can transform anyone to any form but you are mundane he could give you the form of a winged elf male but not the magic only if you already had magic could it change with your form you would not be able to fly your wings would be useless and she paused delicately i love you as you are i would not have you change we just cant make it in each others worlds he said disheartened not very well she agreed thats sad chena said you fell in a love spring they nodded together chena exchanged a glance with crystal then looked back to sean i dont mean to be crude but if we find males to recruitdo you mind telling us exactly where that love spring is sean and willow laughed together ruefully i will show you when this crisis is over but i hope you will tell your stallions of its nature before oh of course chena said we wouldnt cheat that leads to mischief we know sean agreed and willow nodded mary did not comment but it struck her that for a ran dom coupling of dissimilar species the two were remark ably well matched sean had a wild side that needed taming while willow was quite realistic and sensible yet they laughed at the same things sean could do a good deal worse in mundania in fact some of the girls he had been interested in had had only one thing going for them youth that asset was all too fleeting as mary knew so well from her own experience but all that was beside the point she had to explain yon ill wind things to the centaur fillies we were looking for you chena she said and perhaps for crystal too because we need help to deal with this storm before it blows xanth away will you come with us what kind of help chena asked we cant safely fly in this fierce wind im not sure mary confessed but i am sure that we need you and that the manner of it will become ap parent in due course as for flyingyou should be able to do that in the ambiance of our traveling house because keaira is keeping the weather calm here she glanced at keaira who nodded shyly why certainly then chena agreed we can fly above it or to the side as long as the terrible wind is kept away it isnt just the force of it but the magic dust it carries it makes us dizzy and weird things attack like phantasms mary agreed even when they are illusions they are mischief enough very well then lets get moving again but nimby was writing a note chlorine took it and read it aloud whywhy he says the house can fly the fillies can make it fly chena looked at the rv well we can make it light enough to float but thats not the same as but then we could haul it along by ropes crystal said it could move through the air it might be clumsy but it could be done in calm weather is this safe mary asked surprised nimby nodded and we can travel over the jungle instead of through it the notion had definite appeal nod this was evidently the way to go how do you make it light she asked the centaurs we simply flick things with our tails chena said thats really our magic to make things light enough to float or fly when we flick bothersome flies they become too light to sit so must fly away when we flick ourselves piers anthony we become similarly light she looked at the rv how ever thats pretty big it would take a number of flicks to lighten it enough and wed have to flick each of you who go inside it too and the effect fades with time crystal said with each passing moment you lose lightness you lose moments of effect jim said he was speak ing technically because this was in his specialty of phys ics but it didnt matter here yes so you have to get flicked again i think you would have to settle to the ground every half hour or so to get renewed i wonder mary said thoughtfully modem could you change that reality to make it last longer like maybe a day instead of half an hour i guess so modem said then lets try it mary said first the two centaurs worked on the rv they were right they were making it lighten but only at the rate of a hundred pounds or so per flick mary could see the tires getting less flattened but it would take about twenty flicks apiece to complete that job and they had to pause briefly to recharge between doses say can you split into your halves david asked as they worked mary didnt like the way he was staring at their breasts but the centaurs seemed oblivious obviously they wouldnt go bare if they felt there was any shame in it halves crystal asked you know horse and person no chena said between tail flicks those breasts quivered with the effort of every flick and so did davids eyeballs but mary was determined to give no sign of her distress the centaurs simply didnt know how things were in mundania we are complete creatures crossbreeds who have become our own species anyway it wouldnt be halves it would be thirds crystal said equine human and avian yon ill wind well can you maybe turn all human or all bird the boy persisted back and forth no thats not our magic you are thinking of the mer folk some of whom can make legs and become fully hu man and walk on land or perhaps make a fishs head and swim underwater or the naga folk who can assume hu man or serpent form with their natural form being be tween others like the harpies are fixed in their merged forms well could they maybe get together and teach each other david persisted so the centaurs could change form and the naga could have magic talents like flying chena laughed heartily and mary struggled not to wince maybe so but crystal and i have been working so hard to master our present forms that we are not much interested in experimenting with any other type of magic we are satisfied with the magic we have which enables us to fly and dont crave any other type then one end of the rv lifted off the ground it was just about light enough to float away it was time to do the people one person should be ready to hold each one as we lighten them chena said we wouldnt want anyone to float away she smiled but the warning was serious jim took a stance by the rv ill go last he said they started in on the people karen went first and of course the moment she was flicked and lightened by chenas tail she leaped into the air to see how far she would go as it happened she leaped away from jim who reached for her but missed but mary had been alert for something like this and snagged the flying girl she was prepared yet even so was surprised karen really was featherlight as if she were no more than an inflated balloon in girl form obviously centaur magic did work on mun danes she passed the giri to jim who popped her into the open side door of the rv hey its small again she cried how are we all going to fit piers anthony mary looked at modem that magic was temporary the boy fidgeted no but i can change only one re ality at a time you said to make the lightness last oops they needed two aspects of magic now this was getting complicated but maybe therewas an answer jim her husband rose to the occasion modem reality is mostly the way we see it agreed yes the boy said only so what we need is a special kind of reality for this moving house suppose we think of it as having several properties it moves it is larger inside than outside and it holds a given spell for a day or more these are not dif ferent realities but aspects of this particular structure one reality covers all its qualities does this make sense i guess modem agreed he concentrated and sud denly the interior was twice its natural size crystal nicked david and jim passed him inside then chena did the next and so on until only nimby and jim were left outside mary suspected that nimby didnt really need the centaur magic to make him light but heaccepted the flick and went in finally jim closed the side door opened the drivers seat door and accepted his own light ening all ten of them were inside with the two winged centaurs outside taking the ropes now attached the centaurs flicked the vehicle twice more and the rear end lifted they were floating where to jim asked nimby nimby pointed south but he wrote another note south jim called out the window one more to pick up chlorine read adam about an hour as the house flies an hour jim called out the window as the ropes lost their slack just as if this were routine chena looked back and nodded they were hauled smoothly up until the trees were be low mary saw their branches being furiously whipped by the wind as the calmweather patch left them behind the yon ill wind storm was still intensifying and it was not hard to appre ciate how in time it could start blowing trees down happy bottom was increasing to hurricane strength now they bore south the children peered out and down fascinated and so did jim and mary it was as if they were in the cab of a blimp floating silently across the terrain the landscape spread out below varied and vari egated the outline of xanth mary knew resembled that of mundane florida but within that outline the detail could differ considerably here there were mountains and chasms and endless types of magic she looked at the two flying centaurs who made a pretty pair as their great wings rose and fell together they were nice girls she knew in fact most of the folk of xanth were nice parents were trusting because the average stranger deserved trust the bad crea tures like dragons were obviousand even they werent always bad the winged monsters had pitched in to help save xanth even the filthy harpies and none had broken the truce there were things she was coming to like about this land she would be sorry to leave it and she did want to save it she felt somewhat responsible for the storm be cause it had entered xanth through the same aperture as their family had she realized that that wasnt completely reasonable but neither was it completely unreasonable the storm was mundane in origin let the mundanes de fuse it the flight continued with no sign of weight gain jims rationale for double reality shifting had worked for some one who until this adventure had had zero tolerance for fantasy he had made a remarkable accommodation as had she herself there was just something about xanth magic aside nimby pointed down already how the hour had flownno pun now they had to fetch in adam what would his magic talent be how would it integrate with those of the others only nimby knew nimby she real piers anthony ized was the true leader of this expedition a mute don keyheaded dragon below jim called out the window the centaurs angled down there was a squat stone house at least that would be secure against the wind for a while they landed before it but the rv tended to float up again when the rope went slack the centaurs picked up rocks and brought them to the rv as ballast jim and sean took the stones and piled them in the center of the floor in back then the vehicle stayed put but watch it jim warned we still float then the centaurs brought smaller stones which mary and willow put in their purses as personal ballast follow ing nimbys indication it seemed that they were the proper ones to make the appeal to adam they disembarked and approached the house a face appeared in a window are you real or spooks it de manded we are real mary answered i am somebodys mother i am somebodys love willow added then come in before the wind starts again the door opened they entered a rather stout young man stood there you must be adam mary said i am mary mun dane i am willow elf yes i am adam what do you folk want with me we are on a mission to save xanth from the terrible storm mary said we need your help will you come with us he looked astonished you want me to go with you yes if you will we need you but nobody needs me he protested nobody even likes me perhaps because nobody knows you willow said sympathetically are you meanspirited no i am whatever i choose to partake of yon ill wind is that your magic mary asked yes if i see a rock i can take its essence and become rockhard if i see water i can become liquid if i see a cloud i can become light and fluffy but that doesnt help anyone else and i still look plain and stuffy willow shrugged so do i among my own kind but i met a young man who thinks im beautiful thanks to a love spring maybe there will be something for you a love spring he breathed what i wouldnt give to get dunked in one of those with a lovely girl maybe it will happen mary said realizing that this was why willow had been the one for this her experience signaled what adams might be please come with us in our floating house and help us save xanth sure he said so they brought him out and it turned out that there was no need to make him light because he simply looked at a cloud and became foggy light he entered the rv and took a seat where one was available beside keaira any more people to pick up mary asked nimby nimby shook his head so our complement is complete at last mary said relieved now we can head straight on south and save xanth from happy bottom nimby nodded all the way south jim called out the window are you fillies holding up okay we are getting hungry chena said do you like pies we have a treeful yes those will be fine so they passed out the pies remaining from the changed tangle tree and the centaurs ate them as they flew the speed picked up they were on their way to their destiny yon ill wind ill wind david woke as the rv slid down toward the ground was this boring flight finally over it had been interesting for a while when they picked up wil low who was sort of pretty and modem was his own age twelve so had some common interests modem had en joyed the big stink the demoness made as much as david had even if he had had to change it to roses to pacify the womenfolk he sneaked just as many peeks at chlorine and the topless flying centaur fillies oh to be a few years older but keaira was an adult young woman wellcov ered and no raving beauty either while adam was not only adult he was fat so once the novelty of flying in the rv faded nothing much was left but now they were landing and there might be some action after all they still had to drive happy bottom to where she couldnt do any more harm and she wasnt going to want to go he pitied the poor person who would have to wear the windbreaker jacket and try to herd her north nimby sitting beside chlorine turned his head to look at david oh no did that mean david was the one nimby nodded nimby was eerie but always right so david would have to do it but he wouldnt like it nimby shook his head he would like it why but nimby merely smiled in scrutably he could be sort of frustrating that way yet it did give david something to be interested in how could he like wearing the stupid jacket and trying to herd the stupid wind anywhere there must be something fun about it the rv touched down right beside the big pillow where chlorine and nimby had landed at the beginning of the trollway they had come full circle or whatever and seen a whole lot on the way but what now nimby had written some notes for chlorine now she read them off keaira and david will have to herd happy bottom north she read hell wear the wind breaker and shell keep the weather calm so they wont get blown out of the sky out of the sky mom asked her tone echoing the furrow david knew was in her forehead they will be riding the winged centaurs chlorine read and willow will show the way flying with them suddenly it dawned hed ride a barebusted filly up in the sky by himself like a flying cowboy and he could sneak all the peeks he wanted that would indeed be fun but david cant go all alone out there mom pro tested as of course she would suppose he fell um good point in the rv there was no chance of fall ing because it was closed in but though he liked the idea of riding a barechested winged filly his actual horse riding experience was small he might indeed fall and if they were high in the sky at the time that would be the end of him no he will remain light chlorine read it seemed that nimby had anticipated all the questions should he fall from his steed he would merely float gently down the centaur would have ample time to catch him before he reached the ground oho and how would she catch him by flinging her arms about him and clasping him to her bosom that was a risk he was prepared to take and nimby was right about the floating he had forgotten how light they all were so it was safe after all piers anthony dad had a more sensible objection if keaira goes with them what of the weather here well be blown away the moment we lose her calmweather protection i can change local reality to revert the moving house to normal modem said then it might not blow away but he didnt look certain because they could see the fe rocious dusty wind beyond the oasis of calm there were even phantasms forming around the edges of the calm re gion making grotesque gestures to signal what theyd like to do to the folk in the rv if they could just get close of course it would just be illusion mostly as long as they kept the doors and windows closed but even illusions could be pretty bad but nimby had an answer for chlorine to read the present local reality must remain as it is because soon the house will need to travel again and no one must leave it the centaurs will not be here to make it light again mo dems local reality is the main force holding back the magic dust david could see that chlorine was startled as she heard herself read that you mean modems doing more than just keeping the lightness lasting and the inside big then she read the next answer already in her hand yes his magic reality preempts the malicious magic fostered by the dust it does modem asked surprised i guess your magic is more potent than you know dad said with a typical dad smile it is chlorine read because the magic dust is enhancing it thus the dust of madness has the ironic effect of canceling itself in this limited instance gee modem said pleased david was of course too good a person to be jealous of the importance of anybody elses role but he did ex perience a certain discomfort that an ignorant person might choose to interpret as jealousy so he mentioned a legiti mate concern if the rv uh house stays light wont it just blow away like dad says yon ill wind as dad says mom said in her obnoxious english teacher way he had tried to break her of that but without much success parents were slow learners but this time fat adam had an answer i can assume the properties of xanths heaviest rock and be ballast you can keaira asked evidently impressed oh sure adam said when im cloudlight im like a fat balloon when im fruity im like a fat apple when im solid im like a fat boulder thats why folk dont like me i think its a great talent keaira said you do i think your talent is the greatest you can be always in sunshine or have it rain when you want it to keaira blushed thank you you mean you care what i think even though im fat as a pumpkin fat pumpkins are the handsomest she said still blushing this was getting disgusting time to break it up before they actually got mushy well lets get busy david said who rides who who rides whom mom said david ignored it as he would any other crude remark which bareboobed filly is mine david mom exclaimed as karen stifled a titter sorry he said which bareboobed centaur mom looked as if she has swallowed a poopflavored prune but this time she held her tongue good maybe he had made his point of course thered be bleep to pay when she finally got him alone at home but maybe shed forget by then chlorine read her next note chena she thinks youre cute david was flabbergasted she does nimby nodded he should know since he could read minds no wonder he knew david would enjoy the ride meanwhile mom looked as if her prune had turned into piers anthony a stink horn but again she stifled her comment and take some reverse wood chlorine read so they made two small bundles of two sticks each and david took one while keaira took the other they were bound together by duct tape so they wouldnt come apart acci dentally but of course they could be ripped apart if they were needed then whatever threat they encountered would be reversed but use the wood only in an emer gency chlorine read because it will nullify the cen taurs too reversing their magic lightness for sure if david had to use his wood hed strip the tape to prime it then hurl it like a grenade then it would affect only what he threw it at he could make like su perman nulling enemies galore pow you re reversed he tucked the bound sticks into his belt they got out of the rv all except adam who looked out just long enough to spy a solid metallic rock then he assumed the qualities of that rock and became hard and heavy keaira tapped her knuckle against his shoulder ver ifying it almost skinned a joint and smiled with acknow ledgment adam looked as it he were about to float away despite being bouldersolid with adams change the rv was firmly planted and the two centaurs no longer had to hang tightly on to the ropes chlorine gave the jacket she had been wearing to david and explained to them what nimby had written fine chena said smiling get on my back da vid there was something perky in her attitude as if she really did find him cute he adjusted that jacket which remained pleasantly warm from its contact with the beautiful woman and smelled faintly ofof what of a commercial swimming pool of coursechlorine the chemical used to purify the water only now it was like perfume dad lifted him up and set him behind chenas lovely white wings which were folded but remained a bit out from her body then dad did the same for keaira putting her on crystal yon ill wind remember you are very light chena told him turn ing her head and the upper part of her torso so she could look him in the eye that meant unfortunately that he had to meet her gaze because he didnt want to give away what he really wanted to peek at it was frustrating so you must hold firmly on to my mane mane he repeated dumbly her hair flowed down from her head and somewhere became the mane but he wasnt sure where in front of you and try to wrap your legs around my barrel if they will reach barrel when she turned back to face the front he could lookbut now nothing was in sight that was dou bly frustrating take hold she said as she spread her wings then finally he did his hands found grips in the shorter hair of her mane at the base of her human portion she pumped her wings and leaped and sailed into the air it seemed remarkably easy until he remembered that she had made herself almost as light as he was so that she weighed almost nothing the motion of her wings was mainly to move her rather than to lift her but though he could see the full beautiful sweep of those wings he couldnt see the front of her torso here he thought he would have his best chance yet to peek without obstruction or discovery and instead it was no chance bleep he muttered you might consider looking across at crystal chena murmured she knew boys were not supposed to blush but he was afraid he was doing so but it was a good suggestion thanks he said and looked he was rewarded by a splendid view crystals wings were pumping gracefully and her front was completely open to view she was also slightly better endowed than chena in fact then crystal looked their way and he had to wrench piers anthony his gaze away he couldnt peek if someone was watching him peek so frustrated anew he looked around elsewhere to the other side was willow who flew readily in her dress be cause it was cut to leave holes for her wings now that they were all airborne willow flew close crys tal approached from the other side so that they could talk to each other nimby wrote me a note explaining how to do it willow said happy bottom is like a giant puzzle with alternating bands of wind and cloud around her center we have to find our way to the center where her eye is so david can use his jacket to push it wherever the eye goes happy bottom goes she cant help it so well just keep pushing her north to the region of air where fracto will try to tame her the problem will be finding her eye and stay ing with it she may try some tricks to hide it or move it away from us david has to push in the right place or it wont work and keaira has to stay near him so he has calm weather im the only one who is free to explore but if i go outside the fairweather zone ill be in trouble so you need to stay reasonably close to me while i search gotcha david said we shall do our best keaira agreed willow flew on ahead there was a solidlooking ver tical wall of cloud moving rapidly from west to east it reached down almost to the ground and up almost to the top of the sky boy shes a big bbleep david said awed he knew happy bottom was a hurricane now even if she had been a mere tropical storm when she entered xanth she had intensified can one little jacket move all that the center is much smaller chena said and calmer nimby says oh that should make it easier but he wasnt quite sure it was so willow flew back theres a hole in the wall she cried excited maybe we can get through it yon ill wind cant keaira make it calm wherever we go david asked so we dont need to look for holes perhaps willow said but its better to go in with out disturbing the ill winds cloud banks so she doesnt notice us the moment she becomes aware of us she could start fighting us but shes just a storm he protested so is fracto chena reminded him oh yeah here in xanth even inanimate things had awareness it was certainly better not to make happy bot tom aware of them so the two centaurs followed willow through the fleet ing gap in the clouds it closed in after them they had made it just in time now they were between two walls of cloud and the one ahead was moving faster than the one behind david remembered something about hurricanes because he had seen their patterns shown on miami radar they alternated cloud bands with air bands and most of the action was in the cloud bands they got smaller toward the center but also fiercer if we just keep going straight through them he said well find the center we cant help it theres nowhere else it can be i hope so chena said doubtfully it can be hard to tell direction in the middle of fog and rain for sure but soon another gap opened up ahead they plunged through it but this one closed up before they completed their passage and suddenly they were caught in grayness keairas controlled weather kept the winds from them but rain sluiced down from above drenching them he heard the rain pelting the centaurs wings and chena dipped until she flicked herself and resumed level flight happy bottom was simply too big keaira couldnt clear a passage to the sunlight uhoh chena said i think shes on to us david thought the same maybe the storm couldnt touch them directly but she sure could cloud things up piers anthony suppose they couldnt find their way out of this cloud bank then they emerged and it was clear they had made it through this time lets pick a bigger gap next time david said if willow can find one chena agreed willow searched diligently almost getting caught at the edge of the calm section davidsaw her do a flip in the air as one wing caught the edge yes there was power in the storm and it would blow them right out of xanth if they got caught in it maybe i could help some david said with the jacket i think all i have to do is open it thereaad been one of nimbys notes about that somewhere along the way when closed the windbreaker was passive but when opened its magic took effect i think its better to wait until we reach the eye chena said happy bottom may know of our presence but not of our power so she may consider us a nuisance not a threat best to keep it that way she was making sense so they hunted along the cloud wall searching for that brief avenue through while happy bottoms winds seemed to get stronger in due course another avenue appeared but this time they were cautious it could be a trap so willow made a feint at it with the two centaurs following closely behind sure enough it closed up the fog imploding from every side but they had sheered off just before it skirting the fringe of the cloud wall there was no doubt now happy bottom was trying to get them but her ploy had been simple so she probably underestimated them they flew along the side and found a thinning of the wall where fog had been borrowed to make the implosion they plunged into this the storm had to know of then passage but couldnt react fast enough to catch them having been caught offguard by the time the wind and fog closed in they were through they were in the next clear band apparently the hur yon ill wind ricanes power was limited mostly to the cloud bands where the magic dust swirled thickest but they would be unlikely to catch her napping again they flew up to the next band but it was solid fog they couldnt get through they didnt dare risk another bold charge into the fog maybe we can sneak below it willow suggested the hills and trees must interfere with the wind bands so there should be gaps she cant help they flew down sure enough there was a clear region in the lee of a mountain they zoomed through that just below the bottom of a cloud wall skimming the terrain and flew up into the next clear region look chena cried that must be the eye it surely was it looked like a monstrous eyeball turning in the center of the huge ring of clouds that was the in nermost cloud wall this was what they had to move north they came up behind the orb and hovered in the calm air then they oriented north and david unzipped and opened his jacket go he cried nothing happened the two centaur fillies looked at him willow flew close is there an invocation you have to use nimby didnt say so david said disgruntled what was wrong far from blowing anything the jacket was completely calm then davids ears popped ouch feels like descend ing in an airplane he said shaking his head i think the local pressure is rising keaira said thats odd because im not doing it theres a waft of breeze coming toward us crystal said i feel it in my mane but none going away from us willow said and what we need is a strong outward blast then chena caught on its breaking the wind air is coming in but not going away its pooling around the jacket building up pressure and high pressure will push the lowpressure eye piers anthony away crystal added that must be how it works all we have to do is let it build up enough its building for sure david said my eardrums are getting bonged he held his nose and blew hard until he felt another pop in his head look chena cried again the eye is moving and it was there was no actual wind but the high pressure zone around them was shoving the eye away the eye felt it too it spun around to fix its stormy gray iris on them it blinked the pupil widened it saw them keep pushing it willow said david tried but the eye slid around to the side instead of moving north chena flew to get directly south of it again but it slid farther to the side it was just plain hard to push in the direction they wanted maybe if we all try to channel the air flow willow suggested to surround the eye they tried it willow hovered to davids left and crys tal to his right and all three winged monsters did their best to push the dense air forward surrounding the eye its working david cried but then the eye irritated reddened and expanded it grew to twice its former size then en times as big now it was impossible to push the whole thing maybe if i used my reverse wood to mess it up david said tugging at the two sticks in his belt careful with that keaira said touching her own bound sticks this wood is dangerous if too late david had grabbed just one stick the other snagged in his belt the tape let go and the two sticks separated eeeeee chena screamed putting a good six јs into it she dropped out from under him like a rock he had separated the reverse wood and one stick had landed on chena and it had reversed the centaurs magic lightness making her magically heavy he himself was falling too but not as fast because as a mundane he was more resistive both to magic and reversed magic but even yon ill wind the limited effect on him was too much he was falling toward the ground at normal falling velocity and that would be enough to pulp him when he struck the ground so he did the sensible thing he threw away the stick his plummet became a slow descent as most of the lightness returned to his body but he was still going down already he saw the trees below but that wasnt all happy bottoms malignant eye reap peared casting about looking for him she must have pretty will figured out the nature of the windbreaker the windbreaker it was still open still generating a highpressure zone around him that was what was ena bling the eye to orient on him it could probably see the crowded air so he closed the jacket and zipped it up but there was still too much pressure in his vicinity happy bottoms eye continued to cast about looking to one side and the other finding the pressure gradients she would soon locate him and thenshe would probably blow him headfirst into a cliff jacket and all he had fallen out of keairas calmweather zone so happy bottom could get at him now he looked desperately for some escape but there seemed to be none he no longer had the reverse wood thanks to his idiocy and he had no wings to fly with all he could do was float gently down while the hurricane worked up her strength for a doomsday strike then a bit of fog formed below him but it didnt look like happy bottoms fog the color and texture differed what could it be the fog thickened into a lowlying cloud the convo lutions of the cloud formed a fuzzy face he knew that face from somewhere a cloud eye winked fracto he cried how had he gotten here he must have sneaked in camouflaging himself as a section of happy bottom like most clouds fracto could be large or small noisy or quiet depending on his mood right now he was being as quiet as mist piers anthony happy bottom didnt realize david hoped his excla mation hadnt given fracto away but just what could the enemyturnedfriend do the hurricane was about to blow him away regardless fracto in his present form had only a tiny fraction of the hurricanes strength so couldnt counter that ill wind then david fell into the cloud the fog of its substance surrounded him so that he couldnt see anything beyond it which meant that no one could see him either happy bottom would not know where to blow and he was such a small target that shed never get anywhere blowing blindly his feet touched ground david tumbled but wasnt hurt being still quite light he was alone in the magic jungle of xanth the fog lifted just enough to let him see around if he kept his head low fracto was still shielding him from the ill winds view giving him a chance to find his way back into action but to do that he had to find chena centaur or rather she had to find him he hoped she was all right she should be once she got away from that reverse wood stick but if he was hidden from happy bottom he was hidden from chena too but maybe she would know to look for him under fracto so what should he do stand here and wait or try to find a better rendezvous point it might be dangerous to blunder around an alien jungle but it might also be dan gerous to sit and wait for whatever came to find him so he would at least try to find a less exposed region a safer place then if he saw a flying centaur he could hail her and all would be reasonably well he started walkingand his right toe kicked something pain shot up his leg and he fell to the ground what bad he stubbed his toe on there was nothing there but a regular pinecone that couldnt be it he reached for itbut when his fingers yon ill wind touched it another jolt of pain encompassed them and shot up his arm that was it he got up staying clear of the cone what kind of tree had produced that to look so ordinary yet bring so much hurt to anyone who touched it in a moment it came to him that wasnt a pinecone it was a pain cone no wonder it had made him hurt he looked down at the turf by his feet in case there should be anything else to avoid and shuddered there was somebodys severed finger no maybe not severed as it wasnt bleeding it was curved into the form of a circle then he laughed he knew what that was a ring finger a finger circled into a ring maybe ogres wore it he walked carefully around the ring ahead was a sign it said twin city a city maybe that would be a good safe place to go so he followed the path that led away from the sign he came across two girls of about his own age playing by the side of the path if there was anything he wasnt interested in especially at this time it was girls his own age so he tried to pass them by but they didnt let him do that hi boywho are you one called and whats your business the other added should he make up something to try to get rid of them no maybe they wouldnt believe the truth so that was best im david mundane and im trying to save xanth from being blown away sure enough they tuned it out im mariana the first girl said and this is my twin sister anairam come see what we do he was stuck for it because he didnt want to make a scene and maybe get tangled up worse he went to see what they were doing to his surprise it turned out to be interesting i do rock shaping mariana explained she lifted a piers anthony stone and ran her hands across it and it changed shape as if it were clay in fact maybe it was clay let me see that david said mariana handed it to him he ran fingers over it it was definitely rock yet he had just seen her mold it he handed it back and it changed again as she pressed her fingers into it forming a crude doll figure then she gave it to her sister and i animate it anairam said suddenly the doll came to life it sat up in her hands she set it down and it ran off into the forest david couldnt help himself those are pretty good talents he admitted grudgingly thank you mariana said want to play house naturally they wanted to get into girlgames some other time he said like maybe in three years i gotta go he walked on he hoped chena would find him soon soon he came to two girls a little younger than he was was this going to be another dull session he tried to walk on by it didnt work hello one girl called im amanda and this is my twin sister adnama we change hair color great for you he called back im david and im walking right on by but you must see amanda protested yes we have nice talents adnama added and thats not all amanda concluded he was stuck for it again where was chena see my hair amanda said her hair was brown but as he watched it changed to yellow and then to red i can change my hair color she said proudly and i can change the hair color of others adnama said as her sisters hair changed again to green so david asked impatiently so now ill change yours adnama said david felt nothing so figured she was bluffing but then yon ill wind mariana held up a mirror and he saw his faceframed by blue hair change it back he demanded angrily after you kiss us adnama said he was really stuck for it so he kissed them each in turn and adnama restored his hair to its natural color then he got the bleep out of there before they thought of any other games to play with him but farther down the path he came to two more girls these seemed to be about two years older than he was each had long purple hair and green eyes he was catching on to the nature of twin city it was filled with twins but why was it all female this time he tackled them directly knowing that they wouldnt just let him pass im david mundane on a mission to save xanth he said who are you i am leai one said sadly i am suicidal but i cant die i am adiana the other said as sadly i want to live but i am dying suddenly this was heavy stuff you cant just switch places we havent found the magic for that leai said too bad he wondered whether they were teasing him if so it wasnt the kind of joke he liked do you think i could die in mundania leai asked i guess so if its magic that keeps you alive its magic she said see she brought out a wickedlooking knife and tried to stab herself with it hey david leaped to grab her hand before the knife could reach her flesh he succeeded in turning it aside what are you trying to do i am trying to kill myself she said but i cant because something always stops me just as you did that wasnt magic i just couldnt let you do it she looked squarely at him she was rather pretty for a girl why not what do you care about girls nothing he said but piers anthony youll make up some reason but youll always stop me or someone else will ive tried to kill myself a hun dred times and i just cant do it if theres no magic in mundania maybe i could go there with you and im not going to help you get there so you can kill yourself he said she nodded im not surprised but maybe if my sister went with you she could live but i couldnt leave you leai adiana protested she was sort of pretty too i dont think i can help you girls david said though id like to id like to make you both willing and able to live then an idea struckhim i had two sticks of reverse wood i lost them but they must have fallen somewhere around here maybe if you found them they would reverse your magics and both girls screamed with delight ah thank you leai exclaimed and kissed him on the right ear so very very much adiana said and kissed him on the left ear then both ran off on a search for the reverse wood david would never have admitted it but he really hadnt minded getting kissed he walked on down the path soon he came to two more young folk but this time they were male and female i was afraid all the twins were girls he remarked relieved they are in that section the boy said in the next section they are all boys were on the border between sections oh well hi im david mundane im youre on a mission to save xanth from hurricane happy bottom the girl said and you will succeedin due course the boy said david had intended to say something intelligent like how can you possibly know things like that when you have just met me but as usual his mouth got into gear before his brain so all he said was a stupid huh both boy and girl smiled we apologize the boy said we sometimes forget that strangers dont know us yon ill wind as we know them i am deja and this is my twin sister vu my talent is to see the future and hers is to see the past so when we saw you our talents came into play and we knew your past and future business oh so can you tell me where to find chena centaur unfortunately we cant vu said we cant see the present but i can tell you that your friend was most con cerned when she lost you and i can tell you that she will find you in about fifteen and one half minutes deja said thereafter your mission will be routine if the thickening magic hasnt distorted his percep tion vu said we are somewhat protected from it here in this valley so things are almost normal here but that may change we are therefore very glad to leam of your mission uh thanks david said i gotta get on to meet chena then to be sure deja agreed we wish you the very best david went on down the path there was a sign saying tri city at least now he was out of the twins section he felt better until he encountered three girls evidently triplets oh no he knew he hadnt a chance of getting through un scathed but he made the effort he maintained his pace and tried to march on by them why looka singleton boy one said lets have some fun with him im no fun he said quickly as they converged they were big girls of the kind he would ordinarily like to sneak peeks at considering their short skirts but he didnt trust what they might think was fun im just david a dull mundane a mundane another exclaimed we must see how our magic works on him not very well david said desperately as he came to a stop he had to stop because otherwise he would have piers anthony walked right into the one who was blocking the path ahead we shall soon see the third said hello david mundane i am sherry my talent is to shrink things she reached forth and touched himand suddenly he was half his normal size youre rightmy magic doesnt work well on you i meant to make you much smaller please let me go he cried getting really worried deja had said chena would find him soon but he hadnt said in what state but we havent finished playing with you the second woman said i am terry my talent is to enlarge things she reached down to touch him and suddenly he was twice his normal size oh my it is true i tried to make you invisible giant size not baby ogre size david realized that in his present condition he could bowl them over and escape but he didnt want to stay this way either i just want to save xanth he pleaded in that case we had better restore you the first woman said i am merry and thats my talent she touched his leg and suddenly he was back to normal vastly relieved he pushed on by them and fled down the path come play with us again sherry called after him we know other games too fascinating ones terry added for a man and three women merry finished not without violating the adult conspiracy he called back and had the satisfaction of seeing them gaze at each other in wild surprise i guess that pooped your panties he muttered pleased it must be close to the time for chena to find him david hurried on along the path hoping he wouldnt encounter any more mischievous girls he was startled by a loud howl it sounded halfway like the worlds leastoiled door hinge and halfway like the worlds hungriest hound what could it be it turned out to be a huge caninecreature but it wasnt flesh and blood it was made out of wood its legs were yon ill wind like uprooted saplings its body was like a section of a tree trunk and its teeth were sharpened wooden pegs glistening with sap it was a timber wolf david wasnt sure whether to freeze in the hope that it wouldnt see him or speak soothingly to it in the hope that he could befriend it so he took the compromise course he ran like all bleep he heard the timber wolf bounding after him he was going as fast as he could which was pretty fast because he remained pretty light but he heard the bounding foot falls coming closer behind him heellpp he screamed a winged form swooped down on him ah there you are chena exclaimed she caught him in her arms and hauled him up as she pumped her wings the timber wolf leaped and snapped but they were just out of his reach phew now get on my back the centaur said wrestling him around behind her he obliged and soon was properly seated they rose up into the protective shroud of fog only then did he realize that one of his fahcies had just been realizedand he hadnt even noticed she had clasped him to her bare front when she lifted him from the ground and he had been so distracted by the timber wolf that he had paid no attention to what else was happening what an idiot he had been he covered his chagrin as well as he could how did you find me he asked practo provided cover and knew where you were once we learned how to communicate with him we went right to you we crystal is flying right above us but keaira isnt using her power now so we can hide from happy bottom fracto is being really helpful we wouldnt be able to do this without him piers anthony yeah he hid me from happy bottom david agreed but how did you talk with him we devised a fogball code one ball for yes two for no and a fog arrow to show where to find you he said you were all right but that a tree dog was closing in on you so we had to hurry that was a timber wolf david said laughing chena laughed too timber wolf of course we ze roed in from forest to tree and from animal to dog but couldnt make better sense of it in the time we had any way fracto will lead us back to the eye but after that it will be up to us because hell have to get in front of happy bottom and lure her into the region of air how is he leading us all i see is fog she pointed ahead see that nicker of lightning ahead i have to keep flying toward that he will lead me under or around or through the storm bands until we reach the eye then hell fade away but how will we herd her if she just explodes her j eyeball like she did before as she did before chena murmured but somehow it j wasnt as offensive as when mom corrected him i must confess that i am not sure about that now happy bottom knows what shes up against so shell fight us every breath of the way well have to do it just right i hope somebody knows what shes doing like maybe keaira david said because i sure dont im sure there was excellent reason for nimby to des ignate you to wear the jacket chena said diplomatically i dunno nimby reads minds and knows whats going on but he cant see the future so he might be wrong he reads minds she asked seeming modestly alarmed david realized that she didnt know that nimby had told him she thought he was cute better that she not know well maybe he just knows whats all around so it seems like mind reading sometimes i guess if hed looked in mine hed have known i wasnt the best one for this job yon ill wino no im sure there was reason she said as with the good magicians decisions we merely have to fathom it lotsa luck yes good fortune would definitely be an asset she agreed mistaking his irony perhaps your mishap with the reverse wood sticks was not a true accident but part of your qualification yeah sure assign a foulup kid to drive a fouledup hurricane he said not thrilled with the analogy perhaps in mundania it is different she said deli cately but in xanth seemingly inconsequential things may have significance did you encounter anything on the ground that might relate just a bunch of girls he said disdainfully then be latedly no offense intended she laughed none taken i am a filly not a girl what kind of girls were they that was the funny thing they were all twins it was called twin city though it didnt look much like a city they had sort of complementary talents like rock shaping and rock animation or changing her own hair color or somebody elses hair color or being unable to die or un able to live he paused because that last pair had touched his emotion and not just because they were pretty maybe i managed to help them because of the dropped sticks of reverse wood if they find those maybe one can live and the other can want to live they were surely glad to leam of those chena agreed yeah they kissed me of course i hated that of course she knew he didnt mean it then i met twins who were only half girl deja and vu he saw the future she the past he said i would suc ceed but i dont see how his voice had continued on but his mind lagged at leai and adiana with the long purple hair and green eyes and the awful predicaments he hoped they did find the sticks piers anthony the sticks he exclaimed rudely interrupting him self thats how beg pardon chena asked politely the reverse wood sticks i think i got it together they are inert but separate they mess up magic i messed you up before but now we can mess up happy bottom i recovered as soon as i fell away from the wood chena said no real harm was done but how can the wood enable us to accomplish our mission i lost my sticks but maybe that was just as well but keaira still has hers doesnt she yes well she should tie them to two separate ropes so she can trail them together or pull them apart from a distance when she needs to he said working it out as he talked the range is limited isnt it so that way it doesnt affect us but it should reverse whatever the eye is doing yes certainly but how can trailing the sticks at a distance enable us to accomplish our mission we can drag them by the eye when it tries to escape by exploding he explained so then its magic will be reversed and the eye will implode and we can keep on herding it it wont be able to get away why david thats brilliant she exclaimed gee he said pleased to have his messup with the sticks turn good because he would never have thought of it if it hadnt been for his misadventure suddenly the fog ended there was crystal centaur fly ing above them with keaira there was willow flying to the side and there was the glowering eye directly ahead thank you anonymous benefactor chena called as the fog faded david knew why she couldnt speak fractos name now lest happy bottom overhear and catch on to his role in this practo still had a job to do once she was in the region of air she wouldnt speak to him if she knew his role too soon the three winged monsters rendezvoused and david ex plained his idea the centaurs had ropes it was one of the yon ill wind things they routinely carried and willow had cord in her surprisingly capacious purse too they tied two ropes to the two sticks of reverse wood keeping them carefully together because they didnt want those sticks to separate too soon meanwhile the eye was staring at them and the cloud wall behind them was intensifying happy bottom was priming for action she knew they were up to something but she wasnt sure exactly what they oriented on the eye david unzipped the wind breaker the air pressure began to rise happy bottom didnt wait for the push the eye ex panded explosively keaira tossed the two reverse wood sticks toward the eye they were light as air having been treated by a flick of crystals tail when they floated to the end of their tether actually inside the fringe of the expanding eye keaira jerked on one rope and the sticks separated suddenly the eye was shrinking implosively the iris looked surprised in a moment it was so tight and small that it was hardly bigger than a baseball one stick of re verse wood floated near it stunned the eye spun rapidly in place a glazed look on its pupil then keaira reeled in the stick until it lined up with the other she had to do this because otherwise the wood would reverse their own magic like itas it had before yuck now he wasnt even waiting for chena to correct him he was doing it to himself disgusting meanwhile the air pressure was building up david held his breath and blew out his ear tubes happy to suffer this inconvenience keaira hauled in the two sticks and held them together then chena stroked with her wings and moved slowly forward toward the eye happy bottom had not yet real ized what they had done and the eye was just staying there as they advanced it retreated wafted along by the high pressure that was the way of it each time the eye expanded the piers anthony reverse wood contracted it again so that it couldnt escape they pushed it north to the gap chasm by then night was falling they could see the curtain of darkness dropping from the sky in the east the sun afraid of the dark fled to the west it would be too hard to herd happy bottom by night she was unlikely to pursue them southward if she ever realized they were withdrawing so they flew rap idly south following willow who best knew the terrain they were hardly concerned about the bands of clouds because those had been pretty much broken up with the focus on the eye even so it was after dark by the time they made it to the rv fortunately it had a light on so they could spy it from afar and they landed safely beside if scan must have heard them coming because he was standing out waiting willow flew down into his embrace there followed a disgusting amount of hugging kissing and breathless endearments david made a mental note never stray near a love spring reversal tweeter rather liked this magic land of xanth where birds were so prominently represented it had been fun meeting roxanne roc and playing with sim chick and tweeter had taught sim some dirty bird jokes that no nonbird would understand but now he was about ready to go home where things were more settled he really wasnt an adventurous bird good seed a daylong snooze in the cage and some fun with karen at the end of the day were all he really craved even this business of yon ill wind being intelligent was becoming wearing in part because it made him so much more aware of things how could a bird be happy and secure in his ignorance when he was too smart true it had been nice getting to know woofer and midrange better and they had proved to be loyal friends but all of them now recognized that they were not looking for independent existence let the human folk suf fer the stresses of intelligent life now it was dawn and time for the winged monsters nice identification thatto take david and keaira out to finish herding happy bottom into the region of air by nightfall the job would be done and xanth would be saved tomorrow they could go home the winged posse headed out david was clearly feeling pretty important because he had figured out how to use the reverse wood to stop happy bottoms eye from escap ing them now the hurricane had no choice but to be pushed ever northward until she got locked into the re gion of air where fracto would seduce her and tame her fracto was probably more interested in that aspect than in saving xanth but certainly fracto was helping them to accomplish the mission give the omery cloud his due the winds had died with the retreat of the storm and the magic dust was settling out it fertilized the landscape with another layer of magic so that the plants were recov ering vigorously and the animals were getting frisky they knew that the terrible threat to xanth was being abated so their lives were reverting to normal now it was time to move the rv north to be closer to the scene of action with the storm abated they needed neither keairas patch of calm weather nor the winged cen taurs adam looked at a cloud and became as tenuous as it was without his rocksolid ballast the rv floated gently into the sky the demoness mentia became a crazy in flated giant hand and pushed it north tweeter went out for a fly and watched it was weird seeing the ungainly contraption floating like a huge loaf of bread with that big hand grabbing it it was weirder when karen came out to piers anthony join him she had no wings but remained airlight because of modems spell of changed reality so she floated she had a tether so she couldnt drift her sensible mother had insisted on at least that much this was the first and prob ably the last time they would fly together like this by midday they were nearing castle roogna they went inside the rv to clean up so they would be presentable for the royalty there tweeter settled onto his perch and did a careful preening the adventure was nearing its con clusion suddenly nimby the transformed dragon got nervous what is it chlorine asked she had been paying nimby more attention now that sean was no longer interested in looking at her legs what humans saw in human legs tweeter didnt understand they were such fat fleshy things that couldnt even take hold of a branch with laughably inadequate claws for that matter the rest of the featherless bodies of the humans werent very aesthetic either which was why they usually covered them up but evidently they had learned to live with their liabilities nimby wrote a note chlorine read it and was alarmed land immediately but soon well be at castle roogna its just jungle below us here dad came alert if nimby says it we had better do it adam can you shift slowly to stone nature adam could he had emulated a stone so long that he remembered it the rv lost its buoyancy and began to descend mentia popped in hey what gives youre sinking we have to land now chlorine said nimby says when were so close to the comforts of castle roogna ask him why chlorine turned to the nondescript man why he handed her another note she read it aloud be cause the law of averages has been overturned on ap peal all of the humans drew blanks a question mark ap peared over chlorines head what law yon ill wind thats not something that can be repealed dad said its a law of nature you forget where you are mom said grimly who appealed it chlorine asked nimby who overturned it it turned out that the junior computing program sending was the culprit he had not liked losing possession of woofer and tweeter or getting disconnected by the re verse wood or losing his windbreaker jacket according to the law of averages he was bound to win some and lose some but he didnt like losing so he had appealed to the muses of mount parnassus he had claimed that no ordinary person could have answered his twenty questions so something extraordinary was afoot messing up reality he wanted that reality changed but thats just your nature chlorine protested to nimby you know everything around you nimby shrugged evidently the muses had seen merit in the challenge so had granted the appeal the law of averages had been reversed thats liable to have one bleep of a consequence dad said grimly the fundamental order of the universe is governed by he was interrupted by a sudden buffet of wind that shook the rv he staggered almost getting thrown into a wall get it down sean said happy bottoms coming back adam increased his solidity and the rv dropped even so the wind tried to bash it mentia extended an eyeball from her face and peered outside ground coming close lighten up she said adam did and the rv made a halfway soft landing in the jungle tweeter looked out and saw that it hadnt missed a tree by much the winds howled as if angry to have let the rv get away as if they were angry david mom cried distraught willow the cen taurs are they being blown away piers anthony willow scan echoed agonized keairas with them dad reminded them she can keep their weather calm but they may have trouble getting back here sean looked at nimby sending got the law of av erages revokedand now everythings going haywire all the unlikely wrong things are happening and were all in deep bleep just when we figured wed won the game nimby nodded four times why didnt you warn us mom demanded hysteri cally before we sent them out into disaster my poor child nimby is omniscient not prescient dad reminded her he cant see the future and probably this appeal sending made was done privately with no obvious evi dence until the decision was made so it didnt attract nimbys attention even if a person can see everything he cant pay attention to it all the volume is overwhelming spoken like a true physics professor she retorted bit terly thats our son out there and my love sean added adam also looked pained keaira was out there too and she had shown an interest in him which he evidently re turned dad spread his hands im concerned too but it isnt fair to blame nimby without him we couldnt have gotten even this far mom suffered a pang of reasonableness yes of course she faced the dragon man i apologize nimby i spoke intemperately nimby looked embarrassed dragons surely did not re ceive many apologies from human women you guys are missing the point karen said she faced nimby what can we do about it nimby wrote a long note and gave it to chlorine the success of the mission now hangs by a thread that is rap idly unraveling we must go to fetch a new thread before the old one breaks then all can be salvaged yon ill wind who must fetch the thread sean asked nimby chlorine and tweeter chlorine read from the next note tweeter almost fell off his perch meep sean smiled yep youp birpbrain he said go fetch the thread when chlorine asked almost as surprised nimby walked toward the door now chlorine answered herself she looked around i promise to do my very best come perch on me tweeter he looked uncertainly at karen do it tweet karen said but take care of yourself what would i do without you she looked as if she had more than one or two tears to stifle tweeter flew over to perch on chlorines greenish hair it didnt have the special familiarity of karens reddish hair but it was very nice regardless may you succeed soon mom breathed as they stepped out into the howling wind well wait here thank god for a good anchor sean said as another gust of wind tried to get at the rv outside nimby assumed his dragon form and chlorine mounted him are we going far she asked through her windblown hair tweeter was scrambling to get a better grip lest he be blown right out of it that was one savage ill wind out here the dragon shrugged unable to answer but tweeter knew it couldnt be too far or they would not be able to get the thread in time a swirl of magic dust stirred up ahead of them nimby plunged into it tweeter experienced disorientation this was awful stuff which didnt merely coat the wings and beak it affected a persons interior too where are we going chlorine asked evidently as uncomfortable as tweeter was but nimby couldnt write a note in his dragon form so as the swirl of dust settled out nimby assumed his piers anthony human form and began writing a note meanwhile chlo rine saw a path leading to a pleasantberry patch so she walked toward it the berries looked good to tweeter too so he stayed with her riding on her head she picked the first pleasantberry and put it in her mouth suddenly an unpleasant man appeared you have stolen my berry he cried now i shall steal something of value to you he advanced on her looking as if he happened to be thinking of the roughest ugliest stork stop or ill poison your water she warned him you cant poison anything after eating a pleasant berry he retorted as he grabbed for her and evidently it was true because he did not double over in pain chlorine tried to escape but the path behind her had abruptly overgrown with horrendous brambles so she screamedinstead even that had a pleasant sound as if she didnt really mean it that wont save you you luscious creature the man said you are trapped nothing less than a dragon could rescue youand what dragon would bother dragons dont like being pleasant he reached for her then there was a thud and crash and nimby came charging across he did not look at all pleasant comical maybe but not pleasant the man took half a look at the huge dragon body and fled tweeter was glad the man hadnt gotten a good look at nimbys innocuous head he would have realized that this dragon wasnt much of a threat even away from a pleasantberry patch nimby paused just long enough for chlorine to get on him then moved on you saved me nimby she cried relieved this damsel needed a dragon and youre my dragon she paused but i guess you lost the note you were writing nimby nodded looking embarrassed well i wouldnt have gotten in trouble if i hadnt asked you a stupid question and made you change to man form and then wandered away from you like the shallow creature i am she said so you just stay the way you yon ill wind are nimby im sure you know where you are going and will get us safely there but nimbys donkey snoot looked doubtful and that alarmed tweeter suddenly he suspected that this mission might not be as simple or safe as they had assumed no offense nimby but i think i could use a weapon just in case chlorine said tweeter agreed nimby wouldnt be able to bluff too many more hostile creatures so you wont have to rescue me from any more berry patches ahtheres a gourdless phone let me make a call on that and she swept up a small gourd that had no vine hey do you have any ribbons or bows in stock she said into it the dust cleared farther and the forest seemed to be returning to a reasonable semblance of normal tweeter had adropping to drop so he flew to a tree ahead to take care of it it wouldnt be proper to drop it in chlorines beautiful silken hair after all he landed on a branch and took care of his business but then a larger bird appeared haa he cried in bird talk you have besmirched my tree and now i shall be smirch you you tasty morsel of a mouthful he looked as if he were thinking of savory fresh gizzards garlanded with hot drops of blood tweeter tried to flee but the predator took off too and he had more powerful wings i am rapt with the rapture of wrapping your ragamuffin remains with my ravenous rapier the raptor rapped tweeter flew desperately toward nimby but knew he wouldnt get there in time and anyway what could a don key head do to stop a swift predatory bird then a shaft flew by him so close it ruffled his tail feathers it was an arrow and it passed close to the pur suing raptor too the next one wont miss hawkeye chlorine said this bow is cross if not actually angry and it is eager to score indeed she held a crossbow the raptor considered then veered off it knew that irate piers anthony bow wouldnt fire another mere warning shot it would go for the kill chlorine had saved tweeter from a fate worse than life he landed in her hair thankful for her help they moved on through the forest later they paused by another berry patch to eat there was a man there but he did not look hostile do you mind if we eat some of these berries chlorine inquired smiling nicely but tweeter knew she was braced for possible trouble with her crossbow near at hand not at all he replied im just passing through they are good berries im chlorine and these are nimby and tweeter were looking for a new story thread have you seen any im ray all i have seen are worn old story threads im sorry to say they dont make them the way they used to the person you want to ask is the pawpaw wizard the who hes a storyteller ray explained he surely knows where all the best story threads are then we must go to him chlorine said tweeter saw nimby nod this was evidently where the dragon had been taking them anyway could you tell us where to find him ill do better than that ray said ill show you where he is its not far from here tweeter realized that the man was probably being so nice because chlorine looked so nice for her species still they could use the help nimby had no objection which was a good sign where are you going chlorine inquired as they ate i am looking for a money tree i was told grows in this vicinity ray said ive been looking all day but i just cant find it but money isnt any use chlorine said it just gets dirty i know but i have a pet money spider and all it will eat is money so i need some more yon ill wind tweeter finished his berry and flew up to get a look at the lay of the land in a hollow just out of sight of the berry patch he spied a tree whose leaves had green backs that could be it so he swooped down and plucked a leaf with his beak then flew back to drop it by the man thats it ray exclaimed thats money you found it where is it tweeter flew back toward the money tree leading the man ray was delighted this will feed spider mon for a year he exclaimed stuffing a pocket full of the leaves how can i repay you tweeter shrugged he didnt need any repayment for such a favor it was just an incidental thing well maybe something will turn up ray said they resumed their travel with ray walking ahead to show the way there is a bad dragon in these parts he said i prefer to avoid him but he lurks near the pawpaw wizards home hoping to catch a careless child he looks like this an image of a ravening firebreathing dragon appeared before him oh chlorine cried for an instant mistaking it for the real thing the image vanished im sorry ray said i should have warned you thats my talentto cause a picture of what i see to appear in any size ive seen that awful dragon so many times i can show it from my head nor mally i must be looking at something to picture it i should have shown it much smaller the image reappeared harmlessly tiny i certainly hope we dont encounter that dragon chlorine said i much prefer the harmless muleheaded variety she patted nimby on the scales the scales she touched brightened but they were not in luck there was a bellowing roar and the ground shook as something solid tramped toward them through the forest hide chlorine cried looking wildly around but piers anthony they happened to be in a broad glade there was nowhere to hide maybe i can make a picture of a tree or something ray said uncertainly to hide us but tweeter had a better idea he flew to the man and peeped imperatively maybe so ray agreed ill try it he fixed his eyes on tweeter the dragon burst from the forest trailing a plume of smoky fire there was no doubt it had wind of them but as its burning snoot oriented a monstrous image of tweeter appeared before them as tall as the trees picture tweeter peered down at the much smaller dragon the reptile hesitated eyeing the big bird it was clear it hadnt seen anything quite like this before a parakeet as big as a roc but it could smell tweeters bird odor so knew there was a bird there tweeter hoped it wouldnt be smart enough to realize that the real bird wasnt as big as the apparent bird tweeter took a giant step toward the dragonand nimby lifted a front foot and slammed it into the ground making a dull thud tweeter took another step with an other thud tweeter opened his beak and the giant mir rored him exactly that beak was big enough to take in the whole dragon head the dragon had had enough it turned tail and fled oh glorious chlorine exclaimed delighted you saved us tweeter tweeter shook his head and the giant bird did too he hadnt done it rays huge image had ray had more than repaid the favor he thought he owed yet tweeter did feel a certain foolish pride never before and probably never again would he back off a firedragon it had been a great experience they walked on and came to another glade there sat a short fat man with short stocky legs a bald pate sur rounded by a fringe of gray hair and an infamously huge stomach mundanestyle spectacles perched on his nose yon ill wind he spied me party and smiled hello ray who are your friends they dont look much like children of course few children dare venture out with this remarkable recent weather weve been having ray smiled they found the money tree for me now spider mon will be happy they need to find a fresh story thread and i told them you were the one to see he turned halfway to face the group the damsel is chlorine the dragon is nimby and the bird is tweeter i hope you can help them now i must go home with my money before the storm gets worse he departed i am gerald towne once from mundania the paw paw wizard said i believe i recognize a fellow mun danian he looked at tweeter a parakeet tweeter chirped agreement so of course im not really a wizard in the proper sense because only natives have magic but the children do like my tales the wizard said i have many fine story threads and i know where others are what kind do you need nimby assumed manform and wrote a note i think you folk must have quite a story of your own the wizard remarked observing the change of form perhaps some day you will share it with me maybe when the crisis is over chlorine agreed then she took the note we need a strong original reverse story thread the wizard whistled you must be on serious business indeed then i wont delay he gestured to a table beside him have some peanut butter jelly and cheese sand wiches while i explain they settled down to share the sandwiches chlorine put some peanut butter on her finger for tweeter to eat and it was good because there were some peanut chunks in it the pawpaw wizard began his story there was once about two hundred years ago a very unpopular magician named joshua his talent was to reverse magical proper ties whether these were talents or charms because most pters anthony folk did not like to have their talents reversed especially when they were nice ones they stayed away from joshua in droves for example there was one young woman whose talent was to smell of perfume when joshua touched her she stnelled of stink horn there was a young man whose talent was to scale walls by sticking to them with his hands and feet when he brushed by joshua he became slippery instead so that he couldnt even stick to the ground without slipping another man could always find the right spot for something whether for an excellent snooze or for a dog to mark territory after he met joshua he always found the wrong spot leading to considerable embarrassment so joshua was not welcome in his home village or anywhere else once the people had experience with him though he was a perfectly decent and well intentioned man fortunately his reversals were not per manent unless done intentionally they would slowly fade in the course of a few weeks or months and the normal talents would reassert themselves so people wanted joshua to go away and stay away and so joshua traveled a lot one day he happened to come upon a fine grove of xanthorrhoed trees they were unfamiliar to him and grew so thickly they barred his passage so he invoked his talent to reverse their magic he did not realize that they belonged to a powerful witch who had imbued them with special magic to enhance the magic of others when he reversed them they in turn reversed the magic of others and were unusable for the witchs purposes she in a fury set her pet griffins on joshua and they tore him to pieces before he could reverse them thus he died and no one mourned him the witch still furious then chopped up the trees and scattered them all around xanth she thought that would denature them but instead the wood maintained its strength and remains potent today thus the origin of re verse wood the source of a great deal of mischief and some benefit throughout xanth but in the course of his career joshua once encoun yon ill wind tered a fine thread of a story again not realizing its na turehe was by no means the brightest of magicianshe reversed it ruining the story it was supposed to support disgusted the tale teller of the time threw it away and it was lost thus that reverse story thread remains some where we know not where if it has not been destroyed that is the thread you require but i have no idea how you can get it the pawpaw wizard sat back tweeter sagged how could they get a thread if it had been destroyed two cen turies ago their mission was surely doomed but nimby was writing another note chlorine took it and read it how do the forces of nature feel about traveling in time the wizard whistled again they dont like it because they regard it as being against nature but they do have the power to give a person a pass to travel in time if they can be persuaded that this is necessary i suppose you could ask them if you think your reason is persuasive well its to save xanth from being blown away chlorine said the wizard nodded that does seem persuasive i wish you well he hesitated then remarked i dont mean to pry but if you really have a way to go back then i may have some additional information chlorine looked at nimby i think we do intend to go there then i must warn you of another person who lived in that time and he plunged into his story he was xanths very worst vampire a mean creature who really sucked his very name would strike fear into the bravest of the brave so i wont mention it here most people simply called him fang face it was thought that he could be killed only by a reverse wood stake through the heart but since reverse wood didnt exist quite then it seemed he was invulnerable a few people knew that he disliked garlic and feared sunlight but it wouldnt be easy piers anthony to kill him in those ways you couldnt just take a blood thirsty vampire for a stroll in the sun or invite him to share a slice of garlic bread with you no it was going to take more than that to dispatch old fang face but after the vampire sucked a woman so dry that she had to be dunked immediately in a healing spring and still looked rather desiccated her husband decided it was time to get rid of him im going to get that sucker he swore unfortunately his talent was just of the spotonthewall variety not worth mentioning when it came to matching anyones magic he felt quite inferior he knew that if he challenged the vampire directly he would merely become another blood donor but he was a strong man and an intelligent one so he concluded that he could probably do it if he just used his head his name was uh well for gettable he wasnt a very memorable person anyway all that matters is what he did this one time he fashioned a dummy out of various objects such as a milk pod for a head and lady fingers for hands and a pair of jugs for the upper torso but he turned out to be pretty good at dummying and the result had considerable stork appeal it looked just like a very sanguine young womanthat is filled with tasty blood he propped her up atop a pile of dry wood then he covered her with supersticky sap and arrow grass and tangled tree tenta cles the tentacles looked like a skirt that covered not quite enough of her plump legs and the sap looked like a cling ing blouse over her ample bosom but anything that touched that lush body would be stuck to it for some time he hauled the entire assemblagebody and woodpile to a path near the vampires crypt and set it up in a mar velously appealing fashion the trap was set now to bait it help the man screamed in a falsetto voice from behind the dummy im an innocent lovely sweet juicy damsel in deep distress im all tied up and can hardly even kick my tender feet let alone escape wont someone please rescue me before i catch a sniffle from all this exposure yon ill wind soon a man came along the path he was a cool char acter which was obvious because he wore snowshoes but the snow almost melted when he spied the lovely dummy well now he said and took a step toward her the storks will get no rest today but this was the wrong man he wasnt the vampire he was just a typical sexist lunkhead whose elimination wouldnt make any difference to anyone it was necessary to make him go away in a hurry oh thank you kind sir the husband cried in his cracked falsetto voice i never thought a man as hand some as you would take an interest in me im just one of several aides to the cruel vampire the lunk paused youre a what one of the aides the husband cried aides aides thats what i thought you said im not touching any aides im outta here and the lunk took off leaving behind chunks of snow from his cold feet the husband sighed a breath of relief only his quick and dirty wit had saved his trap that time he hoped the vampire would be the next one to pass by this time his fortune was good the vampire arrived methinks i see a luscious creature he opined san guine and helplessexactly the way i prefer he marched up and plunged his fangs into the temptingly ex posed flesh of the dummy then he recoiled this isnt blood he cried in out rage this is milk what are you doing with milk in your body exactly where did you bite me the husband asked in his falsetto you should know better than to bite a milkmaid in the heaving bosom i didnt bite your bosom i bit your neck the vampire screamed do you think i dont know where to bite a helpless damsel anyway it wasnt heaving then he realized the significance of that hey this isnt a real womanits a stupid dummy piers anthony fancy that the husband said abandoning the falsetto which was becoming a strain anyway guess it takes one to bite one the vampire tried to pull away but the arrowgrass hair had caught his head and the tentacle skirt had grabbed his legs in addition the sticky sap had glued his face to the dummys neck help he cried all i wanted to do was have a nice snack of blood and now im stuck and in a moment youll be a roast you sap the husband said gleefully just as soon as i light a fire under you and he proceeded to do just that you fool the vampire cried out of the side of his stuck face you cant kill me im immortal oh im sure thats an exaggeration the husband said warming his hands as the fire blazed up not much of one the vampire clarified youll see you fool ill be back to taste your blood yet if so youll have to do it as ashes because thats what youll soon be maybe youll find a nice piece of ash to bite maybe ill bury your ashes in a hole making you an ash hole the man laughed at his wit which was just as well because the vampire didnt find it very funny however the husband should have taken the threat more seriously because the vampire really was immortal in his fashion as he burned to ashes each ash became a mos quito the mosquito knew only one thing and that was to suck blood like critics they swarmed all over anything that lived and sucked the husband was their very first victim but for some reason he didnt feel honored he fled swatting himself unmercifully and ever since then the vampire mosquitoes have plagued xanth the pawpaw wizard concluded and mundania too where it seems as if they have been forever but thats only because of the itching but that is of little concern to you the point is that the vampire didnt die until shortly btefore the reverse magician did and he lived in the same general region in fact they were friends of a yon ill wind sort the one did not try to suck the blood of the other and the other did not reverse the one into a bloodspitting image so if you go there and then you are bound to encounter him and you probably wouldnt care to chlorine shuddered thank you for the warning we shall do our best to avoid the vampire at least we wont have to worry about mosquitoes and some believe that the story thread joshua lost may be in the possession of the vampire chlorine looked at nimby evidently hoping for a ne gation but nimby nodded oh no she groaned now tweeter understood why nimby had not felt this would be an easy mission but they had no choice they had to go after that thread so they moved on after thanking the pawpaw wizard for the information and the sandwiches nimby knew where to find the forces of nature who as fortune would have it were not far distant they came to a region of ashes chlorine looked around in alarm but nimby was unconcerned so she relaxed in its center was a burning circle and in the circle stood an attractive young or seemingly young woman whose long hair was the color of flame and whose short skirt was the color of smoke she was evidently enjoying herself doing a dance her bare feet unhurt by the hot coals chlorine read nimbys note fira force of fire we are on a mission to save xanth from destruction will you give us a pass to travel two hundred years into the past fira paused and her fire and smoke paused with her she eyed chlorine as if resenting her beauty whats in it for me she demanded if xanth gets blown away there will be nothing left to bum chlorine explained your flames will expire for lack of fuel um fira said impressed very well i will give you a quarter pass but you may not find my sisters so amendable she extended a flaming fragment of paper chlorine hesitated to take it as did tweeter but nimby piers anthony took it in his hand the fire died down though the paper continued to glow thank you chlorine said we are burning with gratitude they hurried on soon they came to a small lake in the center of it stood a woman whose gown and headdress flowed liquidly across her frame which seemed to be as completely supple as water chlorine read another note mareen lady of water will you help us to save xanth from dehydration it was clear that a key word had been uttered please dont utter blasphemy in my presence mareen said i apologize chlorine said quickly i meant that xanth faces a severe loss of water and will be all washed up if we dont go to the past to of course ill help you mareen said here is a quarter pass she produced a blue square of water which turned out to be an aquacolored card when chlorine took it thank you so much we are overflowing with grati tude they went on until they came to a gray rock statue of a woman in a plant green robe decorated with red straw berries she carried a cornucopia from which a wheat shrouded pumpkin was about to emerge and her other hand was extended with a handful of seeds alanda lady of land will you help us to save the land of xanth from being utterly despoiled chlorine read from nimbys note tweeter was coming to appre ciate the finesse of language employed the statue came to life hows that again alanda asked sharply xanth will be blown into nothing but windblown mounds of garbage hardly better than the spoils of war that harpies so love if we dont travel to the past to here is a quarter pass alanda said presenting a cob of corn she culled from the cornucopia the cob became yellow paper as chlorine accepted it yon ill wind thank you most copiously chlorine said they continued until they came to a windy glade here there floated a woman with waistlength windblown hair and a long windblown cape and a big hawk on her arm tweeter was somewhat wary of the hawk but nimby did not seem concerned indeed nimby indicated that tweeter should address the bird tweeter gulped and made his best effort oh mighty hawk he said in bird talk will your companion win dona hear our plea get to the point hummingbird the hawk snapped tweeter decided to ignore the slight as it was probably deliberate hurricane happy bottom is going to blow xanth away if we dont stop her by fetching a story thread from the past so we need a pass to why should we care about that the hawk asked we are creatures of wind tweeter thought fast if the storm blows away all the trees there will be no place for nests and no prey species left and happy bottom will be the most powerful entity of air blowing windona into hasbeen status she here is your pass windona said abruptly tweeter was startled he hadnt realized that she understood bird talk thank you most breezily tweeter said taking the pass in his beak it resembled a feather becoming feathery paper they continued on until they came to a private glade there was a table in the center it turned out to be made entirely of salt table salt chlorine said pleased just what we need she spread out the cards they had received from the four forces of nature then they assembled the four passes one was a quarter pass one and the next was a quarter pass two and quarter pass three and quarter pass four together they formed a complete license to go against nature one time chlorine filled in the time nimby indicated apull then she sat on nimby dragon and tweeter perched piers anthony on her hair and she invoked the crime against nature let us pass to the past she said suddenly they were in a different glade or maybe the same one a hundred and ninetysix years before clothed by different trees they would have four quarters of an hour to complete their mission before the past passed and they reverted to the present ready or not and i hope we dont encounter the vampire chlo rine said with another shudder tweeter agreed maybe we can find the thread in his lair while hes out sucking up elsewhere nimby wrote a note chlorine read it and paled he wears the thread she said he has a balky button on his cape and the thread reverses the buttons nature and makes it amenable so its always with him how can we possibly get that thread without getting sucked nimby looked at tweeter oh no tweeter felt his stiff little legs turn to jelly he should have known that he hadnt been invited along just for the ride but there was more nimby was writing again chlorine read the new note i can take you to the vampire ge stalt but it will not be easy to take the thread because he values it chlorine looked up causing tweeter to adjust his perch on her hair i can fix that i think i can stand before the vampire and stun him by showing him my pant ies she paused seeing nimbys head shake she looked back down at the note she hadnt finished reading tweeter readjusted oh panties dont freak out vam pires only lush pulsing sanguine necks she looked up again and tweeter rode with it well then ill bare my lush pulsing sanguine neck and another shake made her look back at the note oh were not allowed to hurt the vampire because that would change xanth his tory in unpredictable ways he must meet his destined fate as described she looked up and tweeter shifted again but that means that xanth will be plagued by hungry mosquitoes cant we eliminate them another shake sent her back to the note a number of special creatures yon ill wind came to prey on those mosquitoes such as a fine type of netting and several repellents she looked up i met a repellent once it was a disgusting creature but i suppose nets are useful she resumed reading and their elim ination would mess up xanth in other unpredictable ways it might even interfere with the story line we are in elim inating us as characters she gulped and looked up again tweeter was beginning to feel motion sick sud denly i see the point this is all in the past so any change can affect us and we dont want that because we might cause ourselves never to exist and our great adventure would be erased before it started so what must we do she looked back at the note we must try to get the thread without gestalt noticing she looked up once more tweeter hoped that was the last one and thats it we cant hurt him or make too much of a fuss lest we imperil our own very existence this scares me tweeter agreed emphatically he wasnt a creature of xanth but he was affected by xanth because what would happen if the baldwin family blundered into it and there was no chlorine to help them get through it no nimby to know the spot answers they could be in much worse trouble and xanth itself might be doomed without then help he had never seen nimby nervous before now he understood how justified the dragons attitude was and he tweeter had somehow to get that thread with out doing any harm or getting caught so he could help save xanth from the resurgent ill wind it seemed to be altogether too tall an order for one little bird he realized that chlorine and nimby were looking at him well nimby was the womans eyes were trying to see him but he remained perched on top of her head so her gaze was missing him by about a wingspan but she was trying they wanted to know his reaction what else was there to do cheep he said boldly well im glad you have confidence chlorine said youre the one who needs it most piers anthony for sure tweeter tried to control his unconfident shiv ering but ill help all i can she continued maybe i will show him my panties because that should distract him somewhat without actually freaking him outwhich is what we want but im not going to let him near my tender neck tweeter appreciated that so i guess wed better go find the vampire chlorine said halfway briskly and i guess wed better play dam sel and dragon so as to be as distracting as possible while tweeter goes after the thread nimby assumed his dragon form and chlorine got on him nimby knew exactly where to go as always so in only a moment and an instant or perhaps two instants and a trace they arrived at the lair of the dread vampire tweeter was halfway disappointed it wasnt a big spooky old ancient castle but merely a hut formed of bloodroot roots all tangly and red with a thatch of blood root leaves the sagging door was closed the hut was in deep shade because vampires werent especially keen on sunshine he must be asleep chlorine said i understand they sleep a lot in the daytime nimby nodded his donkey head so ill just call him out she decided she paused as if hoping someone would tell her no but no one did so she adjusted her blouse and skirt to show just so much and no more while tweeter flew to a nearby tree hoping to be able to approach the vampire from be hind but i wonder whether you couldnt just fly in and get it while hes asleep she said suffering a moderate after thought but nimby shook his head no so chlorine completed her adjustments which really werent necessary as she was equally lovely regardless and lifted her chin and her voice oooo vampire ge yon ill wind stalt she called without a lot of volume are you in there in a moment the door opened and a dark figure ap peared who calls me it inquired in a sinister tone or two now tweeter saw why the sleep approach wouldnt have worked the cloak was just unkinking from a tight wrap and the button on the side was just coming into sight it would have been inaccessible while the vampire slept probably he slept in a closed coffin box anyway making the chore even more difficult so it had to be while he was up and preferably outside for a more ready escape i called you chlorine said in a somewhat quavery voice i understand youyou like succulent young maid ens the dark vampire brightened indeed i do come into my den succulent damsel and we shall share a rare delight tweeter moved closer the button was now fully ex posed and he could see a strand of thread behind it there was his target but i dont like dingy interiors chlorine said i prefer the bright outdoors she moved in her saddle so that her skirt sort of accidentally fell askew revealing a wellfleshed thigh but the delights i offer are best savored in shadow the vampire said his eyes seemed to play about her neck line more than her skirtline well maybe if we meet halfway she suggested ad justing herself again this time her blouse got accidentally disarrayed so that some of her fair white column of a neck showed maybe so the vampire said licking his thin lips thirstily he walked out toward themand coincidentally past tweeters hiding place tweeter nerved himself with what little nerve he had he was a small bird so it wasnt muchand flew around and behind the figure coming in on the button he landed piers anthony on it snatching for the thread with his beak unfortunately the thread did not give way the vampire felt the tug whats this he demanded glancing down this is a tender panty chlorine cried snatching up her skirt to show it then remembering she reversed course and snatched open the front of her blouse to reveal her pulsing neck and somewhat more i mean a silken bosuh neck old habits died hard but she was too late the flash of silken panty hadnt stunned the vampire just as nimby had warned it wouldnt and by the time her tender neck showed the vampires gaze had departed her body his hand was no slower it dropped down and closed about tweeter we have an avian creature he ex claimed surprised someone is giving me the bird pay no attention to that bird chlorine cried desper ately he doesnt have more than a drop of blood while i have half a slew uh wash uh jug she ripped open the rest of her blouse showing her entire delectable front which indeed had not one but two ample jugs but the vampire gestalt canny in his fashion would not be distracted all in good time he told chlorine without looking what were you after bird my button are you a button hooker he held tweeter up before his face helpless no hes not chlorine screamed hes just a stupid little bird while im a delectable heavingbosomed maiden girl damsel with a stunning pair of panuh breasuh i mean soft tender neck but all her valiant efforts were for naught i think you are up to something bird the vampire said things al ways occur as aspects of wholes and i dont understand your part or your whole stop talking dirty chlorine cried but it was a fading ploy the vampire ignored her turned around and swept back into his hut inside he closed the dismal door checked the dirty win dows and let tweeter go you cant escape this horren yon ill wind dous hovel bird so you might as well confess gestalt said what were you really after and why tweeter thought fast maybe he had half a chance if he used his little noggin well should he tell the truth no because the vampire wouldnt believe it nobody would believe that a stupid little bird came from the future on a mission to save xanth from destruction but what else was there did someone send you gestalt demanded under stand bird i really dont care much about you as the damsel says you have only a drop of blood in you while she is relatively luscious but i like to understand the big picture tell me and ill let you go tell him what that they had to have his reverse thread to fashion a new story line before the old one broke he wouldnt believe that either none of this was really be lievable come come bird gestalt said impatiently i dont have all day my last several victims have escaped and im really pretty hungry if that luscious damsel is gone by the time i settle with you i shall be most displeased he stretched his mouth showing his fangs then a little light flashed over tweeters little head it was only a faint light not at all matching the lights that flashed over chlorines head when she got good ideas but it did illuminate his little mind suddenly he knew what to tell gestalt ah i see you have decided to cooperate the vampire said then lets get on with it one nod for yes two for no three for further definition agreed tweeter nodded once gestalt did seem to grasp the whole of things readily you came for something nod yes the button nod nod no surely not my cloak yesno piers anthony gestalt understood bad phrasing but what else couldthe thread yes but this is a very special thread it reverses yes ah so you know its qualities i need this thread to hold my recalcitrant button nod nod nod theres more how could you persuade me to part with this magic thread nod nod nod gestalt smiled true i need to get specific can you honestly say i would benefit from yes yes parting with this thread would do me good yes gestalt stroked a fang this intrigues me it would do me good with my cloak he saw tweeters negation my house no my sleep no my food yes then the vampire did a double take or at least a one and a half take are you telling me that this thread interferes with my feeding yes gestalt stroked his other fang let me see whether i can figure your rationale this thread was made by joshua the famed reverse magician with whom i share a reason able portion of a friendship it reverses things it reverses the contrary nature of my button are you saying it does not stop there yes so what else would it reverse my fortunes my then a big bulb flashed over his head my prey when i get close it reverses the nature of my victims and they become unamenable instead of being lulled by my aura so that i can sip of their blood without their resistance they become alarmed and flee since all they have to do is step into the sunshine i am unable to pursue them far yon ill wind and so my fortune is changedby the presence of this reverse thread yes he had fathomed it with marvelous precision once given the clue that was exactly the thought that tweeters little bulb had illuminated the vampire gestalt smiled we made a deal and you have delivered you have shown me why i do not want to retain this thread you need it i do not accordingly i will give it to you and let you go on one condition nod nod nod that you take it so far away that it will never be near me again agreed yes the vampire unwound the thread releasing the button which promptly became balky again he extended the thread to tweeter tweeter took it in his beak it gave him a funny feeling he spread his wings and tried to fly but just sank down against the table it is reversing you now gestalt said i think you will have to walk out of here rather than fly he opened the door i trust you can make it on the ground tweeter tried to nod but shook his head instead he walked unsteadily out the door nimby was there with chlorine the dragon extended the tip of his tail and tweeter climbed up on it then without giving him a chance to scramble up to chlorine nimby trundled rapidly away from the hut wait the vampire cried i have business with the succulent damsel not anymore chlorine cried back i showed you my almost everything but you spumed me ill take my panbosjugmy whatever elsewhere thank you all the same ah well gestalt said philosophically i should have no trouble now finding a replacement he headed purposefully in the other direction another little bulb flashed over tweeters head he re alized why nimby was not letting him approach chlorine piers anthony he had the reverse thread and it was reversing him to a degree if he took it to chlorine it would mess her up too so he had to stay here far from the main action to carry the thread without doing any damage to the others well that was what he would do he had succeeded in his mis sion now all nimby had to do was get them back in time or forward in time before their time ran out demon the demon x th was halfsatisfied he had en abled chlorine and tweeter to fetch back the re verse story thread which had taken effect the moment it reached the present time now sendings ploy had been reversed and the story was back to normal happy bottom was confined in the region of air and hurricane fracto was romancing her or taming the shrew as jim baldwin put it in his mundanish way xanth had been saved from one threat but the other threat remained if chlorine did not shed one tear of love or grief for nimby the bet would be lost and then x would be demoted to the least of de mons and the land of xanth would be forfeited that meant it would probably be destroyed that would be too bad because x had recently come to know this land well and it had grown on him he had largely ignored it for millennia but he would do so no longer becoming a character within it had entirely changed his outlook what are you thinking of nimby chlorine inquired brightly interrupting his reverie what a delight she had turned out to be but she would not shed her last tear for yon ill wind him because then she would be blind that was the ulti mate cost of his inattention that had allowed him to choose the wrong companion defeat of course he couldnt answer her but he twitched an ear in acknowledgement that satisfied her she patted his hide and rode on he liked it when she did that which was a signal of how his attitude had modified now they were nearing castle roogna for the big cel ebration of victory over the wind everyone was to be thereeveryone who cared to be including chlorine and her silent companion nimby they came to the mundane rv or moving house the child karen spied them first and dashed out hi chlo rine hi nimby she threw her arms around his donkey head and kissed him on the striped pink and green snout he liked that too glad you could make it she dashed back in to notify the others that little girl belongs in xanth chlorine remarked dismounting with her own dragon true karen had not yet properly learned the arts of dissembling her actions mirrored her thoughts she liked xanth and she liked nimby not caring half a whit how odd he looked her greeting had been sincere which was why he appreciated it the others came out glad to see you again nimby jim baldwin said well be going tomorrow but we wanted you to know that we couldnt have done it without you of course he knew that nimby already knew that but his mundane protocol required him to make a formal statement that too he liked mary approached but perhaps it would be better if you attended the festivities in your human form she mur mured yes chlorine agreed immediately in formal cloth ing too and i hope you know how to dance of course he could dance be had learned that in the course of his survey of the land and people and things of xanth so he changed to human form in a royal robe piers anthony sean and willow emerged they were somber they had not resolved their impasse they were in love and could not bear to be separated but they were of different realms neither suited for the other realm in seans mind was a notion of separating from his family to remain in xanth but he was held back by the knowledge that this would so greatly hurt the other members of the family as to mire him in perpetual guilt in willows mind was the thought of going with him to mundania where she thought she would die but at least she would have a little more time with him but she realized that this would be worse for sean than separation so she would bravely bid him fare well and when he was gone she would do what she should have done at the outset and fly to mount rushmost were they had reunited tie her wings together so she could not fly and throw herself off the precipice then she would be at peace and sean would never know so would suffer no additional grief nimby knew these things but could not speak them and did not care to write them he also knew that good news was on the way for them so that affair would have a happy ending and perhaps that was best just as it was best that all the folk of xanth be happy this day not know ing very well chlorine said not knowing the nature or velocity of his thoughts put me in a lovely party gown and hairdo for the party gee are you going to change right out here david asked his twelveyearold pupils dilating the presence of chlorine accelerated his race toward maturity especially since big brother sean had lost interest right out here chlorine agreed smiling suddenly her complete outfit shifted as nimby changed her accord ing to her wish in somewhat less than an eyeblink nat urally david had blinked in that moment so saw none of what he had hoped to aww the boy said disappointed chlorine turned to nimby you know hes mun yon ill wind dane she murmured low would it be too great a vio lation if he caught half a glimpse considering the spirit of the occasion her mind made clear the nature of her request she knew that she would not have this beautiful body much longer because the adventure was almost over and she wanted to leave a lasting impression on someone without actually being tried for violation of the adult conspiracy she also wanted to give the boy a treat and she did not hold the conspiracy in as much awe as was proper because of her background as a woman nobody much looked at anyway so nimby removed her dress for one full blink at a time when only david happened to be looking so that she stood in eyeballnumbing yellowgreen bra and panties then he restored the outfit as if it had never lapsed there was no evidence and no other witness so there would be no case even if someone suspected davids brown eyes turned yellowgreen and his jaw dropped brief as it was it had still been too much of a dose he was stunned and about to fall but nimby caught one arm and chlorine the other promise not to tell she whispered in the boys ear david nodded numbly he would recover because he was mundane and not quite of age for the full effect to register but it was a close call mundanes it turned out werent all that different from xanthians as it was the boy would start pursuing girls a full year earlier than he would have otherwise the secret glimpse had advanced his thymetable that far david are you all right mary inquired with a mothers instant awareness of any passing indisposition in her child davids mouth worked jusjust great he said awed mary glanced somewhat suspiciously at chlorines low and curvaceous decolletage go with your sister she said she suspected that the boy had seen a bit too much piers anthony so was moving him away from it fortunately she sus pected only about a quarter of the reality they walked as a group toward castle roogna but da vid still glazed stumbled mary caught him and looked in his face your eyes she exclaimed theyre green now she suspected half the reality but being mundane she had an abiding disbelief of magic so couldnt bring herself to suspect the whole of it that was just as well the boys eyes had been stained permanently green by what he had seen castle roogna came into view gloriously magical and there coming out to greet them was a lovely princess they didnt recognize who is that creature jim inquired then karen spied a freckle thats princess electra she squealed looking princessly she was correct nimby had known of course but hadnt been asked normally electra ran around in blue jeans but on formal occasions she suppressed her nature and played her royal role clothes made all the difference karen ran up to the princess how can you stand being so regal she demanded electra made a careful royal moue it isnt easy she confessed but somebody has to do it after the official greetings are over lets get together with jenny elf and sneak away to pig out on chocolate pie we can wear she glanced around to be sure no one else was in earshot shorts and tank tops ooooo karen squealed delighted its a date then electra put her royal face back on and turned to the others so nice to meet you again good people but i believe i have not met one of your number before this is willow elf sean said quickly her winged elm tree is very large so i see electra said so nice to meet you willow elf she extended her hand in princessly manner willow bowed and her wings quivered thank you princess and how did you come to join this party electra yon ill wind inquired i had understood that the winged elves seldom associate with groundbound folk sean and i washed in a love spring before we real ized willow explained oh i understand electra said with instant sympathy when prince dolph kissed me awake after my several centuries of sleep the magic made me love him instantly but he didnt love me at least you were together but didnt he marry you willow asked oh yes eventually but at first he was more interested in princess nada naga how could any man not be most interested in you willow asked amazed when you see nada you will understand electra paused oh there are the winged centaurs arriving come willow i must introduce you to them im sure youll like them then remembering her royal duties she paused again but first i must conduct all of you to the castle in style yet it was evident that she wanted to greet the centaurs first mary was the one to find a way to alleviate the problem well be glad to wait until the centaurs can join us prin cess then we can all enter together oh thank you come willow the princess hurried toward the field where the centaurs were landing and wil low went with her sean remained behind i think they have girl things to discuss he said he was right electra wanted to compare notes on magic love having met another woman who had encountered it the baldwins and chlorine waited while electra and willow met the centaurs and exchanged more introduc tions then that group returned to join the family there were four centaurs che cynthia chena and crystal the family had met them before of course indeed chena and crystal had helped significantly in the effort to herd happy bottom north it was a nice reunion but there was a nicer one coming as the princess was piers anthony about to conduct them all to the castle nimby nudged chorine and gave her a note her eyes widened then she spoke princess could we wait just a bit more nimby says other centaurs are coming electra looked blank more centaurs the good magician invited them the princess nodded then we had better wait for them but i hadnt realized that any more centaurs had participated in the wind venture now they heard the beat of galloping hooves two groundbound centaurs che said he could tell by the sound they dont normally care to associate with our kind they certainly dont chena agreed are you sure then the two came into view a male and a female chena screatned carieton she galloped out to meet them her brother jim said remembering we promised to relay his greeting to her and we did and sheila sean said id recognize that bosom anywhere then conscious of willow beside him he added not that i care im not jealous willow said i could show you something similar if i dared she meant that it was not safe to risk an exposure that might cause them both to forget the danger of summoning a stork since they could not be a family her words were also an invitation of a sort because she expected to be dead long before any stork found her so she might as well do itif he agreed you already did in the love spring he reminded her i almost wish we had then he remembered that they were in the company of his family and stifled it but jim and mary were already exchanging a knowing glance they well understood the invitation and the tentative ac ceptance indeed jim was inclined to give them leave and mary was weakening it was evident that the love of the yon ill wind two young folk was complete but that they would have to separate soon meanwhile chena centaur collided with her brother hugging him i thought id never see you again she cried through her tears of joy i had a similar concern he admitted i feared for your safety on the brutish mainland he drew back a little but you seem to have changed i have joined a new species she said i am now a winged monster she spread her wings so i see i suppose it is for the best if you are satis fied yes i am except for one thing two things one two i miss my family and i would like to find some winged stallions do you suppose that any on centaur isle he smiled i suppose it is time to confess i found myself dissatisfied with things on centaur isle and thought that if you had found a suitable situation i might join your group in fact i know of some others who also might wish to join if it were clear that they would be welcome ooooo chena cried just like a human maiden she hugged him again then turned to crystal would you welcome a new stallion from centaur isle if he put on wings we are among human folk crystal said therefore the adult conspiracy prevents me from answering in de tail but i think a very general affirmative would be in order carieton glanced at her you have not been a centaur long i suspect he remarked you are speaking as you think a centaur would speak crystal blushed is it so obvious im trying so hard i think a centaur stallion would be glad to exchange elocution instruction for flying instruction while this dialogue was occurring sheila centaur was renewing her acquaintance with the family and chlorine piers anthony and david was staring at her front why david sheila remarked your eyes are green centaurs were obser vant and had good memories as well as good mammaries yeah he said it didnt occur to him to wonder why a glimpse of a green bra should stain his eyes while a complete look at a fine bare bosom merely made his eyes dilate this was of course the magic of certain garments how come you came here karen asked i mean you helped us on our way and were glad but do you really care about mainland xanth sheila looked as if she was possibly pondering the mer est hint of a blush which would have been very unusual for a normal centaur it is true that my main interest is in centaur isle but carleton wished to see his sister again and i was indisposed to allow him to travel that far alone i get it karen cried with juvenile lack of circum spection youre sweet on carleton karen mary cautioned while that is not the way i would have chosen to ex press it the sentiment is accurate sheila confessed where he goes i go there was a slight stress on the words because she had a notion where carleton was go ing they got organized and started for the castle again but there was another arrival it was a young woman with tan gled hair and a small dog immediately woofer and midrange took note and went out to meet the newcomers tweeter perched on karens hair chirped that alerted the girl snarland his lost mistress she cried running after the pets so it was snarl had received an invitation to the party because he had helped the wind effort and he had brought ursa along too not wishing to separate from his mistress again the girl seemed a bit baffled by it all but karen quickly filled her in while cuddling snarl there was another round of introductions they started in againbut were paused by still another arrival no one recognized the four women striding pur yon ill wind posefully toward them until tweeter cheeped again then chlorine who had been talking with the centaurs looked the four forces of nature she exclaimed everyones here there were more introductions this time made by chlo rine firathe force of fire she said of the fiery woman mareenthe force of water alandathe force of land and windonathe force of air they helped us go to find the reverse story thread the four women nod ded graciously fortunately chlorine did not clarify that the women had enabled them to travel back in time now at last they all went to the castle souffle serpent was in the moat standing tali with a little black bow tie on his neck to show that he was part of the resident staff they crossed the drawbridge which was gaily deco rated and entered the castle proper there in a gown that made mary wince was princess nada naga and suddenly willow understood why prince dolph had been distracted from princess electra in the early days of their relation ship but there were also the demoness mentia and trenita imp and princess ivy and many others and any concerns about who might catch on to what were lost in the welter of additional introductions and remembrances then jenny elf and another woman approached willow hello sean jenny said this is wira the good ma gicians daughterinlaw she must talk with willow wira sean asked but isnt she he caught himself blind wira finished for him that is why jenny is guiding me here in this less familiar castle i am willow willow said approaching her wira smiled magician humfrey asked me to give you this she held out a card thank you willow said but what is it it is a pass to xanth present it at the station on no name key in mundania and you and your companions will be admitted piers anthony but i cant go to mundania willow protested i would die the good magician says that isnt true but you would lose your wings and become a human maiden while there your problem is not in leaving xanth but in returning keep this pass with you always willows eyes widened you mean i can go with sean and have my wings when i return and he can come back with me please dont speak so loudly wira cautioned the good magician would not like to have it widely known that he ever did a favor without charge but considering your service in helping to save xanth from the wind he felt it was warranted oh willow cried on the verge of fainting from joy and relief tell him thank you thank you thank but wira was gone we can be together sean breathed im sure dad will let you travel to miami with us but what of your mother she will be silent thats her way of agreeing without actually saying yes to an arrangement some might consider untoward untoward you and me sharing a room sharing in my generation its acceptable for engaged couples to share residence engaged willow was staring at the pass still getting her new bearings willow will you marry me suddenly her bearings were gotten yes she hugged him and kissed him and little hearts floated out oh look karen cried spying a heart as it floated by her nose little hearts theyre engaged then everyone looked and there was applause nimby was glad the good magician had not come in person because he would have had some hard questions yon ill wind for nimby it was not easy to keep the truth from humfrey who was the magician of information obviously the good magician knew that nimby had asked willow to help herd happy bottom north but as obviously he had not fath omed nimbys full nature yet the party began and everyone had an excellent time nimby danced with chlorine and it was wonderful she had not been an expert dancer but he quietly made her so knowing it was her wish then she danced with other males dazzling them and he danced with other females meanwhile princess electra her royal duties done re verted to blue jeans and then to shorts and went out with jenny and the children to pig out on pies if any one noticed anyone had the sense to ignore this infraction of protocol willows winged parents arrived from their flying elm tree and met sean and his family they did not seem com pletely thrilled about her betrothal to a landbound mun dane but quickly saw that the situation was hopeless as willow adamantly refused to take any lovenullifying po tion they also grudgingly appreciated the fact that seans family had helped save xanth from destruction that was worth something so they would live with it somewhere amidst it all king dor formally presented jim baldwin with a certificate of thanks for the familys volunteer effort to save xanth from yon wind now confined to the region of air without you and your traveling house and the special effort of all of your family members and pets we could not have done it the king concluded we owe you an enormous debt of gratitude and regret that we have no way to reward you that will be effective in your homeland but be assured you will be welcome here at any time you choose to return return jim asked blankly when you use the pass magician humfrey gave wil low the king explained any of you will be able to accompany her and sean when they visit your three pets are included of course piers anthony woof woofer agreed thats telling them mutt the floor under him agreed jim looked at his wife we might wish to visit mary said cautiously yea karen exclaimed in time the festivities wore out and folk retired to their rooms in the castle and temporary rooms set up around it folk pretended not to notice how sean and willow shared one of those rooms shes a good young woman was all mary would say hes a good young man willows mother said with similar reservation the two women one mundane the other winged exchanged a glance that transcended cul tures that was enough in the morning the family and willow piled into the rv and headed for the trollway waved on their way by a king a queen and a number of princesses the demoness mentia went also to make sure that they found a suitable gas guzzler and suffered no other problems they also had the mundane addresses of dug and kim two others who had visited xanth and knew something about it some of them would surely be visiting again then chlorine knew it was time for her to go home her big adventurebigger than she had really expectedwas over her folks might be wondering where she was so reluctantly she bid farewell to the royalty and set off for the backwoods riding nimby in dragon form when they got close chlorine had a notion i know this is all about to end nimby she said you promised me one good adventure and you certainly delivered it you have things of your own to do and cant take forever catering to my whims but at least id like to show you to my family before you go away forever will that be all right nimby nodded it was all right because anything she wanted was all right by the terms of his situation but far yon ill wind more hung on her decision than she realizedand he could not tell her that so okay im taking my medicine and declaring this wonderful adventure over she said and at that point she reverted to her natural appearance and nature you are free to do whatever you want with my thanks but if you will be kind enough to wait here until i can bring my family to see you ill really appreciate it its been great nimby her reversion hadnt quite registered yet so she was still being nice then she turned and marched away from him not looking back because she was afraid she would break down and ask for what she thought to be impossible a permanent life as a lovely smart healthy and nice woman and nimby lost his power of motion and magic all that remained was his awareness of all things in xanth but he could no longer affect them in any way he had been reduced to a donkeyheaded hulk and would remain so until he rotted away unless chlorine should shed her tear for him and why should she do that knowing it would blind her the demon x was depressed because he was about to lose his wager and with it his governance of the land of xanth some other demon would take it over and might change it or destroy it because no other demon cared about it the way x th did for he had indeed come to care for it very much and therein lay another irony for he had also fallen in love with chlorine of course he knew that the beautiful smart healthy nice edition was a creation of his magic he had made her literally but he had done it by her request to her speci fications she had become the woman she chose to be when she had the option therefore the seeds of it had been within her she had known her deficiencies and acted to eliminate them chlorine as she had been the past few days was what she would be always given the chance and it was chlorine ideal that he loved she was just the perfect woman in all but one respectthe one she hadnt piers anthony thought of and that was the capacity to love her hard life had washed that out along with her tears until only a vestige remained and so she did not love him back he knew it because he knew her mind as no other did and without that love she would never shed a tear for anyone other than herself x himself had not known the meaning of love before this adventure he had not cared about anyone or anything except himself and his competitive ranking among demons but in order to win chlorines love he had had to learn about love and in the course of that he learned how it had not been easy or sudden because chlorine herself did not truly understand it she thought that love came automatically with beauty and niceness she was mistaken such things merely facilitated it so she had practiced her craft impressing young males by displaying teasing por tions of her healthy body and clothing she had teased nimby too and indeed she had been interesting and he would have liked to summon the stork with her but storks were not identical to love they were more like fellow trav elers there could be storks without love and love without storks chlorine had finally realized that distinction and broken off the effort and in that decision had sown the seed of what she lacked she had realized that she was coming to care for him enough to make playing unkind but she hadnt realized what she was actually searching for it was the mundane family baldwin that had begun to show him the immense potential depth and breadth of love the childrens love for their pets and marys love for the children neither had anything to do with storks but in their subtle ways they were as significant any member of that family was prepared to die to protect any other mem ber not all of them realized it such as david but it was true x had studied that quiet underlying emotion laboring to understand it and gradually had succeeded mary had helped him most by showing her concern for yon ill wind everyone even for him when he had come in soiled from the meatier shower she had treated him like a son and though he was infinitely older than she he had appreciated it she had cared for him and thereby shown him how to care for her it was a kind of commitment that required no magic it was just there like water seeping silently through ground but it was the base on which the more dramatic forms of love were laid such as that between sean and willow true it had been sponsored by a dip in a love spring but neither would have been affected as they were if they had not had solid family love first they had understood the as pects of love and were ready when suddenly it caught fire otherwise the water would merely have caused them to mate uncontrollably summoning as many storks as they could in a short time and then to separate the mood ex pended in the manner of animals instead they had resisted the mating urge for the sake of a larger commitment that they were ironically unable to make for the love they wished to realize in its entirety it had taken xtan some time to analyze that and to emulate it to be sure that he did understand it but that turned out to be a door that once opened could not be closed again he loved chlorine now she had ended the adventure without knowing its significance unable to love herself she had not appreci ated how a donkeyheaded dragon could love her it had all been for fun as she saw it a glorious adventure of the type princesses were wont to have indeed she had danced with a prince and conversed with a king and not made a fool of herself this was her notion of the ultimate now it was over and she was going home and nimby was dying perhaps it had been doomed from the start from the time he had allowed his attention to wander and had ad dressed the wrong young woman the one without tears but somehow he could not regret that now because he could not have loved the other woman more than he loved piers anthony chlorine though he lost the bet and his status and the land of xanth he had gained something infinitely pre cious in return the knowledge and substance of love per haps it was worth it yet how different it might have been had chlorine pos sessed just a smidgen more awareness of the true nature of love she might then have asked for an enhanced ca pacity and then she might have learned to love him but as it was she merely liked him and so his mission here was doomed had she been able to shed her last tear for him he would have won and then what a great and wonderful surprise he would have had for her he would have made her all that she had wanted to be and so much more more than she had ever imagined she could have become the god dess of xanth below only himself because he could not make her a demon all knowledge all power and all joy too could have been hers he would have assumed any form she wanted especially the handsome nimbyman one and obliged her in any way she wished he could have given her any magic talent she wished being no longer limited by fear of discovery of his nature but per haps most important of all he would have given her his love and enabled her to love him in return in the manner of sean and willow and in thanks for the way those two had showed him how gloriously complete true love could be he would have given sean the talent of flying without wings in xanth so he could share willows life com pletely no one else could do such a thing but the demon x had all magic power in his own land and he knew now that a favor done required a favor returned everything everything could have been chlorines for herself and her friends who had helped her battle the wind even those who had come in late like adam and keaira who were now discovering a romance of their own he knew the parts all of them had played and could re ward them all all lost for want of a tear yon ill wind he spread his awareness chlorine had arrived home in her homely badnatured form she tried to tell her mother about her adventure wheres that sprig of thyme you were supposed to fetch you disreputable wench her shrewish mother de manded slapping her she did that often because she knew the girl didnt dare hit back chlorine had completely forgotten about that in fact she didnt even remember that she hadnt been the one sent for a sprig of thyme that was miss fortune chlorine had gone for a bow from a bowvine but the two had collided and gotten confused and proceeded on each others missions ii got distracted she said realizing just how awful her family life had been why had she ever bothered to return to this distracted her brutish father asked did you sneak out to see a stupid boy a stupid boy that was about as far from the truth as it was possible to get not exactly you see i encountered a funnylooking dragon who changed into a handsome man and made me beautiful and we had the most wonderful adventure and helped save xanth from the wind and shut up he shouted lifting his hand to knock some respect into her dont try to tell me any crazy fantastic story wheres this oaf chlorine realized that they were not about to listen so she tried another tack out near the thyme plant do you want to meet him sure i do her father said fetching his club from the wall ill bash his head into pulp you dont deserve any man bash nimby gross chance she did not realize that nimby was now immobile so she led them back to where nimby lay there he is she said the dragon who made me beautiful and gave me the best adventure of my life now do you believe me a dragon ass the man exclaimed recognizing the piers anthony species immediately because it was so close to his own type we dont want that kind here not in my back yard well destroy it he bashed nimby on the head with his club but it made no difference nimby could not move but neither was he vulnerable to the weak strength of a dissipated mortal man only time would wipe him out or a hot fire its already dead you fool chlorines mother said soon itll begin to stink then well bum it the man decided come on pile up some brush round it he and his wife got to work gathering dry brush chlorine was stunned nimbywhats the matter with you she cried get up get away from here ill go with you maybe we can have another adventure some where else but nimby didnt move he had lost that power so youre slacking off as usual you slut chlorines father said just for that you will have the privilege of doing the final honor he brought out a torch and lit it you will set fire to the pyre let that be a lesson to you he shoved the blazing torch into chlorines somewhat flaccid hand nimby she cried a strange emotion rising in her get up get away dont let them kill you but nimby just lay there unable to respond if only she had been able to fathom the one thing she needed to do it girl or youll get a beating the like of which you wont forget her father said grimly chlorine realized that she had no choice she was back in the real world of xanth no longer in the dreamworld of beauty and princesses and great adventures she was subject to the brutish whims of her family and she herself was rather more like them than she liked for a while she had been nice as well as beautiful but now she was nei ther she wished she could have loved and been loved while she was worthy of it yet somehow she hadnt known how to make it happen why hadnt she thought to ask yon ill wind nimby so she had squandered her chance even for that she was a loser her best bet was to bum up the dragon and be done with illusions of grandeur she lowered the torch but as she gazed directly upon nimbys ugly donkey head a despairing realization came im not beautiful im not nice im no good im poison like my talentbut for a while you made me seem oth erwise i owe you that wonderful dream that never could be i owe the mundane family too because they showed me how good a family could be i think maybe i could learn to love like that given half a chance oh nimby i dont know what happened to you but i fear its my fault maybe i poisoned your water by accident when i reverted to my normal nature its too late now to make amends and id mess it up if i tried but now i know i love you in my worthless way and if i cant gaze on you i dont care if i never see anything again in fact ill join you in this pyre so maybe my thirdrate spirit can be near yours nimby i beg you forgive me for messing you up she touched the torch to the brush and the pyre flamed high heating her face singeing her hair and the two halves of her only remaining tear flowed from her eyes blinding them and merged on her nose and that tear fell authors note i do a lot of writingfar more than ever sees print because im a writaholic i love writing but my work ing schedule suffered a significant disruption i was writing hope of earth which is my third geodyssey historical novel and hoped to complete it in but i had a number of collaborations to dono dont all you readers write in asking to collaborate because i hope to do no more of thoseand those delayed hope then i got to work on it and was about words along when the last collaborative manuscript arrived quest for the fallen star i read it and had mixed emotions it was a major fantasy that would surely put my collaborator on the map when published but it needed the kind of editing and revamping i could do to give it full effectand it was words long on each of the more recent collabo rations my collaborator has written the novel then i have gone over it to fix any problems that might make it un publishable so my part is fairly fast but this one would take me two and a half months to revampas long as it takes me to write a typical xanth novel if i took that much time off how could i finish hope on schedule so i dis cussed it with my researcher alan riggs and he suggested that he try going over it first he could take care of the routine adjustmentsthe kind that can take a lot of time and then i could go over it and polish it to my standard that would reduce my time to about a month with as good a result i liken novel writing to building a highway first you scout the territory plot the route on the map obtain the right to use the land clear the site bulldoze out hills fill in ravines bridge over bogs and rivers level itand then you are ready to start hauling in your supplies and piers anthony actually constructing the road surface my collaborator had done all that but his surface was not quite of drivable level so needed to be regraded and finished alan could do the regrading and then i could come with my finishing tools and complete the job so we consulted with the au thor and he agreed and alan got to work on it but that meant i had lost my researcher and because alan has not had my quarter century experience revising novels it was much slower for him so he was out for most of the rest of the year and hope ground to a halt anyway without him what to do a dim bulb flashed do the next xanth novel i had scheduled it for but my fan suggestion list was already overflowing despite using up about on roc and a hard place some were pretty substantial notions too such as having the demon x assume mortal form and have an adventure in xanth or having a mundane family named baldwin get blown in with a storm ah i see you recognize those notions so i filled in by writing this novel then my father eightyfive fell and fractured his hip there were endless complications as he wended his way through surgery and recovery culminating in a trip to pennsylvania my daughter penny and i made to make sure all was in order with him i believe we did succeed in enhancing his lifestyle in a number of ways as well as renewing family ties so that was time off from this novel but not the main time off that was the process of learn ing a new word processor i had used borlands sprint for six years and liked it well enough but it never had an update and the news was that the company was going to let it fade away it required a special patch to run on a system what about the so it seemed to be time to get with a word processor that would stay with the times the winnowing out has occurred and for my ibm clone system there were now two main choices word perfect or microsoft word of those only the latter would call up multiple files since i normally call up nine working files yon ill wind for text contents characters notes and so on that clarified my decision later i learned that word perfect for win dows now calls up nine filesbut ms word for windows seems to have no limit so i tried word for dos but after a week moved to word for windows because that was about two upgrades more advanced and had a number of features i wanted i am one of those who dont much like windows or the mouse but got around that by getting a trackball and then finding ways to avoid using it win dows and word arid associated programs turned put to be monsters to leam evidently crafted by programmers who had been too long away from the real world i dont just accept the defaults offered i want to make the machine serve me rather than vice versa word did not want to yield mastery but eventually i did get things mostly my way and it is a powerful program even if it hasnt yet caught up to sprint in a number of features so i started this novel on sprint and changed to word for dos early in chapter three and to word for windows by the end of that chapter so if you notice a change in the novel at that point you know whom to blame microsoft and yes of course i wrote microsoft a long letter detailing the ways word was pointlessly userunfriendly such as having an almost invisible vertical line in lieu of a cursor so you have to operate almost blind oh what fun deleting the wrong file because you thought you were here instead of there the company could at one stroke greatly improve its prod uct but i received no response par for the course after all if they wanted it to be userfriendly they would have listened to users long ago but i must say that once that pit bull is muzzled and trained it does have a lot of au thority then microsoft marketed a new ergonomic key board which looks as if it was designed by salvador dali he of the melted watches take a regular keyboard melt it halfway over a flame stretch it so the keyboard separates in the center push it together again so that the center humps without rejoining and put a bar under it that lifts piers anthony it in the front rather than the back so that the keys tilt slightly away from you and you have it the microsoft natural keyboard only a crazy person would try to use that right i bought it and i love it because now my hands can address it halfway naturally easing the pressure on my wrists so that maybe my carpal tunnel syndrome will alleviate i tried it for ten days getting used to it then tried my old keyboard againand in one minute gave up i can no longer stand the type of keyboard i used for ten years i fancy myself as an ornery independent cuss and i dislike big business on principle but microsoft got my number on this one i changed to the new keyboard with my dvorak layout pasted on in chapter nine during chlorines seduction scene right after the window fan and before the ogre eater so again if you notice a change so my life shifted in the course of this novel and not just because i turned sixty thanks so much to all of you readers who wrote to remind me of that milestone in case i should overlook it

turned out that she was almost completely paralyzed that was several years ago and as i write this she is eighteen still mostly paralyzed but doing better she can use a powered wheelchair and can walk a few steps using a walker and can speak some words her computer helps a lot she hopes to take college courses at this time the collection of my first years letters to her titled letters to jenny is being published in paper back jenny elf was a major character in isle of view and has been around as an incidental xanth character since as in this novel readers keep sending me puns characters and sugges tions this year i have written two xanth novels and used about reader notions in the last and close to in this one and there are still half a slew waiting in line with more crowding in the wait
