before when the first message from space arrived on earth five people who were on their way to the eschaton were busy at their own affairs for one dr pat adcock was having a really bad day with her accountant in new york for another commander jimmy pengtsu lin was on the lanai of his mothers estate on maui glumly running up his mothers telephone bill with fruitless begging calls to every influential person he knew major general martin delasquez had just been given his second star by the high governor of the sovereign state of florida doctoratnauk rosaleen artzybachova was discontentedly trying to make the time pass with chessbyfax games against a variety of opponents from her boring retirement dacha outside of kiev and dan dannerman was holed up in a seedy pension in linz province of austria he was hiding from the bundes kriminalamt with a woman named use who was by profession an enforcer for the terrorist free bavaria bund more commonly referred to as the mad king ludwigs most of these five people had not even met each other yet pat adcock being an astronomer by profession might conceivably have had some rough idea of how the message would affect all their livesthough even she couldnt have known just how or how very much none of the others could have had a clue all the same all five of them were in varying degrees startled thrilled or frightened by the message because nearly everybody in the world was what would you expect it was a major historical event it was definitely the very first time that the patient astronomers who tended the seti telescopes or for that matter anybody else had received an authentic guaranteed alien message from an extraterrestrial source of course that left a lot of large questions not even the few dogged hangerson in the nearly extinct seti program had been able to interpret what the message said either except for a few fragments the dits and dahs of the radio signal were not morse code they were certainly not in english eitherwere not in fact in any recognizable language of any variety unless pictures are considered to be a language of sorts when the signals had been painstakingly massaged by some of the worlds biggest and fastest computers which they naturally were very quickly it turned out that at least one chunk of the message wasnt in words at all it was in pictures when the bits were properly arranged what they displayed was an animated diagram in their hideout on the bonnerstrasse dannerman and his girl watched it over and over on their wall screen dannerman with curiosity use with only cursory attention she was one of the very few who didnt give a hoot in hell what the stars had to say even her cursory interest didnt last since whatever this bit of drek from space was meant to convey she declared it certainly had nothing whatever to do with the unswerving determination of the mad king ludwigs to free bavaria from the cruel prussian gripto which liberation at any cost she reminded him they had both agreed to dedicate their lives as a matter of fact the diagram really wasnt much to look at that didnt keep the channels from repeating it endlessly usually with some voiceover commentary provided by somebody who possessed several scientific degrees and a passion for seeing himself on tv the commentaries varied but the diagram was always the same first the screen was dark except for one tiny brilliant spot in the middle of it then an explosion sent a myriad smaller less bright spots flying in all directions the expansion slowed followed by a general contraction as all the specks slowly then more rapidly fell back to the center of the screen then the central bright spot reappeared and then the commentators took over unquestionably there is much more to the message one saidthis one an elderly herr doktor from the astronomy department of the university of vienna but we cannot decipher the remainder as yet that is a great pity since as you see the diagram by itself is quite uninformative in the absence of the rest of the message this segment by itself is no more than perhaps five per cent of the total transmission merely the first few seconds we have not been able to decode the rest still i believe i can interpret what that fragment is intended to show it is nothing less than a description of the history of our universe compressing to a few seconds a process which in fact will require many tens of billions of years the model begins by showing the tiny andi must confess even to those of us who have given our lives to the subjectthe quite incomprehensible quantalrealm object that preceded the birth of the universe then the object explodes in what is called the big bang and the universe as we know it begins it expandsas we actually do see the universe doing now when we measure the redshifts with our telescopes finally it contracts again in what the americans call the big crunch big crunch what nonsense come to bed now use said crossly you have seen all that a hundred times at least walter you dont have to call me by my party name here dannerman said absently watching the screen the herr doktor had begun talking about stephen hawkings theory of repetitive universes just as he had the last three times dannerman had watched that particular interview do not tell me what to do you are a dilettante she said severely or you would not say a thing like that it is basic doctrine which you have not adequately studied there is no security ever unless there is security always i suppose so he said his attention still on the screen he switched channels until he found the diagram on another newscast you are impossible she told him at least turn down that totally useless sound i am going to sleep fine he said but he did as she asked he didnt look away from the wall screen however in spite of the fact that he was beginning to be as tired of the damn thing as she what dannerman wanted was something different he wanted her to go to sleep without him and when at last her gentle ladylike snores assured him that that had happened he moved silently to the door collecting his down jacket on the way and slipped out he wasnt gone long but when he came back use was sitting on the edge of the bed arms crossed wide awake greeting him with a glare she was quite a pretty woman most of the time but in this mood not where were you she demanded he said apologetically i just wanted some fresh air fresh air in linz well a change of scene anyway and all right i stopped in the bierstube for a drink what do you want from me usei mean brunnhilde i get tired of being jailed twentyfour hours a day in this dump dump your words show your class origins walter in any case what i want from you is proper dedication to our cause also if you were seen you would become far more tired because in five minutes they would have you in a real jail hell uh brunnhilde the baykahs arent looking for us in austria are they anyway that was part of the reason i went out i wanted to see if anybody was watching the pension nobody is and how would you know if they were dilettante security is my task not yours walter did you telephone anyone why would i go outside to telephone he asked reasonably it wasnt a lie dan dannerman preferred not to lie when a simple deception would do so she studied him for a moment then all the same she said softening slightly you are not entirely wrong i too would like to leave this place it is in bavaria that we are needed not here well be there soon he said trying to make her feel better the funny part was that he did want her to feel better all right the woman was a criminal terrorist a known killer with blood on her hands but he had to admit to himself that he wasalmostfond of her anyway he had noticed that about himself before he often came to like the people he put in prison though that didnt keep him from putting them there anyway he reached for the control for the wall screen and use moaned oh my god you are not going to turn that on again it is not of any importance to us its just interesting he said apologetically interesting we have no room in our lives for what is only interesting walter walter sometimes i think you are not a true revolutionary at all of course she did not know then just how right she was about that and by the time she found out much had happened for one thing the second message from space had arrived that was the one that showed the furry halloweengrinning scarecrow creature with the twelve sharp talons on each fist crushing the big crunch in his paw and one after another the seven other aliens pictureinpicture like little cameos surrounding a central figure that went with it no one knew quite what to make of it though there were plenty of speculations in their nightclub routines the worlds standup comics had a wonderful time with this brandnew material it was one of them who christened the seven peripheral aliens the seven dwarfs and another who claimed that the whole message was either an alien political broadcast or part of some et childrens horror animation film inadvertently transmitted to all the billions of nonpaying viewers on earth the more easily frightened scientistsplus every buckhustling guru of every bizarre religious cult in the worldthought it was more likely to be some kind of a warning they didnt know just how astonishingly right they were either for all of the persons involved by that time a great deal had changed in their personal lives as well dan dannerman having finished his assignment with the mad king ludwigs was busily infiltrating a dope ring in new york city and use glumly marching around the exercise yard of the maximumsecurity prison at darmstadt was cursing the day shed ever met the man chapter one dan when jim daniel dannerman heard the wheepwawp of the police sirens he was on the way from his family lawyers office to his cousins observatory to beg for a job the sirens gave him a moments confusion so that for the blink of an eye he could not remember which one he was going to see the autocratic career woman who was the head of the dannerman astrophysical observatory or the fiveyearold girl who had peed her pants in the tree house on his uncles estate he was also already en route to the eschaton though to be sure with a weary long way still to go he didnt know that was true yet of course he had never heard of the eschaton then and after the first moment he didnt pay much attention to the sirens either city people didnt cop chases were a normal part of the urban acoustic environment and anyway dannerman was busy accessing information that might come in handy on his new assignment he had been listening to the specs of the starcophagus the abandoned astronomical satellite that had suddenly seemed to become important to the bureau when the shriek of the stopalltraffic alarm drowned everything else out every light turned red and he was thrown forward as the taxi driver slammed on the brakes every other vehicle at that intersection was doing the same thing because the ugly stopall enforcer spikes were already thrusting up out of the roadway in the front of the cab his driver cursed and pounded the wheel goddam cops goddam spikes listen they blow one more set of tires on me and i swear to god im gonna get rid of this crappy little peashooter i been carrying and get me a real gun and then im gonna take that gun and dannerman stopped listening before she got to the ways in which she was going to take the citys police system on singlehanded he was watching the drama being played out at the intersection the car that was being pursued had tried to make it through the intersection in spite of the spikes and naturally every tire had been stabbed flat the three youths inside had spilled out and tried to get away on foot dodging among the jam of stalled vehicles they werent going to make it though police were coming at them on foot from all directions the running cops were weighed down by radio stingstick crowdcontrol teargas gun assault gun and body armor but there were too many of them for the criminals the police had the kids well surrounded dannerman watched the fugitives being captured with mild professional interestafter all he was in the lawenforcement business himself sort of his driver perked up a little looks like they got em listen mister im sorry about the delay but theyll have the spikes down again any minute now dannerman said no problem ive got time before my appointment it didnt placate her sure youve got time but what about me im stuck trying to make a goddam living in this goddam town the thing was she had one of those seven stupid alien figures hanging from her rearview mirror and it was singing out of its picochip the whole time she was talking a shrill obbligato behind her hoarse complaints that wasnt particularly odd there were pictures of the aliens all over the place on the kids being arrested bellydown on the pavement the backs of their jackets displayed little cartoon figures of the alien they called sneezygang colors those were but even his lawyers secretary had had a coffee mug in the shape of another on her desk the taxi drivers singing goodluck piece was the fat one named sleepy for its halfclosed eyeswell there were three of the eyes actually on a head that was maned like a lions it wasnt much like the ancient disney original but then neither were the secretarys doc or the gangbangers sneezy it was an odd thing when you thought about it that the hideous space aliens had become childrens toys and everybodys knickknacks colonel hilda had had an explanation for it it was like the dinosaurs of a generation or two earlier she told him on the phone something so horrible and dangerous that people had to translate it into something cuddly because otherwise it was too frightening then she had gone on to tell him that the space message might or might not be relevant to his new assignment but it wasnt his job to ask questions about it it was his job only to close out his assignment to the carpezzios drug ring and get cracking on the new job it wasnt the first time shed explained all that to him either because that was the way it was in the nbi that of course dannerman didnt need to be told after thirteen years in the national bureau of investigation he knew the drill the funny thing was that dannerman had never set out to be a spook when the college freshman jim daniel dannerman signed up for the police reserve officers training corps he was nineteen years old and the last thing in his mind was the choice of a career what he was after was a couple of easy credit hours while he went about the business of preparing himself for a career in live theater he hadnt read the fine print all the way through his undergraduate program and even in graduate school it had meant nothing but a couple of hours a week in his reserve uniform plus a few weekends by the time he did read itvery carefully this timeit was his last day of graduate school and he had just received his orders to report for active duty by then of course it was a lot too late to change his mind but it hadnt been a bad life when you worked for the bureau you went to interesting places and you got to meet a lot of interesting people the downside was that sometimes you had a pretty good chance of getting killed by some of those interesting people but so far hed been lucky about that the other downside was that when you had to go under cover there was always the problem of remembering all the lies about who you were and where youd been all your life that was one of the things that made the new assignment look pretty good as the colonel had explained the only identity he had to assume was his own indeed the fact that he was a sort of relative of the person under investigation was what made him the best choice for the job dannerman snapped off the portable and leaned back closing his eyes he hardly noticed when the traffic jam began to dissolve because he was working out just what he wanted to say in the interview with his cousin there wasnt much doubt that he would get the job he was going to apply forthe lawyer had all but promised that dannerman was pretty sure the old man meant it if only because he had a little bit of a guilty conscience over dannermans lost inheritance but it would be embarrassing if he was turned down he was surprised when the taxi stopped here you are mister the driver said friendlier now when tipping time was near she pulled the slip with the tenoclock fare update out of the meter and handed it to him peering over his shoulder at the plaque over the building door hey whats this t cuthbert dannerman astrophysical observatory business i thought telescopes were you know like on the top of a mountain someplace dannerman glanced at the midtown skyscraper that housed the observatory and grinned at the woman actually he said as he paid the bill until this morning so did i time was indeed when astronomers shared the night with the bats and the burglars huddling their freezing buns in drafty domes on the tops of snowclad mountains if they wanted to peer far into space they had no choice that was where the telescopes were that was time past in time present the camera had made the allnight vigils unnecessary the spread of electronic communication and control exempted the astronomers from having even to show up anywhere near their telescopesand the best of the worlds telescopes or at least the ones of that kind that were still working werent where they were easy to visit anyway like the starcophagus they were in orbit but wherever the data came from they arrivedprocessed enhanced computerized and digitalized at an observatory comfortably located in some civilized place uncle cubbys final gift to the world of astronomy occupied the top floors of the building but of course there were turnstiles and guards between the street door and the elevators dannerman presented himself at the lobby desk and announced his name that drew interest from the guard you a relative he asked nephew dannerman admitted mr dixler made an appointment for me to see dr adcock yes sir the guard said suddenly deferential ill have to ask you to wait over there until someone can show you to dr adcocks office itll just be a moment it wasnt just a moment though dannerman hadnt expected that it would be the observatorys private elevator doors opened and closed a dozen times before a large sullen man came out and lumbered over to the holding pen he was not deferential at all you the guy from dixler j d dannerman show me some id he didnt offer to shake hands when he had checked the card he passed dannerman through the turnstiles and into an elevator and only then introduced himself im mick jarvas dr adcocks personal assistant give me your gun dannerman took his twentyshot from his shoulder holster and passed it over do i get a receipt the man looked at the weapon with contempt ill remember where i got it dont worry whos this dixler family lawyer huh okay wait here janicell tell you when you can go in that ended the conversation and dannerman was left to sit in the waiting room it didnt bother him it gave him a chance to see what a modern astrophysical observatory was like this one wasnt like the mountaintop domes he remembered from his childhood it was full of people glimpsed down corridors elderly men talking to young darkskinned women in saris groups drinking cokes or herbal tea out of the machines a couple of people sharing the waiting room with him and improving their waiting time by talking business on their pocket phones what interested him most was the big liquidcrystal screen behind the receptionists desk it was showing a great pearly mural that he recognized as a picture of a galaxy some galaxy or other switched to a picture of what he took to be an exploding star switched again to a huge photograph of an orbiting observatory he had no trouble recognizing that it was the one he had been studying on the way over it was also he was aware the gift that had eaten up half of uncle cubbys fortune before he died the observatory was starlabsometime uncharitably called starcophagus for the dead astronomer who was still orbiting inside it starlab was the ancient biggest and bestbut unfortunately no longer operationalastronomical orbiter of them all dan dannermans only previous experience of an astronomical facility had been when he was four years old and his father had taken him to visit uncle cubby in the old optical observatory in arizona starlab was quite different and all the engineering specs hed been able to dig out of the databank didnt make it real for him getting up he strolled over to the reception desk and cleared his throat janice i mean i dont know your last name janice is good enough she said agreeably and youre mr dannerman dan i noticed you were showing the starcophagus on the wall a minute ago she had begun shaking her head is something wrong dr adcock doesnt like us ever to use that word here its the dannerman astrophysical starlab mostly we just call it starlab thanks he said meaning it it was a useful bit of information for someone who was about to ask the boss for a favor it used to be the dannerman orbiting astrolab she went on looking him over but dr adcock changed that because of you know the initials oh right he said nodding doa i see what you mean i guess nobody wants to be reminded about the dead guy up there anyway i was wondering if you could fill me in a little bit i understand uh dr adcocks trying to get a mission flown to reactivate it theres talk she admitted cautiously well whens that going to happen do you know no idea she said cheerfully youd have to ask dr adcock about thatwait a minute she paused squinting as she listened to the voice in her earpiece and paid no further attention to him he went back and sat down evidently he was to be kept waiting for a while as was appropriate for someone who wanted to ask a favor he didnt mind it was what he had expected from a cousinbymarriage he hadnt seen for years and wouldnt be seeing now if the bureau had not taken a sudden and serious interest in just what the woman was up to chapter two pat dr pat adcocks morning was pure hellcrises in the money problem and the starlab problem not to mention all the usual hurry of regular observatory problemsbut she took the long way from the bursars office to rosaleen artzybachovas anyhow i hat way passed by the reception room and that let her get a quick look at her waiting cousin dan she let him wait she was impatient to hear what rosaleen had to tell her about starlabs instrumentation then the bursar had had no good news for her and she needed to do a little thinking about that she needed too to think about whether she wanted to go out of her way at this particularly hectic time to find some kind of spot on the staff for her jobseeking cousin it was not a good time to be adding to the payroll on the other hand on the other hand family was family and pat wasnt displeased to have one of her few remaining relatives ask for a favor especially when the relative was dan dannerman so she rushed through her meeting with rosaleen artzybachova door closed and electronics off the woman might be old but she was still sharp and she was doing a good job of tracing the history of all the additions and retrofits starlab had suffered in its observing career and theres nothing that would account for the radiation pat demanded youre sure the old lady looked up at her thoughtfully are you getting enough exercise she asked you look like you could use some fresh air yes im sure thanks pat said not answering her question but when she got back to her own office the first thing she did even before she closed the door was to study herself in the wall mirror it wasnt really exercise she needed she told herself it was rest a good nights sleep for a start and no worries but what were the chances of that while pats office door was open the walls were displaying a selection of the major current projects of the observatory the lesser magellanic cloud with its new gammaray bursters the huge mass of neutral gas in capricorn that warren krepps was investigating and just for the sake of prettiness some particularly nice shots of nearby objects like saturn phobos and the moon those werent really highpriority projects the dannerman observatory didnt do much planetary astronomy but the pictures were the kind of thing that impressed possible donors when after leading them through the grand tour of the observatory pat took them into her office for the glass of wine and the kill when pat closed her privacy door the display changed then what the walls showed was starlab and on either side of it like a portrait gallery the images of the aliens from the space message pat didnt look at the freaks as she settled herself at her desk she didnt need to but she wanted them there to remind her time for cousin dan she decided not it wouldnt hurt him to sit a while longer and there was still the business of the observatory to run it took more than science to keep an enterprise like the dannerman observatory going after her name patrice dannerman bly metcalf adcock was entitled to put the initials bs ma phd dhl and scd considering that she was still a young woman not very much more than thirty that was quite a lot to be sure the last two degrees were honorary being the kind of thing you got from small and hungry universities when you happened to be the head of an institution that might offer useful fellowships to underemployed faculty members but she had truly earned all the rest the trouble was they werent enough why hadnt someone told her to slip a couple of economics and businessmanagement classes in among the cosmologies and the histories of science her skills at reading a spectrogram were all very well but what she really needed to understand was a spreadsheet and this morning like most mornings the problems were mostly money kit papathanassiou was requesting twenty hours of observing time on the big keck telescopes in hawaii pat knew that papathanassiou would make good use of the time but the kecks were a bigticket item she cut it to five hours gwen morisaki wanted to hire another postdoc to help out with the cepheid census in ngc but that job only amounted to counting after all and why did you need a doctoral degree for that cousin dan probably not pat thought and decided to offer gwen an undergraduate intern from one of the local schools that wouldnt save much money you could hardly hire anybody for less than the average postdoc would gladly accept but a dollar saved plus its costofliving adjustment was a dollar plus cola earned this months communications bills were higher than ever pat reluctantly came to the conclusion that it was time for her to get on everybodys back again about keeping the phone bills down she didnt look forward to it hassling the staff to watch pennies was not what she had earned all those degrees for maybe if things got betterthe way she dreamed they might if the starlab thing worked out but it was all taking so long that was a big disappointment pat had hoped that once the judge decreed that the feds were obliged to honor the contract uncle cubby had made with themhad to provide a clipper spacecraft to take a repair mission to starlab and whats more had to pay for putting the old spacecraft into working order why then the whole thing should have been automatic it wasnt the feds and the floridians were dragging their feet somehow somebody somewhere in their bureaucracies had begun to suspect that she knew something they didnt well she did and it was none of their damn business she leaned back and studied the pictures on the wall not the starlab itself she didnt need to look at that again with rosaleen artzybachovas help she had already memorized every centimeter of that what she was looking at was the freak show from the space messages there were eight of the aliens starting with the universecrushing scarecrow and every one of them was ugly one looked like pats idea of a golem huge bipedal body with some arms like elephant limbs and some like limp spaghetti and the bearded head with its glaring eyes that was the one the comics called doc anotherthe grumpy looked a little like a sea horse with legs a third the dopey had a whiskered kittens head on a chickens body another might have been a hugeeyed lemur if it werent for its own extra pairs of limbs and she couldnt recall what nonsensical name it had been given pat closed her eyes and sighed she wished as half the world wished that she knew why the unidentified transmitter of these unpleasing pictures had wanted humans to see them what were these creatures not a zoo these were not animals most of them wore clothing some carried artifacts of one kind or anothersome that looked unpleasantly like weapons of course the fact that they had weapons didnt mean they were killers everybody carried weapons pat kept one on her person whenever she left her office or her homenot counting whatever additional firepower her bodyguard carriedand she certainly wasnt intending to shoot anybody unless of course she absolutely had to which raised the question of under what circumstances the freaks might think they absolutely had to but she didnt want to think about that pat adcock had considered the possibility that some of those alien creatures might be hanging around somewhere in earth orbit where the mission to starlab might encounter them and decided that the odds were strongly against there wasnt any reason to reconsider that question nowmost likely she opened her eyes and looked at her watch actually she had kept cousin dan waiting long enough she pushed the button that transformed her desk screen to a mirror checked her hair and her faceyes still not bad in spite of what rosaleen had saidthen sighed pushed the control that unlocked her door and restored her wall display to the one she was willing to let the world see and called the receptionist my cousin still out there janice all right then send him on in chapter three dan when dannerman entered his cousins office they didnt kiss nor did they shake hands and she didnt even look up at him her attention was on her desk screen displaying the resume he had given mr dixler to send over says here youve got a phdbut its in english literature for christs sake what the hell does dixler think were going to do with an english major here do you know anything at all about astronomy not a thing he said cheerfully studying her blue eyes rusty brown hair yes that was the cousin he remembered though now physically well matured she was wearing a white lab coat but it hung open under it was a onepiece skorts outfit thermally dilated to adjust to room temperatures she kept her office warm so a lot of pat adcock showed through the mesh at thirtysomething she was almost as goodlooking as pretty little patty d bly had been when they were children two marriages and a career had just made her taller and even more sure of herself i just happen to need a job pretty badly he added she finally looked up to regard him thoughtfully then smiled anyway hello its been a long time dandan its just dan now that ive grown up cousin pat and its just doctor adcock if youre going to work here she reminded him a touch of steel peeking through the velvet i dont know about hiring you though dan it says here you got your doctorate at harvard and your dissertation was called between two worlds freud and marx in the plays of elmer rice who the hell was he earlytwentiethcentury american playwright very seminal for broadway theater some people called him the american pirandello huh she studied his face are you still stagestruck not really oh theres a little theater group in brooklyn i help out now and then christ it wouldnt interfere with my work he promised she gave him an unconvinced look but changed the subject so dixler wants me to give you a job here i was surprised when he called i thought you werent speaking to him dannerman shifted uncomfortably you mean about uncle c cubbys estate well i wasnt but i thought the least he could do was put in a word for me with you she was gazing at the screen again what happened to the job you had with it says here victor carpezzio and sons importers of foods and fragrances personal problems i didnt get along with the carpezzios and youve had she paused to count up jesus dan youve had four other jobs in the past few years are you going to quit here too because you dont like somebody he didnt answer that and youve been dicking around with little theater groups all over the place not just in brooklyn i thought you were the kind of guy who went for the macho kind of thing theres enough macho in the world already pat hum she said again then all right our mutual uncle gave a lot of money to found this observatory thats a fact but it doesnt mean we have to support the whole damn family of course not if we decided to take a chance and we did give you a job for uncle cubbys sake dont expect it would be anything big youd be getting minimum wage daily cola no fringe benefits this is a scientific establishment were all highly trained people you just dont have the skills for anything better than scutwork i understand dr adcock that made her laugh oh hell dan i guess pats good enough considering weve known each other since we were in diapers you dont bear any grudges do you about the money i mean he shook his head i mean you got as much as i did under uncle cubbys will not exactly well you would have if youd been around when the will was probated then the whole thing wouldntve been eaten up by inflation by the time you collected it and you wouldnt be looking for a scutwork job now would you what were you doing in europe anyway i guess youd call it postdoctoral research he said coming reasonably close to an honest answer the statement was technically true at least he really had had his doctorate by then and what he had been doing in europe surely was research of a kind and maybe there was a girl you could say a woman was involved he admitted again skirting the truthuse was indeed female and so was the colonel i guess i made a mistake not keeping in touch i guess you did all right i dont see why we shouldnt do old dixler a favorand you too of course well find you something to do go down to security and get your badge and passes from mick jarvas you can start tomorrowbut remember you get no medical benefits no tenure youll be a temp hired on a weektoweek basis and how long you stay depends on you or actually it will depend on me because im the director here is that going to give you a problem no problem it better not be a problem i dont mix family loyalty and science weve got a lot to do here right now trying to get starlab back on line and all i dont want you thinking that the fact that we played together when we were babies is going to get you any special privileges dannerman grinned thinking about the kinds of games theyd played youre the boss pat he said but of course shed been the boss then too is soon as he was out of the building he paused before the window of a betting parlor to lift his commset to his lips and make his call he didnt give a name he didnt have to all he said was mission accomplished i got the job thats nice the voice on the other end said chattily congratulations youve still got one thing to do with the other guys though i know ill phone it in when i get home make sure you do danno talk to you later on the subway ride home dannerman pretended to watch the news on his communicatorthe hot new story was that the presidents press secretary had been kidnappedbut he wasnt paying it much attention he was content with the days work to be sure he didnt know exactly why he was going to work for his cousin but he was reasonably sure he would be told in time what he had to take care of with the carpezzios wouldnt take long and of course the eschaton that ultimate transcendence had never yet even crossed his mind chapter four dan the process of getting photographed and fingerprinted for the job had made dannerman late leaving the observatory it got even later he got caught in the rush hour and the subways were running even slower than usual because of a bomb scare at the seventysecond street station that meant the trains werent allowed to stop there until the security police finished checking out whatever suspicious object was worrying them so dan dannerman had to travel an extra stop north and make his way back on foot through the jammed sidewalk vendors along broadway the peddlers did their best to slow him downhey mon here we have got tomorrows top collectibles get them today while the price is rightbut dannerman was interested only in food just then by the time hed picked up some groceries for his dinner and got home all the other tenants had finished their meals he had the condos kitchen to himself he dumped his purchases on the kitchen table and began to cut up the vegetables for his stirfry while he was waiting for the rice to steam he tried to get some news on his landladys old screen all the stories looked very familiar the only additions to the ones hed heard on the subway were that a new serial killer seemed to be at large in the city two senators were under indictment for embezzlement the heavyweight boxing champion of the world had announced his plans to enter the priesthood the president had received a ransom demand for his kidnapped press secretary and the time for the freefire zone that the lawn order enforcers had announced for the wall street area had just expired with only seven persons wounded nothing very interesting nothing about the possible bomb in the subway even on the local menu but then the services hardly bothered reporting that sort of thing anymore stirring up the fry didnt take more than five minutes but rita gammidge must have smelled it cooking from her room evening danny she said appearing at the door as dannerman was ladling it into his plate um do i smell chorro sausages in there rita gammidge was his landlady tiny old whitehaired quick and inquisitive she owned the duplex condo where dan rented his roomwell his half a room if you went by the original layout the condo was a valuable piece of property originally eight big rooms and three baths but dannerman knew that the condo was also about the only thing rita had saved out of what must once have been a considerable fortune before she and a lot of others were wiped out in the big devaluation dannerman did what was expected of him join me he invited theres plenty for two she hesitated if youre sure im sure there was there always was the rents rita collected were barely enough to keep her ahead of the taxes and the maintenance charges and so he made a point of cooking enough for both of them he knew that the other thing she wanted from him was his days rent so they settled that before they began to eat the good news she said ringing up her deposit is todays inflation adjustment was only two per cent he nodded and remembered to tell her theres other good news ive got a new job well wonderful calls for a drinklet me supply the beer she had unlocked the fridge and brought out a bottle from her private stockone halfliter bottle for the two of them to sharebefore she thought to ask what was wrong with the job in importexport no future he said as was usual with most of the things he told people about himself the statement was true enough whatever future there had been with the importers had vanished when the colonel ordered him to drop it and try to hook on with his cousin the place im working for now is an astronomical observatory oh boy what do you think theres money in looking for martians there arent any martians rita and anyway that isnt what we do he explained to her from his small and very recently acquired store of astronomical knowledge that the dannerman observatory spent its time analyzing data about distant gas clouds and quasars trying to puzzle out the origins of the universe then he had to explain why the observatory was called dannerman rita approved of that its good to have family these days she said chewing wistfully youre close you and your cousin not really shes not a blood relative she was uncle cubbys wifes sisters daughter and i was his younger brothers son even so she said vaguely and then commented you could have put a little more sausage in the fry nobodys making you eat it she didnt take offense she didnt even seem to notice what hed said she went on dreamily we used to eat really well while jonathan was alivetruffles guinea hen steaks you could cut with a fork oh and roast beef and rack of lamb and three or four different wines at almost every meal dan do you know we used to have as many as twentyfour at dinner some nights wed eat in the main dining hallthats where the rosenkrantzes and the blairs live nowand we had the butler and the maids to hand everything around if anybody wanted seconds why they could have as much as they wanted there was plenty and we didnt even mind when the servants took the leftovers home and then if the weather was nice wed go out on the terrace for coffee and brandy afterward i dont have any coffee dannerman said to keep her from getting her hopes up neither do i she said swallowing the last of her beer thanks for dinner ill clean upand dan its nice about your cousin but this citys no place for a young man like you you ought to get out of it while you can and go where he asked she didnt have any answer for that she didnt even try before dannerman unlocked the door to his own room he checked the telltales they were clear no one had entered while he was out his stock of collectibles was still intact and so were the more important items concealed among them he locked the door behind him and began his evening chores after rita finished partitioning the condo for lodgers her original eight rooms had become fourteen dan dannerman had a windowless chamber that had once been a kind of dressing room to the condos master bedroom now occupied by the halverson family of four his part got the huge marble fireplace but it was the halversons who got the direct entrance to the bath when dan wanted to use it he had to go down the hall all in all dannerman would gladly have traded with the halversons he couldnt use the fireplace because of pollution regulations so it was just an annoyance that took up wall space he could have used for his personal stock of inflation hedges those were the goods that people with jobs bought from the pitiful sidewalk vendors the fixedincome people or the noincome people who were reduced to selling off their possessions to stay alive it didnt matter what you bought with daily inflation running at two or three per cent sometimes more anything you bought was bound to be worth more than you paid for it if you just held it for a while it was part of dannermans cover to be just like everybody else who had a little spare cash but not enough to put it into the good inflation hedges like option futures he spent his surplus on collectibles as fast as he could in dannermans personal store he had glass paperweights small items of furnitureall he had room for in the tiny chambera barbie doll from the issue in nearly mint condition old flatscreen computers bits of costume jewelry cds optical disks and even magnetic tapes of music of all kinds of course the stock in his room didnt represent all of his real capital but since he couldnt admit what his real capital was he couldnt draw on it the bureau would hand it over to him fully inflated with whatever the thencurrent costofliving adjustment might be when he retired meanwhile in times of unemployment dannerman too had had to protect his cover by setting up a booth along broadway and selling ofif goods he checked his watch and noted that it was time to take care of his last bit of business with the carpezzios he dialed the number let it ring once dialed again for two rings then dialed again and waited for an answer nobodys here but me said the voice of their main shooter and watchman gene martin shit dannerman said he wasnt particularly disappointed and not at all surprisedhe had timed it for when none of the bosses would be inbut that was just the way you started most sentences around carpezzio sons flavors and fragrances so take a message i cant come in i have to go to the dentist but tell wally hell have to do the meet tonight himself hell be pissed sighed martin you got a toothache no i just like to go to the dentist see you later and he would see him later dannerman thought but not until it was time to testify at their arraignment and they wouldnt be very sociable then that taken care of he had chores to do from behind a printbook set of lee s lieutenantsnot a very good investment really but one of these days he intended actually to read the bookshe pulled out his rods and cloths turned on his room screen and switched his pocket phone over to the screen to check the days messages while he cleaned his guns the messages were almost all junk of course that was what he expected his pocket phone was set to record everything that came in as voicemail except for the ones from hilda he reminded himself to add calls from the observatory to the priority list now that he had a job and set himself to review the days garbage accumulation people wanted to cast his horoscope or sell him weapons a mensclothing store was inviting him to a private advance sale of the seasons newest sportswear and impactresistant undergarments a realestate office had forcedsale condos in uptown to offer a couple of news services urged him to subscribe a finance company offered to lend him money at just one per cent over the cola in short the usual there were just two real calls one was from the theater group in brooklyn and although the caller didnt give a name he recognized the voice anita berman the other was from the lawyer mr dixler both wanted him to return their calls but he thought for a moment and decided against it dixler could wait and anita berman well anita was a separate problem and dannerman wasnt quite ready to deal with it thoughtfully he left the phone live while he began cleaning his twentyshot considering the case of anita berman she was a sweet lady there was no doubt of that she liked him very well and that was for sure too but hilda thought she was a security risk and now with the new job hilda was bound to think anita was excess baggage that was going to be a pain he thought and then remembered that he still had homework to do he put the cleaning materials back coded the room screen for library access and automatically wiping the sales messages as they came in in their little window at the corner of the screen cued in the search he had begun in the taxi for data on astronomy orbital instruments it took him only a moment to access once more the entries for the dannerman observatorys wholly owned satellite starlab there was a lot about starlab that dannerman had no need to retrieve from the databanks because he clearly remembered when it had been launched he had been only nine at the time but his mother had taken him to uncle cubbys grand compound on the jersey shore for the launch party the whole family was there to watch the launch on television cousin pat and her parents included as well as a dozen famous astronomers and politicians but while the astronomers and the politicians were thoroughly enjoying the party dannermans mother had been a lot less thrilled it was uncle cubbys fortune that paid for the satellite as it was also uncle cubbys fortune that endowed the dannerman astrophysical observatory a little later and while starlab and the observatory were undoubtedly great contributions to astronomical science what they represented to uncle cubbys heirs was a considerable depletion of the remaining fortunes they might someday expect to inherit still there was no doubt that starlab had done great things for astronomy in its time when it was built there was still money around to spend on pure science it was designed to house a few actual living astronomers for weeks at a time as they took their spectra and their shift measurements that part had been abandoned early when it became too expensive to ship human beings up to orbit the last of the visiting astronomers had died up there and was still there no one had been willing to spend the money to reclaim his body but starlabs instruments had gone on working for more than twenty years until three years earlier they stopped just stopped the transmissions ceased in the middle of a cepheid count and the satellite did not respond to commands from its surface controllers dannerman put the screen on hold and got up to get a beer of his own from his private cooler it all seemed pretty straightforward satellites went out of commission every day and the money to fix them got scarcer why was this one particularly interesting he meditated over that for a moment sipping the beer and wiping the new messages as they arriveduntil one came in voice only but definitely the voice of a female that said flirtatiously hey danno i hear you got a new job give me a call and lets see if we want to celebrate there wasnt any name on that one either but there didnt need to be no one called him by the code name danno but colonel hilda morrisey a call from the colonel was not one he could answer on the open lines dannerman pulled down an old flatscreen converter from its place on his shelf and jacked it into his modem then he dialed the number he knew by heart his screen instantly showed a bewildering fractal pattern of wedges and wriggling lines until he cut in the digitprime synchronizedchaos decoder then colonel hilda morrisey was looking out at him plump dark brighteyedjust like always evening colonel honey he said she didnt acknowledge the greeting she didnt waste time on congratulating him on getting the job either all right she said cut the crap have you done your homework i sure have colonel honey all you gave me anyway starlab went out a few years ago so the observatory applied for a repair mission to fix it naturally nothing happened the red tape dont tell me about the red tape anyway the application wasnt moving theres no public support for space missions lets see i think the latest polls show about seventyfour percent opposed to spending another dollar on it anywhere how much of that is bureau dirty tricks do you suppose never mind anyway now all of a sudden my cousin pat got hot she took the government to court and she won but it still dont move so now shes doing a lot of wheeling and dealing on her own and spending serious money right okay look i had hoped to have background checks for you on the people youll be working with but right now with this presidents press secretary thing its hard to get any action out of washington so far it looks like two of them are dirtynot counting your cousin ones a bruiser named mick jarvas ive met the man hes a doper that might be useful he used to be a professional kickboxer now hes your cousins bodyguard he stays with her wherever she goes so he knows what she does outside the office the other ones a chink named jimmy pengtsu lin hes an astronaut or was until the peoples republic privatized its space program and he went freelance he got in some political trouble in the peoples republic too but i dont know exactly what yet thats all ive got so far any questions matter of fact i do have one hilda mind if i ask how the carpezzio case is going youre not on the carpezzio case anymore dannerman thats just a routine drug bust and well handle that you shouldnt do it yet he said as hed said beforeknowing that it was useless if youd just wait two weeks till the major guys from winnipeg and saginaw get in cant do it youre needed on this one but youll just be getting lowlevel dummies danno she sighed are you empathizing again you damn near blew the mad king ludwig operation because you didnt want to get your girlfriend use in trouble she wasnt my girlfriend he protested exactly i just thought she was basically a decent human being and for that matter the carpezzios werent that awful either sure they sold drugs but they were loyal to their people and he was going to miss some of those allnight parties in the loft with its constant aroma of room freshener and oregano that they hoped would keep any stray police dog from detecting the more interesting scents from their merchandise your kind heart does you credit but forget it what youre on now is a numberone priority from the director himself dont screw around with anything else you hear check it out see what you can get and i want you to report in every night about this time youre not making it easy for me do you want to tell me what im looking for exactly xt no come on colonel how the hell can i do my job she hesitated you might see if you can find out anything about gammaray emissions from the starlab she said reluctantly gamma rays thats what i said dont use that term unless someone else uses it first aw colonel you dont give me much to go on i give you all i can tell you what ill see if they want to give me permission to tell you more now get some sleep you want to be fresh and pretty for your cousin tomorrowand that reminds me have you ditched that actress from brooklyn yet well do it your cousin likes men and we want you concentrating on making her like you chapter five dan with starlab out of action the dannerman astrophysical observatory didnt have a telescope of its own anymore what it had was people a lot of people more than a hundred fulltime scientific and clerical people worked there with another twenty or thirty visiting astronomers postdocs and slavelabor graduate students on and off the premises that was good for dannermans purposes tradecraft said that the first thing you did in a new assignment was to let yourself be seen by as many people as possible so that they would get used to you think of you as part of the furniture and accordingly pay no attention to you on his first day in the new job he covered all the floors the observatory occupied and was pleased to be generally ignored most of the staff had no time to chat with a new lowranking employee at least until they discovered he happened to be a dannerman then they became more cordial but were still busy if the observatory didnt have any instruments of its own it did have sharedtime arrangements with groundbased and radio telescopes in new mexico and hawaii and the canary islands not to mention neutrino instruments in canada and italy and even odder observatories everywhere in the world the scientists made their observations and then they and all the other specialists at dannerman massaged enhanced and interpreted the data and added it to the general store of human knowledge of course dan dannerman wasnt qualified for any of that if you didnt count janice dupage the receptionist who doubled as payroll manager or old walt lowenfeld who ran the stockroom dannerman was pretty nearly the least professionally qualified human being on the payroll of the observatory he hadnt been granted the dignity of a title but if he had it would have been office boy exploring the observatory was made easy for him because his work took him everywhere it included carrying things from the stockroom to the people who needed them making coffee killing for janice dupage a wasp that had somehow made it into the reception room fetching doughnuts from the shop in the lobby for harry chesweiler the senior planetary astronomer on the staff taking messages in fractured english from the greek friends of christo papathanassiou the quantum cosmologist from the island of cyprus getting cousin pats jewelry out of the safe for her when she was going out socially bringing tea with a measured twenty cc of cloverblossom honey no more and no less for old rosaleen artzybachova well past ninety and still spry but crotchety as she pored over her instrument schematics what he did in short was whatever they told him to do they could be anybody because he took orders from any of the fifteen or twenty principal astronomers and physicists and computer nerds and mathematicians who made up the major science staff of the observatory and from any of their assistants as well but he especially took orders from cousin pat adcock because she was the one who ran it all cousin pat wasnt a bad boss as bosses went she wasnt really a good boss either though she seemed to have little patience and no interest in whether any of her employees might have lives of their own she snapped her orders outnot only to her lowmanonthetotempole cousin but even to people like pete schneyman the mathematicianastrophysicist who it was said was high on the list for some future nobel laurel and to old honored rosaleen artzybachova maybe part of the reason for the impatience dannerman thought was that everybody knew that the only reason cousin pat was the director was uncle cubbys money but she seemed tense and preoccupied most of the time janice dupage whispered that pat hadnt always been like that and probably one reason was that having gone through two husbands she didnt currently have even a steady boyfriend maybe so dannerman told the receptionist but she was a bossy little kid too he didnt believe that was the explanation anyway there had to be something else something most probably to do with the starlab or else what was he doing there what he was doing there of course was following colonel hilda morriseys orders as ordered he kept his eyes and ears open and if he didnt find much that interested her in his nightly reports it wasnt for lack of trying it wasnt because the people he worked with werent willing to talk either they were a sociable lotparticularly with somebody who however lowly his present status was a definite relative of their great benefactor but all they want to talk about is their jobs colonel he complained to her on the coded line dr schneyman kept me after work for an hour talking about stuff like something he called isospin and how protonrich nuclei were created in novae and neutron stars screw that stuff danno thats not what youre there for what about the gammaray item nobody brought it up so i didnt either you told me i know what i told you have you at least made contact with mick jarvas and the chink astronaut i havent seen commander lin yet at all hes been out of the office they say hes in houston doing something about getting ready for the repair flight ive got one other name for you christo papapapathana the greek fellow right from cyprus well theres a file on him only i havent accessed it yet its been crazy here she hesitated then said the thing is they found the presidents press secretary only he was dead dannerman was scandalized dead gripes hilda that was supposed to be a strictly commercial snatch so something went sour the word isnt out yet the presidents going to announce it at a news conference in the morning meanwhile everythings pretty screwed up so itll be a while before i can get more and keep after jarvas he isnt exactly a sociable type make him sociable danno didnt i tell you this assignment is priority do i have to teach you all over again how to do your job and look see if you can get into some of the technical part of the work there youre not going to find much out while youre running the coffee machine dannerman followed orders as best he could he didnt achieve much with cousin pats bodyguard though he tried getting jarvas to go with him for lunch or a beer he got a frosty turndown jarvas didnt socialize outside the office at lunchtime he went out only with dr pat adcock and on the rare occasions when she lunched on sandwiches in her office he preferred to go out and eat alone dannerman did better with the other instruction it occurred to him that the databanks for astrophysics were reached in just about the same ways as the ones for critical studies on american playwrights when he pointed out to pat adcock that he could be more use in research than fixing squeaky drawers she reluctantly agreed to allow him to do an occasional literature search that was useful it gave him a good reason to talk shop with his coworkers and when harry chesweiler found out he spoke good german and at least halting french the planetary astronomer was delighted hell boy he boomed his mouth full of a bagel you can do something for me right now pats been after me to check out some little clo shes interested in a what a clo a cometlike object i dont know why shes getting interested in it nowit came through a couple years ago hut it does have some unusual characteristics she wants to know its orbital elements for some reason and ive got all this ganymede stuff to work up we dont have any data for the sectors and times shes interested in so youll need to check some of the other observatories use my screen if you want to id like to get out early for lunch anyway the good part of checking up on the clo was that it was more interesting than making coffee and it didnt really require any knowledge of astronomy with the information chesweiler left for him dan dannerman began calling up other observatories to beg for copies of any plates they might have the main sources chesweiler had explained were out of the country the german maxplanck institut fur extraterristrische physik which had both an optical and a gammaray observatory still more or less functioning in orbitgamma raysand cerro toledo in south america which had one that observed in the extreme ultraviolet the woman at cerro toledo refused his attempts at frenchhe knew no more of her own language than the taxidriver spanish any american neededbut had good enough english to make clear that while she was perfectly willing to transmit the plates he asked for she wanted to be paid dannerman took a chance and agreed to the price she asked the man at maxplanck was a cheerful youngster named gerd hausewitz he was considerably more cooperative especially because dannermans german was what hed acquired in his four years in the democratische neuereich hausewitz was about to go home for the day he mentionedit was nearly six oclock in europebut he promised to get the plates and dannerman feeling cheerful went back to replacing the wilting flowers on the desk of janice dupage talking german again had reminded him of the good times in europeof the parts of those times that were good anyway the cakes with mountains of schlag on the ring boulevards of vienna the beer in frankfurt the girl named use who had invited him into her bed and then into the secret society called the mad king ludwig it was the mads he had been working on but use was a definitely valuable fringe benefit undoubtedly she was a terrorist and almost certainly she had been involved in the group that had tried to spread cholera in the drinking water of the un in new york but she was also about the most beautiful woman hed ever shared a mattress with dannerman took a short lunch hour and when he came back it was janice dupage the receptionist who checked his carry gun for him how come he asked checking weapons is my job when micks out body guarding pat adcock huh what does she need a bodyguard for anyway janice looked at him unbelievingly daniel what galaxy do you come from pats a goodlooking woman she needs some kind of muscle to protect her from rapists and kidnappers and general scumnot counting sometimes she likes to wear some pretty highpriced rocks when she goes out why do you carry a gun he shrugged everybody does and everybody knows why he persisted so why does she hire a retired kickboxer who never won fight that wasnt fixed ask him yourself and some krauts been calling you its in your voicemail gerd hausewitz was as good as his word but before he transmitted the plates he wanted to talk to dannerman again anything wrong dannerman asked i lie broad face on the screen looked troubled just that its a hinny thing dr dannerman you said you were looking for a cometlike object both in euv and our gammas but comets do not radiate in such frequencies i guess thats what makes it only cometlike dannerman said equably to be sure yes but my superiors were interested that you should ask and interested also in your starlab satellite we understand there is to be a flight to repair it is that correct dannermans expression didnt change but he was suddenly more interested yes that would be splendid naturally it is a fine instrument however we have found nothing in the literature to describe the plans for repair could you perhaps send us a copy of the mission plan if it is not too much trouble ill have to ask the boss of course but please do we would greatly appreciate is there anything else i can do for you dannerman hesitated then took the plunge your gammaray observer yes i was just wondering have there been any unusual gamma observations lately in the last couple of years that is the german looked puzzled unusual there are of course the bursters but those occur all the time nothing unusual however why do you ask dannerman backtracked swiftly it was just something someone said its not important anyway thanks for the plates after dannerman passed the plates on to harry chesweiler the germans question stuck in his mind he wished he knew a little more about astronomy did this clo have anything to do with starlab did the fact that it wasnt a normal comet mean anything why was the man from maxplanck asking about the satellite in the first place colonel hilda would want the answer to that too so dannerman got into conversations on the subject as much as he could manage he didnt get much no one seemed to have access to the starlab flight plan dr adcock was handling that directly with commander jimmy pengtsu lin no one really knew just what had happened to starlab not even dr artzybachova though she gave him a frosty look when he asked at the end of working hours when all the employees were lining up at janice dupages desk to collect their days pay before inflation knocked another two or three per cent off it he dawdled to ask more questions with little more success it wasnt that the people in line with him were unwilling to talk but what they wanted to talk about was their own special programsblack holes galaxy counts redgiant stars redshift measurements when dannerman got the conversation onto the prospective repair mission for starlab they were happy to discuss that too or at least to discuss what a newly functioning starlab would mean to their hunt for organic molecules in interstellar gas clouds or for the missing mass that seemed to concern some of them whatever that was by the time the line carried dannerman to janice dupages desk he decided he didnt even know what questions to ask until he got more information from colonel hilda then as he was handing his cash card over to janice dupage for his pay she said oh there you are dan dr adcock wants to talk to you before you leave and when he got to his cousins office she glared at him whats this im hearing about you why are you asking for the starlab flight plan he wasnt surprised that she asked the question he had no doubt that pat adcock kept an ear to everything that went on in the observatory i wasnt asking for myself pat i got some data for dr chesweiler from the maxplanck people and they were the ones who wanted to know i thought it would be you know professional courtesy to give it to them professional courtesy isnt your department you arent a professional here and its none of their damn business you dont pass out any information to anyone outside the observatory without my personal approval ever do you understand that and another thing janice tells me that youve made a payment commitment to cerro toledo for their data well have to pay it but you ought to know you dont have any authority to do that either dan this just isnt satisfactory i dont want to have to warn you again but hold it a minute her screen was buzzing dannerman couldnt see the face on it but he recognized harry chesweilers voice it sounded excited ive got your orbital elements for the clo and theyre damn funny theres definite deceleration and wait harry she ordered turning back to her cousin thats all dan you can go just be more careful in die future he shared the elevator going down with two of the scientists arguing over what the search for wimps really signified they seemed close to coming to blows so he interrupted whats a wimp they paused to stare at him weakly interactive massive particle the postdoc whod been talking to him about the missing mass said oh thanks and say long as ive got you theres something else ive been wondering about if theres a comet that radiates in gamma and euv and it is slowing down as it comes toward the sun what does that mean the other man laughed means it isnt a comet thats all maybe its one of your fucking wimps will jesus the postdoc said what are you telling him that for you know it couldnt be a wimp maybe some old spacecraft you know of any old spacecraft that would be coming in toward the sun will so its probably just a screwedup observation anyway the man said getting back to his own subject believe me wimps are definitely out there and they make the difference theyre why the universe isnt going to expand indefinitely dannerman gave up he was glad enough when they came to the ground floor and he could get out this debate about whether the universe would continually expand or rebound to a point again was sort of interesting but not as far as he could see in any way relevant to any of the questions he was working on and as far as he could know it wasnt of course because of course at that point dan dannerman had still never heard of the eschaton that night there was a call waiting from the lawyer dixler begging him to have lunch with him the next day that was a puzzle dannerman could think of no reason the lawyer would want to talk to him and even fewer reasons why he would want to spend an hour with the man but when he had reported in to colonel hilda she said do it see what he wants it sounds like a waste of time to me so were the ones whore paying for your time if we want you to waste it then you do it maybe he knows what your cousin is spending her money on whats that about her money shes liquidating assets and it isnt just to pay off her lawyers id like to know why something else danno you didnt mention the query from maxplanck about starlab in your report he stared at her oh christ youve put a tap on the observatory lines no tap is allowed without a court order you know that and we cant apply for one without taking the chance that shell find out about it the colonel lectured him of course we put a tap on their lines i dont like this questioning by the krauts though what do you suppose their interest is you could ask the baykahs he suggested no i couldnt even if everybody wasnt going ape about the press secretary but i did get some data for you like on that old lady rosaleenuh artzybachova sure i think you ought to cultivate her shes an instrument specialist it says in her file that she helped design the original starlab project is starlab what shes working on there now i dont know what shes working on she always blanks her screen before she lets me bring her tea in you need to get into their system danno your cousins keeping secrets and thats where shes keeping them i bet are you telling me you cant break her code its a closed circuit get in and listen danno ive been checking your file and you havent been on the range for nearly two weeks ill fit it in damn right youll fit it in you want to keep your skills up martial arts too dan because you know what occurs to me it occurs to me youd make a pretty good bodyguard for your cousin he protested mick jarvas already has that job maybe something can be arranged ill work on it any questions outside of the usual one you mean the usual one that asks you what this is all about she sighed yes thats the usual one all right and the usual answer is still no that was it she wasnt going to tell until somebody higher up authorized it that didnt surprise dannerman but what did surprise him was that when he finally did get a clue it came from that old fart of a family lawyer jerome dixler the place the lawyer had chosen for lunch was a small private club way downtown on gramercy park the place appeared to have a theatrical history when dannerman checked his twentyshot and carryphone at the cloakroomthe gun was no surprise but he was a little astonished that the club did not allow phones to ring in their dining roomhe was informed that mr dixler hadnt arrived yet he spent ten minutes in the lounge studying fulllength oil paintings of famous members all actors of a century or more ago whose names were familiar to him only from longago courses at harvard when the lawyer showed up he was out of breath real apologies dan he panted the traffic gets worse every day and that driver of mine well i did make it here lets get to our table and order something to drink dannerman was mildly flattered more intrigued by the fact that dixler had put himself out to try to be on time still he didnt get to business right away whatever his business was going to turn out to be while the waiter was bringing cocktails the lawyer went over every item on the menu discussing the provenance of the basic foods that went into it and the way the clubs chef prepared it dannerman knew he was meant to feel courted clearly dixler had taken him to a pretty expensive place although dannermans own menu was bereft of prices for anything he wondered just what it was that the lawyer wanted from him that justified this kind of entertainment dixler was in no hurry to get to it as soon as the orders had been placed he said brightly well then dan howre you getting along with dear little pat well enough i dont see much of her in the office dixler clucked thats a pity you know cuthbert always hoped you two kids would get together someday him too i beg your pardon nothing someone else said the same thing just the other night but i dont think its going to happen for one thing pat never got in touch with me after uncle cubby died dixler gave him a wounded look you never called me either dan i hope youre not holding a grudge about that problem with your inheritance there wasnt any problem there just wasnt any inheritance by the time it got to me you explained it all when i got back from europe as executor you liquidated the estate had to dan its the law im sorry it worked out the way it did but i put the whole bequest into government bonds the way i was supposed to its not my fault inflation was so bad there wasnt much there when you got home if youd kept in touch while you were in europe yes everybodys in agreement about me arent they pat told me i should have kept in touch too well im not blaming anybody dannerman wasnt either not really there wasnt any point since there wasnt anything that could be done about it now he changed the subject anyway it didnt work all that well for pat either did it i hear shes having her own money troubles dixler looked startled howd you hear that dannerman shrugged well i suppose offices gossip its true enough i dont think im violating lawyerclient confidentiality if i say that divorcing two husbands cost her a lot ah dannerman said nodding i guess you handled the divorces for her the lawyer winced really dan thats unkind i did the best i could for her no attorney can do more than his client lets him and shewell she didnt provide me with the best cases you know thats about all i can say with propriety wouldnt say that much you know if you werent family he worked on his salad in silence for a moment then came to the point let me take you into my confidence dan i guess you wondered why i asked you to come down here i suppose its because the club is sort of historic and the foods good dannerman offered politely historic sure they say john wilkes booth used to eat in this very room if you like history i dont and theres good food in plenty of places that are a lot more convenient theres only one reason i keep my membership in this place and thats because nobody i know ever comes here its private what i wanted to talk to you about is confidential and in a way it does have to do with pats financial situation you see he hesitated then put his fork down and got it out there are some funny rumors going around about what your cousins up to i mean this repair mission on that starlab orbiter its not just that the observatory wants its telescopes working again people seem to think theres more to it in fact some people say theres some kind of technology in starlab that isnt supposed to be there the kind that might be worth a lot of money to whoever got his hands on it dannerman kept his expression blank but his level of interest suddenly elevated how can that be starlabs just an old astronomical satellite the lawyer shrugged whether the rumor is true or not it appears that your cousin thinks it is shes spending pretty heavily out of whats left of her personal fortune to get what she calls the repair mission going that was a good deal more puzzling than enlightening why does she have to spend her own money you read me uncle cubbys will unless i heard wrong it seems to me he left the observatory pretty well financed dixler shook his head she has to account to the board for anything she spends out of the endowment if she wants that mission to fly shes got a lot of offthebooks expenses to deal with i wouldnt call them bribes exactly but not exactly legitimate either if you know what i mean she doesnt want to have to explain them to the board so shes been dipping into her capital to pay them out of her own pocket shes been buying uncut diamonds too for the first time dannerman was startled uncut diamonds the lawyer shrugged for what purpose i do not know she certainly doesnt plan to wear them and shes got better inflation hedges than diamonds already he shook his head dan i dont have to tell you thats not like her so she must have some pretty powerful reasonand there are these rumors what do the rumors say exactly the lawyer said shrewdly thats what im asking you to find out you work there you should be able to get the facts on it dannerman quelled a sudden impulse to laugh in the mans face youre not asking me to be a spy are you oh no nothing like that i wouldnt ask you to pry into your cousins affairs all i want you to do is keep your ears open and of course give me a call when you find anything out so you can figure out some way to cut yourself in on the profitsif there are any dixler flushed but he controlled his temper my reasons he said arent actually any of your business if you want to take a guess about them youre welcome but i dont choose to discuss the subject let me think about it dannerman said the lawyer waved graceful permission with one hand and began to talk about what a fine man cuthbert dannerman had been and how charming dan and his cousin had been as children dannerman listened but didnt need to say much dixler was conducting the conversation by himself only when the meal was finished and they were getting their checked belongings at the cloakroom did the lawyer say what about it dan dannerman was listening to a message that had come with his carryphone and gun he looked up what dixler lowered his voice i said will you do what im asking for me i can make it worth your while dan how worth my while dixler shrugged and was mute well ill do what i can dannerman said ambiguously now if youll excuse me i have to run looks like ive got an appointment i hadnt expected fine said dixler ill be waiting to hear from you as dixler got into his limousine dannerman waited for the doorman to produce a cab he was thinking hard but not about the lawyers offer he was listening again to the message that had been on his phone what it said was dr adcock will be returning to the observatory some time after twothirty you should be waiting at the street entrance before she gets there there wasnt any signature but there didnt need to be the message had been addressed to him as danno he made it by twothirty but with only moments to spare but it didnt seem he had needed to hurry the sidewalk outside the building was as crowded as always but there was no sign of his cousin not at twothirty not at twoforty not at almost three dannerman leaned against the side of the building between two storefronts to keep his back covered he had no doubt there were pickpockets among the horde of pedestrians there was a policeman moving methodically down the block making the sidewalk vendors pack up their wares and move on he gave dannerman a searching look as he did the four or five other idlers who were standing around doing their best to look as though they were waiting for someone some probably were one at least wasnt because as soon as the cop was ten meters away the man strolled over to dannerman out of the side of his mouth not looking at him he muttered smoke get high want to have a good time get lost dannerman said he looked at his watch he had stretched his lunch hour a good deal longer than cousin pat would approve if it happened she had come back a little earlier than expected and was up in her office wondering where he wasshe wasnt he saw a taxi roll up before the building entrance and pat adcock and her bodyguard got out dannerman wondered just what he was supposed to do but not for long two of the idlers had moved quickly toward the curb as the cab was pulling away one of them jumped mick jarvas from behind the two of them falling to the ground dannerman heard a sickening crunch that sounded like a bone breaking the other grabbed his cousin snatched her necklace knocked her down too and began to runstraight at dan dannerman dannermans reflexes were fast hai he shouted and stopped the man with a full body block the mugger squawked and then lost his voice as dannerman spun him around and got an arm around his throat the other mugger got up from where he had left jarvas writhing on the sidewalk and started over to him then as dannerman turned to face him releasing the man he had captured the two turned and ran disappearing into the crowd as dannerman helped his cousin to her feet and handed back her necklace she looked at him with shaky wonder well thanks dan she gasped youre pretty handy in a street fight arent you and you even got my beads back just glad i was here pat he said modestly so am i she turned to the policeman who was trotting toward them at last sweaty in his body armor and looking annoyed it was only when she had finished reprimanding the officer for not being present when needed and ordering him to call in for an ambulance for groaning mick jarvas that cousin pat finally remembered to revert to type one thing though dan im glad you happened to be here of course but you do know dont you that youre supposed to be back from lunch no later than two and its a pity you let those muggers get away he didnt answer that he especially didnt tell her the reason because he didnt want to mention that while he had the mugger in a choke hold the man had gasped aggrievedly come on danno dont be so fucking rough chapter six dan on the way home that night dannerman stopped to do what he should have done days earlierput in his onceamonth hours practice on the firing range at the ymca as long as he was there he put in another hour on the exercise machines to keep his muscle tone up when he got home he was hot and sweaty but the guns had to be cleaned his practiced fingers knew how to do that without much direction from his brain so he put something on the screen to watch while he cleaned the weapons he hesitated over the choice one of his store of elmer rice plays for the fun of it some of the briefing tapes hilda had downloaded for him for the sake of duty he compromised on looping the two messages from space again maybe they had something to do with his assignment as the colonel had hinted but anyway shed stirred his curiosity he did the easiest weapon first the registered twentyshot his eyes on the screen even slowed down to catch details the first space message gave no more information than it had the first time he saw it in the neuereich the universe expanded and collapsed and that was that he paused before running the second message because the stink of his bombbugger was getting to him once the chemicals in a bombbugger mixed they produced not only thrust for the bullets but a godawful smell he rinsed the whole weapon tiring chamber and all in water with neutralizer added then carefully added enough of each chemical to top them off from the canisters hidden under his bed then he turned on the second message and began to clean his ankle gun he didnt get far there were angry voices just outside his door one was his landlady rita in a bad mood the other whining and apologetic belonged to one of the upstairs lodgers bert germaine when he opened the door rita diverted her attention from the lodger to dannerman i didnt see you in the kitchen she said accusingly then wrinkling her nose whats that smell i guess its the lowpower loads they make you use on the ymca range sorry about that she shrugged turning back to look for the other lodger but that conversation with the other lodger was over because germaine had taken advantage of her distraction to sneak away little bastard she said morosely i ought to kick his ass right out of my condo cant pay the rent oh no but he always has a couple dollars for lottery tickets every day dannerman took the hint let me settle up oh honey she sighed i wasnt talking about you youre the best goddam tenant i have you know that only how can i make ends meet when i have to put up with deadbeats like germaine look at the bright side rita maybe hell win his hundred million dollars then hell pay everything he owes all at once maybe pigs will fly dan she said looking him over when was the last time you got a haircut he shrugged you really ought to take more pride in your appearance a goodlooking young fellow like you which reminds me she added there was a girl here looking for you oh he said wondering colonel hilda somebody from the office said her name was anita said to tell you they missed you at the theater is she the one i used to see here sometimes like a month or two ago not that im complaining about your having guests she added hastily you pay your rent on time im not going to worry if you have somebody visit you now and then and one thing i will say for you dan the ones ive seen have always looked pretty respectable not like the hookers that little bastard germaine tries to sneak in hes always got the money to pay them you bet and still he says he cant pay his rent when he was safely locked in his room again dannerman didnt start the tape again he was thinking about anita berman that was not an enjoyable subjectnot meaning anita herself who was about as enjoyable a female as he had ever dated but the fact that he would soon have to do something about her the troubling question was do what he didnt really want to break off their relationship but she was beginning to sound serious and that was something he couldnt afford then hildas call came in on the coded line and he put anita berman out of his mind for the moment he started in right away with the colonel thanks a lot for setting me up this afternoon you couldve told me about it first what for i knew you could handle it now jarvas is out of the way for a while right i guess so they were still at the hospital when left hes out she said positively his arms broken so tomorrow morning you go in to your cousin and see if you can get his job you broke his arm on purpose damn straight we did so now his jobs open because whats the use of a bodyguard with a broken arm get it her bodyguard goes wherever she goes so you can keep tabs on her when shes out of the observatory now lets hear your report there wasnt much to say until he got to his lunch with the lawyer she scowled at that him too maybe we should sell tickets you dont act surprised at what he said he pointed out you mean because this dixler thinks your cousins trying to make some money out of the starlab but we already knew all that of course hell hilda i didnt so now that i know that much how about telling me the rest she shook her head dont hassle me about that what else he hesitated one thing i want to go back and visit at the theater theyre opening the subway tomorrow night and i want to be there she frowned again is that wise the only reason we let you do that theater crap was because it made good cover on the carpezzio job and thats over for you dont get the two things mixed up its personal hilda she sighed and surrendered that goddam berman woman right well i wont say no but if theres any fallout its your ass danno all right ive got some orders for you we cant get through your cousins encoding we need a key that greek fellow papathanassiou that one he probably has it and ive got his data packet ill pass it on to you couple of others too but the greeks is the one that looks good you ought to be able to get something out of him blackmail him you mean whatever and that chinaman we were interested in jimmy lin hes coming back tomorrow morning so you want to get on him too she reflected for a moment peering past him did you clean your clothes after firing your bombbugger once you fire one of those things the stink stays so everybodys going to know youve got a hideout gun i will he promised then hey youve had me followed well sure if we didnt do that how would we know if anybody else was following you youre clean so farand dont forget the first thing you do in the morning is see if you can go for jarvass job but as it turned out that wasnt an option somebody had forgotten to tell the bureaus armbreakers that jarvas was lefthanded and when dannerman put his card in the turnstile at the observatory entrance the next morning his cousin pat was ahead of him and beside her punching out the combination to summon an elevator was mick jarvas a translucent cast on his right arm morning dannerman said trying not to grin and good morning to you his cousin said smiling she reached over to touch him on the shouldernot affectionately exactly but a lot more amiably than before you surprised me yesterday old dan for an english major i mean she said listen come see me this afternoon ive got an errand for you to run sure thing pat he might have asked what kind of an errand but he didnt get the chance as they stepped out of the car at their floor she almost bumped into a large sandcolored man with short black hair who was waiting there why jimmy she said i didnt expect you so early i just dropped off some of my stuff i have an appointment downtown to check in at the embassy in half an hour the man said holding the elevator door open well i wont keep you pat said you know mick jarvas of course and this is my cousin dan dannerman commander jimmy lin dannerman hadnt had any clear idea of what he expected a chinese astronaut to be like but jimmy lin wasnt it the man was taller than he had imagined and a lot huskier he wore a flowered hawaiian shirt and shoes that dannerman was pretty sure would have cost him a month of his observatory pay glad to know you commander dannerman said automatically extending his hand but the peoples republic astronaut obviously didnt share the pleasure he didnt accept dannermans hand he didnt even speak to him he gave him a long hard look then turned to pat adcock ill be back before lunch he said we can talk then ive got a lunch date make it this afternoon she said gazing after lin as he let the elevator door close behind him then she turned to dannerman with a mildly puzzled look hes usually chummier than that you didnt forget to shower this morning did you he shrugged well lets get to work you can sort that out later dannerman would have to sort that out somehow if he was going to carry out the colonels orders but it was going to be harder than hed thought he hadnt expected that kind of unprovoked hostility from lin and he was going to have to come up with something better than a broken wrong arm to get jarvas out of the way and then as he checked his weapon with jarvas there was another curious thing the bodyguard gave him a long look partly abashed partly pugnacious but though he seemed to want to say something he didnt get it out there was one thing dannerman could do though hilda had kept her promise and transmitted the background packets on the observatory employees who had turned up in the sin file two of them were unlikely to help the astrophysics grad student three weeks past her period and frantically sending faxes to her boyfriend now in sierra leone harry chesweiler identified as a former member of the manboy love association but the packet on christo papathanassiou did look good the old man had got himself picked up for questioning about a terrorist assassination back in the old country that dannerman thought judiciously could be made to workwhether or not papathanassiou was actually guilty of anything dannerman couldnt do anything about it for the first couple of hours that morning because he was kept busy with his nominal observatory duties and then when he went looking for the cypriot papathanassiou was nowhere to be found he wasnt in his office he wasnt in with pat or in the room of number crunchers all the scientists used to set up their mathematical models when dannerman looked into rosaleen artzybachovas cubicle he wasnt there either and the old lady herself was incredibly doing pushups on the floor you want me she called looking up at dannerman actually i was looking for dr papathanassiou try the canteen she said and that was where dannerman found him attacking a wedge of some unfamiliar kind of pastry smothered in heavy cream he looked defensive one has to keep ones blood sugar up he said good idea said dannerman mind if i join you and when he had a dish of sherbet for himself he said i was kind of hoping id run into you dr papathanassiou i was looking at those tapes from space again last night those oddlooking alien creatures yes and i just didnt understand about this big crunch ah papathanassiou said gratified but really its very simple the universe is expanding in the future it will collapse again thats all of it of course he went on the mathematics is yes rather complex actually it was the subject of my dissertation in graduate school did you know that dannerman did but saw no reason to say so it was necessary to use symplectic integrators to predict the next fifty quadrillion years of motion in only our own galaxy youve heard of the threebody problem what i had to solve was the twohundredbillionbody problem he tittered dannerman pressed on but what i dont understand is when the universe collapses again what does it collapse to ah the astronomer ruminated for a moment licking cream off his upper lip well you see when everything has come together again great velocities and pressures are involved first all matter is compressed then the atomic nuclei themselves are compressed they become a new form of very dense matter which is stablewell temporarily stable are you following me so far dannerman nodded not entirely truthfully excellent interestingly some workers once thought that sort of thing might happen in a particle accelerator they called that state leewick matter and they feared it would be so dense that it would accrete everything else into it perhaps do you see even turning the whole earth into leewick matter he wiped his lips with a napkin grinning they were incorrect no accelerator can reach those forces though at the crunch yes why then papathanassiou said nodding yes perhaps it could be possible not in the form of leewick matter no one is pretty confident now that that doesnt exist after all rather it would be in the form of strange matter thats to say matter made from quarksdo you know what a quark is well never mind but strange matter would be very dense indeed and it would keep on getting denser and denser you cannot imagine how dense mr dannerman like a black hole he hazarded far denser than even a black hole it would encompass the entire universe you see for as soon as it began to form it would transform everything around it into strange matter do you know our story of king midas and his touch of gold like that but only for a tiny fraction of a second because such matter has a net positive chargeno electrons you seeand so it tries to fly apart like a bomb have i answered your question well yes dannerman cleared his throat that part of it anyway but its funny you should mention a bomb papathanassious cheerful expression faltered i beg your pardon someone was asking about you dannerman lied he mentioned bombs and a brother the astronomers smile was gone i dont understand who was this person i dont know greek i think you know that bar downstairs was having a cup of coffee and he sat down next to me and asked if i knew you do you think i should mention it to dr adcock dear god no i mean so she can find this man and make him stop he said some very unkind things about you dr papathanassiou no please no the astronomer begged well dannerman began then paused as his communicator beeped at him there was an incoming call on the observatory system in any case he thought that was a good place to stop the hook had been planted and it would be worthwhile to let papathanassiou worry for a while id better take my call he said anyway i wont say anything to her today but i need to think this over maybe you and i can talk again tomorrow here i think that would be a good ideaand oh yes thank you for explaining to me about the big crunch the call turned out to be gerd hausewitz from the maxplanck institut again and he was looking aggrieved you promised to supply the specs for the starlab mission he reminded dannerman i know gerd ive requested them it is only that we supplied the data you asked for at once i know you did what can i tell you i dont know how it is in your place but here it takes time to get people to move yes of course dannerman but he looked over his shoulder and spoke more softly my superiors are quite interested in this matter they were not pleased that i delivered your material without at once receiving what we asked in return this could be difficult for me here ill do what i can please dannerman yes i promise dannerman said half turning as he cut the contact someone was at his door and surprisingly it was the chinese astronaut prc space corps commander james pengtsu lin he was wearing a propitiatory smile hey dan he said i owe you an apology i beg your pardon no really i was pretty rude this morning and i didnt mean to behad to get down to the embassy and all that red tape had a lot on my mind so lets start over okay glad to commander lin just jimmy all right listen what i was thinking are you free for lunch looks like were going to be working together for a while and i like to get to know new people when they come to work here especially if theyre pats cousin they tell me theres some pretty fine ethnic food just around the corner thatd be fine dannerman said with pleasure whatever had turned lin around was a mystery but it was also a break you didnt often get a subject volunteering to let you interrogate him ill get my stuff and meet you at the elevator and then as he picked up his twentyshot weapon from mick jarvas another little mystery solved itself jarvas was in the mens room but when he came out he looked almost cheerful until he saw dannerman waiting for him then he gave dannerman that peculiar look again as he handed over the gun he didnt let go of it is there something you want to say to me dannerman asked holding the barrel while jarvas held the butthe was glad to see the safety was firmly on jarvass eyes were on the ground but dannerman thought he muttered something what did you say jarvas looked up angrily as he let go of the gun at last he managed to get it out about that business in the street yesterday i just said thanks jimmy lin was in the waiting room busily chatting up the receptionist in the elevator he said appreciatively i have to say your cousin pat doesnt mind hiring other goodlookers howd you like to do the twin dragons teasing the phoenix with that janice lady the what the astronaut guffawed the twin dragons teasing the phoenix its an old chinese expression its like well like when a lady has two gentleman paying attention to her at once he grinned sidelong at dannerman just a joke you know phew what a mob he led the way along the block to turn the corner moving rapidly when he noticed that dannerman was lengthening his stride to keep up with him he said apologetically sorry i guess im always in a hurry its a genetic fault my dad was the same wayexcept with the ladies of course anyway heres the place to the surprise of dannerman who had been preparing himself for chinese food the ethnic restaurant was not oriental at all what it was was texmex the place was almost as crowded as the sidewalk but lin had a whispered conversation with the waiter and money must have changed hands they got an immediate table i hope you like this stuff dan i guess i got an appetite for it in houston first time i was there this lady from el paso introduced me to it then i introduced her to the jade girl playing the flute aw he said grinning lowering his voice as he glanced at the waitress who was hovering just out of earshot that doesnt mean anything to you does it its another of those old chinese expressions one of these days ill show you some books that were written by my greatgreatidontknowhowmanygreats granddaddy pengtsu i got my middle name after him the old mans kind of famous in some circles anyway he was a taoist sage two thousand years agoid have to say a pretty horny taoist sageand he wrote some dandy books on what he called healthful life his idea of health though was to prong the ladies as often as he could and make up a list of all the ways there are of doing it well enough of my sordid family history lets go ahead and order we dont want to keep that goodlooking little cowgal over there waiting and then you can tell me all about dan dannerman and that was the way it went it didnt take dannerman long to realize that the astronaut was as interested in pumping him as he was in finding out about the astronaut they didnt talk shop they talked the way longlost friends talk when they catch up on each others lives after years of separation jimmy lin wasnt reticent about himself garrulous wouldve been more accurate in the first half hour dannerman learned that the lins were a wealthy old hong kong family who moved to beijing after the reunification and got even richer there as the peoples republic discovered the wonders of entrepreneurialism jimmy lin himself had been educated in america of course that along with the fact that he spent a lot of his spare time in his fathers place on maui accounted for his accentfree american english then instead of going into the family business hed been accepted for astronaut training but he said sighing im no credit to my ancestors the top brass fired me out of the astronaut corps a year agothey had some damn political charge he looked ruefully embarrassed what they called it was leftwing rightwing zigzag deviationism if you can imagine that but actually about half the corps got dumped at the same time for one pretext or another my opinion they just decided there wasnt any money to be made in space anymore so they cut back so now i have to scratch for work but after every little datum he supplied about himself he paused inquiringly to give dannerman a chance to supply a little quid for his quo he was fascinated by dannermans interest in the little theater in brooklyn he was searching about dannermans years in europedannerman was glad hed been thorough about covering his tracks with the mad king ludwigsand sympathetic about the fact that although dannerman and pat adcock had inherited the same amount from uncle cubby pat had actually got hers and dannermans had shrunk to invisibility through inflation before he collected it but of the repair mission to starlab he would say nothing at all the thing is dan he said all goodnatured candor im in line to fly that bird provided i dont screw up with your cousin and well she just doesnt want it talked about yet he glanced at his watch well thiss been great but we better get back to the office i hear pats got a job for you to do this afternoon when dannerman was summoned to his cousins office though the first thing she said wasnt about the errand it was what the hell did you promise the germans he shrugged less interested in the question than in the fact that mick jarvas was standing there beside her desk looking truculent again they asked for information about the starlab repair mission they cant have it all right he said agreeably but can i give them a reason no well hell i guess you have to say something tell them weve got a problem you dont know exactly what it is but itll all be cleared up in a week or so it seemed to dannerman that his cousin had a lot in common with the colonel he ventured meaning when you get back from your starlab trip she glared at him who told you i was going to starlab just do your job she ordered no wait a minute i didnt mean for you to go i need something delivered to the florida embassy youre going to take it and its important im sending mick along with you just in case jarvas stirred i can handle it all by myself he muttered she ignored him to dannerman she said give me your belly bag when he unsnapped it and handed it over puzzled she dumped the entire contents on her desk hey he said there was personal stuff there his cash card his id the key cards for the office and the condo shut up she said she unlocked a drawer of her desk and took out a small softsided leather satchel she stuffed it into his belly bag it fit but just barely she thought for a moment then put his id back you can pick up the rest of your stuff when you get back dan what i want you to do take this bag to the floridian embassy and give the bag to general martin delasquez personally nobody else understand no matter what they say its to be handdelivered and hes expecting it wait for him while he checks it out and when he says its okay you can come back here mick give him his gun right padr adcock the bodyguard rumbled pulling the weapon out of his pocket come on dannerman in the elevator he was fidgety glaring at dannerman just before they reached the ground floor he asked do you know what this is about dont have a clue neither do i listen maybe youre not as big a prick as i thought you were but my orders are that that package stays in your belly bag until you hand it over to the guy its meant for no peeking i dont want to have any trouble with you you wont dannerman said meaning it he didnt want to cross jarvas just when the man was being nearly human in any case he was hoping that the subway ride would give him a chance to engage jarvas in conversation but that didnt happen jarvas was working at the business of being a bodyguard he stayed close to dannerman keeping anyone else from touching him even on the subway his good hand always near his own weapon and he wasnt talkative when the train speeded up to pass what some terrorist had done to the fourteenth street station all lightless and covered in dark green radiationproof foam jarvas crossed himself awkwardly with the arm that was in a cast dannerman considered mentioning to him as a conversation opener that he really had nothing to worry about the residue from the terrorists nuclear satchel bomb was no more dangerous than the general atmospheric levelsas long as you didnt linger there of course but as soon as he opened his mouth jarvas gave him a warning scowl he closed his mouth again and followed jarvas meekly as they got out at chambers street the floridians had their place on embassy row just like the rich foreign countries theirs wasnt one of the bigmoney establishmentsit wasnt anything like the swedish embassy on the corner twelve stories high and immaculately kept and of course not a patch on the embassy of the united koreas across the street but then florida was stretching a point to have an embassy at all since it wasnt really an independent nation at least not in name the floridians took themselves as seriously as one though both jarvas and dannerman had to turn over their guns even before they got to the scanners in the vestibule and then dannerman had to turn over his ankle gun as well jarvas gave him a scowl for that at least dannerman thought with resignation the scanners hadnt picked up the bombbugger then they had to sit for half an hour in a sort of barred quarantine chamber before a guard was available to escort them to the office of major general martin delasquez moreno jarvas sat like a stone a scowl on his face after a moment dannerman decided to improve the time he checked his mail wiped it all then accessed a news broadcast but he had time only for a couple of items before the door guard leaned in and ordered no electronics then they just sat when the armed guard came for dannerman he pointed to jarvas and said you stay hey ive got my job your job is stay here come on you leaving the fuming jarvas behind was a surprise for dannerman but not altogether unwelcome it occurred to him that without jarvas by his side it was a chance to sneak a quick look into the leather bag but it really wasnt with the armed embassy guard watching every move when he got to the office of general delasquez the man seemed surprisingly youngprobably a relative of somebody high in floridas government dannerman supposed he was wearing the full dress uniform of a general of the florida state air guard and when he shooed the guard out with an offhand gesture the man was meek to obey delasquez closed the door hand it over he ordered and then when he had the leather bag in his hands turn around this is not your concern but by then what was in the satchel was no longer much of secret to dannerman because hed felt its contents as he took it out of his belly bag it felt like a few dozen pebbles it wasnt pebbles though when the general had finished his inspection and had locked the bag in a drawer and told him he could turn around again he forgot to put the jewelers loupe away but by then dannerman had figured out that they were gemstones almost certainly the diamonds jerry dixler had mentioned pat was buying wait the general ordered and keyed on his phone dannerman couldnt see the picture but he knew his cousins voice when she answered your application has been received and is satisfactory dr adcock the general said the documents will be processed immediately and then to dannerman you can go with their errand completed jarvas loosened up a little he listened almost politely as dannerman answered his questions about what had happened in the generals office then actually managed a grin got that done anyway your cousinll be happy about that then he stopped short in front of the swedish embassy eyeing the curbside vendors hey dannerman how about some candy ive got kind of a sweet tooth not me but go ahead as he watched jarvas haggling with the woman at the pushcart he wondered how jarvas got away with his drug habit the candy addiction was a tipoff and so was the fact of his mood swings in some ways cousin pat didnt seem to be as sharp as hed thought but it was good that jarvas was mellower maybe on the way back he would be more talkative the other good thing in his future he thought was that that night he could go back to the theater he must have smiled be cause the guard outside the swedish embassy gave him a suspicious look before going back to eyeing the vendors and loafers along the crowded sidewalk dannerman kept getting nudged as people bumped against him but if any of them were pickpockets as they likely were he had nothing left in his belly bag worth picking he felt droplets of cold water hitting the back of his neck and looked up the meticulous swedes had permanent crews at work in hoists overhead to keep the building washed down even so they were just barely keeping ahead of the pollution as he moved away he felt someone touch his arm it was a young boy no more than fifteen vill herrn vaxla vagvisare he hissed dannerman shook his head but the boy persisted vill ni knulla min syster renflicka mycket vacker dannerman realized the boy had taken him for a swedish tourist asshole dannerman said cheerfully i dont want your sister and besides im an american the boy changed gears without a blink okay sport how about a little american happy time sticks ampoules mellow patches i can get you anything you want no sale and then as jarvas came toward them munching on caramel popcorn he said you can try my buddy there he might be in the market for some dope it was a light impulse and he regretted it the boy took one look at the expression on jarvass face and then dodged across the street to try his luck with the koreans and all the way back in the subway jarvas stood cold and angry beside dannerman and wouldnt say a word chapter seven dan there was one job remaining for dannerman to do that day it was a fairly nasty one and not one he looked forward to but it was best to get it over with so at quitting time dannerman went looking for the cypriot astronomer christo papathanassiou the man was standing over the screens in his office preparing to shut them down for the day when he saw dannerman in the doorway he gave him a quick apprehensive look sorry to bother you but i need to talk to you for a minute dannerman said ive got a problem papathanassiou sat down again stiffly waiting see dr papathanassiou im in a little trouble with my cousin and i dont want to make it worse when i went down to the lobby to get something for dr chesweiler that man was there and he started up again the astronomer still didnt speak he didnt look surprised at what dannerman was saying only sadly resigned and now dannerman went on im really worrying about not telling my cousin about it you see what the man says well he says youve been mixed up with some bad business you have a brotheri think he said the name was aristide yes and this aristide was implicated in an assassination on cyprus a turkish tax collector i think he said shot in the back as he was opening his own front door papathanassiou stirred i know of this case yes a very sad business but it was long ago more than five years and aristide is only my halfbrother my fathers youngest son by his third wife we were never close so what has that to do with me well aristides on interpols wanted list and it seems they have some idea you helped him get away papathanassiou nodded somberly i was aware they had that idea i was questioned at the time of course that is all never since but how does it happen mr dannerman that you know so much about interpol who me oh i dont know anything about interpol dannerman said quickly thats just what the man said but if pat finds out i knew about this and didnt tell her shell be even madder madder about what papathanassiou inquired well thats where i have this problem she wanted me to get some data for her and i said id already done it actually i hadnt and now i cant remember the specs for what she wanted and i cant ask her because id have to admit i lied about doing it already and i cant look them up because theyre in her secure file so what i wanted to ask you dr papathanassiou the old man held up his hand permit me to guess he said he didnt seem angry or surprised only sorrowful i imagine what you want is for me to give you the access code for the secure file simply so you can carry out dr adcocks orders of course and then i imagine you will no longer feel it necessary to tell her about this other matter well yes thats about it dannerman agreed and did not enjoy the expression on the astronomers face it was a long subway ride to coney island and at rush hour the trains were packed it hadnt taken long after papathanassiou leftwithout saying goodbye dannerman rememberedto access the secure file and dump it all into a coded transmission for the national bureau of investigation office but it hadnt left time for anything like a leisurely dinnerat least not if he wanted to get to the theater early the best dannerman could do was to pick up some falafel and a juice box figuring he could stave off starvation on the way and then there just wasnt enough elbow room in the standingroomonly subway car to eat them they were at lower manhattan before he was able to squirm his way to the corner of the car he managed to eat his dinner there on the long stretch under the east river doing his best to avoid spilling hummus on the luckier seated passengers around him but he took no pleasure in it for one thing all that congested body heat had caused all the hightech micropores in the garments of his fellow passengers to open and the collective odor was not appetizing more than that there was the depressing business with christo papathanassiou dannerman could not help empathizing with what the old man must be feeling hilda was right about one thing anyway dannerman admitted to himself he had the bad habit of letting himself feel what his victims went through in a way it was an asset for a professional spook it had certainly made it easier for him to get along with for instance use of the mad king ludwigs not to mention even the carpezzios but sometimes it made him feel well guilty by the time the train had come out of the ground and begun to run on the old elevated tracks dannerman even found a seat he took advantage of the time to run through his messages none of which mattered to him and then did what most of his fellow passengers were doing stared blankly into space or watched the advertisements as they circled around the display panels just under the ceiling of the car what caught his eye was a commercial for a soft drink with a mild tetrahydrocannabinol contentthe obligatory surgeon generals warning ran in inconspicuous type under the prancing cartoon figures along with the legend not to be sold to anyone under the figures comically struggling with each other for the soda were the seven aliens the sleepy with its redshot eyes and pursy little threecornered mouth the happy with its ominous sharktoothed grin the bashful the docall of them in their sanitized and anthropomorphized disneylike forms as cartoons the creatures were funny and not at all threatening but suppose dannerman thought suppose the real creatures were somewhere not far away possibly as close as starcophagus suppose the messages from space had in fact been warnings suppose the creatures were actually a clear and present danger that the world really needed to be warned about dannerman remembered the little song the taxi drivers grumpy doll had sunghiho hiho to conquer earth we go well steal your pearls and all your girls hiho hiho but it might not be a joking matter dannerman dismissed the notion it was simply too fanciful and besides he had nearer concerns he leaned back closed his eyes and thought about just what it was that he was going to say to anita berman there were a million ways of breaking off a relationship the trouble was that they all started from the same point you had to want the relationship to be broken off and dannerman was a long way from being certain of that it was the job that mandated the break not his personal wishes although the life of an nbi agent was surely full of interesting incidents there was a part of dan dannerman that sometimes thought wistfully about what it would be like to live a more settled existence to have a home of his own for instance in something like a fourroom apartment somewhere in the outer suburbs with a regular job that didnt require him to move somewhere else on short noi ice a home that he could share with someone else on a more or less permanent basis with someone for example who was a lot like anita berman that wasnt a useful speculation either he wasnt going to resign from the bureau for what else would he do with his time by the time he got to the stop for theater aristophanes two he had managed to bury that line of thought along with imaginings about the aliens and the memory of his conversation with christo papathanassiou and was only looking forward to an evening that was all his own the people who got out with him were a mixed lot coney island wasnt the worst neighborhood in brooklyn but it wasnt the best either it was not what you would consider a natural place for a theater but the old ukrainian orthodox church they had converted into theater aristophanes two had one great advantage it was cheap it was a sound building too because the ukrainians had done their best to make the area livablebuilt a church tore down the worst of the burnedout tenements turned some of the vacant lots into vegetable gardens but when the ukrainians moved out and the immigrating palestinians biafrans and kurds moved in the neighborhood went sour again the new people apparently didnt go in for farmingmaybe there werent any farms in palestine or iraq anyway now there was little behind the chainlink fences but burdock and trash and the church had lost its congregation the theater group had been able to pick it up for a nominal rental and a lot of sweat equityit needed the sweat work because it had been looted twice and flooded three times in atlantic hurricanes on warm evenings it still smelled a little like low tide at the beach it wasnt very big either maximum seating capacity was not quite two hundred that had its good aspects it was easier to fill than a bigger house and most of all it kept the theatrical unions from bothering the group even though it also meant that theater aristophanes two had no chance at all of ever turning a profit but that of course wasnt what they were there for the members of the group were there because theater was in their bloodor because it was what they were trained for and nothing better offered itself dannerman arrived early the lobby doors were locked but when he knocked the manager timmi trout peered out of the ticket window and came out to let him in dan she said pleased hey we thought wed lost you i shouldve known youd be here for the opening anyway theyre still rehearsing its a mess because we open in an hour and that idiot bucky korngolds out of the cast because he got himself arrested yesterday on some damn drug charge can you imagine dannerman could imagine very easily practically everybody in the group had a day job of course bucky korngolds had been dealing drugs he was one of the people dannerman had been investigating in the carpezzio matter he said mind if i go in and watch of course not she hesitated anitas going to be real glad to see you you know shes been kind of worried about you hut hey youll talk to her yourself go on in he did and took his seat in a back row as inconspicuously as possible the cast wasnt so much rehearsing as shouting at each other for missing cues and stepping on each others linesnormal enough for a final rehearsal at aristophanes twoand he saw anita berman at once for one thing she was the prettiest woman on the stage slim tall redhaired with a deep carrying voice that was perfect for unmiked theater she saw him right away too when she caught sight of him at the back of the theater she looked startled then perplexed then gave him a tentative not quite forgiving seeyouinaminute wave and it wasnt much more than a minute before the director abandoned his attempts to get the performance running like clockwork go back for makeup all of you he ordered a bad dress rehearsal means a good show they say maybe you can take comfort in that i know i will and anita berman jumped down from the stage and ran up the aisle to meet dannerman it was clear shed made up her mind for forgiveness im real glad youre here she said putting up her face to be kissed she clung to him for a moment then pulled back to look at his face i guess weve kind of been playing telephone tag im sorry about that he said meaning itmeaning at least the sorry part ive got this new job and it keeps me really on the jump i figured it was something like that i guess youre making a lot more money there maybe soon anyway he said vaguely but it takes all my time matter of fact ill have to be going out of town pretty soon ah she said for very long i dont know that yet she was silent for a moment then said dan dear listen ive been thinking about us i know some men still like to be in control and maybewell if you think i was rushing things talking about moving in together thats not it he said uncomfortably look you need to get ready for the performance and weve got a lot to talk about how about if i meet you after the play she gave him a sudden smile thatll be fine dan come backstage and well go to the cast party you can tell me all about the new job and your trip ill be waiting for you so dannerman had the whole duration of the play to decide on a story about where he was going on the trip he had invented on the spur of the moment and how long he would be away there was a funny thing about that if only he had known it it was part of dannermans tradecraft as an nbi agent to tell selected fragments of truth in order to deceive for a change this time it was the other way around although he didnt know it yet the deception was truth he was indeed going away in fact very much farther away than he could ever have imagined fidgeting in his seat while waiting for the curtain to go up dannerman was trying to decide what to do about anita berman he didnt have to break up with her well not just yet anyway sometime yes because a permanent committed relationship was out of the question for anybody in dannermans line of work the worrisome part was that he was pretty sure the longer he waited the worse it would be for her when the break did come and how bad was he willing to make it for sweet pretty anita berman when the play began he was glad to put that question out of his mind what was happening on the stage held his interest maybe the old adage was right the blunders of the rehearsal had disappeared and the cast was flawless in the first act of the subway anita was beautiful even in her s bargainbasement flapper costume and whoever the actor was who had taken over for poor bucky korngold he didnt miss a beat even the play itself was going well with the audience the subway was definitely one of elmer rices more squirrelly works and dannerman was the one who had first urged it on the group it was ideal for them it was short it used a large cast always an asset for an offoffoffbroadway theater when everybody involved wanted to get on stage where some slumming bigtime media critic might just possibly think their performance worth a few seconds commendation in a review the play was cheap to produce since it only required one impressionisticand therefore inexpensiveset most important of all the subway was just about totally forgotten no major company had given it a production in close to a hundred years and so the troupe didnt have a million library tapes floating around out there to compete with he had also vowed to the group that some critics at least would be sufficiently intrigued by a longlost classic of modern american theater to make the long run out to coney island to see its revival he was happy to see that he had been right about that he was pretty sure that at least six or eight of the audience members were actual critics none of them were smiling but he didnt expect that critics didnt smile the important thing was that they werent walking out either then when the first act ended at least two of them were actually clapping well the whole audience was enthusiastic in its applausenot surprising since a good half of its members were in some way related to one of the actorsbut it was a good sign in the intermission crowd that packed the lobbyonce the vestry when the place had been a churchdannerman attached himself as inconspicuously as possible to a woman he was nearly sure was a tv talkshow host trying to overhear what she was saying to her companion but she was only commenting on the buskers on the sidewalk outside two arab kids tapdancing while a third in an i love allah tshirt worked the intermission crowd for cash he started for another potential critic and was annoyed when someone touched his arm he turned to face a short plump woman who was placidly gazing up at him why danno she said it really is you isnt it nice to run into you like this why dont we step outside for a little air damn it hilda he said what the hell are you doing here she didnt answer that but then she didnt need to she simply steered him firmly out of the doors and around the corner to where a large truck was parked at the curb the liquidcrystal display on its side glittered with the words niitake bros moving storage but dannerman knew it was not going to be any ordinary moving van it wasnt it turned out to be a complete mobile nbi surveillance station with a police corps master sergeant saluting smartly as colonel hilda morrisey brought him in its time for us to do a little business she said cheerfully take a pew danno want some coffee a beer were pretty well stocked here and horacell get you anything you want what i wanted was to be left alone for one damn evening with my friends another time danno hows it going as well as can be expected considering you picked korngold up the day before the opening not me they she corrected they picked everybody in the operation up but i wasnt involved ive been off the carpezzio business as long as you have because your cousins is more important lets have your report she absorbed the news about the floridian general and the diamonds without comment but winced when he told her that the muggers had broken mick jarvass wrong arm well have to do that another way she said resignedly youve got to get his job because shes going out to starlab and youre going to have to go with her he goggled at the woman into space nobody goes into space anymore she does thats what she was bribing the general for and she wouldve taken jarvas along for muscle but well have to change that you want me to go into space he said again why are you making such a big deal out of this lots of people have gone into space not the bureau and not recently for almost anybody well until recently the bureau didnt have a reason he looked at her more carefully somethings happened he said that data from your cousins file happened danno the colonel said triumphantly i knew thered be something there you know what it was synchrotron radiation he said impatiently cut the crap hilda i dont know what that is well neither do i exactly but thats what started your cousin off seven or eight months ago the observatory was trying one more time to reactivate the satellite and they detected a burst of this synchrotron radiation coming from it but you said to check into gamma radiation i know what i said the agent who passed the word along mustve gotten it wrong anyway the word is its definitely synchrotron not gamma there wasnt much of it it lasted just for a few seconds but it was definite according to your cousins analysis and the thing is there isnt supposed to be anything on starlab that could cause it she paused studying his face so you know what that means somethings been added to starlab are you going to tell me what that is ill show you as much as we know horace will you start the simulation now please the sergeant touched one button and the inside of the truck body went dark touched another and the simulation tank at the front of the body lit up with a picture of starlab sailing along in its perpetual fall toward earth with its ruff of solar panels soaking up photovoltaic power to run the instruments that were no longer responding and its huge collector eyes staring unseeingly out at the universe as you can see hilda instructed its big thats because it was designed to let astronomers live there for weeks at ive seen all this hilda its no secret christ theyve got a model of the thing in the observatory waiting room dont rush me danno were coming to what you havent seen this is stuff we got from your cousins observatory records she had this whole segment deleted from the public bankdecided to keep it a secret i guessbut once our technicians knew what to look for they had no trouble retrieving it this is enhanced imaging otherwise you couldnt see anything at all watch that little thing coming in from the upper right i see it it was a nearly featureless lump by comparison with the huge starlab no bigger than a football it slipped past the great solar vanes and gently caressed the sheathing of the main body of the satellite it didnt bounce away it stuck where it touched then while dannerman watched the object draped itself to the curvature of the shell in a moment it was almost invisible again except as a nearly imperceptible swelling of the hull so what the hell is it dannerman demanded space junk did that look like junk it didnt crash into the satellite did it looks to me like it docked with the son of a bitch what then as the idea struck him does it have any connection with the clo good question she said approvingly i ran that past the experts as soon as they dug out the clip on the object they said no they said this thing was way too small to be taken for a comet although they couldnt turn up any later observations of the object lost it somewhere i guess but they didnt exclude the possibility that this thing had come in on the clo and been dropped off like a probe i guess anyway theyre pretty sure it is some kind of an artifact well he said reasonably if its an artifact somebody would have to put it in orbit whos been launching spacecraft lately nobody not openly anyway some terrorist bunch god i hope not if theres some kind of technology that can launch an artifact without anybody detecting it we need to know about it if terrorists got hold of it well can you imagine what it would mean if the mads or the irish or the goddam basques could put up their own satellites she shrugged expressively then added but maybe that would be better than the other possibility at that your cousin seems to think its extraterrestrial but that doesnt make any sense hilda if she thought that why would she keep it a secret money she said shortly from what damn it oh danno she sighed you know what your trouble is you just dont think like a normal human being you arent greedy enough think about it some kind of technology that can produce synchrotron radiation where there isnt supposed to be any the brains tell me that it cant be done without a big particle acceleratorthose things that run out of subwaytunnel kind of things fifteen or twenty miles long so that means there has to be some pretty hot hardware up there if its alien its worth money to whoever finds it for us on the other hand it doesnt matter whether its from some weirdo et or somebody on earth we want it so let the bureau send a mission up to get it dannerman said reasonably she shook her head thats one option sure but maybe we cant its tricky starlabs private property your uncle paid for it out of his own pocket maybe we could get around that thats what weve got lawyers for for gods sakebut then theres the other problem we dont want to alert other people to whats going on the goddam europeans might send up a mission of their own if they knew we were after something they can move faster than nasa and you know theres no security there and anyway the goddam floridians still control the launch facilities so soprobablythe final decision hasnt been made because too many of the top people are all tied up with the presssecretary thingso probably we want to let her go ahead but send one of our own along to make sure we get first crack at whatevers there ah said dannerman glumly like me you mean exactly like you danno so you have to take jarvass place ive got an idea about that sergeant kill the display and lets have some light again while we brief agent dannerman on what hes going to do for us as she turned to get something out of a locker dannerman tardily remembered the other thing that had been on his mind he sneaked a look at his watch it was late the play would be long over before he got away from the colonel and so he wouldnt be keeping his promise to meet anita backstage which meant that probably that particular problem had already settled itself chapter eight dan when danny dannerman was eight years old spaceflight was still a going business young danny was a pretty normal american kid too so naturally he did a lot of daydreaming picturing his grownup self as one of those grand spacefaring adventurers with sharp uniforms rows of ribbons the look of eagles on their faces and all but that was then then he was a child as he was growing to become a man the space program was dwindling at almost the same rate of speedfew human heroes but a lot of machines then as money began to run short fewer machines too even instrument launches got rarer and rarer and the dream dried up until now now it had become not only real but personal and dannerman had never reckoned on anything like this when he joined the national bureau of investigation he knew as every rookie knew that the work could take you anywhere in the world but it had never occurred to him that it might someday take him right out of it all the way home from coney island in the subway train sparsely occupied by drunks and sleeping homeless people he thought about what he had let himself in for climb into a giant kind of sardine can and let them lock it shut behind you lie there strapped in and helpless while a few dozen exploding tons of fireworks blasted you hard as a hammer blow right off the surface of the earth oh the idea was exciting all right but it kept him awake for an hour after very late he finally got to his narrow bed in ritas condo and then he dreamed all night of spaceships and hideous sharptoothed aliens and a long terrifying fall out of orbit he didnt know what final smashup he was falling to the dreams never got that far but all night long he was falling falling and when the speaker clock woke him at he was edgy and unrested and then as he was getting ready to leave hilda called youre awake good youve got a busy day ahead of you danno i shouldve told you there wasnt much time now theres no time at all what are you talking about im talking about your cousin what do you think she got all her papers signed last night shes planning to launch tomorrow the news beat dannerman to the office by the time he arrived half the observatory staff was clustered in the reception room all chattering whats going on he demanded as janice dupage checked his sidearm wheres jarvas in dr adcocks office sore dr artzybachova and commander lin theyre going up to the orbiter dan up to the starcophagus he asked hoping to learn more than the colonel had been able to tell him even in the excitement of the morning she took time to give him a reproving look to the starlab right we dont use that other word remember anyway she went on the spirit of the morning taking over again shes going to make an announcement as soon as everyones herethatll be any minute now hut thats what it is all right i saw the documents myself when they came in isnt that wonderful dr papathanassiou she added as the old man came up to hand her his ancient uzi yes quite wonderful he said managing to avoid noticing that dannerman was standing right beside him it calls for a celebration said one of the postdocs is there any money in petty cash janice maybe dan could go out and get some supplies ill ask dr adcock as soon as shes made the announcement janice promised and someone else predicted she wont want to spend the money so what the hell the postdoc said happily well take up a collection god to have observing time on starlab you dont know what thats going to do for my ttauri count but they did know they all did know because almost all of them had observations they wanted to make and only the skimpiest budget of hours pat adcock had been willing to buy for them on the keck or the big twin instruments in arizona or even the ancient radio dish at arecibo they didnt need party supplies they were all partying already and when the interoffice channel lighted up and pat adcocks flushed face appeared on all the screens there was a cheer from everywhere in the observatory pat had to have heard it even locked in her private office she looked startled then grinned i guess you all know what im going to say already she said well its true the mission is on were taking off tomorrow in seventytwo hours well be on starlab dr schneyman will be in charge while im gone andand wish me luck all of you but she hadnt said what kind of luck she wanted dannerman wondered what she was going to tell them all if she got back with a fortune in new technology but the old orbiter still out of commission but it wouldnt matter of course if she was right if she was right the whole world was going to change and dannerman himself would be part of it provided that is he reminded himself he did what the colonel wanted him to do and won the chance to go along he patted his belly bag where the pouch hilda had given him was packed away what he needed now was a chance to use it pat had firmly vetoed the notion of a party but not much work got done at the observatory that morning anyway word of the mission had got out janice was kept busy on the phone fending off calls from well wishers listening to complaints from the downstairs security guards besieged by reporters with their tinycams who wanted statements from dr adcock when pat took her crew out to an early lunch most of the staff took off too determined to celebrate even if they had to do it at some nearby restaurant the observatory finally began to quiet down it was time for dannerman to do his job all he needed was for janice dupage to cooperate he lurked around the reception room waiting for her to leave her desk for a moment it didnt happen for a long time she seemed fixed at her desk making him wonder what sort of bladder the woman had but finally with hardly a quarter of an hour before mick jarvas would be back with his charges janice stood up put the elevator door entrance on lock picked up her purse and moved toward the washrooms dannerman didnt wait as soon as she was out of sight he was in the gun locker a coded computer file might defeat the skills the bureau had taught him but a simple locker was not a serious challenge in thirty seconds he had the locker open peering past the gun racks until he found jarvass private cubbyhole and when he had it open there in among the candy bars and the antiinflation trade goods and the porno disks was a package unmarked with three sealed medicallooking patches that he knew did not contain any physicianprescribed medications bingo dannerman pulled the patches out stuffed them in his belly bag and replaced them with three of the ones hilda had given him the night before by the time janice returned from the ladies room he was innocently watering the receptionroom plants and realizing that he had not left himself enough time to eat lunch no matter a missed meal was a small enough price to pay for the mission jarvas was predictable as soon as he had escorted his charges back from lunch he made a beeline for the gun locker then for a cubicle in the mens room ten minutes later dannerman knocked on the lintel of the office where jimmy pengtsu lin was conferring with pat adcock excuse me he said jimmycommander lin i mean i hate to bother you but mick jarvas is acting kind of funny out here hes a pretty big guy and i wonder if you could give me a hand with him that brought them both to the doorway where they gazed incredulously at jarvas who was dreamily waltzing up and down the corridor pinching the ass of rosaleen artzybachova in passing grabbing unsuccessfully at the breast of janice dupage rosaleen was laughing janice was only annoyed as he neared pat adcocks office she found her voice come in here jarvas she commanded sure thing sweet buns he said amiably hi danny hows it going china boy pat looked bewilderedly at dannerman as he was closing the door behind them what happened dannerman shrugged my guess he mustve got his hands on some extrapowerful dope you never know what theyre going to be selling you on the street the bewildered expression changed to anger crap mick promised me he doesnt do drugs anymore i couldnt have a doper for a bodyguard oh well why dont we just ask him to take his shirt off aw dan jarvas said suddenly pouting i thought you and me were friends pat looked from one to the other then made her decision do what he says mick i dont have to i got persnal privacy rights dont i she turned to dannerman take it off him dan dannerman looked at jimmy lin who spread his hands evidently personal combat wasnt one of his specialties it wasnt something dannerman would have sought with somebody like mick jarvas either but the former kickboxer was giggling apart from goodnaturedly pushing at dannermans hands he hardly resisted as dannerman pulled the tabs of his shirt loose zip and slid it down over his back on jarvass rib cage just under his right armpit there was one of hildas inconspicuous fleshcolored patches jimmy lin chuckled well what do you know he really is mellowed out oh shit said pat too disappointed to be furious what am i going to do now he cant escort me in that condition jarvas gave her a happy grin course i can hon little joy never hurt me just makes my reflexes sharper and all he might as well not have been in the room pat biting her lip didnt even look at him i was counting on him she told the air it was the cue dannerman had been waiting for but jimmy lin forestalled him if you need a new bodyguard pat he offered whats the matter with your cousin hes handy enough with his fists you tell me danny for a bodyguard pat adcock stared at him then at dannerman i guess youre big enough she said thoughtfully what kind of gun do you carry twentyshot spray with quickchange clips same as always are you sure you know how to use it oh right you were rotsy in college werent you protsy actually she sighed and made up her mind i dont really have much of a choice do i all right dandan i guess youre about due for a promotion how would you like be an astronaut for a while not much work got done in the observatory that afternoon either at least not by pat adcock and her spacefarers as soon as theyd sent jarvas sniveling back to his home in the company of one of the larger postdocs pat declared herself through for the day take me home dan ive got to pack you better take an overnight bag too sure thing pat im new at this though what sort of stuff do you pack to go into space how do i know ive never done it before either i guess theyll give us all the space stuff we need at the cape but well be gone five days according to the mission plan so take whatever personal things you think youll need and oh yes dont forget your gun youre expecting trouble she didnt answer just dont forget i want you back at six am to get us to the airport six oclock dannerman thought dismally on the ride up to pats yorktown condo that meant getting up not much after four it was a long way from ritas riverside drive place to yorktown but at least he could make it an early night as soon as he had reported his success to colonel hilda morrisey he went looking for his landlady im taking your advice and getting out of town for a while rita he told her hey great where are you going florida he said and stopped her lecture on how nasty the floridians were since they got their own government by taking out his payment machine im not sure how long ill be gone so id better pay a week or so in advance i dont want you throwing my stuff out into the street oh dan i wouldnt do that she protested not even if you were away for even a month it wont be that long he assured her im sure of that chapter nine dan the captains voice woke dannerman as the plane was making its approach to the jose marti airport outside the cape he hadnt intended to sleep he hadnt realized he actually was sleeping until he woke up saw the red light on the seat back before him to show that the airbag had just been armed and saw pat adcock stirring beside him look there she said yawning as she gazed out the window thats our clipper there it was gleaming ceramic white forty meters tall with work trucks and people busy around it so it wasnt a dream it was real that was the ship that was going to lift dannerman and the others right off the solid planet they had been born to and all those childish fantasies would become fact are you scared his cousin asked him giving him a searching look oh no well not really scared are you certainly not she said going into space isnt what worries me uncle cubby brainwashed me pretty well you know it was his dream only he never could pass the physical to make it on his own and i guess he infected me thats not whats bothering me he looked at her with new interest but something else is well yes she squirmed around to look back at jimmy lin and rosaleen artzybachova in their own seats a few rows back for one thing i dont know if i can trust lin she said moodily as she straightened again delasquez either thats why i want you along dan keep an eye on those guys while were up there but theyre the pilots you picked he said reasonably she shrugged i had to take what i could get just be careful about them okay she peered up and down the length of the plane do you suppose its too late to go to the can she asked it was the stews were cruising the aisle checking seat belts and picking up empty glasses he said consolingly well be on the ground in a moment yes and then what he said surprised then therell be a chance to get to the ladies room right away she gave him a pursedlips look thats right youve never been in florida before have you he hadnt understood what pat had meant by that but as soon as they were off the plane it became clear the passengers were not permitted to step off the plane and go freely about their business the passengers were immediately herded into long lines for customs inspection well it wasnt called customs exactly since florida wasnt really an exactly independent country however determinedly they insisted on their own laws and practices the processing was justis thorough though and the first step was that one of the agents collected everybodys carry weapons dannerman hated to give up his twentyshot but all the more seasoned florida travelers seemed to take it as a matter of course the agent tagged each gun and gave the owner a claim checkso you can redeem it senor when you leave our beautiful free state then another set of agents searched methodically through everyones bags and pockets for a moment dannerman thought they might even insist on a bodycavity search as well but it didnt come to that it was bad enough though the inspector gasped in outrage when she patted him down and found his ankle weapon she held the gun in her hand and gave him a severe look this is contraband weapon she announced it is conceal this is not permit in the free state of florida it must be confiscate she beckoned to a state policeman who patted his own gun to make sure it hadnt fallen out of its holster as he strolled toward them the cop waved all four of the party over to a little quarantine ghetto while the customs agent and her supervisor debated the matter in spanish pat was irate rosaleen artzybachova waited patiently for a resolution to the problem jimmy lin showed amusement danny danny he said reproachfully dont you know any better than that when you go to florida you leave your own gun at home nobody brings a gun to florida you dont need it you can always pick up another on the streettheres not a block in the state where you cant buy anything you want dannerman didnt answer he did know better he just hadnt wanted to part with his service special its all right pat announced waving in relief to a tall man who had appeared at the customs desk although he was wearing a different uniform this time gleaming dress whites with clusters of ribbons at his chest dannerman recognized general martin delasquez he spoke rapidly to the customs agents then approached them looking grave what a pity dr adcock he said to pat ignoring dannerman your man has attempted to break our law therefore he is forbidden admission to our state however i believe that we can avoid the legal penalties i have arranged that he will be placed on the first return flight to new york and the rest of you may proceed to the staging area oh no pat adcock exclaimed i want him with me delasquez shook his head politely but it is impossible you see he said reasonably maybe not dannerman said he had been watching delasquez carefully the general looked at him for the first time you spoke he asked his tone frosty yes i did general you know what i bet i bet you have enough authority to get us all through these bureaucrats dont you general delasquez said coldly it is apparent that you do not understand the gravity of your situation i bet i do for instance i bet i know what would happen next i bet while i was waiting for the next plane the cops would ask me a lot of questions i wouldnt want to lie to them either and if the subject of our first meeting came up id have to tell them anything they wanted to knowyou know like the articles i delivered to you in new york delasquez did not respond for a moment he studied dannerman in silence then turned to pat adcock who is this man he demanded she shrugged hes my cousin and do you know what trouble this could cause she didnt answer only shrugged again then delasquez smiled well what harm can it do it is only a technical violation after all i think i can persuade the authorities to let you pass and get our guns back for us too please dannerman added chapter ten dan the flight started tamely the takeoff thrust was not much worse than some of the highspeed scramjets dannerman had taken to cross an ocean but the clipper was still being an airplane then he hardly noticed when the takeoff jets switched over to the higherspeed contoured flow but then the time came when the scram cut over to rocket thrust and he noticed that all right that was real acceleration he was squashed into his seat for four long minutes his belly sagged his head drooped he realized for the first time that even his eyeballs had weight on their sockets then he fell forward against his chest straps as the thrust cut he was suddenly weightless and they were on their way it was about then that dannerman realized that space travel took a long time to happen and that while it was happening there was nothing much to do what he wanted to do was to get out of his seat and roam around the clipper but he had been warned against that he quickly saw why every course correction brought another jolt not nearly as violent as the first but unpredictable for either time or direction then the gimbaled seats tilted the motors roared and you were lucky if you didnt bite your tongue or bash your head a window at least would have been nice he didnt have one all he had was the tiny tv screen on his armrest but all it showed was black empty space by his side rosaleen artzybachova sat with her eyes placidly closed maybe even napping well spaceflight was nothing new to her she could not have been comfortable her feet rested on a pair of gray metal boxes lashed to the seat supports and so her knees were squeezed almost into her belly just ahead but out of his sight pat was in the thirdpilot seat trying to talk to delasquez and lin at the controls dannerman couldnt make out the words and if the pilots answered he couldnt hear in the seat next to him artzybachova opened her eyes and gazed at him are you all right when he nodded she asked politely and how are you enjoying spaceflight is it what you expected well no not exactly i thought wed have to go through more training she laughed like highg conditioning in those awful old centrifuges drills for emergency actions thank heaven we dont do that anymore we dont wear spacesuits either i noticed that what dannerman himself had on was the slacks and jacket he had put on that morning dr artzybachova and jimmy lin were wearing onepiece coveralls general delasquez the combat fatigues of the florida air guard dr artzybachova was still being grandmotherly are you hungry i brought some apples and i believe there are other things on board hungry no and you dont have to pee or anything you shouldve gone before we took off i dont he said shortly but she had put the idea in his mind he quelled it for there was an opportunity here to be taken dr artzybachova can i ask you something is there something well peculiar about what were doing she gave him an amused look pale eyebrows raised define peculiar he chose his words with care this is supposed to be a simple repair mission right but there are all these rumors what kind of rumors he spread his hands something about some kind of radiation from starlab that wasnt supposed to be there i dont understand that very well dr artzybachova i was an english major and something about those messages with the seven ugly space dwarfs you are very skilled at listening to rumors mr dannerman it wasnt a compliment he pressed on i get the idea that thats really what this mission is about something alien on starlab something that might be worth a lot of money pat wouldnt talk to me about it that is not surprising the old lady observed i guess not will you dr artzybachova studied his face for a moment considering while the clipper rolled itself into a new position i suppose it could do no harm now in a little while you will see what we all seewhatever that turns out to be or it will turn out that there is nothing worth seeing and then we will simply try to determine what repairs might make starlab function as originally designed again so she said sighing yes the rumors are true fifteen months ago your cousins observatory detected a burst of synchrotron radiation from starlab no one else appeared to observe it but then no one else was actively trying to reestablish communications with the orbiter so she called me at my dacha i flew at once to new york we examined all the logs of instrumentation changes and no there simply was nothing on starlab that could have produced that emission so we performed a data check dannerman pricked up his ears this was new what kind of data check a fortunate coincidence the japanese were getting ready to replace one of their old weather satellites so they did a census of everything in orbitto select a safe slot for their satellite you see one of their instrument people was a former student of mine from her i got all their obs of astronomical satellites including starlab when we massaged the data it became clear that there was a steady flux of very lowlevel radiation coming from it in several bandsnone of it compatible with the presumed deadboard status of the satellite in addition optically there was a blister on the side of the satellite that didnt belong there finally just recently we got another indication there was a cometlike object yes i know about the cometlike object she regarded him thoughtfully yes i suppose you do and what all this adds up to oh mr dannerman she said sounding less patient i have no doubt that you know that too all the evidence taken together there is strong reason to believe that something extraterrestrial has established itself on starlab an alien she looked pensive probably not a living one no at least i hope not more likely some sort of automated probe but definitely some sort of technology that is not terrestrial in origin a quick course correction spun their chairs around the old lady grimaced and closed her eyes evidently she had finished her story but dannerman hadnt finished thinking about it it sounded wholly preposterous but this apparently sane woman seemed to give it credence he cleared his throat dr artzybachova and when she opened her eyes again i can see that new technology might be worth a lot of money but what do you do with it when we find it if we find it but that i cannot say until we see it of course that is what i am along for me and my instruments she tapped one of the boxes with a toe i was wondering about them he said she smiled of course did you think i could examine what we findwhatever we findby smell perhaps although it may be that none of these instruments will be of any use since we have no data on what might be there but you must have some idea she raised her hand amiably but mr dannermandan may i and please call me rosaleen it was a notion of my mothers when i was born she was much taken with the wife of your american president and gave me a name as close to hers as she dared she paused then finished her thought but dan i really dont know what will be on starlab you see i only have hopes i hope that there will be some usefullooking devices which i can remove and bring back for analysis do you know the term reverse engineering for that so that perhaps they can be copied in some way will that happen i dont know will there be anything alien in starlab at all i dont know even that much either it is all hopes it is quite possible that even if there is something there it will be so unfamiliar that i will not dare to try to remove it or there may be nothing at all in either case we will have done all this for nothing he looked at her seems like a pretty long shot the way you describe it ah she said softly but think of the payoff if we win our bet there will be unimaginable benefits and not just in money i would not have left my comfortable summer place in ukraine just for the money only for the chance to learn she looked pensive for a moment then smiled whatever it is well find out for sure when we get aboard now dan if youll excuse me we should be coming around toward north america again and id like to check the uplinks for news dannerman must have drifted off to sleep again in spite of everything because the next thing he remembered was jimmy lins cheery hail the astronaut was swinging weightlessly toward them hand over hand pausing to float in space upside down by dannerman so how do you like micrograv he asked amiably then glancing at artzybachova and lowering his voice tell you one thing if my greatgreat had ever gone into orbit he wouldve had to write three or four new books you dont know what screwing is until you try it weightless rosaleen turned to him her arms still waving in the graceful flow of tai chi ignoring the astronauts remarks she asked are we getting close to starlab not too far thats why im going to the head now if we have to wear those damn suits i wont want to need to pee i recommend the same to you two soons im through but dont stay out of your seats any longer than you have to okay and sing out when youre both strapped in again the general claims he ranks me so hes doing most of the piloting and he has a heavy hand with the deltavees dannermans bladder was signaling to him with increasing urgency but he didnt get his turn for a while he deferred to rosaleen artzybachova out of politeness and then to general delasquez because he wasnt given much choice when the pilot came back and pushed his way past then to his cousin out of politeness again by then his fidgeting was becoming conspicuous dr artzybachova observing it did her best to distract him have you seen she inquired reaching over to adjust his screen it was displaying something tiny and oddly shaped but when she turned up the magnification it became a satellite with antennae and solar collectors poking out in all directions starlab he ventured that amused her no of course not it is simply a dead old orbiter i think a military one and probably russian but it is interesting is it not oh it was interesting enough as a souvenir of the days when wars were actually fought between nations instead of between legions of police on one side and on the other a horde of criminals and a few squads of slippery terrorists he cast a longing look at the toilet but pat was still locked inside well he said to the ukrainian woman forcing jolliness into his tone was there any interesting news in the uplinks dutifully she rehearsed the principal items for him englands mi had caught a dozen welsh freedom fighters redhanded in possession of nuclear materials some sikhs at the marseilles airport had machinegunned moslem pilgrims en route to mecca and in washington the president had finally announced the death of his kidnapped press secretary hilda would be going crazy he thought but he didnt think it long the door to the toilet was opening and he was already unbuckling himself to go there pat was looking baffled when she finally came out and when dannerman got his chance at the toilet he saw why the writing on the cubicle wall wasnt graffiti it was instructions a complete tech manual to the use of a micrograv toilet and it took a bit of doing as he was finishing up with the complex flush maneuver he heard squawking from outside he hurried back to his seat rosaleen waving him on and there spinning slowly on the screen was an orbiter that he recognized because he had spent so much time studying its pictures there was no doubt about it just disappearing from view between the solarcollector struts and a communications dish was the blister that might or might not have come from outer space the construction was immense so thats starlab he said of course it is rosaleen said fretfully and look the optical mirror has been left uncovered all this timewho knows how much damage its taken from microjunk impacts theres a little ship attached to the side dannerman observed yes the acrvthe assured crew rescue vehicle it was supposed to take crew back to the earth in an emergency but poor manny lefrik never got a chance to use it manny lefrik memory clicked the name into place the astronomer who had died on starlab did you know him she sighed of course i knew him very well in fact and on this very satellite jimmy was quite right about making love in microgravity and then noting the expression on his face oh dan can you not believe that i was not always a million years old but buckle yourself in quickly there will be much maneuvering now hurry she was right about the maneuvering docking was tricky with a lot of swearing in three languages from the pilots up ahead as they jockeyed the spacecraft to its port but then there was a faint metallic crunch and a shudder and a cry of satisfaction from pat adcock the clipper had mated with starlab beside him rosaleen artzybachova was busily removing the containment straps from her instrument cases let me help you dannerman offered she hesitated yes perhaps it would be better if you took one but do be careful with it stay put you people delasquez called from up front were checking the life support but starlabs systems were apparently working even after all these years the internal pressure and temperature were all righta bit chilly maybe jimmy lin suggested but they wouldnt need the suits even the lights were workingsome of them anyway enough then the arguments started pat wanted somebody to stay behind in the clipper preferably one of the pilots for christs sake why jimmy lin snarled just in case just in case screw that nothings going to happen here and anyway dannerman can stay on board if you want him to im going in and he did pat right behind him even encumbered with one of the instrument boxes rosaleen artzybachova squirmed ahead of delasquez who was angrily stuck with going through the shutdown checklist in spite of lins suggestion dannerman was not far behind as he squeezed through the docking port tugging his own massive toolbox he heard rosaleens shocked voicedo your mother everythings all different chapter eleven dan it wasnt what he had expected he hadnt expected starlab to be so warm but it was that was passive heating rosaleen said only sunlight he certainly hadnt expected it to stink but it did a rancid pervasive odor part chemical part almost like cinnamon was it the decaying body of the abandoned astronomer not likely it wasnt really a spoiledmeat smell and besides the mortal remains of the lost manny lefrik must have long since finished all the decay that was possible to him but that was not the greatest shock rosaleen artzybachova had been right it was all different the views of the starlab interior he had studied displayed gray metal cabinets sunshineyellow and warm red walls patterned wall hammocks those things were still here most of them but to them had been added objects that the schematics had never displayed greenflecked lumps of transparent matter like lime jello with glittering sparks of gold and diamond light flickering within it a great coppercolored pillar sixsided that gave out perceptible warmth a huge cupboard sort of thing with a door that slowly swung closed when dannerman tried to peer into itthings for which he had no easy name there had been structural changes too even some of the walls were gone the partitioned space of the original had been opened up and here and there all about stuck at crazy angles from the remaining walls were the machines that were like nothing dannerman had ever seen before the more he looked the stranger they got he saw some that were palely luminous some velvet black they were rounded or jaggededged some with brightly glowing dots on the surface that flickered and changed as he watched some faintly crackling or humming none of them looked normal jesus he said i guess you were right pat thats not any human stuff pats face was glowing in triumph effing well right it isnt dandan its alien and its ours but what do those things do whats the difference my god dan she said happily reaching out to caress the pinkly glowing surface of one of the machines once we get this stuff back and figure out how it workscan you imagine what itll be worth well make a bundle out of this if we can move it rosaleen artzybachova muttered trying to fasten her instrument box to a handhold on the wall while like everyone else she was distractedly staring at everything around her pat i recommend you do not touch anything until i have had a chance to study it the rest of you too pat pulled her hand back beside her jimmy lin was doing the same thing whats the problem he asked how do i know what problem there is perhaps there is no problem at all or perhaps if you touch it it will fry you to a crisp if you want to experiment i suppose it is your right but i would prefer that you help me me too dannerman asked trying to keep his own instrument box from bumping into anything in the micrograv environment it weighed nothing but its mass made it hard to handle oh dan rosaleen sighed what help could you be at least the others have some experience with instrumentation no go and explore ill go with him pat said suddenly you also want to be a tourist and general delasquez is that what you are indicating too with that scowl well why not if there are too many unskilled helpers here it will be worse than none at all so go look for old mannys body perhaps we can give it a decent burial in space while we are here and maybe get rid of some of the stench martin delasquez growled the old woman ignored him or perhaps you will meet some interesting stranger and then you will come back and tell us if you can a few meters down the main transverse pat stopped and consulted a scrap of paper from her pocket the general gave her a suspicious look but brushed past her to go off on his own let him go pat muttered without looking up maybe hell see something we dont lets see we follow this transverse to the second junction dannerman drew the obvious inference youre looking for something specific she glanced after delasquezs disappearing form and lowered her voice right you are dandan i want to see where that blister was attached from the inside come on i think i know where im going the way you got around in the effectively gravitationless starlab was by pulling yourself along by the handholds spaced along the walls or by hurling yourself like a slowmoving projectile from point to point neither dannerman nor pat was up to projectile standards so progress was slow they didnt speak pat was concentrating on the chart in her hand dannerman thinking about the implications of rosaleens final remark if artifacts had been added to starlab as they had someone had to have put them there and it was at least a reasonable possibility that that someone was still there dannerman kept his eyes peeled as they drifted along the passages ears too but there wasnt much to hear even the chatter between rosaleen and jimmy lin became inaudible after the first few turns apart from the cryptic noises that came from the alien machines the only sounds dannerman heard came from pat and himself when starlabs designers planned the satellite they allowed for weeks or months of occupancy by its observers that meant they had to make arrangements for living quarters so they did but they were not lavish the residents werent given rooms what they haddannerman perceived as he pulled himself through the squaresided passages of the observatorywas no more than coffinlike cubicles the things were doorless though fitted with stiff fabric panels to provide at least the illusion of privacy and they were smallsmaller than any broom closet dannerman had ever seen and not much more elaborate there was more of starlab than he had expected for pat too it seemedwhen twice she paused to look uncertainly around and when once she had to retrace her steps for half a dozen meters dannerman assumed she was lost and the way she muttered to herself made that assumption plausible but it ought ought to be right here she murmured touching a bare spot on the corridor wall and then hell it isl is what dannerman asked but only silently he didnt have to say it out loud because pat was already demonstrating the answer her fingers traced the lines that made up a hexagonal shape on the wall the lines were new bright metal they cut a patch out here then they entered then they welded it up again who they dannerman asked she gave him a look of mild surprise the people who brought this new stuff aboard of course then where they there was less surprise this time but more visible worry yes thats the question all right isnt it probably there wasnt a living they at all dan just some robot probe machinery dannerman made a neutral sound in his view the word robot did not exclude some meantempered clanking thing that could be quite as unpleasant to meet as any of the seven ugly space dwarfs one thing though he said what if all the machinery weve seen came on the thing that looks like a blisterprobably from the clo i guesshow did it all fit pat opened her mouth to answer and then closed it again obviously it was a hard question the amount of unfamiliar gadgetry in starlab could easily have filled a dozen objects the size of the blister some of them were far too large to have been squeezed through the space traced on the wall as well i dont know she said at last maybe but whatever the maybe was going to be dannerman never heard it she stopped in midsentence turning toward a sound that came from one of the corridor openings and so did dannerman his hand on his twentyshot what appeared in the corridor wasnt an alien it was general martin delasquezwho also had his hand on his gun and a look of alarm on his face his expression cleared oh its only you he said i thought it might be whatevers been eating the corpse the corpse dannerman repeated the dead astronomer manny something i found his body well thats not so surprising we knew that he died here so his body had to be somewhere around sure you did but did you also know that his head was missing rats rosaleen artzybachova informed them a headless corpse of course it is rats they go wherever human beings go it is not surprising that some managed to get aboard starlab somewhere along the line or that they would mutilate a corpse and then disappear jimmy lin suggested sardonically and then die of starvation she corrected him or of plague or whatever or possibly they have not disappeared at all but are still aboard rats are excellent at avoiding attention but pat began unconvinced but rosaleen overrode her in any case they are not our problem our problem is merely to detach some of these artifacts and stow them on the clipper pat nibbled her lower lip in silence martin delasquez looking at the single cobaltcolored metal lever that rosaleen had so far detached said you arent doing very well at that are you rosaleen artzybachova swung around to confront him you have some criticism would you like to do this yourself no that does not surprise me it is much easier for someone like you to complain than to try to understand how these things are interconnected or what will happen if we separate them but someone like me delasquez said does not claim to be an expert on instrumentation you do do you not isnt that why you are here im earning my way rosaleen said grimly and im not getting paid for my services twice delasquez looked insulted are you referring to the gems i was given but those were not for me they were to make it possible to get clearance on such short notice for this flight the quarrel distracted pat adcock from her thoughts of corpseeating creatures oh hell she said what are you fighting about theres plenty to go around just as we agreed jimmy lin cleared his throat i think not he said politely you know what i think pat i think were going to have to refigure all that the hell with that she said sharply we made a deal and were sticking to it remember starlabs my satellite well the observatorys she qualified but as far as youre concerned thats the same thing starlab was built and launched with my uncles money so its private property mine lin gave her a long bland look then he shruggednot in the manner of someone who is convinced only in the manner of someone who has decided not to pursue the question for the moment however dannerman decided as he watched the squabble lin was not going to put it off forever then there was general delasquez silently listening he was another who was presumably looking forward to renegotiating their arrangements pat adcock was taking charge right then rosaleen what do you think how long will it take you to get this stuff detached first i have to figure out what it is pat well damn it do it the old lady pursed her lips i kind of agree with jimmy she said why dont we talk about how were going to split it up rosaleen not you too pat bit her lip then surrendered all right we can settle this after we land what we have to do now is pick out the likeliest items and shift them to the clipper when we land in california ive got a crew rosaleen interrupted her sharply california pat said apologetically im sorry i didnt tell you before rosie we couldnt go back to the cape though could we the vultures would be waiting to snatch it all away anyway its all arranged ive got a crew and a chopper waiting in california well offload as fast as we can and get the stuff to a safe place and then were not landing in california general delasquez said damn it martin you agreed i have reconsidered the question we will return to the cape dannerman sighed softly because he knew what was coming the four of them were regarding each other like stray tomcats paying no attention at all to him pat gave the general a sour look dont be foolish the arrangements are all made she said crossly delasquez shook his head no i have also made arrangements the state of florida can make good use of this technology we have suffered under yanqui tyranny long enough with this we can have full independence at last with the gun in his hand dannerman spoke up and a little something extra for you personally martin he inquired politely that was when it all got rough delasquez fumbled for his own gun tangled in the incongruous giltleather holster jimmy lin was also reaching for something no doubt a weapon of his own but he didnt get very far rosaleen was perched just behind him still holding the rod of blue metal she didnt stop to speak but swung it and caught lin on the side of the head oh no you must not said a new voice dannerman barely registered the fact that the voice was unfamiliar he had delasquez in the sights of his twentyshot then there was something like a flasha tinglea sudden sense of falling and the weapon never did get fired chapter twelve dan a while laterhe had no idea quite how long it had been dannerman blinked and opened his eyes the other four were stirring around him and they all looked bewildered they were in the clipper though dannerman didnt remember going there he had a recollection of his gun being in his hand though he wasnt sure why he glanced hastily around in case it was floating in the nearby air it wasnt he observed general delasquez looking around in the same befuddled way and beyond him jimmy lin looking perturbed as he rubbed the side of his head what the hell happened he asked rosaleen artzybachova said shakily i think i must have had a touch of microg vertigo it looked to dannerman as though they all had everyone seemed dazed and pat was weeping softly all for nothing she whimpered hell jimmy lin said pensively bad enough there wasnt any of that alien technology even starlabs own equipment is ruined ruined rosaleen artzybachova echoed she sounded more than dazed dannerman thought in fact really ill it was her age most likely he decided but she kept on doggedly with the litany of loss electronics fused power supply ruinedthere mustve been a plasma arc a big one theres nothing left worth salvaging might as well start back we cant do any good here dannerman was scratching the back of his neckas for some reason so were the othersas he was peering into the pilots screen at starlabs hull he pointed at the bulge that had no business being there i really thought that was going to be something interesting he said just some kind of sticky space glop i guess jimmy lin said all right get strapped in were ready to undock despondently the five of them took their places ready for the long return flight to earth chapter thirteen dan and at the same time but a very long way away dannerman blinked and opened his eyes and squawked in unbelieving outrage in a place he had never seen before he was being held firmly by two people in halloween trickortreat dressbig ones with a froth of white concealing their faces and an astonishing number of armswhile a smaller one in a different costume was interestedly but inexpertly undoing the flaps of his clothing to undress him shouting around him made him look about all four of his companions were similarly held and two of them jimmy lin and pat were already naked he bellowed what the hell happened he wasnt asking anyone in particular but the goblin who was taking his clothes off gave him an answersort of an answer it seemed to have the body of a large chicken it gazed up at him out of mournful huge kittens eyes and worked its slack jaw for a moment and then it spoke do not struggle the handlers may damage you and pat adcock cried half laughing my god dan its dopey chapter fourteen pat yes the chicken with the cats face did look like the dopey the transmission from space had warned against and the pale bearded giant that never spoke was likely enough the doc and that was a subject for wonder but pat had other things on her mind pat adcock had had fondly held hopes blighted before never like this she had been so close after all those interminable exhausting weeks of court battles and conspiracy there had been that one great exultant moment when it looked as though all her dreams were paying off and then bam reality hit her right between the eyes and these bizarre creatures from a nightmare had snatched all the triumphs away but it wasnt a nightmare even that consolation was denied her improbable as it was the dopey was real the whiskered doc was real the space aliens truly did exist and they had taken pat adcock prisoner it was almost more than she could take inthe astonishment the incredible strangeness of it allbut the wonder was diluted by fear and diluted again by discomforts of several kinds including her increasingly urgent need to go to the bathroom it was all more than she could handle because nothing like this captivity had ever happened to pat before she had never been in jail she had never in her life been restrained against her will in any way at all unless you counted the times her nanny had made her sit in a corner for some fiveyearolds wickedness she wasnt prepared for it and she didnt like it at all she didnt like the sixsided chamber that was their prison like a scaledup honeycomb cell the size of a backyard swimming pool or the bright mirrored surfaces that reflected their own naked bodies whichever way they looked she didnt like being naked for that matterat least not under these circumstances pat was not a prude about her body but she had always been selective about whom she displayed it to she especially didnt like the fact that there were no private spaces inside the cell not even a toilet about that she was indeed quite prudish she was not the only one suffering from affronted modesty that dedicated sexual athlete jimmy pengtsu lin sat with his back against a wall his bloodied head down in shame hugging his knees to his chest to conceal as much of his privacy as possible dannerman and the general were less obvious in their discomfort though the general she saw had a lot to be discomforted about lacking the builtin corsets of his uniform his body sagged and bulged in unexpected ways both men she observed did their best to turn away from whomever they were talking to only rosaleen artzybachova seemed unaffected very likely pat thought with interest because she stripped down pretty well for a woman of that age all that exercise appeared to have paid off pat resolved to try a bit more of it for herself when she was back in her real life if she ever was there did not seem to be a very high probability of that they were well and truly captured all five of them they were all responding in the same way too all five of themwell all but jimmy lin who was fully occupied in nursing his bashed head and his embarrassed nudityhad immediately begun to check the mirrored wall centimeter by centimeter looking for a doorway perhaps or at least some sort of gap there wasnt any i guess were stuck here dannerman said at last and no one disagreed all they could do was ask each other unanswerable questions and complainpissing and moaning was the term dannerman had used it wasnt a good choice of words pat was uncomfortably aware that they had so far really done only the moaning part from all the questions a few facts were established early they certainly were not on starlab anymore because gravity pressed them down as it had on earth they almost certainly were not on their own earth either because of that same gravity it was rosaleen artzybachova who noticed it first but then they all agreed they seemed to weigh a little less pressed a little less heavily on the soles of their feet when they stood perhaps could even jump just a bit higher than they had for all their previous lives also rosaleen went on you will notice that we are breathing quite normally pat frowned yes which means that the atmosphere here contains approximately an earthnormal partial pressure of oxygen i imagine the rest is probably nitrogen some inert gas at any rate and not helium or carbon dioxide because we would know it if so from the effects on our voices or our alertness all the other inert gases are comparatively rare so i believe she said thoughtfully that it must be nitrogen she reflected for a moment then added the temperature is a bit warmmore like north africa than new york i would saybut still in a livable range jimmy lin looked up at her to make a face so dr artzybachova put it all together and tell us what we need to know where are we not on earth of course she said at once perhaps we are on a planet i am not sure of that but in any case not a planet of our own solar systemtoo much gravity for mars or mercury not enough for any of the gas giants and of course not on venus because the heat would have killed us at once there are other possibilities perhaps we could be on a spaceship undergoing constant acceleration but i doubt that alsoi believe we would hear the rockets if they use rockets dannerman offered a good point rosaleen agreed but i think i do hear something perhaps motors somewhere it doesnt sound like rocket engines so we come back to the one clear fact we are not on earth of course that question was not seriously asked in the first place they didnt really need much proof that they werent on earth because the proof was right before their eyes nothing on earth was like their cell and nothing on earth looked like the creatures who had disrobed them here there was argument about that too what were the creatures were they really the seven ugly dwarfs from the space message rosaleen polled the group jimmy lin had no opinion on that partly because he was distancing himself from the others with his embarrassment and his sore head and mostly because he said he had spent much of his recent time in a place where they did not pay a great deal of attention to such cartoons namely at the jiuquan space center in the peoples republic of china martin delasquez didnt think their captors really resembled the figures from space either but there was no doubt in pats mind at all it was simply statistically unlikely she was sure that two unrelated sets of such bizarre creatures could turn up at once she noticed that dannerman took little part in the discussion he was restlessly checking the cell out not saying much until abruptly he announced im hungry so pat realized once he mentioned it was she and wanting other creature comforts too and i wish i had something to drink she said wistfully thinking of the silver decanter of icewater always on her desk rosaleen said im sure we all feel the same way but the less fluid you take in the less you will have to discharge which we all must do she looked around at the others almost smiling we do not have a choice you know shall i be the first she paused for a moment but no one answered no one had a useful answer to give very well she said and walked purposefully over to one wall where she squatted down without further remark oh hell pat said unhappily hey guys at least you could all turn your backs jimmy lin raised his head long enough to laugh sourly glancing at the mirrored walls dannerman paid no attentionvery conspicuously and politely paid no attention he redoubled his study of the mirror wall but by the sense of touch only his eyes half closed against any impolite reflection martin stood by him watching theres nothing to see in the wall the general pointed out nothing i can find so far anyway dannerman said obstinately but those goddam bugeyed monsters walked right through it so there has to be something rosaleen finished her task matteroffactly and stood up that wasnt the wall where they came in anyway they came through the one next to it where pats standing which started another argument even more pointless which wall how could you possibly tell which wall anyway when they all were identical there was no mark of any kind on any of them not even a seam where two panels joined pat ran her fingers wonderingly over the smooth warm surface herself it looked as though it should be glasshard it wasnt as she pressed her fingers against it the tips actually entered the wall faintly dimpling it as they might a surface of modeling clay but they penetrated no more than perhaps a millimeter or so she tried harder finally pressing with all her weight no good she could get fingernaildeep into the surface and no farther and she could find no sign at all that it had ever opened up to let the extraterrestrials through if she hadnt seen the creatures walk right through it she would not have believed it possible jimmy looked up unhappily tell me something suppose you did find a way to get through that thing even got all the way out of here he said i dont think you ever will but what if you did what would you do then then dannerman said id figure out what to do next but wed be that much ahead as long as were stuck in here we cant do anything at all jimmy shrugged but said nothing neither did anyone else some truths were too obvious to be argued then but this is interesting rosaleen called from her place at a far wall gazing at the floor what is rosaleen gestured to where she had relieved herself the urine is disappearing look there is only a trace now and it is getting less even jimmy lin got up to see that it was true the tiny pool of pale liquid was dwindling and a moment later it was gone martin delasquez hesitated then stopped to touch the floor where it had been dry he reported he didnt need to they could all see for themselves that there was no trace of urine not even a faint stain on the milkywhite slightly resilient flooring well rosaleen said encouragingly at least we seem to have a sewage system martin scowled at her but still no food and nothing to drink she shrugged and nothing we can do about it either is there meanwhile i am quite tired i think i will try to sleep pat watched incredulous and almost admiring as the old woman lay down on her side curled in the fetal position folded her hands under her cheek and closed her eyes you know pat said i could use some sleep myself we all could dannerman said but one of us ought to stay awake jimmy giggled are you talking about setting sentries to guard against what against i dont know what dannerman said but thats the exact reason why i think one of us should stay up ill take the first turn if you like martin delasquez said heavily yes i agree we should set a guard and yes we might as well sleep since we have nothing better to do perhaps we will think more clearly when we are refreshed so very well let us wait what is that he didnt have to ask they all saw what was happening at the same time a patch of one wall clouded momentarily then bulged into a pair of figures as the dopey and a doc came through the doc was carrying small parcels in several of its arms the dopey gestured and the doc began setting the parcels on the floor as the wall closed seamlessly behind them dannerman wrinkled up his nose thats what i was smelling on starlab he said staring at the doc it was that thing all the captives were standing in a defensive clump now even rosaleen watching warily pat adcock sniffed yes there was a queer odor not entirely unpleasantpart of it like something from a spice rack part something sour and distasteful there was no doubt that it came from the extraterrestrials she stared at them realizing for the first time just how unhuman they were the dopey was not at all human in formtorso like a thanksgiving turkeys but a big one its prissy little feline face at the level of pats chest it wore clothinga sort of pastelmauve muumuuand it carried a kind of muff made of coppery metal mesh after it had signed an order to the doc it put its hands back in the muff before pat could get a good look at its fingers there was something odd about them but she wasnt sure what then as it turned slightly she saw that the muumuu had an opening in the back from which protruded a scaly iridescent spreading tail as colorful as a peacocks pat felt at least a hint of reassurance from the fact that the dopey was wearing a garment clothing implied civilization civilization implied some possible however remote hope that there could be some sort of meeting of the minds between them the one they called the doc on the other hand was almost naked except for a sort of cachesexe over where she supposed it kept its genitals it was also very big more than two meters tall pat guessed at least twice as tall as the dopeyof course the snapshots in the message from space had given no indication of scale and it was not in the least human the word that crossed pats mind was golem the thing stood on short bent legs like the greek version of a satyr but no satyr had ever had six arms two huge thick ones at the top four lesser ones spaced along its torso and all tipped with sharptaloned paws now that she had a better look at the creature she saw that the white beard was not a real beard the strands feathered out more like fern fronds than any kind of animal hair a cluster of the same sort of growth peeped out from the jockstrap garment the dopey worked its slack little mouth for a moment and spoke you stated that you required food these are food i think that took pat by surprise you speak english she said it sounded like an accusation the alien didnt reply stupid question martin reproved her he just did speak english you then will you tell us why we are here you are here the creature said so that you may be learned its voice was shrill and grating as much like the cawing of a parrot as any human speech but the words were clear enough learned what the general demanded the dopey didnt reply for whom no answer for that either and rosaleen tried her luck can you say how we got here the dopey considered not at present perhaps later it said at last pat thought it seemed to be waiting for something but didnt pursue the thought she had other things on her mind food for one thing and she wasnt the only one jimmy lin was rooting around in the sparse collection mints apples corn chipsshe recognized the provenance it was what they had had on their persons in the clipper it wasnt much it was welcome though she selected an apple carefully excavated a bruised spot with a thumbnail then bit into it it was as moist as she had hoped jimmy was less pleased he was muttering dissatisfiedly to himself in chinese then looked up at the dopey and snarled wo zen mo nen chi zhe zhong dong xi the alien didnt miss a beat ni bao li zhi you zhe xie it replied every human jaw dropped at once and pat cried you speak chinese too of course also cubanfloridian spanish and dr artzybachovas galician dialect of ukrainian as well as a number of other human languages this was necessary for my work on your orbiter one moment it turned to the wall almost at once the mirror bulged and admitted a pair of docs carrying a large metal object they set it down and stood waiting the dopey said you now have all you need now you are simply to go about your affairs in the normal way you may breed if you wish that appeared to be all it had to say it turned and left through the wall the docs silently trooping after dannerman sprang to the wall as soon as they were through but as before the wall flowed like mercury around the departing aliens and reformed as solid as ever well dannerman said encouragingly at least now we have something to eat jimmy what was that you and the bem were talking about lin was looking amusedat least an improvement pat thought over his sullen withdrawal of before i was just complaining about the food i didnt expect an answer but then he saidin perfectly good mandarinthat it was all there was among our possessions but what about the other thing he said pat are you ready to start doing the breeding bit she said simply shut up she was watching rosaleen artzybachova who was examining the metal object the docs had carried in it seemed to be a rectangular fauceted tank with pipes dangling from it that led nowhere rosaleen cupped one hand and held it under the faucet when she twisted the lever water came out she sipped it and nodded i think its the portablewater recycler from starlab she reported it appears there is some water in the tank and it tastes all right however i suggest we use it carefully theres nothing here to replenish it in starlab it had a condenser to collect moisture from the air and a still for wastewater from the toilets but as you can see those have been disconnected and left behind and of course we dont even have regular toilets anyway jimmy smirked pat scowled at him but that was not all bad she thought she was not enthusiastic about drinking water that had come from a toilet no matter how meticulously it was treated and distilled but when she said as much dannerman laughed and where do you think that water came from in the first place anyway it looks like theyre going to take care of us maybe the seven ugly dwarfs arent so bad after all but they are still the ones the broadcast warned us against rosaleen reminded him and no one had any answer for that chapter fifteen pat of all the things pat adcock missed the ones she would least have expected were clocks they had none there wasnt any day or night in their cell the white glow came always unvarying from the ceiling she felt time dragging for her with nothing to do but the only clues the prisoners had to measure how much of it was passing were their own internal onesthe number of times they ate some of the scraps the dopey had given them or slept or when the remorseless demands of their metabolisms made it necessary did their best to come somewhere near the impossible wish to urinate and move their bowels in private it was not a kind of existence pat adcock had ever expected for herself not patrice dannerman ely metcalf adcock who had never in her life gone hungry except in the occasional struggle to get rid of a few extra pounds who had from tiniest childhood always lived a life of privileged securitywell reasonable security if you didnt count the natural hazards everyone faced from street violence or random terrorist acts pat was accustomed to being a person of position she was entitled to give orders to nearly two hundred people as the operating head of a reasonably prestigious scientific enterprise she was also used to all the perquisites that went with being more or less rich what pat adcock was used to was being an organism efficiently adapted to the ecological niche she occupied she had all the skills necessary for that life knew how to juggle budgets even in runaway inflation how to discourage a date who wanted more intimacy than she cared to giveand how to motivate one who didnt how to find a clean and comfortable ladies room at need wherever she was how much to tip a headwaiter and when it was best just to give him a smile how to well how to live in the particular world she was designed to live in but not in this new world which seemed to call for skills she didnt have and didnt know how to acquire so nothing in pats previous life had prepared her for the present confinement and privation not to mention the humiliating aspects of their captivity naked weaponless surrounded by the mirrored walls wherever she looked six pats or sixty times six pats looked back at her dwindling as the reflections became more distant they were penned like abandoned dogs in an animal shelter waiting to be adoptedor to be put to death nor did they have any more control than a stray dog over their future they could tell time only by events only in their case the events werent inspections by possible new owners they were occasions like the time when they got the food from starlab and the time when they were at last given back their clothes and the frightening time when they killed the dopey no circumstances were ever so bad that a little human effort couldnt make them worse as their tempers grew short they became quarrelsome pat snapped at martin delasquez for snoring dannerman and rosie artzybachova withdrew from the others each busy at some not discussed thoughts of their own while martin and jimmy lin argued fiercely over whether the lack of blankets to sleep on was worse than the lacks in their limited larder and whether mints apples and corn chips represented a diet they could survive on for pat who was trying to force herself to down one more meal of that sort of trash it was the last straw oh shut up you two for gods sake dan whats the matter with everybody it was a rhetorical question but she could see him making the effort to give her an answer its prisoner neurosis he said you see a lot of it in jails thats why you have so many murders in prisons actually its the policemans best friend because when people are hiding out from the cops after a while they just cant stand each other thats when they do something foolish and get caught jimmy was listening with a half smile you know all about that dont you dannerman he said dan gave him an opaque look its common knowledge psych or dont they teach that in chinese colleges lin met him stare for stare then shrugged actually i got my bachelors at the university of hawaii he said and dropped the subject pat frowned chopping a bruised part out of the apple she had just picked up there was something going on between the two of them but she couldnt guess what jimmy was being his usual irritating self of course but dannermanwell what was dannerman up to exactly he prowled their cell for hours at a time then sat silently seeming to be trying to work something out though she couldnt imagine what rosaleen was talking to her do you notice anything about the apples pat looked at the fruit puzzled well i think thats the second or third ive had with a bruise in the same spot really rosaleen said thoughtfully that i hadnt noticed what i was talking about was how many are there i never packed that many and actually i only had one package of corn chips pat said i dont understand are they raiding a supermarket somewhere if they are they could give us a little more variety martin said sourly dannerman speculated maybe they figure thats all we need since that was all they found on us or maybe they have some way of multiplying the food you know loaves and fishes rosaleen said but they could find something better to multiply theres stored food in starlab if dopey she hesitated before she said it but they did need a name for the creature if dopey can bring the potable water still from the orbiter he can bring us some of the food too or jimmy lin said he could bring us a bed maybe one of those fourposters with curtains that come down so we could get on with that breeding he was talking about pat gave him a freezing look it was nice that jimmy seemed to be coming out of his funk but she didnt want him starting anything that could not be properly finished as a matter of fact the subject had been on her mind from time to time this enforced intimacy was stimulating glands that she didnt really want stimulated just then she thought almost wistfully of exhusband ferdie adcocknot of that son of a bitch of another exhusband jerry metcalf who had been a disappointment in all areas including the bed ferdie on the other hand had been a truly rewarding lover in almost every way a fine choice for a mate if only she had been able to overlook his unfortunate habit of keeping his amatory skills current by constant practiceon two of their maids on the assistant cook on an occasional pickedup professional and most troublesome of all on several of her best friends but ferdie was far in the past and even farther away in space as to the nearer candidateswell she thought simply as a speculation there was no intention to do anything about it of coursethere was general delasquez not counting the flab he was a powerfully proportioned man though too bossy in his disposition to be a really firstrate choice jimmy lin himself yes she admitted to herself under some circumstances the chinanaut might have been a definite possibility even on earth it had once in a while crossed her mind to wonder just how much of the knowhow of jimmy lins greatgreat he might have inherited of course there were problems with jimmy too one of the most annoying of them being the prospect of becoming just one more scalp on his boastfully long list that wasnt necessarily a total disqualification pat adcock was not a jealous woman except with husbands in the case of a casual lover that sort of thing might have been bearableunder normal conditions however under normal conditions they wouldnt be stuck with an audience of three interested onlookers while they got it on which left only onestill purely theoreticalcontender dan actually she conceded to herself watching dannerman move about the enclosure out of the corner of her eye there wasnt really much wrong with her cousin if you overlooked his habit of thinking private thoughts he didnt choose to share with anyone dan wasnt a badlooking man he wasnt a stranger either they had been pretty close at one time and if they hadnt gone off to separate schools the two of them might sooner or later have decided to become a lot closer dan was a definite possibility she thoughtstill purely theoretically of course but under the circumstances she was determined that it had to be theoretical without privacy making love with him or with anyone at all was simply out of the questionat the moment anyway she added to herself and then noticed jimmy lins knowing grin as he watched her covertly eyeing dannerman they kept making small but inexplicable discoveries about their cell rosaleen pointed out a curious thing about the floor it not only soaked up and removed their biological wastes it did the same for trash of all kinds their apple cores for instance throw them on the floor and an hour or so later they were gone yet the floor was selective about what it caused to disappear their food supplies were scattered on the floor for lack of any better place to put them and they were never touched it discriminates the old lady said sounding pleasedwell the cell was after all an interesting machine also we must have used all the water the tank could hold by now but if you notice its not empty somehow the water is being replenished have you noticed that we dont stink very much either jimmy lin put in that was also true pat realized add the open toilet to the fact that bathing was impossible and the air of their cell should have been pretty ripe it wasnt their air was constantly being changed the shadowless light that came from the ceiling was less of a puzzleeven on earth there were such wall installations that glowed in much the same waybut the greater mystery of the walls resisted all explanation talk about making money from alien technology martin said bitterly do you have any idea what that kind of hardware would be worth for prisons let the guards walk in and out but keep the convicts secure rosaleen doing leg lifts with her hands pressed against the wall in lieu of a barre gave him a look it would be worth a great deal for many things far more useful than prisons actually jimmy lin laughed you have something against prisons rosie yes she said now more than ever but always we had enough experience of prisons in ukraine my mothers uncle was taken away to one when he was fourteen years old he didnt come back until he was sixtytwo and dying also my mothers father my grandfather who died there we learned much about prisons in my family from my greatuncle because he had many stories to tell did he have any good advice to give about escaping no about how to survive yes my greatuncle said the important thing was to go on doing what you should be doing if you were freeas much as you possibly can that is some things would naturally be impossible pat made the connection thats why you do your exercises every day rosaleen hesitated that is one reason yes the other reason well that is not important what is important is to keep a sense of purpose in my greatuncles case he constantly continued his education he had been taken right out of school when they arrested him he organized classes with the other prisoners and at night instead of sleeping they taught each other what they knew before he died he could speak french german georgian some english and japanese and even a little bit of hebrew he was pretty nearly in dopeys class as a linguist almost and that wasnt all he could recite poetry for hoursmandelstam okujawa shakespeare petrarchand he knew the names of all the kings of england and france in order and much more but he didnt spend much time thinking about escaping there would have been no point in running away from the camps you see when the whole country was a prison much like our own situation jimmy lin said sourly and no one had anything to say to that when dopey came again the three men were sleeping restlessly on one side of the cage and rosaleen was teaching pat tai chi they were trying to be as quiet as possible but when pat saw one of the wall panels begin to cloud she called out at once by the time dopey was inside the men were getting up blearyeyed but curious you asked for the food from starlab dopey said also blankets so that you may sleep in more comfort the parade of docs that followed him began setting down racks and cases of objects hey said jimmy lin for the first time in their captivity looking almost pleased he began sorting through the new rations even before the docs had set their burdens down and trooped out besides the blankets the starlab ones hemmed with metal rings to keep them from floating away there were scores of food packets of all kinds some were in popopen cans some sealed in plastic freezedried radiated or canned they needed no refrigeration and they came in many varieties pat saw packages labeled omelette and fried tomatoes and any number of vegetables green beans white beans red beans pickled cabbage raw cabbage beets there were soups stews and quiches there were powders that were dehydrated fruit juices or coffee and pat was suddenly aware of just how hungry she was she wasnt the only one martin held up one opaque plastic sack reading the label wonderingly what is hassenpfeffer he demanded and jimmy lin exulted look there must have been some chinese on starlab theres bok choy and rice and i think these other things are dim sum the only one not poring over the larder was dannerman he was gazing at dopey whats the matter dan pat asked but he didnt answer her he said to the alien you heard what we said about the larder on starlab you can hear everything we say in here cant you the creature inclined its mournful head the equivalent pat thought of a nod of course that is my assignment i am tasked to monitor you also to provide you with everything you need so the observation can continue as long as possible pat looked up from the canned ham in her hand you arent doing a very good job of that why dont you give us back our clothes to provide you with what you need dopey said firmly well we need clothes tell him dan she said but dannerman was looking thoughtfully at the alien it was rosaleen who picked up on the question clothing is a definite need for us she declared we are not animals we will be definitely harmed by prolonged exposure also there are items that we carried in our clothing which are essential to our survivalmedications for instance dopey hesitated then did a curious thing he jammed his little paws deep into the coppercolored muff his eyes closed he seemed to be listening to voices unheard by the others then his eyes opened and he declared the clothing will be brought thats more like it jimmy lin said his mouth full of something he had seized from the food supplies how about answering some questions for us too where are we you are in this pen you do not require more information than that well then martin delasquez tried at least tell us what youre monitoring what do you want us to do simply to continue as you are dopey said as though that should have been obvious then as the walls opened and three burdened docs came back in he added sharply do not touch your clothing yet it was not really a necessary order they couldnt have anyway the three docs had formed in a line between the captives and the pile of clothing dopey paid them no further attention but began carefully examining each garment as he finished with one he tossed it past the docs to be claimeda brassiere for rosaleen artzybachova a single sock a pair of mens under shorts claimed by dannerman the underwear came first because pat thought it was the easiest to check out as dopey came to the outer garments he was more thorough investigating pockets running his long tapering fingers over seams to see if anything was concealed inside them he was looking for weapons it seemed he found them too two guns and a bombbugger in dannermans effects a gun and a knife in martins more guns from the others even two little switchblade knives from the garments of rosaleen artzybachova christ pat said we were all ready to fight a war i simply took routine precautions jimmy lin said defensively watching as dopey pulled a sixtyshot sidearm out of his jacket rosaleen spoke up to the dopey thats just a pen please let me have it the dopey didnt respond except to turn the pen over a few times then take it apart evidently he decided it would not make a good stabbing weapon he tossed it over and turned to everyones shoes that took longer he ran his fingers inside each shoe apparently measuring to see if there was enough thickness anywhere to conceal a weapon on one of jimmys shoes he hit pay dirt the heel unscrewed and inside it was a coil of razor wire hell jimmy said and resignedly went back to getting dressed they were all doing it now it was surprising pat thought how much more formidable martin delasquez looked once he had his military camouflage jacket on again gold braid with its embroidered generals stars for pat herself getting dressed again after so long bare was less pleasant than she had imagined the waistband of the slacks was uncomfortably tight the pantyhose unpleasingly constricting and her feet seemed to have swelled because it was an effort to get them into the shoes the three docs abruptly turned as one and left carrying the confiscated weaponry and it was only then that pat realized that while they were dressing dopey had slipped through the wall and was gone damn it dannerman said i was hoping we could ask him some more questions which he probably wouldnt have answered anyway pat said so lets eat the canned ham had been cold and greasy the pita bread pat ate with it dry and leathery but her belly was full eating made a difference being clothed made a difference too pat couldnt help feeling that things were taking a turn for the better maybe only a very small improvement with a very long way still to go but everybody seemed cheerier martin in uniform stood taller than before and what they had received was not merely food and clothing dopey had returned all their pouches and belly bags pat was pleased to get her watch back and her rings less pleased to have the packet of tampons that she always carried in case of emergency it reminded her that her period would be coming along sometime soon and that one pair of tampons would not be adequate to her needs rosaleen held aloft a small bottle my painkillers she said exultantly were you in pain pat asked wonderingly dear girl at my age one is always in pain exercise helps a little but these are betterthough they do not solve the real problem may we not discuss it please i have a suggestion there was something in rosaleens tone that made pat anxious to hear more but she didnt press the point yes let us make an inventory of all our possessions dan since you still have your screen perhaps you can keep the tally her tone made pat curious dopey didnt return yours rosaleen pursed her lips he probably thought it contained a weapon delasquez laughed and of course it did what simply a sharp little blade for emergencies he took mine too for the same reason and left us no weapons at all jimmy lin said something in his tone made pat give him a closer look but when she started to ask him dannerman cut in hold it he commanded of course none of us have any weaponsbut if we didhe glanced meaningfully at the wallwe had probably better not mention them out loud lets get on with the inventory shall we it didnt take long there was rosaleens multicolor pen and a reading glass a collection of key cards and ids from all of them a nail clipper two pocket combs some loose coinsvery few because hardly anyone carried cash that was it most of them had left their more interesting gadgets in the lockers at the cape no weapons there anyway jimmy said ruefully i guess if we put all our coins and stuff in a sock we could make a cosh dannerman gave him a warning look prompting him to add quickly although theres not enough mass there to do any real harm to anybody anyway pat could restrain her curiosity no longer rosie whats this real problem youre talking about rosaleen shrugged i dont suppose theres any need to keep it secret it is simply that there is nothing that can be done about it painkillers are not the only medication i need i have a good many other troublesome conditions they are well controlled by implants but the implants need to be refreshed from time to timebeta blockers polyestrogens most of all the implant that helps to ward off alzheimers i dont suppose any of you have anything like that on you general shaking of heads jimmy lin his mouth full of rice offered i have allergy medicine i dont suppose that would help rosaleen shook her head unsurprised not at all i doubt youll need it either there may be allergens around here but not the ones youve needed it for so she added i have some weeks at least conceivably even some months before the implants wear off then well lets look on the bright side by then we may all be dead anyway chapter sixteen pat what pat adcock discoveredwhat millions of jailed men and women had discovered before herwas that prison reduced life to fundamentals there were no decisions to make or crises to meet the high spot of the day was eating their larder was a mixed bag the fruit juices were good once you mixed them with watershe could have wished for an ice cube or two but they were certainly drinkable without there was even real wine it wasnt very good wine but it came in little plastic cups which could be rinsed out and used for other things no beer though which annoyed jimmy lin and the coffee was a disappointment not only was it at the same temperature as everything else they had but it was the european kind of coffee heavy on chicory and made from beans burned black only martin and rosaleen seemed to enjoy drinking it still things were looking up a little not counting the fact that she was tired of seeing herself reflected in the cells walls no matter where she looked if anything could make her crazy she thought it was those mirrors not counting the fact that jimmy lin had formed the annoying habit of following her around brushing against her in a pretty unmistakable way but at least now she had clothing but none of it was good enough time was passing and it was all wasted time pat adcock had little practice in timewasting she was used to a world in which she always had something to do usually more to do than she had time to do it in work to get done plans to make social obligations to fulfill amusements to seek here she had nothing she even missed the annoying everyday flow of sales messages on her comscreen and the solicitations of street panhandlers pictures from her childhood flashed through her mind the images of pacing polar bears and sullenly squatting gorillas from sunday zoo trips with uncle cubby or her parents the parallels hurt were zoo animals we have nothing to do she complained it doesnt make sense dannerman shook his head no youre wrong there everything makes sense to somebody even this even anything people used to talk about senseless crimes like murdering some eightyyearold guy on welfare to steal his shoes they think it makes no sense to kill somebody for so little but to the guy who did it it made perfect sense he wanted the shoes thank you for the lecture dr dannerman jimmy lin said dannerman said stubbornly im only saying that all this must make some kind of sense to dopey and the others from their point of view all we have to do is figure out what their point of view is it sounds like youre taking their side dannerman martin rumbled oh hell why are people always telling me that im taking the bad guys side what people martin asked puzzled different people he didnt elaborate there was something there he didnt want to discuss pat was sure though she couldnt imagine what anyway he said im just trying to understand whats happening probably they want to know more about us before they reveal themselves pat asked how much do they have to know isnt that why dopey was hanging out in starlab all that time eavesdropping on earth martin said heavily maybe that is not enough for them i am remembering what the old sailingship explorers used to do when they encountered new indigenes they would kidnap a few and take them aboard their ships to look them over your christopher columbus he began and then stopped scowling they all heard it a distant sound almost like a shriek faint and far away what the hell was that he demanded no one answered until rosaleen shrugged if this is a zoo she said we may not be the only animals on exhibit it sounded human to me jimmy said uneasily dannerman said nothing but he was frowning pat thought she knew why the scream had sounded human to her too in fact it had sounded a lot like the voice of dan dannerman the scream didnt come again they listened they tried to be as quiet as possible so that they might hear but there wasnt much to hear dannerman reported that he had heard might have heard a faint hum that could have been distant machinery pat herself thought she caught a whisper of speechof a voice of some kind anyway when she reported it dannerman shook his head i didnt hear anything like that did it sound human how can i tell i thought it sounded as though it were asking for something to her displeasure jimmy lin took that to be a cue he moved closer to her perhaps it was asking for something which i too would like he said one hand casually resting on her shoulder the man was making her uncomfortable she shrugged herself free knock it off lin but why he asked reasonably i am aware that such things are better conducted in privacy i would prefer it so myself but what can we do modesty is pointless here the point she said is that i dont want to make love with you jimmy if youre looking for a comfort woman look somewhere else hey rosaleen said goodnaturedly where do you want him to look exactly ive been out of the comfort business for forty years but what else is there to do jimmy lin asked in a tone of reasonableness it is a perfectly natural thing and also good for you my honored ancestor said it all in his book he said it was unhealthful to go for very long without sex and all my life i have done my best to follow his advice rosaleen said pleasantly if you need to masturbate no one will prevent you if not perhaps you wont mind if we change the subject he glowered at her to what she hesitated before she spoke ive been thinking about those messages from space you see i think most of us took those pictures of aliens as some kind of a joke perhaps some satellite controller with time hanging heavy on his hands very well that was a mistake now we know better about that but what about the rest of the message what rest the original pictures the scarecrow creature crushing the universe at the time of the big crunch what do you suppose that means dannerman said i asked one of the astronomers the same thing he thought it meant that we were being warned against something that was supposed to happen after the universe has finished expanding and fallen back and contracted again at least pat thought they were on a subject she knew something about but she frowned that kind of speculation doesnt make any sense nothing could happen after the big crunch its like wondering what the universe was like before the big bang the answer is there wasnt any that sort of thing isnt science its metaphysics rosaleen shook her head you know more about that than i do pat but even i know that some quite good scientists have speculated about the subject armwaving smoke and mirrors pat said dismissively but perhaps for the aliens it isnt pat shrugged it was true that cosmologists had built any number of pretty speculations about the origins and end of the universeshe had spent many boring hours learning about them in graduate schoolbut they had always seemed idle daydreaming to her martin shared that opinion he said impatiently there is no point in thinking about such things the trouble is simply this we have been kidnapped that is not a speculation it is a fact governments have considered such things an act of war jimmy said fine now if youll just let them know about it at the pentagon im sure theyll have a rescue fleet here right away martin glared at him you are very good at sarcasm lin less good at taking action we should do something rosaleen attempted to defuse the antagonism very well she said since no one else seems interested in trying to interpret the meaning of those messages i agree that martin is right we should do something else what is available to us when we were discussing what people in prison on earth do i am afraid i distracted us with my reminiscences of life in the old soviet union so let us try again is there some action that is possible for us to take jimmy said sourly glancing at dannerman why dont you ask the expert pat frowned what do you mean expert but dannerman seemed unsurprised he was already answering the chinanaut first thing he said if i had any specific ideas i dont think id say them out loud remember dopey hears everything that goes on but if you want general principles i dont see any harm in discussing themjust in the abstract of course of course rosaleen said impatiently well what prisoners do depends on what they want to accomplish if their primary goal is to escape they do things like digging tunnels they hide themselves in bags of waste they get weapons or make them and force a guard to take them outside or they take hostages for the same purpose or they go on a hunger strikeof course that only works if the people on the outside care whether they live or die martin demanded which would you recommend what i would recommend dannerman said is that we dont talk about this any more fine said jimmy lin caustically your advice is that we do nothing then is that why you spooks couldnt even catch the guys who kidnapped the press secretary dannerman opened his mouth angrily then glanced at pat and closed it again he didnt answer he simply turned his back and walked over to survey the food store there was an undertone here that pat couldnt identify she wasnt enjoying it whats going on here jimmy she demanded he jerked a thumb at dannerman ask him hell she said and marched over to dannermans side dan whats jimmy talking about he stood up and popped a cup of wine before he answered how do i know i think you do know why does he call you a spook dannerman shrugged maybe because i was in protsy in collegeyou know the police reserve officers training corps not good enough dan that was a long time ago what about now he took a long pull of the beer before he answered then he sighed all right pat i dont suppose it matters anymore and its the truth i work for the national bureau of investigation it was no more than she had guessed but she felt adrenaline shock flood through her body youre a spy im an agent of the bureau yes i was ordered to find out what was going on with you and starlab dan he looked remorsefulno not remorseful stubborn and sullen well jesus pat what did you expect this was major stuff as soon as the rumors got out the bureau had to find out what you were doing bastard she said scandalized i wouldnt have believed it of you you come to me with a hardluck story about needing a job and all the time youre a goddam spy honestly dan what did i ever do to you are you still pissed off because you didnt get your share of uncle cubbys money it wasnt a personal matter i had orders orders to do what to steal whatever there was on starlab for the damn feds he said uncomfortably well i suppose thats one way you could put it is there some other way so tell me just how far were you prepared to go for the good old bureau dan liquidating me if necessary for instance oh hell no pat what kind of a person do you think i am ive only uh shot two people in my life and i couldnt help that both of them were doing their best to kill me at the time nobody ordered you liquidated and if they had they wouldnt he said stubbornly and that was all he would say when pat curled up on the floor with her face to the wall and her eyes shut tight she didnt go to sleep she wasnt planning to she just wanted to be alone for a bit as alone as you could get in this place the national bureau of investigation everybody knew what that was all about cloakanddagger stuff with all too much emphasis on the dagger now her own cousin turned out to be one of them it wasnt just dan dannerman she told herself feeling abused every last one of her comrades had in some way betrayed her trustdelasquez and jimmy lin trying to hijack the goodies on starlab for another country even rosaleen artzybachova hitting her up for a bigger share of the pie if pat adcock had been a weeping woman she would have allowed herself a few tears of selfpity as she wasnt she simply went to sleep when raised voices woke her nothing had improved she lay with her back to the room unwilling to turn around and join the others while martin and jimmy lin were arguing about the food but it is nothing but party leftovers jimmy lin was complaining its the stuff nobody wants to eat what kind of people would have ordered all this stuff then there was rosaleens voice patiently trying to keep the peace there were astronomers from a dozen different countries on starlab in the early days i imagine each chose the sort of menu they preferred and ate all the good stuff and left the remainders for us then martins voice deeper but equally irritated i am tired of breaking my teeth on bricks of filthy uncooked russian stew rosaleen offered ive told you if you do what i do and soak it for an hour or so it gets softer a little and then it is cold grease she didnt try to deny it try the fruit compote at least ive had enough of the fruit compote jimmy lin said who knows how long this stuff has been in storage anyway pat turned away from the familiar bitch session she had her own feelings about the dehydrated beef stroganoff she found herself thinking wistfully of a friedegg sandwich perhaps with a couple strips of crisp bacon on wholegrain toast or a fresh salad lettuce with the dew still on it perhaps some slices of avocado maybe even a few curls of green pepper there wasnt any help for it she got up and headed for the food ignoring her companions that wasnt hard to do rosaleen had begun quietly exercising off by herself and martin and jimmy had moved away to whisper together over the water tank only dannerman was by the larder and he looked apologetically at her but didnt speak neither did she she was not yet ready to talk to the duplicitous spy dan dannerman ignoring him she took her time studying the available choices reading labels peering at the foods that were visible through glass or plastic none of them looked attractive but there were many she hadnt yet tried she settled on a packet of irradiated chili at least it would not require soaking to be chewable martin had been right cold it was fairly nasty she had turned her back on dannerman as she ate but was not surprised to hear his voice are you still mad she didnt answer because he said ill apologize if you want me to she didnt answer that either and apparently he gave up when she finally peeped around he was over with rosaleen doing his best to learn some of her exercises that was another annoyance for pat it had been on her mind to do the same thing because she could feel herself gaining fat on their preposterously unbalanced diet but how could she do that while he was there the worst part was that it seemed all four of them had decided that pat was in a bad mood and better left alone as long as they were ignoring her how could she effectively shun them she went back to the larder for lack of anything better to do and was glad when while she had almost decided to try some more of the damned fruit compote the patch on the wall suddenly fuzzed and bulged and dopey came in oddly without docs he was pushing ahead of him a thing that looked like a portable toploading washing machine it moved easily on spherical bearings this device is to heat your food as you wish he said if you put things into it they will become hot this is not the device from your starlab however that object was far too primitive to be of any use here they all clustered around while he demonstrated the use of the cooker pat hadnt forgotten that she wasnt speaking to any of the others but put that matter on hold for a while operating the cooker looked simple enough you put things in from the top and left them for a while and in a minute or two they were hot when rosaleen reached to take the container of spaghetti and meatballs out dopey stopped her no be careful you will do yourself harm if you put a part of your body into the device use these he plucked a pair of sticks from under one arm and showed them how to lift the packets out without putting their hands in the cooker rosaleen eagerly popped the packet open and sniffed the steam that was coming out of it i think its actually too hot to eat she said happily it will cool if you wait for a moment dopey informed her in any case this instrument will be useful when you have renewable food supplies in the next phase dannerman was suddenly alert what next phase whats going to happen silence well when will it happen dopey looked evasiveor simply uncertain how could you tell with a kittenfaced chicken that is unclear that sequencing is not my decision to make there are also he hesitated some technical problems which have hampered communications pat asked the question for all of them what technical problems are you talking about dopey turned his large kitten eyes on her then did again the thing with the muff jammed his hands into it gazed vacantly into space for a moment then said there are bad people who would harm our project i may not say more at this time what kind of bad people no answer only that continued stare pat bit her lip the alien was at least answering some questions now but she was running out of the right questions to ask and dopey was volunteering little nor was she getting much help from her fellow prisoners out of the corner of her eye she noticed that delasquez and jimmy lin though they seemed to be listening intently were strolling slowly around behind the alien it crossed her mind that they were up to something not in time by the time she began to guess what that something was and long before she had even begun to decide what if anything to do about it dopey was turning to leave the wall began to cloud preparatory to letting him through he didnt get that far grab him delasquez shouted hurling his weight against the milky place in the wall lin did as orderedthrew himself on the alien who squawked once in astonishment and then was still if delasquez was trying to escape he failed the wall was not deceived he struck against it and was hurled violently back into the cell as the wall turned mirrorbright again against him delasquez didnt walk away he was catapulted backward staggering into the pile of dopey and jimmy lin on the floor he sat down heavily on top of them and gasped dismally mother of god that hurt from beneath him lin breathless and equally dismal begged get off me he struggled to his feet and backed away delasquez at his side the two of them looking apprehensively at the alien dannerman gave them both a hard look but said nothing as he knelt by dopeys side is he breathing martin asked i dont know it didnt feel like it jimmy lin said uneasily maybe he just had the breath knocked out of him martin offered but dannerman looked up and shook his head knocked out of him for good im afraid i dont know much about his anatomy but there isnt much doubt about it hes really dead ever since they had been taken captive there had been no times for pat adcock that she could think of as really good but there had never before been one quite as bad as this she had a pretty good idea of what was done to zoo animals who murdered their keeper was it going to be done to them dannerman was saying well that was stupid and even rosaleen was looking reproachfully at the two jimmy lin shamefaced martin belligerent butcrossing himself pat couldnt be sure the generals right hand was fingering the left shoulderboard of his uniform jacket as he answered it was your suggestion dannerman delasquez said bullshit i never said anything about attacking dopey you spoke of taking hostages well we decided to try it the other part trying to crash out that was my own idea i just thought of it at the last minute obviously it wasnt a real good idea dannerman said taking a hostage wasnt much better that only works if you dont kill the hostage his death was simply an accident how could we know the thing was so delicate in any case its done and we have an opportunity the general reached down to the corpsebut with his left hand pat saw in puzzlement his right hand was still close to his lapel he was trying to pick the coppery metalmesh muff from dopeys slack hands wait dannerman cried warningly but too late as soon as martins hands touched the metal he screamed jolted erect and fell unconscious to the floor damn fool dannerman snarled leaping to his side but ancient rosaleen was there before him her ear pressed to the generals chest no breath no pulse she reported electrical shock i think dan do you know cpr she didnt wait for an answer simply bent her mouth to the generals for artificial respiration dannerman didnt speak either as he dropped to his knees and began pounding a fist rhythmically on martins chest beside pat jimmy lin was muttering to himself but it was pat who caught the first flicker of a reflection in the mirror wall watch out she cried as a pair of the great ungainly docs came lumbering in but the creatures paid no attention to their prisoners if there was any expression on their whitebearded faces pat could not identify it they were strictly businesslike they bent down to dopeys body disentangled his fingers from the coppery muff and bore it away through the wall without a sound leaving the corpse abandoned behind rosaleen had paid no attention continuing to breathe for the general pat watched nervous unsure of what to do she knew what cpr was of course but she had never seen it done before had not expected it to be so violent beside her jimmy lin was glumly watching what do you guess theyll do to us now he asked the room in general no one answered it was a good question pat thought dismally shifting from one foot to another the two docs had shown no punitive intention but then the docs never spoke never seemed to show any independent thought or emotion at all then dannerman sat back on his heels regarding the patient he placed one finger at the base of martins neck and held it for a moment its irregular but its beating he informed rosaleen and then as she lifted her head for a moment martin gasped and coughed and opened his eyes staring wildly about he struggled to sit up but dannerman pushed him back stay put he ordered what what martin tried you got yourself killed martin dannerman informed him lie still for a while i think youll live but dont push it he tested the pulse with a finger again then pat was puzzled to observe dannermans fingers moved to the lapel of martins uniform jacket as though feeling for something when he stood up he looked almost amused but all he said was keep an eye on the walls for me while i see if dopey had anything we can use he walked over to the corpse of the alien and looked down at it the slack mouth was open so were the eyes the peacock tail half erected seemed to have lost some of its scales are you going to search the body pat asked he gazed at her for a moment unless youd rather do it yourself dont worry ive done it before though of course the others were at least human be careful she begged he nodded and knelt beside dopeys corpse the creature had worn only the one garment and though dannerman poked at itdiffidently at first then with more assurance as there was no punishing electrical shockit seemed to have no pockets it did have some sort of decoration things like glassy buttons sewn on it dannerman tugged at them experimentally the dopey had also worn a bangle over the base of its tail and a wristlet of the coppery metal but pat caught only a glimpse of them as dannerman completed his search of the corpse he sat up and shrugged i guess he carried everything he had in that muff he said at least i cant find anything maybe he carried some stuff internally jimmy lin offered good thinking jimmy do you want to give him a bodycavity search because i dont think id like to i wonder why the docs didnt take his body away rosaleen mused squatting beside the semiconscious martin dannerman shrugged maybe theyll come back for it maybe well wish they would because i imagine its going to decay pretty rapidly rosaleen nodded then checked herself staring at the body perhaps not she said look at that pat peered at the dead alien and saw what rosaleen meant something was happening to the corpse the bottom of it where it touched the floor was soaked with a dark brown liquid and pat noticed a sharp nasty smell as of some foul brew cooking on a stove dannerman knelt for a closer look the floors dissolving it away he announced incredulously please dan dont get too close to it pat pleaded dont worry he said dryly although its kind of interesting thats a great waste removal system i bet if i lay down right next to dopey the floor would leave me alonebut no im not going to try it he stood up and looked around hows the patient doing rosaleen was supporting martins head while holding a cup of water to his lips seems to be improving he opened his eyes and looked at me dannerman nodded so the question now he said is what we do when and if somebody takes a dim view of this do we just take our punishment whatever it is or do we try to fight back what have we got to fight with pat demanded he looked at her quizzically whatever we can find he said from her post by the patient rosaleen called i do not think that fighting back would be advisable not now anyway i think youre right dannerman agreed after all if they want to hurt us they wouldnt have to get into handtohand combat they wouldnt even need weapons the easiest thing would be just to leave us here until we run out of food and starve speaking of which he said why dont we see what cooking can do for some of those rations pat stared at him unbelievingly you want to eat now she demanded with this dead body turning into mush right here well he conceded maybe we might as well wait until its gone it seems to be going pretty fast right now anyway indeed it was pat saw as she gazed down on it holding dannermans arm for reassurance more than half of dopey had already turned liquid and been sucked away the smell was still there but no worse than before and actually pat admitted to herself dannerman was right the process was kind of interesting to watch not to mention that it implied a kind of technology she had never before imagined just one more damn thing she murmured to dannerman that would have been worth a fortune if we could have taken it back to earth dannerman looked down at her seeming almost amused tardily she remembered that she wasnt speaking to him she looked away dopeys body was nearly gone one of the little arms sticking up and then collapsing into the general mulch pat frowned something was missing what had happened to the wristlet dan she asked did you notice but he was giving her a scowl and a quick headshake puzzled she opened her mouth to complete her question just as the wall turned milky again they all spun around to face it as another dopey walked in this time not alone two of the golemlike docs followed him and stood silently protective behind him as the dopey glanced incuriously at the almost disappeared remains of his own body and then said in reproach you should not have done that chapter seventeen pat but they killed you pat gasped and yes they did dopey confirmed sounding impatient please one moment it did not seem to be a subject that interested him greatly he turned his great eyes on the two docs who instantly moved forward to pluck martin out of rosaleens hands naturally the general squawked and protested naturally it did no good one of the things picked the general up from behind the two great upper arms holding him the other four restraining his arms and legs the other golem methodically stroked and patted martin all over each touch lingering for a moment and then moving on the whole process took no more than a minute or two then without warning the docs dropped martin sprawling they retreated to stand silent and impassive with their backs to the wall apparently no longer interested in their environment yes dopey said as though one of the docs had reported to himbut pat hadnt heard a sound the examination shows that general delasquez is not seriously injured it will not be necessary to replace him as it was me due to your illadvised action about that jimmy lin said at once swallowing hard you know that was just an accident dont you i mean we didnt want to hurt you dopey gave him a severe look whatever your intentions your action caused the loss of some data which i must restore for this copy please inform me of the nature of our discussion just prior to my death they all looked at him blankly you want to know what we were talking about jimmy ventured yes that is what i said well jimmy said trying to remember actually i dont think it was anything much except rosaleen cut in swiftly with a hard stare at jimmy lin that you were explaining this whole matter of copies to us i was oh yes absolutely pat said picking up her cue is that why you arent angrier about getting killed by those idiots because youre just a copy dopey looked almost offended i do not understand the term just in that context of course i am a copy we are all copies are we not how else could we have been transmitted here from your starlab transmitted rosaleen repeated fumbling in the dark thenwell then that means we didnt come here in a spaceship dopey seemed amused indeed not that is a strange notion dr artzybachova persons do not travel on spaceships that would be impossible for almost any person yourselves included since the transit times would be greater than your life span due to the limitation imposed by the speed of light as an astronomer you at least must know that dr adcock oh right pat said nodding vigorously trying to help the process on thats what you were explaining to us please go on the funny thing was that he did go on pat did her best to keep an expression of pure exultation from her face it was after all the very first time they had been able to trick their captor and that in itself promised at least some hope for the future the other prisoners listened in silence rosaleen concentratedly frowning martin frowning also but probably about something else jimmy lin merely curious and dan dannermanwell something was going on with dan too pat thought because the man seemed abstracted and he appeared to be turning something over and over in his pocket as he listened she postponed the question of dan dannerman because what dopey was saying was certainly fascinating it seemed there was some sort of great search going on all through the universe for intelligent races automated probes had been sent out on the quest in uncounted numbers they traveled slower than light because there was no way for ordinary matter to go faster but then when some sort of civilization was detected a terminal was set up and observers like dopey were transmitted to a listening post and when specimens like themselves were obtained they too were transmitted for further study hold it pat commanded what do you mean transmitted not even photons can exceed light speed dopey said patiently i did not use the word photons the transmissions are carried by a different particle the name of which he hesitated while his fingers moved rapidly in the muff is tachyons in your language oh my god pat breathed remembering her days in graduate school tachyons yes ive heard of tachyons they were whats his name gerald feinbergs theory right particles for which the speed of light was a limiting velocity yes but a lower limiting velocity so that they could travel only faster than light precisely dopey confirmed it is the nature of tachyons that the lower the energy the faster they move the carriers used in this case are quite low in energy and thus have a virtual velocity of he hesitated the long fingers moving inside the muffof somewhat more than one hundred thousand of your lightyears per second pat gasped good god but im pretty sure scientists looked for the things and they were never found indeed dopey said politely perhaps your scientists should have looked harder rosaleen was shaking her head but how could you transmit objects on these carriers not objects the object is analyzed so that a sort ofi believe you would call it a blueprint is made and that is what is transmitted and of course once the blueprint exists copies may be made as desired like you someone said precisely said dopey seeming gratified the class was beginning to understand its lesson such occurrences are quite common in my situation in fact in my time on your orbiter it was necessary to discard and reconstitute me he paused to think for a moment at least twentyfive times you realize i was there for six years four months observing and there is damaging radiation in the environment but said rosaleen reasoning it out if it was that important why have you stopped stopped why do you think the monitoring has stopped there are automatic machines still in place to carry out the assignment of course he seemed to be tiring of the conversation he shoved his paws into the copper muff and his eyes went vacant again and then he said if there are no other questions wait martin said thickly pushing himself up dont go yet i have something else to ask about your ah your purposes in kidnapping us he hesitated glancing at his fellow captive pat instantly thought he looked suspicious a suspicion that was confirmed when delasquez rattled off a couple of highspeed sentences in spanish si ustedes estdn interesados en establecer relaciones nopierdan su tempo con estagente migobierno en florida les ofrecerd mejores condiciones hey jimmy lin yelled none of that talk so we can all understand you martin gave him a frosty look why i was merely asking if they were checking us out as a precaution before proceeding to make contact with the rest of the human race dopey said politely actually that is not an accurate translation general delasquez your precise message was if you are going to want to establish relations dont waste your time with these people my government in florida will give you a better deal however that contains an incorrect assumption as to the purpose of this operation dannerman glared at martin who glared defiantly back but then closed his eyes and went to sleep or pretended to pat thought angrily dannerman turned to dopey then what is the purpose dopey was silent for a long moment i do not think i may discuss that moreover he added sounding sorrowful i believe that you have not been candid with me about our discussions before general delasquez and commander lin leaped on me and crushed me to death that is not fair please do not attempt to deceive me again also he added turning toward the wall but looking over his plume at dannerman please also learn that you must not attempt to steal things which do not belong to you and you do not understand it sounded as though the message was meant for martin delasquezbut then why was he looking at dannerman before pat could ask dopey was gone through the opening wall a moment later the docs followed i guess the conversations over dannerman said wryly pat sighed you know what would be nice it would be nice if he would just once say goodbye when he goes and then she turned to the unfinished business of martin delasquez bastard she said what were you trying to do delasquez would have had a harder time of itpat would have seen to it herselfif he hadnt abruptly pressed his hand to his forehead staggered and sat down pardon he said perhaps i am not entirely recovered in any case i was merely attempting to establish contact in another way in the hope that something could be gained for all of us sure you were jimmy lin sneered pat opened her mouth to tell the general a few more home truths about himself but then closed it again what was the point dannerman seemed to have lost interest in the subject his hands were still turning something over in his pocket and his expression continued to be abstracted for a while the others pressed pat for all she could remember about these tachyons but it wasnt much she had said just about all she retained from those longago courses and after a few minutes rosaleen turned to something more useful she had been experimenting with the cooker dopey had brought and ten minutes later there were heavenly smells of decent meals coming out of the thing the reality was as good as the aroma pat had forgotten how fine a cup of hot irish stew could taste even martin recovered swiftly enough to cook up and devour some sort of friedbanana thing it wasnt until they were all on their seconds that rosaleen cleared her throat patrice she said were there not some studies long ago about how to produce these tachyon things dopey was talking about pat swallowed and thought for a moment studies but the tachyons were never found yes you said that the old lady said patiently but i do recall some speculations on the subject it was while i was studying at the highenergy institute in kiev we were analyzing the instrumentation of the synchrotron and the instructor mentioned purely for our entertainment i am sure that someone had once suggested fasterthanlight particles could be generated with a sufficiently powerful instrument with a synchrotron pat said and then oh that radiation from starlab rosaleen nodded exactly then pat had to explain what they were talking about to martin and jimmy lin who had heard nothing about synchrotron radiation being observed from the orbiter dannerman on the other hand listened for only a moment then said i think ill take a little nap he wasnt the only one martin was losing interest in the discussion he lingered only for a few moments then silently removed himself to a side of the cell and lay down closing his eyes rosaleen yawned a full belly makes a sleepy brain she said do you think one of us should stay awake not me said jimmy lin so pat volunteered it wasnt that she wasnt drowsy herself it was that she had something else on her mind not martins treachery not what dopey had told them astonishing though that was the thing that was preoccupying her thoughts was the delicious fact that at last she had her comb back it was what she had yearned forwell one of the things anywayand while most of the captives had stretched out to nap away their full bellies pat knelt before the mirror wall carefully drawing it through the tangles of her hair that was one good thing about the place she thought you never had to hunt for a mirror the bad thing was what the mirror revealed pat gazed discontentedly at the dark roots on her hair the smudges of unidentified filth on her blouse the circles under her eyes what was even worse was that she was uncomfortably aware that she didnt smell very good either the hoarded drops of perfume from her carryall were running low her little deodorant stick was long goneand in any case the deodorant paste had left her unwelcome thatch of armpit hair sticky and tangled what she needed was a bath she thought longingly of a slow soak in a hot tub with scented bubblebath foam rising high over the steamy water and yes then also a wardrobe of clean clothes to put on afterward even a bar of soap would be fine she thought of all the million little soap chips she had thrown away over her lifetime because they got to be too small to bother with she would have paid a high price for any one of them right now a stirring a few steps away from her attracted her attention it was where dan had settled himself to sleep but he didnt appear to be sleeping he had taken off his jacket to wrap it over his headwell that was a sensible enough thing to do to keep the light outbut she saw that he had one hand up inside the garment right in front of his face and the hand was moving as though he were doing something with it inside the jacket pat informed herself that whatever he was doing it was none of her business picking his nose something equally distasteful and private not to mention that she wasnt really speaking to the man but it went on for a surprisingly long time and curiosity overcame her scruples dan softly so as not to wake the others what are you doing the motion stopped a moment later dans head popped out regarding her its nothing he said well sorry i just thought but he was shaking his head as though to tell her not to pursue the subject baffled she watched as he wrapped the jacket around his hand and stood up he looked as though he were pondering something when she opened her mouth he shook his head at her again then seemed to come to a decision he touched the wall with one hand then raised the other wrapped in the jacket to press against it he held it there for a bit frowning then slowly moved it up and down he seemed to be expecting something whatever it was it didnt happen he shrugged and sighed and then something did happen the wall puckered and opened just where his hand was a moment later a great fist a doc fist taloned and immensepoked through and snatched the garment from his hand shit he said jumping back what pat began but almost at once the wall puckered again the fist reappeared it dropped the jacket on the floor and was gone again dannerman looked angry he picked up the jacket and shook it free the bastards he muttered i guess they saw what i did after all and now theyve taken it away from me chapter eighteen pat pat didnt think she had screamed when that fist poked through the wall but she must havemust have made some sort of noise anyway enough so that a sleeper or two woke and saw something going on then their questions woke the rest it was the wristlet wasnt it she demanded you took it off dopeys body he admitted it with a nod i had one of those glass buttons too he said did you know they glow in the dark under my coat i could see it easily and the bracelet looked like metal but it was soft rubbery it slipped right off when i pulled at it rosaleen was looking at him curiously what did you think you were going to do with them she had wakened totally and quickly as though there were no difference between sleeping and waking for her pat wondered if that was what it was like to be old dannerman shrugged i didnt know it occurred to me that maybe they were a sort of key to the wall so i tried that out didnt work did it jimmy lin growled now youve got them even madder at us that was more than pat could standthis from one of the men who had actually killed the first dopey but surprisingly it was martin who came to dannermans defense you are wrong lin martin said heavily he was quite correct it is the duty of a prisoner of war to try to escape by any means possible he hesitated then added i beg your pardon dannerman you are not as useless as i thought now i think i will go back to sleep the entertainment was obviously over so more slowly jimmy and rosaleen artzybachova followed his example dannerman sat awake leaning against the wall with his eyes half closed after an indecisive moment pat sat down next to him he raised his head to look at her are we friends again he asked hopefully pat considered well she said not active enemies anyway right now im a lot madder at martin than i am at you so is it all right if i say something when she nodded he cleared his throat and added i want to apologize im sorry about lying to you and all will you believe me when say i never wanted to do anything to harm you she thought about that for a moment then shrugged wed have to get into a definition of what harm means wouldnt we well i mean personal harm i admit what i was doing might have kept you from making a lot of money maybe damn straight it might important money money i needed as a matter of fact my second divorce came pretty close to cleaning me out she thought about that mighthavebeen money then relented lets let it drop tell me though howd you get into the spy business in the first place you mean how did a nice guy like me get into a racket like that he grinned it just happened i was in protsy in college i told you that i didnt think it would last past graduation but they called me up into the army not the army he said wearily i keep telling you it was the police reserve officers training corps i guess i was a natural for them with my backgroundwell you know how we grew up golden kids private schools all of uncle cubbys rich powerbroker friends hanging around when we spent our summers at his place so i made a lot of contacts and then when i grew up i had entry into all kinds of places sometimes that was pretty useful for the bureau i suppose she said thoughtfully what the hell were you doing in protsy in the first place easy credits and well yes there was also a girl she laughed out loud a couple of the sleepers stirred and she lowered her voice thats the story of your life isnt it was she the one you brought to uncle cubbys for christmas just before your father died no that was a different one he admitted you had a guy there too was he the one you ran off and married she gave him a sharp look then smiled no actually not even close well maybe neither of us is that much different from jimmy lin just a little less outspoken about it she nestled against him comfortably then remembered to pull away he turned to look into her face whats the matter she said uncomfortably i dont think i smell very good right now so join the club damn it dan i dont want to be in that club id give anything for a bathor at least for a little more water and somebody to chain jimmy lin up while i sponged myself off she paused to smother a yawn hell tell me something dan do you see any way of ever getting out of here he gave her a warning look but only said did you notice how that thing reached right in to where i was standing to grab the stuff meaning theyre watching us she shuddered involuntarily looking about well she hadnt really ever doubted that they were being observed but still on the other hand getting out of this place was definitely the central concern in her mind and she couldnt let it go so the walls have ears right but do you have any ideas he considered the question for a moment then picked his words with care i hope so pat there has to be something his tone struck pat as somber but you have thought of what that is if you mean something that could help us escape he said glancing at the ceiling no not really what im thinking is that there are all these people back home who dont have any idea theyve been watched all this time there was an expression on his face that pat couldnt identifystubbornness worry concern something of all of them plus a kind of determination she had never before associated with cousin dandan i have a duty he said and stopped there in the silence she leaned back against him wondering it had never occurred to her that a cloakanddagger spook might be driven by conscience and concern as much as bywell by whatever misguided adolescent yearning for colorful action might make a person get into that line of work it was a new feeling for pat not a bad one it made him a lot easier to be comfortable with which she was comfortable in spite of everything comfortable enough to be definitely drowsy when she yawned he did too well figure something out he said right now im sleepy and so pat realized was she it occurred to her that it would be nice for them to untangle themselves so they could stretch out but by the time she had got that far in her thinking she was already asleep with her head on dannermans shoulder what woke pat up was someone talking the person was intruding on her dream and she didnt want to let go of it especially not because of the greenskinned woman playing a musical instrument who was intruding into it when she opened her eyes she discovered her head was in dannermans lap and jimmy lin was grinning down at them she sat up abruptly what did you say she demanded fuzzily i was asking dan what you were doing looked like the jade woman and flute bit to me of course dan claims it didnt happen but then old dans a real gentleman about a ladys honor isnt he damn you she said cant you turn off your testosterone for a while now and then what is it do you get a kick out of making trouble his expression changed to belligerency are you talking about the accident well you know what im not sorry we killed the little son of a bitch even if it didnt take sooner or later im going to find some way to make him give us straight answers and if he wont do it i wouldnt mind killing him all over again dannerman was sitting up straight now glaring at lin pat was pleased to see that he was getting angry too but a little disappointed too when she realized that the anger wasnt at lins smarmy remarks youre an idiot he said flatly if you really wanted to do something like that youre sure making it hard by advertising it ahead of time lin shrugged and stalked away dannerman hesitated then patted pat on the head easing it off his lap ive got an idea he said and got up without saying what the idea was what he did was only to head for the stack of miscellaneous supplies dopeys golems had brought pat gazed after him her back propped against the wall knees hugged to her body she was thinking about the connotations of being patted on the head pat on the head was a metaphor for tolerant dismissal and there had been a time in her radfem undergraduate days when any male who ventured such an act did so at his own peril but she didnt feel tolerated and certainly she didnt feel dismissed what that casual touch had felt like was affection maybe even sexual affection tentative yes but under the circumstances about as forthright as was feasible under other circumstances under other circumstances pat told herself wistfully something nice might come of that but not under these she shook herself and stood up curious about what dannerman was doing he had borrowed rosaleens multicolor pen and was busily printing something out on a scrap of wrapping paper from the starlab booty shading what he was writing with his other hand rosaleen artzybachova was sitting crosslegged nearby watching him curiously when dannerman saw pat standing over him he complained the damn ink smears on this stuff thats what wrapping paper is like she agreed what are you writing he paused to add a word then covered the sheet with his hand you could call it a diary he said we dont have much privacy here and there are some things id just as soon not advertise to the world she frowned there was something odd about his tone so we cant see it oh he said i didnt say that i guess a few friends could take a look like me rosaleen offered its my pen why not dannerman said only do it like this please he cupped the scrap in two hands and lifted it to his eyes opening the hands at the thumbs just enough to peer inside can you do that rosaleen gave him a baffled look but did as instructed thank god for radial keratomy she muttered and then oh she closed her hands again over the scrap looking at dannerman with interest before she passed it to pat you know the drill she said i hope your near visions in good shape it wasnt particularly but when pat had done as ordered opening narrow slits between fingers for light she managed to make out the blurry scrawl if anybody has any useful ideas for escape etc lets share them like this oh pat said too i see what you mean by then martin and jimmy lin were clamoring for their own turns and dannerman was already writing something else when he passed it to pat it said concealed weapons i have flex glass knife in belt martin whats in lapel anybody else by then they were all industriously writing little messages of their own squabbling over their turns at rosaleens pen hold it rosaleen ordered lets make sure everybody sees everything how about if we pass them around in alphabetical orderadcock artzybachova dannerman delasquez lin then you can dispose of the messages when youre finished with them jimmy how i dont know swallow them maybe lin looked rebellious but dannerman said maybe we can burn them up in the cooker and when they had all seen the first message he gave it a try it worked the crumpled scrap of paper became ash and he teased it out and ground it into powder with his heel for the floor to remove by the time they had finished taking inventory they had discovered they possessed a remarkable little armory dannermans glass blade martins plastic stiletto a garroting cord from jimmy lin even rosaleen had a pair of knittingsized needles in her boots apologetically pat admitted to being the only one who had entered the clipper without fallback arms but when they had exchanged all the information they had to offer secure from the prying outside eyes the temporary euphoria subsided and she felt let down it was nice to know that they had some weapons but what was the good of weapons when they had no plan to use them passing secret messages around was a kind of pleasure pat hadnt experienced since high school but it palled there was really nothing for them to say and besides they were all getting hungry again while they were cooking their individual meals rosaleen was investigating the cooker there must be a power source for this thing somewhere she said puzzledly i cant find it maybe its in the base the rest of its nothing much but sheet metal funny sheet metal martin rumbled it isnt even warm on the outside like a microwave pat offered rosaleen shook her head its not a microwave those vegetables jimmy put in were foilwrapped and it didnt spark i dont exactly know whatoh hell tardily they all smelled the scorching as the container of beef stew inside began to burn damn dannerman said i had my mouth all set for that stew but it was powdery ashes before they could lever it out and in the long run martin simply picked the cooker up and shook them out of it for the floor to dispose of it was martin then who noticed another curiosity look here he said pushing at the device the wheels dont roll anymore pat looked and discovered that they werent actual wheels anyway they were just metal balls when she pushed at the gadget hard enough it slid sluggishly over the rubbery floor but the wheels werent turning but it rolled easily enough when dopey pushed it in she said perplexed maybe rosaleen said thoughtfully or maybe they never did turn i think weve got another piece of that farout technology we were looking for here for all the good it will do us martin said grumpily dannerman and pat took their food over to sit against the wall dannerman was deep in thoughtprobably pat supposed about ways of getting them out of their prison cell she hoped so anyway she was just getting used to the fact that her own cousin was a gumshoe the annoyance was fading curiosity was beginning to assert itself she said feeling talkative dan he blinked at her what oh sure whats on your mind well you told me that after college protsy they drafted you into the armyall right the protsy had to be the protsy pat they had snappier uniforms and no thirtykilometer hikes then what he chewed reflectively for a moment well when they called me up it turned out they didnt need any more people in uniforms they needed undercover ops they thought id do just fine mingling with the whitecollar criminals and the yuppy terrorists i objected i said i didnt want to spy on my old friends so they said sure we can give you something else and they did he shook his head wryly they ordered me to infiltrate one of the ultra light plane gangs in orange countyyou know like the deadly force and the scuzzhawks the gangs that had been taking over little towns and scaring the hell out of the citizens it meant wearing the same leathers for three or four weeks at a time and never taking a bathnot all that different from here you know except that there were occupational hazards the reason they needed gang infiltrators so badly was that they were having a pretty high attrition rate with the agents that managed to get in at all all kinds of casualties one plane crash two odsand one guy who was found washing up with the surf it didnt take me long to call in and say that after all i thought investigating tax frauds and radicalchic terrorists was more along my line of work jimmy lin had settled down nearby listening intently pat gave him a glance then grinned at dannerman i think you made the right pick i cant really imagine you as a scuzzhawk but look that was eight or ten years ago at least and you didnt quit when your hitch ran out he said simply i found out i kind of liked it fascinated pat persisted what else did you do whatever they told me to do pretty much that outfit i used to work for in new york before i came to youthat was drugs and i did a lot of antiterrorist stuff too the free bavarian movement the spanish guys that blew up nelsons column in london all that and youd go in and make friends with them and then the end result of all these adventures was you put somebody in jail dannerman gave her an injured look only the bad guys pat looked at him wonderingly dandan she said you know what i think about you i think you didnt keep on being a spook for the money i think you did it because you want to protect people youre a kindergarten teacher you know that jose pees on elviras milk and cookies so you give jose a good swatbut youre doing it for his sake as much as for hers dannerman looked as though he was getting hot under the collar somebody has to keep the peace do you have any better way of doing it no she said studying him analytically i dont actually i think its kind of sweet he shrugged you werent that kindly a kid you know what happened do they teach compassion in the spy school not exactly we did take a course in sensitivity training but basically it was to teach us how to manipulate people he looked at jimmy of course dannerman said im not the only one with experience in this area am i lin was silent waiting watching dannermans face while the bowl of goulash was cooling on his outstretched thighs i mean dannerman went on you knew i was an agent you had to find out from somewhere lin sighed if youre asking if im a professional spook like you the answers no but yes i did know they told me at the consulate first thing as soon as i got back from houston thats why i started cozying up to you he glanced penitently at pat see pat he said almost pleading i want to go home i mean without getting arrested theyve got a warrant out for me at jiuquan its a chickenshit political charge but theyre serious about it jails involved and trust me you dont want to be in a chinese jail they told me i could square it by performing a little service for the state so i ask you what could i do pat didnt answer that instead she asked whats this jewchoon place youre talking about jiuquan dannerman corrected its the chinese space center like our cape and huntsville and houston all rolled into one then to lin tell you what lets change the subject all right no hard feelings we all did what we had to do and look how much good its done any of us time passed pat was interested to discover that time kept right on passing even when there really werent any events to mark the passage oh there were a few slow but visible processes of change all three of the men were developing tackylooking beards and pats own axillary growth was no longer scratchy stubble but very little happened once or twice dopey put in a brief appearance not talkative seeming harried sporadically someone would have a notion and commit it to paper to be passed around but none of the ideas seemed to go anywhere sleeping eating defecating took up just so much of their time and the rest hung heavy pat was mildly pleased to discover that she could beat any of the others but rosaleen at chess once rosaleen had made a wrappingpaper board and while she and dannerman were playing their hundredth game jimmy lin was attempting to fabricate a deck of playing cards out of more scraps of the paper towels at least i might have a chance to win something at poker now and then he said sulkily pat rocked back on her heels as a thought struck her its your move dannerman said wait a minute give me the pen and a piece of paper will you jimmy something just occurred to me and she began to print would it do any good if we tried to get dopey into a game of something she was just about to hand it to dannerman when jimmy called hey looks like dopeys coming back indeed the mirror wall was turning milky again caught with the scrap of paper in her hand pat stared about looking for a place to hide it there wasnt any desperately she popped it in her mouth and began to chew she forgot to swallow when she saw what was happening dopey was indeed entering through the wall but he wasnt alone he was leading two other human beings through the wall hey jimmy lin shouted in delight naked women so they were being shepherded into the cell by a pair of docs looking terrified and angry at the same time each of them was rubbing the back of her neck with one hand as she clutched her bundle of clothing with the other you said dopey explained that you required additional breeding stock they looked very familiar to pat adcock she swallowed the lump of paper as she stared at them clutching dannermans arm sweet jesus she gasped theyre both me chapter nineteen pat it was frightening it was unbelievable but pat had to face up to the fact that it was true these two women were indeed herself they were two precisely identical copies of dr patrice adcockoh a lot cleaner yes and a lot less frayedlooking but in every other way exactly herself their voices were the same their appearance was the same the way they were hurrying into their clothesdannerman politely looking away martin impolitely observing jimmy lin frankly oglingwas just the way she had done it when she first got clothing again and when she asked where the hell did you two come from what they answered was just what she would have said starlab they said it in chorus too and then stopped short to stare at each otherto stare at everything around them jesus one of them began a halfsecond before the other who paused to let the first one finish with the flip side of pats question it wasnt where did you come from but where in gods name are we that got several answers the habit of talking in chorus was contagious pat thought jimmy lin giggling said youve been abducted by space aliens and rosaleen said compassionately thats a long story and dannerman proposed you go first please tell us everything that happened it might be important then well tell you everything we know pat adcock listened to her duplicates talk she discovered a strange feeling in herself it was pride she was proud of herselfof her two new selves they were less than an hour in this bizarre and terrifying new place and yet they were managing to tell a coherent story oh with repetitions and interruptions of coursemany interruptions but it showed she was gratified to think some real strength of character the first thing her two duplicates remembered was waking up they had been lying on what the first new pat described as a kind of army cot and the other as a morgue slab there were aliens all around them and they werent just the dopey and the docs that stripped them and convoyed them to the cell i saw one of the ones they call bashful the other said you know the ones with the big eyes and the dewlaps that cover their faces he was doing something with a big machine that looked kind of like a refrigerator what oh i dont know what but he was making lights go on and offthe lights were in that green jelly stuff you know like we saw on starlab a lot of it was like on starlab they hadnt observed their surroundings very closely because as soon as they were awakened they were unceremoniously stripped by the docs and their necks hurt they said rubbing them reminiscently let me see rosaleen ordered and jimmy lin chimed in me too knock it off pat said wearily elbowing him out of the way she and rosaleen bent to inspect the nape of the womens necks here pat asked touching a vertebra up a little higher there pat and rosaleen studied the hairlinehow neatly trimmed pat thought with a twinge of jealousybut there was nothing to see maybe you bumped yourselves jimmy offered crowding in to look but they denied that then yes the dopey and the docs had gone through their clothing and handed it back to them there was a whole pile of other clothes there one remembered and the other confirmed it i saw something with a lot of braid on itit looked like that jacket youre wearing martin all in a heap with a lot of other stuff no they werent doing anything with it it looked like they just tossed it there maybe theyre making clean clothes for us pat said hopefully maybe and then they were marched down a long busy passage lined with bizarre things that probably were machines they thought to the point where they saw all the rest of the captives wall no i didnt see any wall not from the outside not until we were inside here no it didnt look like glass it didnt look like anything at all all i saw was the bunch of you playing cards or something but it didnt look like you saw us and then we were here and there were these big damn mirrors all around us and those machines rosaleen asked what did they look like but she didnt get much of an answer they had been too full of other questions for close study one of the devices they passed was making a kind of coffeepercolator sound one of the new pats remembered and the other said another one was giving off heat but just weird you know like the stuff on starlab then she pleaded our turn now what is this place pat took over come over and sit down she offered want something to eat jimmy make us some of that lousy coffee anyway pat adcock who had been an only child had never had any experience with this sort of thing she had never had sisters before much less identical triplets she was astonished to discover how much she liked it there was something warmly pleasing about sitting with the two new versions of herself the repulsive coffee cooling untasted in their hands while she took over the job of briefing them there was a lot to be told pat had not realized just how much she and the other captives had had to learn in all those long days in the cell until she had to summarize it all for the two new pats their capture their imprisonment their futile attempts at escapethe whole disheartening story it was bad enough for the original five captives even worse for the new arrivals who pat thought not only had the shock of finding themselves in this bizarre new predicament but also of suddenly being inexplicably part of a perfectly matched set of three they took it well increasing pats pride in them took it well most of the time anyway not counting their outrage when she explained the toilet arrangements to them they were almost as repelled when she told them that everything they did all the time was watched from outside the cell they have no right one of them exclaimedbarely before the other pat sighed sparing a quick look at dannerman who had written something on a scrap of paper and was holding it covered impatiently waiting they have the power she said i dont know about rights except that we dont have any at all and to dannerman is that what i think it is for the new ones he said handing it to pat she glanced at it it was what she had expected a synopsis of the parts of the briefing that were not to be spoken out loud she showed the newcomers the technique of managing to read it without ever letting it be exposed to hostile eyes when the first one read it she said nothing just looked affronted and unhappy when she passed it to the other when the other finished she giggled wanly passing notes back and forth she said its like being in school again only school was never like this the other one agreed and pat marveled they were thinking the same thoughts she had thought well they would wouldnt they being the same person except for being a lot cleaner which made her think of something she glanced at the other captives all of whom had edged close to listen in and lowered her voice listen she said they left you your perfume didnt they could one of you spare me a couple of drops they could and jimmy lin stepped closer inhaling ah he said thats really fine id almost forgotten what a woman was supposed to smell like pat gave him a look of disgust shoo she ordered and then more politely all the rest of you could you just leave us alone for a bit so we can get used to this the other three considerately took themselves over to the cooker but lin looked rebellious who are you to give me orders ice queen maybe these other ladies appreciate a little male attention we dont one of the others said briefly get lost when he moved sulkily away she stared after him whats the matter with him hes horny well sure hes horny hes always been horny but he didnt use to act like that ah no pat said remembering not quite as forthright anyway but that was then you were his boss then now that doesnt matter anymore the other pat was staring after jimmy who was now sulkily demanding his share of what was coming out of the cooker speaking of that kind of thing well she said now almost whispering excuse me for asking but i dont suppose anybodys actually getting any are they in this goldfish bowl i wish because the other went on i couldnt help seeing the way dandan looks at you you know is something new going on with you two pat had to think about that one i wouldnt be surprised she said finally surprising herself hes not really a bad guy when you get to know him i mean not counting that hes a goddamn spy that took explanation too everything did not helped by the fact that the new arrivals not only looked the same but talked at the same time with the same words and then stopped and stared at each other hell rosaleen said at last weve got to do something about telling you apart lets start by naming you youthe originalyoure pat and youthe one nearest heryou can be patricia its patrice actually the two new ones said together all right patrice and youre patsy the third one looked rebellious the hell you say nobody ever calls me patsy oh come on the patrice said soothingly its not so bad and rosies right about needing names the patsy scowled so why dont you be patsy then then she surrendered oh well i guess it makes no difference but you owe me fine rosaleen said smiling for the first time thats settled pat patrice and patsy now hold still she was pulling out her multicolor pen just so the rest of us can know which of you is which im going to put a little beauty spot on your foreheads hey both of them protested at once rosaleen overruled them its just for now itll wear off by the time we think of something better lets see well do blue for you pat just to be fair red for patrice and ill do green for patsy and then mimicking dopey are there any questions she was talking to the pats but it was jimmy lin who spoke up i have one which of you is going to be the lucky girl who gets me pat opened her mouth to chastise him and then closed it again what was the point better just to ignore him she thought and hostess like was about to ask her new best friends if they were ready to eat again when something happened it sounded like a distant crump of a blastthunder an explosionand a moment later that constant featureless white light from overhead dimmed and reddened it only lasted for a second then it was bright again what the hell was that patsy asked nobody had an answer patrice asked does that happen a lot and pat shook her head never before she said it sounded like something blew up rosaleen artzybachova said did you feel the floor shake dannerman thought he had none of the others were sure but there wasnt any doubt that something had happened and though they chewed the subject over the next half hour or so all they could agree on was that they didnt like it except for jimmy lin who said grinning weakly how about that just talking about sex i can make the earth move for you whatever it was it didnt happen again by their second daywell by the time they woke up from their second sleep after their arrivalthe two new pat adcocks were at least no longer speaking in chorus nurture had triumphed over nature there hadnt been many differences in their experience and those only small ones patsy had burned her hand trying to learn how to use the cooker jimmy lin had been a little too forthright when he managed to get patrice alonewell not alone but at least a couple of meters from any of the others enough for him to deem the privacy adequateand it had wound up in a screaming match things like that but however little the differences had been they were enough to set each of them off on somewhat different trains of thought what all the pats had and kept was a preference for each others company they ate together when one of them had to use the toilet the other two stood protectively before her glaring the three males down they slept nestled next to each other woke at the same time whispered to each other within the small group of captives they had become a separate subunit it was pat thought a little reassuring to have two companions whom she could trust absolutely since they were herself the other four were not as pleased dannerman and rosaleen embarked on a chess marathon doggedly ignoring the three pat adcocks martin delasquez hardly spoke to anyone retreating into sleep or pretended sleep for hour upon hour while jimmy lin went the other way he was hyperactive pat thought he seemed hardly to sleep at all he kibitzed the chess players tried unsuccessfully to get martin to play some other game with him and of course did his best to talk sex with any or all of the three pats if they were worried about getting pregnant he offered the revered ancient pengtsu had the answers for that too we could do approaching the fragrant bamboo for instance he said thats doing it standing up you know and pengtsu says you cant get pregnant that way you dont believe that all right then theres always the jade girl and the flute or the white tiger leapsthat one he said with a wink i dont want to tell you about but any time you like i could show you all that sort of talk had long since become pretty stale for pat but the two new ones were more tolerant they let him talk anyway pat thought that was better than jimmys other main occupation which was feverishly writing out notes with ideas for doing somethinggoing on a hunger strike capturing dopey and torturing him until he did whatever they wanted maybe using some of the concealed weapons they still possessed maybe by dunking his limbs or tail into the cooker pat wondered if the man was going insane when he passed around the suggestion for cooking dopeys plume on the grounds that that was bound to hurt but unlikely to kill the creature he was almost trembling with excitement but then a few hours later he was talking enthusiastically about some of his ancestors other sexual proposals when the wall clouded and dopey came in as always he was bombarded with questions as soon as he appeared why were you gone so long from jimmy lin what was that explosion from dannerman one answer did for both of them there was an incident dopey admitted his fingers working nervously his bright tail dimmed and still it caused some problems for a time but it has been dealt with now i have some news for you pat wasnt letting him get away with that what kind of incident she insisted he hesitated staring around at them with those great eyes then he spoke to dannerman in your previous life you were assigned to dealing with terrorists is that not correct that is with criminal persons who performed violent and destructive acts yes well it is something of that sort here i can say no more about it except that the criminals have been ah neutralized neutralized how jimmy asked suspiciously but rosaleen overrode himprobably pat thought because she didnt think they would like to hear the answer never mind that she said what he means is are these the same criminals who were interfering with your communications yes precisely the terrorists i see and perhaps the same ones who transmitted the message that described you people as destroying the universe for a moment pat thought that dopey was going to relapse into his trance state again it seemed to be a troubling question but then he made a breathy soundalmost a sighand said yes they are the same through trickery and violence they managed to infiltrate the link to your starlab for a brief time of course i observed their transmission at once and was able to jam the rest of it but then they did it again dannerman offered dopey said mournfully indeed this time i failed to observe it as they had caused the death of one of me but my replacement dealt with them no he added waggling his head against the next burst of questions that is all i may say on that subject but i have received new instructions for you i am instructed to accelerate your program and so a device is being prepared which will give you more complete information device what kind of device rosaleen demanded it will be explained when it is ready he said severely please do not interrupt i have further instructions i am directed to provide you with whatever additional materiel from your starlab you requireexcept of course anything that can be used as a weapon why are you being nice to us martin asked suspiciously i do not make these decisions i simply carry out instructions if there is anything in particular you wish simply inform me now or later otherwise i will use my own discretion we dont have room for anything else in here pat put in yes that has been anticipated other accommodations are being prepared for you he paused eyes closed fingers busy in the muff it looked to pat as though he was getting ready to leave with a million questions unanswered rosaleen evidently thought the same because she spoke up tell me one more thing are you going to bring any more of us here more copies of you here i know of no such plans it is possible however that there will be other human beings two additional human missions to starlab are currently being proposed and of course if they reach the orbiter they too will be copied for study now i must go he turned then paused to look back at jimmy lin one more thing please do not give any more thought to the plan of capturing and torturing me i do not think you could succeed but if you did it would be very unpleasant for me and it would do you no good at all chapter twenty pat pat adcock was deep in sleep when the sound of her own voice yelling jerked her awake it didnt come from her own throat it had to be one of the new pats and she jumped to a conclusion is that damn jimmy trying something she demanded sitting up and rubbing her eyes but it wasnt jimmy lin it was one of the docs and the person shouting was patsy hanging by one arm from the docs grasp damn you she cried shaking herself free dont grab a person like that the doc hesitated glancing at a second doc standing stolidly by wheres dopey pat demanded no one answered and he wasnt there the second doc which was holding some sort of metallic object didnt speak of course they never did as far as pat knew perhaps couldnt or simply had no reason to what it did was make a gesture and at once the first one abandoned patsy and casually reached out for the arm of the nearest other humanit happened to be jimmy linholding him firmly while the other jammed the object down on lins head hey jimmy squawked in alarm reaching up with both hands to tug it free in vain the docs grip was firm pat thought for a moment of trying to rescue the chinanaut from whatever new torture the docs had devised she could see the thing plainly now a sort of helmet made of the same coppery mesh as dopeys muff on jimmys head it looked almost like a garish wig cut along the lines of one of those flapper hairdos of the early twentieth century what they called a french bob she thought and while she waited jimmy stopped struggling hey he said again sounding startled but nowastonishinglyalmost pleased theres a frenchman talking to me hes sayingno just wait a minute ill translate for you when hes done i speak french rosaleen said eagerlyonly the first to make the claim she was quickly followed by all three pats and both other men jimmy waved impatiently for silence he isnt speaking french hes speaking chinese shut up so i can hear chinese martin muttered angrily as the two docs left as wordlessly as they had come in one of the patspat thought it was patricecomplained that is so inconsiderate both of them were echoing pats own thoughts chinese for gods sake dopey was showing even worse judgment than usual but there was nothing to do about it but wait until jimmy lin was willing to talk to them evidently the frenchmans message was short after a moment jimmy took the helmet off and gazed at them well he said that was interesting it didnt actually tell much but hey martin had grabbed the helmet from him jimmy reached to take it back but martin fended him off and settled the thing on his own head now whats the use of doing that jimmy demanded pettishly you arent going to understand chinese martin martin said triumphantly he isnt speaking chinese hes speaking spanish but thats impossible jimmy protested he was speaking quite excellent prc chinese with a welleducated accent though there was a trace of the beijing tones be quiet martin thundered i cant hear while youre making all that racket also i know who this man is i will tell you all about it if you will simply let me listen looking petulant jimmy lin did as ordered but the others didnt under the dark eyepatches of the helmet martin was scowling at the noise but he said nothing more until it was over then he took the helmet off and held it in his hand for a moment the man speaking he is hugues duvalier hes a navigator with eurospace i met him once at kourou what he is saying is a communication meant for everybody in the world it sounds as though they finally got their own starlab mission off what did he say dannerman demanded martin shook his head try it for yourself since he is so unexpectedly versatile i am curious to see if perhaps this time he will speak in some language you can understand hey pat cried as martin handed the helmet to dannerman what happened to alphabetical order who said all the men go first what happened to womens rights patrice chimed in and patsy added oink oink you sexist pigs but rosaleen said its faster if we dont argue let him go well all get a turn and dannerman placed the helmet on his head chapter twentyone dan dannerman settled the thing on his head as rapidly as he could he wanted to see this linguistic marvel wanted even more to find out just what the frenchman had to say the helmet didnt fit particularly well and it was heavy the gogglesopaque eyeshields actuallydug into his flesh over the cheekbones but they did their job he could see nothing but blackness could hear the sounds from his companions only faintly through the thickness of the helmet then the blackness dissolved dannerman was looking at a man dressed in an astronauts eva spacesuit helmet tucked under one arm and the man was looking directly back at him it didnt look like a broadcast it seemed that the man was standing before him solid in three dimensions seeming almost near enough to touch when the man spoke he sounded as though the conversation was oneonone he said hello ladies and gentlemen you may recognize me i am colonel hugues duvalier and i am speaking to you from the astronomical observatory called starlab i am not alone here i am in the company of a person who has a message of great importance for everyone on earth i cannot show him to you at this time however he is a friend and he has given me the responsibilityand the privilegeof delivering his message to you you will remember that some time ago these two broadcasts of alien origin were received all over the world a screen appeared beside the figure displaying the two old space messages one after another some people thought these were some sort of a joke others came closer to the truth imagining that they were warnings of an extraterrestrial invasion that is both true and false there is a threat of invasion by evil people that is true what is false is that the evil ones are not the ones shown in the messages the evil onesthe people who are even now planning to attack our planet and do us all great harmare the ones who sent those first false messages in order to deceive you these brutal creatures are called by a name which is difficult for me to say it sounds like the horch they possess a very high technology particularly in weaponry they have fought many wars over long ages of time and in them they have succeeded in destroying many other civilizations in other solar systems only a few races have been able to defend themselves against the horch some of them are the people whose pictures the horch sent to youpretending they were enemiesbut they are in fact the ones who can help you defend yourself against these attackers their name is even more difficult to pronounce my friends here call them beloved leaders you already know what they look like from the deceitful transmissions the horch sent what i will show you now is a picture of a horch the image of the astronaut flicked out of sight and another being appeared it didnt look like a picture to dannerman the creature looked as though it were actually standing there no more than a yard or so away from him it was taller than dannerman himself and gazing threateningly at him it was certainly not from the gallery that had already been displayed though equally ugly stocky body wearing metallic armor long lizard head on a long and supple neck with a lipless mouth filled with sharp teeth instead of arms it had two boneless limbs like an elephants trunk fraying into half a dozen digits at the ends in one hand it carried an axe in the other a spiked club it was in fact the very model of the kind of alien invader you would never want to see appearing out of your skies the image shrank to a picture inset on the screen and the colonel appeared again looking grave i have been shown the evidence which is indisputable and so i now know what terrible things the horch can do he said somberly they will do such things to us too if we let them and we have no defenses of our own that could withstand them still we have been offered strong allies with the help of the beloved leadersas these friends are calledwe can defend ourselves without them we are doomed that is all i can say now in twentyfour hours i will speak to you again and then i will give you more details about the choices before us until then please be warned the picture went to black the message was over thoughtfully dannerman removed the helmet he spoke to me in english he announced rosie why dont you take a shot and see what he does for you thanks a lot dan pat said with annoyance he shook his head youll get your turn wait till weve all seen it he settled himself on the floor and waited staring into space then patsy last to have her turn took the helmet off and shakily wow that was an ugly one all right dannerman had been thinking he said something strikes me as peculiar the astronaut spoke to me in english was it the same for you pats yes i thought so rosaleen why yes he spoke in ukrainian with a few russian words actually but his accent was good why do you say thats peculiar clearly this is an announcement transmitted to everyone on earth like the others naturally they would want it to be in languages everyone can understand thats not the peculiar part did you see duvaliers lips move his lips she looked puzzled but jimmy lin was quicker youre thinking it was lipsynched for each of us he demanded no forget lipsynching maybe you could get away with that for european languages mandarin chinese no duvalier was actually speaking those words dan dannerman nodded but that wasnt exactly what i was thinking what im thinking is that it wasnt lipsynched and thats the part thats hard to understand martin did this colonel duvalier know all those languages delasquez looked indignant that ass no i was astonished to hear him even speak spanish i do not even know how he succeeded in getting a spacecraft on course to starlab he is such a notorious fool pat was looking at dannerman expectantly when he didnt speak she prodded whats your point dan i wish i knew the whole thing sounds funny patrice nodded i know what you mean if i saw that on tv at home id turn it right off beloved leaders for christs sake onlywell if what he says is the truth jimmy lin finished the sentence for her then he said the world is really in the deep shit chapter twentytwo dan dannerman didnt have to be told that the world was in trouble it always was that was the reason it hired him and others like him to do their best to protect it against itself now here was the biggest threat of all and shouldnthe asked himselfshouldnt he be doing something about it there was only one answer to that for jim daniel dannerman the question wasnt whether it was what and to that he had no answer every other time he had found himself in harms way he had known exactly what he wanted to accomplish if hed been in any doubt colonel hilda morrisey or someone like her would have spelled it out for him at the briefing there was always a hierarchy of defined objectives first you stayed alive second you got the evidence third you called in the strike force and watched the malefactors being led away here there was no briefing to tell him what to do there was also no evidence to get no way to get out and no strike force waiting to be called and here the stakes were higher than they had ever been before it was the entire population of earth who were at risk nowhilda herself and sweet anita berman from theater aristophanes two and his landlady rita as well as everyone at the dannerman observatory as well as everyone else hed ever known in all his life villains and colleagues and civilians alike he wondered what they were doing now he wondered how much comfort they could take in the promise of help from the beloved leaders and he wondered too just how much help those beloved leaders had any real intention of giving there just wasnt enough data he knew nothing useful of those shadowy figures had no idea what sort of bizarre alien personality traits motivated them and had little reason to believe that benevolence was among them he opened his eyes when he heard pat raising her voice she was saying something harsh to jimmy lin who was grinning as he held her by one arm she wrenched herself free saw dannerman looking at her and came over to sit beside him bastard she said he didnt take it personally but you mean jimmy he asked just to make sure who else youd think hed have enough decency to give it a rest the way things are i take it he was hitting on you me and patsy and patricehe doesnt care he just wants to get laid he said she hesitated then shook her head he said what he always says so whats the use of talking about it forget him then she looked apologetic did i interrupt something nothing that was going anywhere he admitted well if youre sure listen ive been wanting to ask you something dan what did you mean about its being funny funny oh right i almost forgot well it is funny why would dopey show us that message why hum she thought for a moment then said yeah i see what you mean dopey doesnt do anything that doesnt do him some good so what good can that do him thats the question all right i dont suppose you happen to have an answer i wish i did i wish i knew how much of it to believe too so do i dannerman thought about telling her some of his own doubts but there wasnt much point they werent clear in his own mind anyway he saw that pat was glaring again at jimmy who was standing over the cooker waiting for his next meal to heat and leering at them bastard she said again not that i dont understand how he feels its been a long timebut here with everybody watching although i have to say he thought about that part too oh said dannerman surprised to find a sudden interest growing she looked at him her expression unreadable well yes like in an airplane you know when you get a couple of blankets from the stew there are all those blankets from starlab then well did jimmy ever explain the rabbit nibbles the hare to you frequently he saidsurprised again to find that he was feeling just a tiny bit of unexpected jealousy is that what you and jimmy talk about its what jimmy talks about she corrected all the time she was still studying his face as she added but listen dan just for the recordi mean in case youre interestedjimmy and i never actually did anything not now or ever the only thing i ever wanted from jimmy lin was for him to help me make a lot of money one more surprise the feeling of relief but always thinking of the big bucks arent you he chided he meant it lightly but her expression changed i dont want to be poor she said im sorry no you were right i wanted the bucks thats why i wanted starlab so badly our dear old family lawyer told me you had made some bad investments dannerman said remembering did he now our dear old family lawyer has a big mouth but that wasnt it well she said reconsidering i did make one real bad investment maybe that was ferdie my exhusbandthe sweet one hed spend the whole day lying naked by the pool communing with nature when he wasnt writing poetry ferdie was very zen made me learn my mantra and everything but after a while i got tired of having this big healthy man around the house who couldnt even remember to flush his own toilet but i couldnt let him starve could i so before the divorce i endowed this lectureship for poetry and got him put in charge of it i figured that would keep him eating for the rest of his life and your generosity bankrupted you well not directly it cost me a bundle but i had plenty left but on the other hand yes i guess it did because after id laid out the cash to finance the lectureshipand believe me dandan i was generousthe next thing that happened was ferdies lawyers came to see my lawyers and said okay now that weve got that out of the way lets talk about how were going to divide up the community property skunks he said the diffuse light that came from nowhere made her unkempt hair radiant lawyers she corrected he got some really good ones working for him ill say that much they had every last thing i owned on their database i had to give him halfwhich meant i had to sell off a lot of stuff that i didnt really want to sell to keep the house and the personal stuff but ferdie really was a sweet man she stretched and yawned now you she ordered he considered what do you want to know everything especially about the women start with whoever it was who kept you from collecting uncle cubbys inheritance he leaned forward and lifted her hand to kiss and the hell with who might be watching it was the first time in a long timemaybe he reflected the first time everthat hed had this kind of boygirl talk without having to lie through at least some parts of it to cover up what he was really doing but now there was nothing to lie about that would be use i guess in a way anyway she was in the mads the what the mad king ludwigs the bavarian secessionist movement well the terrorists thats what they really were i was undercover investigating them when uncle cubby died and id cut all my links with home we were on the run use and i although i always kept my team leader informed and use finally mustve rumbled me or someone else did and tipped her off who were you running from the baykahsthe bundes kriminalamt the cops they were after us because wed tried to blow up the kunstmuseum as a protest i made sure the bomb didnt actually go off maybe thats what made the mads suspiciousbut we had to get out of there anyway one night use and i had a lot to drink in this pension in the alps now that i think of it i was the one doing most of the drinking then i just went to sleep not a care in the world and when something woke me up an hour or so later in the middle of the night use was gone and four big bastards with hockey sticks were crashing through the door after my blood i knew them all they were aktionthe organizations muscle men id seen them doing their stuff at demonstrations but i hadnt expected them to be coming after me just then he leaned back meditating you know how youre never prepared for the really big challenges if you knew something like that was coming up youd get a good nights sleep first and make sure your reflexes were all tuned mine werent i was still half in die bag and all tangled up in the bedclothes and there i was but you overpowered them anyway oh no i did break the arm of one of them but the other three beat the shit out of me until hilda got there another of your women that made him laugh jesus no my team leader shed been surveilling the building when she saw use come out and the legbreakers go in she decided shed better make sure i was all right which i was after i healed up for a while though i had to stay out of sight for a month or sothe mads had planted a couple people in the police and they had to be collected first he scratched himself hilda had intercepted the lawyers notice about the estate he added but she didnt pass it on because she didnt want to blow my cover poor bastard she was yawning as she said it which made him yawn too dirt poor he agreed drowsily well except for what the bureau had been putting away for him but he couldnt collect that until he retired which didnt seem like a very early probability unless he corrected himself you considered that in a way he was perforce pretty much retired already his thoughts were going in circles again he abandoned them and let himself drift off it was getting to be a habit to fall asleep with pat adcock on his shoulder he thought and couldnt decide whether it was a good one or not his body had its own opinions when dopey appeared again and roused the whole cell pats proximity had started a few glands flowing and dannerman woke with a major erection and the rapidly dissipating recollection of some more than normally erotic dreams beside him pat was scrambling to her feet come on dan she urged him in a minute he said waving her away by the time he felt fit to stand up everyone else was clustered around dopey and his two docs as they dispensed more largesse i have brought you more blankets and food dopey said unnecessarily you do not presently need them i am aware but there is always the risk that supplies may be temporarily interrupted meanwhile i have some urgent business what kind of business patsy asked but was outweighed by two or three others demanding to know what kind of temporary interruptions dopey was talking about merely more of the difficulties we have already experienced he explained they will be dealt with now as to the more important matters but rosaleen poking around in the mounting heap of supplies the docs were lugging in had more important matters of her own arms akimbo she faced dopey angrily we need more than food and blankets she said we need medical supplies we need we need to know whats going on on earth too patsy put in dopey said defensively i cannot promise that i do not have authority to make such promises i have in fact asked those who decide for permission to provide you with additional data but i have not received an answer you do not understand how difficult things have become i dont care how difficult things have become but you see at present i am unable to reach the ones who could give permission just at present that is to say everythings just at present jimmy lin sneered and dannerman looking at the stack of food packages had a comment of his own you must expect us to be here for a long time that is also not for me to decide but the reason for the large quantity is that i do not know when i will be able to get more i have said this now we must deal with the urgent matters do you have any questions about the announcement made by your colonel duvalier dannerman was surprised that that was the urgent business but it was pat who spoke up weve got plenty of questions but theyre not about colonel duvalier for instance these horch the colonel talks about in what you transmitted to the earth are they related to the problems youre having dopey didnt answer immediately dannerman expected him to thrust his paws into the muff and go again into the thinkingitover trance but he merely looked painedas much as a kitten face can look pained finally he announced there is a disjunction here you are correct in one respect the horch are indeed responsible for our problems because they are evil they have performed acts of terrorism which have caused great hardship for us you will understand what terrorists are like agent dannerman from your own experiences with colonel hilda morrisey the horch are criminals in much the same way as your human terrorists but far more dangerous than any you can imagine however you have made a false assumption which is dannerman demanded that message has not been transmitted the reason for that is that colonel duvalier has not yet arrived on starlab hah jimmy lin shouted i knew it it was a damn simulation the problem was not understood dopey admitted it will be corrected something was bothering dannerman he asked why bother with simulating somebody who isnt there if you wanted to send a message that seemed to come from a human being why not use one of us dopey hesitated again that would not be effective he said and would not say why the only subject that he seemed willing to discuss was what their reactions had been to the message and when they began asking questions in returnwhat would be in the second message what other languages would it be delivered inhe did not respond at all not until at a venture pat asked are we in personal danger from these horch that made dopey pause to think once more at this time no he said at length oh fine patrice muttered youre making me feel all cuddly warm and protected i understand you that is sarcasm meaning the opposite dopey said you will however be protected by you i no of course not i that protection will come from a far more advanced race than my own meaning dannerman asked those oddlooking scarecrows we saw on tv dopey winced that was an unfair picture our enemies transmitted the beloved leaders come from a lightgravity planet and thus are rather frail in physique he paused as jimmy lin made a sound of disgust beloved leaders lin sneered dopey looked inquiring your tone of voice indicates disapproval he said you damn bet it does beloved leaders is what the old koreans called their dictators thats not a good name dopey thank you the alien said that too is useful although i am not sure that a change will be permitted at any rate because of their evolutionary heritage the bethe persons in charge that is would not be on a planet of this mass so theyre not really going to be around to save us jimmy lin demanded in alarm but that was one question too many dopey evidently had what he had come for without farewell he turned and disappeared into the mirror which reformed seamlessly behind him like a puddle of mercury closing over a stone dannerman stared after him for a long minute though there was nothing to see but his own reflection in the wall he was puzzling over something and it showed whats the matter pat demanded you still wondering why he showed us that message actually no dannerman said i think thats pretty obvious now isnt it hes using us to be his sneakpreview film critics getting our reactions before he puts the thing on the air no its something else he hesitated for a moment then tell me something pat when we were talking i mentioned hilda to you didnt i sure your boss in the bureau i remember but did i ever say her last name no i didnt think so so how did dopey know that it was morrisey chapter twentythree dan so dannerman had one more puzzle to add to his collection he was certain hed never mentioned hilda morriseys last name and the bureau did not advertise the names of its personnel and it was not information that could be picked up from the monitored broadcasts but dopey had known it in fact dopey seemed to know quite a few of the things they had never spoken aloud how there was one easy answer to that someone might have been sloppy in concealing some of the notes as they read them or passed them around but that didnt explain hilda morrisey and dannerman didnt believe it anyway what he believed was that dopey possessed sources of information they didnt know about whatever those sources might be he snorted in disgustmuffled quickly because he didnt want pat or any one of the pats to come over to see what was bothering him that had happened twice already and he had waved them away he wished he didnt have to he wanted badly to talk it over with the others because someone else rosaleen maybewell any of themmight have a clarifying insight he had missed but if even the eyesonly notepassing was compromised they would simply be giving more information to dopey or dopeys masters would that matter would that sort of information be useful to them dannerman could form no satisfactory answer to that either but it was simple basic tradecraft to deny as much information as possible to the enemy and his thoughts were interrupted by a new sound something had begun squealing shrilly somewhere when dannerman raised his head he saw patrice holding the helmet in her hand looking puzzled i think it wants something she said it wants one of us to put it on of course rosaleen said crossly give it to me evidently she was right as soon as she had it settled on her head the beeping stopped by then most of the others had converged around her clamoring to know what she was hearing rosaleen didnt take the helmet off only held up her hand and said relax its basically the same message but with a few improvements give me a moment then this time we do it in alphabetical order remember pat reminded them pat comes before patrice or patsy so i get the first look jimmy lin emitted a long exasperated sigh martin muttered something that sounded obscene dannerman only waited he was as impatient as anyone but he accepted the fact that it would go faster if they didnt argue when all four women had had a lookeach looking puzzled even faintly disappointed when they were finishedhis turn came as soon as the helmet was on his head and the eyepieces in place the figure of the french astronaut popped into being and began to speak messieurs et mesdames it began je m appelle colonel hugues duvalier peutetre vous me connaissez et je suisand then the french language was drowned out by another voice overriding the colonel with unaccented american english ladies and gentlemen im colonel hugues duvalier maybe you know me i am an astronaut at present in orbit on the astronomical satellite known as starlab i have a message of the greatest importance for everyone on earth it was the same message as before but reworked to remove their objections the colonel wasnt risking any distractions to his audience by speaking in many tongues there was a simple voiceover the same thing viewers heard on any newscast anywhere in the world the phrase beloved leaders was still there but modified to they are called beloved leaders but we can know them simply as the forces which have so farand very successfullyborn the brunt of the attack when delasquez and jimmy lin had had their turns dannerman asked about languages just to clear up one final point the answers were the same as before ukrainian for rosaleen american english for dannerman and the pats spanish for delasquez and chinese for jimmy but this time rosaleen said the ukrainian was all ukrainian they corrected some of the russian words dannerman nodded thoughtfully but said only fast work dopey must have real good production facilities when he stopped there pat gave him a perplexed maybe even an unfriendly look is that all you have to say about it he shrugged jimmy lin answered for him whats to say were just dopeys damn test audience arent we and we did our job for him he listened to everything we criticized and he changed the message around to suit now he turned and faced the wall cupping his hands around his mouth are you listening dopey okay then listen to this you got it right this time its fine the way it is so dont bother us with any more revisions just keep the food coming he turned to dannerman grinning does that about cover it because if it doesnt we could he didnt get a chance to finish the sentence because he was interrupted abruptly the ground began to tremble everyone who was standing suddenly began to reel jimmy grabbed martin delasquezs shoulder to steady himself nearly bringing them both down oh hell jimmy grunted his voice as shaky as the floor theyre doing it again the odd thing dannerman thought was that this time he hadnt heard any explosion just the sudden uneasy twist and slide in the floor beneath him but the tremor was a big one some cans of something or other on top of their stacks of supplies were jarred loose and clattered to the ground rosaleen sat down abruptly there were yips of surprise from at least two of the pats then it was over no not quite over just as everyone opened their mouths to tell each other that this one had been an unusually bad one all right something else happened the mirror walls flickered and changed color jagged streaks of bright red danced around them like slow lightning flashes that permanent diffuse pale glow from overhead darkened and their only light came from the radiant walls as they turned lurid orange in one spot blotchy bright red in another for a moment they seemed to go almost transparent and through the nearest one dannerman saw or thought he saw a shadowy ziggurat of bright metal a doc was standing there transfixed all of its arms raised toward the sky in what looked like abject terror then the colors faded the faint visions from outside clouded and disappeared the steady overhead glow returned the walls became featureless mirrors again and everything was as it had been before everything but the prisoners at least but they were all shaken and bewildered what in the name of god was that martin delasquez angrily demanded of the room at large rosaleen was the one who tried to answer she was getting back to her feet wincing with one of the pats helping her on either side i think it must have been some kind of a power failure she said soberly i do not think that is a good sign at least they had a new topic of conversation to keep them busy for a while in fact they had two of them one was the debate on what caused the tremor why the power had seemed to fail and make the walls go all weirdsome new questions some just repetitions of the familiar ones about just what the hell was going on here anyway whatever it was it clearly was something that mattered to them it made dopey jittery and no doubt it threatened their own fragile security as well but that particular discussion had nowhere to go all anyone had to contribute was unanswerable questions and speculations none of them very satisfactory the other area of discussion dannerman thought was more productive during that momentary lifting of the veil some of the captives had caught glimpses of what lay beyond the wall none had had time for a clear view but most had seen something what they saw depended mostly on which way they happened to be facing patrice and jimmy lin were out of it because they had been looking the wrong way and hadnt seen anything at all but each of the others had at least a hazy impression to report it was rosaleen artzybachova who interrupted the hubbub with a suggestion listen please each of us should do his or her best to draw what we saw before we forget then we can compare notes patsy bobbed her head at once good idea she said reaching for rosaleens pen and then paused long enough to give dannerman a questioning look is it all right for us to do it this way or should we be trying to keep the drawings covered she asked before dannerman could respond martin answered for him why do you ask dannerman for permission he asked giving dannerman an unfriendly look it is obvious that there is no point in hiding such drawings who can doubt that dopey knows what is outside the wall far better than we do so what information could he gain patsy was still looking expectantly at dannerman he shrugged i guess thats true he said though his own reasons had little to do with what dopey already knew and a lot with whether all their secretive note passing had served any useful purpose when they began drawing it turned out that martin had seen the same metallic tower as dannerman though it was hard to recognize the thing in the mans crude kindergartenstyle drawings rosaleen on the other hand produced a workmanlike engineers view of what looked as much like a row of file cabinets as anything else dannerman had ever seen pat and patsy had had the benefit of a year of art in college and both provided neat sketchesan elongated twodomed metal object for pat looking a little like a steel camel hunkered down to the ground for patsy a broad corridor between more rows of the filecabinet objects with something that might have been a vehicle a score of meters away it wasnt moving she said but im pretty sure it was some kind of a car and there was somebody well something standing outside of it patrice looking on enviously commented you know it looks a little like the way dopey brought us in here i thought so too and the person or whatever that was standing thereit could have been a doc like die one you saw dan he nodded abstractedly his attention on the handful of drawings patsy was still watching him her expression quizzical dan she said are you all right he looked up what oh sure youre not talking much that was the simple truth not to be denied but he wasnt yet prepared to say why ive got something on my mind he said truthfully enough and then when patsy suggested maybe he should write it down he could think of nothing better to say than not yet all three of the pats were looking at him the expressions on their faces less friendly than they had been they thought he was being hostile he knew but could think of nothing useful to do about it rosaleen who had been watching silently felt the tension she coughed if i can propose something we ought to do she suggested each of you which way were you looking when the wall went transparent if we compare notes maybe we can make a kind of map of whats around us it was a sensible proposal as they all began trying to recall just which way they had been facing they included dannerman in the conversation civilly enough but that was as far as it went and when some time later pat began to yawn she didnt look toward dannerman all three of the pats curled up close together and dannerman did not sleep that time with any warm and pleasing head on his shoulder by the time he woke up rosaleen had completed making a fair copy of the map their collective glimpses had produced of course it wasnt complete in the center rosaleen had drawn the hexagonal cell they were in with each side numbered counting clockwise from their main point of reference the area they had set aside as latrine dannermans tall tower was at side two there was nothing at one or three except rosaleens small neat question mark four was the cabinet things she herself had observed next to them at five patsys broad corridor and at six pats angular steel camel he handed the chart back to rosaleen with gratitude good work he said she nodded and forbore to ask any questions she turned awaynot hostile simply accommodating his desire to be silentand limped back to show it again to the others dannerman watched her go with a frown how long had rosaleen been limping and how long would it be before this very old lady began to show other signs of distress if a chance ever came for them to escape would she be able to take it and if she couldnt would they be able to leave her here they were not pleasant thoughts it was a relief to be distracted from them when the helmet began its plaintive beeping cry once more by the time it was dannermans turn all four of the women had already heard the message and in each case their expressions ranged from shock to incredulity pat who went first ordered everyone who followed to hold all comments until theyd all seen it they grumbled but they obeyed then rosaleen handed it to dannerman her face bleak and when he put it on the colonel appeared at once mesdames et messieurs colonel duvalier began and once again the voiceover took up the message in unaccented american english ladies and gentlemen this is the most important message you will ever hear some of it will startle you even more than what you know already some of it you will find very difficult to believe i found it so myself but i was given proof that i could not deny and our friends from space stand ready to give those same proofs to you what it concerns is heaven that startles you at once doesnt it im sure that many of you believe in god and his heaven just as i do and im equally sure that like me you consider that that sort of thing is a religious matter not a scientific one but what i now know is that it is both what our friends from space have discovered in their scientific investigationswhich are far more advanced than our ownis that at a time in the far future a very long time from now something very strange will happen at that time every intelligent being who ever existed in the universe will come to life again and then will live forever in scientific terms that is called the eschaton there is also another name for it it is what we ordinary people have been used to calling heaven he paused staring seriously at dannerman yes he said you heard me correctly we are talking about heaven the very heaven that priests and religious leaders of all kinds have told us about you see its real and our new allies have discovered definite scientific proof of this fact i cannot explain all this to you now i am not qualified and there is no time for our eternal life in heaven is threatened and the people who are threatening it are the ones i told you about earlier the horch i warned that they intended to conquer the earth i did not say that their reason for doing so just as it has been their reason for conquering and often for wiping out countless other intelligent races in the pastis so that when the eschaton arrives they and they alone can be the dominant race who will be able to rule everyone else forever the colonel smiled sorrowfully then waved a hand a screen appeared showing the second message from space the expanding and contracting universe with the scarecrow and the seven ugly dwarfs do you remember this picture he asked probably you didnt understand it when you first saw it neither did i but now it has been explained to me the diagram shows the universe expanding then contracting again as it reaches its maximum growth and then falls back it is at that point at the end of the final contraction when the big bang has been replaced by the big crunch that the eschaton will occur you see the message that picture tried to convey is true that part of it at least but one part of it was a lie it was sent to you by the horch in order to deceive you it is the horch not our friends from space who want to dominate the eschaton and they are ruthless enough to subjugate or destroy every living thing that stands in their way that is all i have to say to you at this time except for one thing it is now up to you the people of earth to decide whether you want to invite our friends to come to earth if you do they will display for you all the proofs i have mentioned they will do more than that for you if you wish they will give you freely of their immense store of knowledge however first you must of course have time to think all this over then i will speak to you again and tell you what they propose until then au revoir the figure went to black slowly dannerman removed the helmet wow he said and handed the helmet to delasquez obviously everyone who had already seen the new message was burning to have something to say about it but they managed to keep quiet until jimmy lin at the bottom of the list had his turn then they all began to talk at once what a load of bullshit jimmy lin said scornfully heaven for christs sake and martin complained it is blasphemous to talk of heaven in that way and patsy began yes sure butlisten dandan ever since i heard it theres something ive been trying to remember pat patrice didnt we have something in college about but by then dannerman knew what he had to do hold it he ordered all of you dont say another word that was more than martin delasquez could stand he said angrily who are you to be giving us orders dannerman i have had enough of being bossed around by you but rosaleen put her hand placatingly on his arm he was fuming but he listened to her please martin she said im sure dan has a reason for this lets listen to what he has to say martin looked darkly suspicious jimmy lin looked only hostile but both of them kept quiet so did the pats waiting while dannerman thought out what to do after a moment he nodded satisfied heres the point he said evidently dopey wants information again he must think we have some or he wouldnt go to this trouble and i guess we do but lets not give it away he raised a hand to prevent questions then turned and faced the mirror wall just as jimmy lin had done earlier dopey he called you hear us none of us is going to say or write another word about that message until you agree to our terms if you want us to tell you everything we know or thinki mean tell you out loud no more secrets well talk it over in your presence and you can ask as many questions as you likeif thats what you want then come here and lets talk but its going to cost you because this time we arent going to do it for nothing chapter twentyfour patsy the dr patrice adcock they were calling patsy was angry she sat buddhalike her legs tucked into the lotus position glowering at the world she knew she shouldnt be angry she conceded to herself that dandan had some reason for ordering them to be quiet and she supposed those orders might make sense why should you give away what you might be able to sell all the same she wasnt used to being told what she could or could not talk about what she was bursting to talk about was that whole eschaton business it was right on the tip of her tongue if only she could compare notes with pat and patrice to goose her memory along that ancient and illrecalled episode had been a very minor item in her education no more than a grace note in some course she had taken for easy credits she could almost see the face of the professor who had talked about it it was the young dark one with the bedroom eyeswhat was his name and he hadnt called it the eschaton something likeoh yes the omega point whatever that was supposed to be but she was pretty sure that it was precisely the thing that colonel duvalier had been blathering about in the message on the helmet farther than that however her unaided memory would not take her it was perfectly obvious to her that everybody else was dying to talk it out too well of course they were was it even remotely possible that this notion of eternal life tentothezillionth years in the future could be real or that some hideous creatures from outer space might be doing their best to turn that eternal heaven into some kind of perpetual hell the whole thing was ridiculous the other thing about it was that it was also just possibly quite true in any case she couldnt help thinking about it and neither could any of the other six captives it put a damper on all other subjects for conversation the seven of them did their chores completing rosaleens inventory cooking and eating their meals using the latrine when there was no way to avoid it but what they were thinking about was this eschaton thing if only dopey would show up then maybe dan could work out some kind of deal with him and then they could all talk freely and maybe scratch that burning itch to hash the subject out but dopey didnt show and time wore on as she was beginning to get sleepy she said something about dopeys absence to pat who had nothing useful to say in return how would i know why he doesnt come maybe that power glitch is screwing things up for him well sure but there must be something else going on it couldnt be just the glitch he got that new duvalier message out to us after that happened didnt he beats the hell out of me pat said irritably anyway maybe were not supposed to talk about that either pat wasnt the only one who was shorttempered everybody was getting antsy under the burden of dans rule of custody of the mouth then when they were all getting sleepy pat didnt join patrice and herself instead she nestled up next to dannerman again just as before evidently his silence was now understood and thus forgiven and as patrice was settling herself down she glanced at the two of them and then whispered to patsy whats she got to be pissed off about it was a fair enough question pat had dandan and what did the other two of them have there was certainly some jealousy there there was also quite a lot of sisterly loyalty to be fair about it patsy thought justly as she drifted off to sleep you couldnt really say that pat actually had dandan not in the total lack of personal seclusion that was their present condition patsy wondered drowsily if they could talk dopey into giving them a few more of the helmets because if everybody but pat and dan were wearing a helmet there would be at least the illusion of privacy while they got each other as they were obviously yearning to do or maybe she and patrice could patch together some of the blankets from starlab and make a kind of a screen to hide the lovers as they went to it or or maybe somehow miraculously the us cavalry would come charging over the hill with bugles blowing and pennons flying and wonderfully carry them back home and then the two of them could do whatever they damn pleased and so could she with whoever was handy and and then the world would be fine again but none of that was actually going to happen the cavalry wasnt really coming to rescue them was it their future was very uncertain but definitely darkif the seven of them turned out to have any real future at alland when patsy finally did succeed in falling asleep there were tears on her cheeks they slept and they woke up and they spent most of another long day of trying to keep from talking about the things that really had to be talked about and when finally dopey did appear without warning simply walking in through the mirror he said only i was delayed we understand that you were having problems rosaleen said courteously you neednt apologize he looked flustered patsy thought his peacock tail was rippling in dark colors and the expression on his furry little face was troubled but he said firmly i did not apologize i simply stated an explanation i am now prepared to transact business with you on the basis you proposed everyone was listening intently and patsy thought they all looked delightedwell so did she but dannerman was making sure of the terms no holds barred dopey looked faintly puzzled i assume that what you mean is without reservation i agree to that however i must tell you that there are things i cannot do because at present they are physically impossible to me the horch terrorists have caused serious interruptions in our communications with the beloved leaders and even certain of the resources of this base are temporarily not available to me but please you must help me to evaluate the message for earth it was what patsy had been waiting for she opened her mouth eagerly but dannerman raised a hand wait one he said if your communications are down whats the point they will be restored dopey said doggedly please do not argue remember that you are not indispensable sure we are jimmy lin said his face angry you need our input but not necessarily from your particular specimens commander lin do you not realize that it would be possible to produce new copies of all of you copies who would remember nothing after being taken from starlab and extract the information from them what i realize dannerman said firmly is that if that were what you wanted to do you wouldnt be talking youd be doing it dopey looked irresolute it is true that there are at present some difficulties in this respect he admitted very well i agree now tell me no no you first the creature didnt like that the lips on the little kitten face were drawn backalmost patsy thought as though he were going to hiss at them then he relaxed i will agree he capitulated what do you want from me information the little paws drummed impatiently on the muffnot inside it patsy observed and realized that in this interview unlike any other dopey was not keeping his hands in the muff was there something wrong with the thing be more dopey stopped as there was another ground tremor a mild one this time patsy observed gratefully but was surprised to see the way dopey reacted his tail went all dark his eyes were fastened on the wall there was something like fear on the little feline face but nothing happened to the wall dopeys fan slowly began to regain its color be more specific he ordered and hurry all right dannerman said whats wrong with the wall dopey paused to think the terrorists have done some damage to our systems he said at length the whole truth pat snapped you promised but that is the whole truth dopey said seeming surprised do you wish to know details very well approximately ah nineteen of your days ago the horch succeeded in transporting some of their weaponry into our base since then there has been fighting each time their attack has been defeated and each time they succeeded in transmitting new forces and attacked again much damage has been done and communication with the leaders has been interrupted who s winning more hesitation i do not know dopey confessed i have no doubt that in the long run our beloved leaders will prevail but as your sage john maynard keynes once said to your president franklin delano rooseveltit was on a documentary broadcast while i was still on your starlabthe trouble with the long run is that in the long run we are all dead im glad to see youve kept your sense of humor dannerman said caustically im only surprised to discover that you have one more details but i do not know any more details dopey said in surprise i know nothing of weaponry many of our people are dead now and much has been destroyed that is all i can tell you in any case now it is your turn are there errors in the second broadcast dannerman looked rebellious but gave in not as far as i know nothing significant did any of the rest of you notice anything no one had that is good dopey said gravely now about your comments on the eschaton if patsy had been prudentif all the pats hadthey might have held out for more information from dopey they werent pat and patrice were as eager to talk as patsy and it was pat who got in first we heard about it in a historyofscience class in graduate school the professor dr mukarjee patrice supplied eagerly yes thats the one he told us about some scientist a long time ago just before the turn of the century i think it was who claimed the same thing only he didnt call it the eschaton patsy raised her hand excited and impatient the omega point thats what he called it pat gave her a grateful look how smart of you to remember that anyway it was the same thinguniverse expands universe contracts big crunch everybody reborn in heaven then they stopped having run out of recollections his name dopey insisted who was this scientist the pats looked at each other tinker patrice hazarded pat frowned thoughtfully i was going to say maybe doppler something like that patsy just shook her head that is not satisfactory dopey complained now i must try to have a data search conducted through that primitive equipment on starlab have you nothing else to add they looked at each other again nothing pat said and patrice said only something dr mukarjee said he said that was just another example of the ways most cosmologists went kind of loopy after a while that is not a useful datum dopey declared but dannerman cut in sure it is now you know he was a cosmologist that ought to help identify him anyway thats all weve got so now lets talk about but what it was dannerman wanted to talk about he didnt get a chance to say the ground shook the wall flared again the sound of distant thunder drowned out his words this time the display lasted for many seconds no one spoke though dopey was whimpering softly patsy eager to take advantage of any new visions that might come through the wall if it happened to go transparent again faced it unblinking through all its swirling changes of color it didnt it cycled rapidly through the entire spectrum then resumed its milky mirror sheen she turned just in time to see dopeys plume vanishing through the mirror as the creature sped away oh damn the thing pat said feelingly rosaleen was more tolerant hes frightened she observed i dont blame him if we knew everything he knows we might be terrified too im already terrified as much as i can handle rosie pat said well what do we know that we didnt know before the answer to that patsy thought was damn little she listened as the others tried to piece meaning together from what dopey had told them but there wasnt a lot of meaning there all right things were even worse than they had expected but what kind of news was that she scowled at her own reflection in the mirror wall half listening to what the others were saying mostly filling with resentment for just a moment there she had been reminded that she had another life a life in which she was not a helpless pawn stranded in a demeaning captivity but a responsible human being who held an important job she was for gods sake a highly trained scientist it was time for her to act like one she told herself it was time to stop being so damn passive and start to take action the problem was she could not think of any productive action to take she looked at the others dannerman at least seemed to be actually doing something even if only going over everybodys recollections repetitively demandingly maybe she thought that was the way he had learned to interrogate witnesses in spook school was there any point in it did it matter how much they learned when there was nothing they could do about it anyway a snarling buzzing sound interrupted her it interrupted everyone else too it was not a sound any of them had heard before and so it took them a moment to realize that it came from the helmet what the hell dannerman said i think it wants to be picked up again patrice said jimmy lin said nervously you sure it sounds like its broken to me could be dangerous oh for gods sake pat said in exasperation snatched the thing from the floor and pulled it on over her head and then a moment later she gasped hey its a damn horch and its trying to tell me something chapter twentyfive patsy whatever it was that pat was seeing it was brief hardly more than a minute or two and when she pulled the helmet off her head her expression both astonished and bewildered and handed it to patrice it was without a word not without a struggle though martin was already grabbing for it but pat pushed him away as was right and proper patsy told herself even in that moment at least now they were doing alphabetical order again and was quick to take the helmet when patrice as startled and uncertain as pat herself handed it to her the most astonishing thing pat had said was true it was a horch that faced her in the simulation space it was not at all the same horch that colonel duvalier had displayed either this one carried no viciouslooking weapons wore no armor seemed much less evil but it was certainly a horch all the same and how such a thing could manage to use the device of the beloved leaders she could not guess nor had time to the horch didnt speak it gesturedwith both its boneless arms and with its sinuous long neck as welltoward a corner of the field of view and immediately a picture appeared there patsy was looking at a street scene in what she knew had to be a city though not any kind of city she had ever seen before the street itself was not a mere strip of hard surface it was a moving ribbon of what looked like liquid metal on which what looked like great multicolored dragonflies danced and now and then launched themselves into the air to fly into doorways set into tall buildings high in the air the buildings were alabaster and goldenrod and fleshy pink some of them a dozen stories tall all this was what she saw in the first eyeblink and she had no time to study details almost at once the view pulled back as though the camera were rising to the sky through the sky accelerating it flew higher and higher until it was out of the planets atmosphere entirely looking down on the whole planet pale blue and tainted white as from orbit then a spacecraft came into view copperyred and glittering and the point of view approached it entered it as though the ships hull were only mist and showed the inside a beloved leader swam languidly in zero gravity there the very scarecrow of the original message from space it waved a fragile arm at its viewscreen and somethingsomething something huge and dark and craggycame plunging from nowhere at the planet it blazed an eyesearing meteor trail through the atmosphere and when it struck the surface it exploded with the power of a billion nuclear bombs and that planet died before patsys eyes no time to think about that now either immediately she was looking at another street scene but the story was the same pull back into space see a beloved leader negligently take aim on the world observe that world destroyed and instantly there was another and another and anotherthe pace speeding up the planets alldifferent the end always the same and then and then the velocity slowed a world appeared in the field of view that she recognized at once it was the world patsy had always known their own earth northern hemisphere down toward the fringes that approached the equator she could see the hook of italy the wedge of india with sri lanka hanging like a teardrop from its tip the narrow red sea and when the view went inside the object in orbit this time it was not an alien spacecraft it was an orbiter she recognized their own starlab and there was no giant asteroid plunging toward the planetnot yetbut what was happening inside was even more frightening there was no beloved leader present what there was was dopey clinging to a wall while a pair of docs worked over a human figure spreadeagled against a bulkhead the docs were doing something to the back of the mans head then they drew back the human figure turned itselfit was martin and silently pulled itself to a lineup joining dannerman jimmy lin rosaleen and patsy herself the docs herded the humans who moved like zombies into the clipper and it dropped away en route to the planet that was it the picture went black they had all seen the same thing they had all had the same reaction so the horch want us to believe that the beloved leaders are mass murderers dannerman said meditatively which of course is what the beloved leaders want us to believe about the horch so where does that leave us jimmy lin demanded no one answered but of course the answer was obvious patsy thought they were left right where they had been all along in their cell but if the horch are telling the truth dopey also sent copies of us back to earth rosaleen said why would he do that do you suppose we will damn well ask him that martin said his face grim if we see him again dannerman said that alarmed patsy why do you think hes going to abandon us i think he may not have much to say about it dannerman told her if things are as bad as he says now what does the thing want he added as the helmet snarled at them again martin was the nearest he picked it up theres only one way to find out he said pat was outraged youre doing it again its my turn first martin looked at her contemptuously and without replying jammed the helmet down on his own head damn the man pat snapped in patsys general direction patsy didnt answer all these things that were happening were coming a lot too fast for her comfortyes and a hell of a lot too weird too she couldnt sort them out beloved leaders killing planets all right she was perfectly willing to believe that that was what the beloved leaders did it wasnt good news but at least it was comprehensible they were being warned but what was the meaning of sending copies of themselves to earth that was scary then everybody fell silent as martin delasquez slowly lifted the helmet off his head he stared at them blankly until jimmy lin snapped well yes delasquez said organizing his thoughts then he took a deep breath and delivered his report what i was seeingit was i think the vip dining area at kourou kourou in south america the european launch center delasquez confirmed thats what it looked like anywayi did a sixmonth exchange mission there once but what is astonishingi was seeing it out of my own eyes rosaleen was the first to react your own eyes but how do you know it was you it was i saw my academy ring on my handand i know my own hand and there were all kinds of european space agency people there tooat other tablesi think i even saw colonel duvalierbut i wasnt with them i was at a table by myself except for one other man he was in uniform and he carried a sidearm and he wasnt eating didnt even have a plate in front of him he was just watching me it was he hesitated trying to think of the right word it wasit was very unpleasant let me have that snarled jimmy lin reaching for the helmet pat was ahead of him she snatched the thing from martins slack grip my turn she snapped and put it on martin was paying no attention i could taste the food he said wonderingly i was eating an omelette one of the kind with vegetables in it and there was the shell of a papaya on the tablei could still taste itand a brioche quite good coffee too and hot it almost burned my tongue rosaleen was listening intently you could taste and feel so it wasnt just a television picture it was just as though i were there martin insisted but by then patsy wasnt listening anymore because pat had claimed her attention she was making sounds of distress and patrice was standing anxiously beside her begging to know what was wrong then pat moaned gasped and pulled the helmet off as though it burned her it was all woogly she cried suddenly whitefaced and shaking patrice put her arm around her if patrice hadnt patsy would have because she had never seen pat look so shaken i guess i was on earth all rightpartly anyway but i was in jail and of course there were about a million questions about that but patsy didnt wait to hear the answers didnt even wait to find out what pat meant by being partly on earth she went right to the source snatched the helmet out of pats hand pulled it over her head snapped the goggles into place it was a good thing that pats complaints had prepared her at least a little bit even so the shock was almost paralyzing as she found out what pat had meant by woogly she wasnt seeing one scene she was seeing two of them no not merely seeing she was present in two different places feeling seeing hearing smelling all the senses were involved and everything was doubled in one scene she was seeing herself with the helmet over her head saw patright up close as though she were holding her in her arms no she was holding pat in her arms because she could feel pats body shaking and at the same time in the other scene she was looking at a bare room with bright lights a small table with nothing on it a straightbacked plastic chair dunpainted walls without any pictures or ornamentation of any kind she saw all this second scene from a recumbent position because she was lying on a hard narrow cot curled up on her side with her open hand under her cheek but wide awake she was staring into space and she could see the door to the room all right and yes pat had been perfectly right there were steel bars on the door she was definitely in some kind of a jail when patrice took her turnno argument about who was next this time not even from jimmy lin everyone wanted to know what the woogliness was all aboutshe reported seeing the same thing two separate scenes both wholly real in every sensory way the only difference was that in the scene that corresponded to their cell she saw patsy there instead of herself dopey said they were monitoring our copies rosaleen said meditatively but like this seeing with our eyes pat was still shaken it gave me a damn migraine only she hesitated remembering only what i saw was three different scenes not two two of them were here from different angles it was the other one that looked like a jail damn well was a jail patrice said feelingly rosaleen sighed yes she said following out some private thought process of her own it must be so what must be so patsy demanded and rosaleen looked at her with compassion it explains much she said these copies of us that the horch showed us the ones the beloved leaders made and returned to earth they were fitted with some sort of transmitters to pass on everything they saw and felt how jimmy lin asked oh jimmy what foolish questions you ask how do i know how with a magical incantation perhaps or perhaps they implanted a tiny broadcasting station in the left nostrilwho knows what kind of technology is here damn dannerman said feelingly i see what you mean rosaleen thats how dopey knew the name of my boss colonel morrisey yes and much more rosaleen said she turned back to patsy and patrice and when in kindness dopey provided us with you two he first turned you into observing devices hey both of them said at once yes and so now at least we know just how dopey was able to read all our little secret messages that we passed around with such care you two read them for him whatever you saw he saw too in these last two days patsys life had been violated in more ways than she could countthe violation of the nudity taboo when she was first brought in the endless privacy violations that came with everyone being huddled together in the one common pen for everythingfor sleeping for eating even for going to the damn toilet but this latest violation was something new until now she had had the illusion that at least her private central self was intact now that illusion was destroyed some weird creature somewherenot just dopey who knew what other bizarre beasts were eavesdropping as wellsomebody was seeing and feeling everything she did and beyond doubt was still doing it it was she told herself an intolerable situation except of course that she had no choice but to go right on tolerating it chapter twentysix patsy if the others had taken the news as hard as patsy they didnt show it they were all clustered around whoever was wearing the helmet at that moment every one of them demanding another turn it was like christmas at uncle cubbys with every child demanding the one best toy at once even dannerman and rosaleen though dannerman had reported resentfully that his turn had been a washout since as far as he could tell he was simply in bed asleep and rosaleen had seen nothing at all didnt even share dannermans conviction that the reason was that she had been asleep but then there was jimmy lin his turn lasted longer than any of the others were willing to tolerate he clung to the helmet trying to wave them off with his arms and when at last he took it off he was beaming you guys had me worried he said you know armed guards and jail cells and all that but i was just fine im pretty sure i was in jiuquanthe chinese space center and i was in my old fiat electric driving somewhere from the base i know that road it hadnt changed much since the last time i was there i could see the launchpads way off by the hillsoh theres no doubt about it thats where i was and i was in uniform i could see the sleeve of my tunic it looks like i got a promotion too because i was wearing full commanders stripes i thought you got kicked out of the astronaut corps dannerman objected jimmy scowled at him well i did but i know what i saw so i guess they reinstated me anyway i wasnt alone in the car and i dont know for sure where the two of us were going but i think we were planning on having a pretty good time oh and the language we were talking in was chinese what were you talking about dannerman demanded jimmy gave him the ghost of a smile what do you think we were talking about it was a date man old reliable lin martin groaned always right there with his gonads blazing dont be so envious jimmy said enjoying himself lets see what else it was maybe late afternoon i think probably we were just coming from a shift at the base i was kind of hungry but i was alsowell martin yeah i have to admit that i was feeling kind of horny too rosaleen had been listening intently but now she frowned what i dont understand she said isassuming its true that theyve planted bugs in our copieshow come were receiving anything from them dopey said theyd lost their communications maybe only with the beloved leaders at their headquarters wherever that is patrice put in dannerman nodded that could be it remember dopey also said something about using the starlab equipment to track down the omega point man he may not have contact with his beloved leaders but apparently he still does with starlab rosaleen considered that it sounds plausible she said and hesitated then she reached for the helmet i think i would like to try another turn for myself that made everyone quiet down jimmy handed her the helmet without a word rosaleen carefully settled it around her head and fumbled with the opaque goggles until they locked in position she was silent for a moment while everyone waited then she removed the helmet again yes she said in a colorless conversational tone there is nothing there but blackness for me she handed the helmet to the person standing beside her who happened to be martin and added i can think of only one explanation there is no copy of me on earth but we saw you being sent there in the horch message pat said worriedly rosaleen did not respond to that except to say i think i would like to rest for a while then a most surprising thing happened martin took the helmet from rosaleens hand but he didnt put it back on he laid it on the floor and instead took rosaleen artzybachovas arm and helped her over to a position by one wall he settled blankets around her until he was sure she was comfortable patsy stared could this be martin for a moment she almost toyed with the thought that when they werent looking dopey had somehow slipped a doppelganger general in among them in delasquezs place well that was fantasy sure but to find general delasquez caring for somebody else was almost as fantastic by the time he came back the others were gathered around the cookerall but jimmy lin who had seized the chance to get back in the helmet martin didnt speak he stood over the pile of rations staring down at it but making no move to take anything for himself impulsively patsy spoke to him keeping her voice low so that the others might not hear that was nice of you martin for a moment she thought he wasnt going to answer he reached down and selected a ration packet at random then he said my mother was like that quite old but active alert in fact a very brilliant woman until her sister died her sister died patsy repeated the man was being even more difficult than usual he studied the packet for a moment then slit it open with a thumbnail they were quite close he said then afterward it was quite different for my mother her condition deteriorated very fast he looked up at patsy for the first time i see you dont understand he commented no youre right i dont but this must be very similar for rosaleen you see there is no copy of rosaleen on earth although we saw her being sent there how can that be because of course the rosaleen who returned to earth has died died patsy stole a look at rosaleen lying with her eyes closed and only a part of her face visible among the blankets what could that feel like losing one of yourself patsy tried to imagine how she would feel if pat died or patrice but she didnt try for long the thought hurt with kinds of pain patsy had never felt before something else was troubling her too it felt like guilt rosaleens exposed face was gray although she had stood as erect as ever while they were talking patsy remembered that rosaleen had been biting her lip and when she turned away she had limped worse than ever that was where the guilt lived it was her fault after allthat is it was dr patrice adcocks faultthat the old woman was here in this place a place that certainly was not a good environment for an ailing woman in herwhat were theyat least her nineties maybe more rosaleen had been comfortably retired to the leisure of her ukrainian dacha as at her age she had every right to be until pat called her in for this mad venture with its even madder consequences if she died as a result of all this patsy finished her meal and lay down to sleep hoping to blot out some of the things that were on her mind she did not want to think of rosaleens dying and she was glad when at last she seemed to be drifting off to sleep the sleep didnt last long what woke her was another groundshakenot big but enough to rouse her she opened her eyes in time to see the wall doing its magic trick the bright mirror was streaked with glowing pink and red the colors shimmering over the surface like oil on a pool of water the display lasted for a dozen seconds then the swirls of color disappeared it didnt turn transparent this time and a moment later the wall was a bright and unflawed mirror again and nothing had changed the others were all awake martin and rosaleen standing by the cooker patsy covertly studied rosaleens face but it showed nothing but fatigue jimmy lin was holding the helmet in his hand his expression thunderous what a time to lose contact he cried and as soon as things had settled down again hastily jammed the thing back on his head patrice gave him an unfriendly look then turned to patsy i think the son of a bitch is getting laid in china she muttered did you get enough sleep i took another turn while you were out and i waswe werestill in that jail and nothing was happening except that i was dressed and sitting in the chair just sitting there with i guess nothing to do martin did a little better though i will tell her martin said he fished a ration packet out of the cooker juggled it a moment in his hands before passing it on to rosaleen and made sure that the old lady was able to handle it before he told patsy what he had observed he had been standing at a lectern at the front of a briefing room while some other astronaut at another lectern was going over a d virtual of the interior of starlab it didnt look the way we saw it when we were there it was i imagine the way it had been before dopeys people rearranged it and every once in a while someone would ask me if that was how i remembered it and i said yes he hesitated that isnt the truth of course i must have been lying to them but i didnt like i was lying and that guard with the gun was sitting right behind me that was interesting but patsy had nearer concerns she drew some water from the tank and rubbed it over her face then used the space they had set aside as the latrine leaving the others to argue with martin as to how he could tell whether or not his copy was lying she didnt listen she was thinking about rosaleenand thinking too at the same time that splashing a few drops of water on her face was all well enough but god what she would give for a real bath not to mention some clean clothes not to mentionwell everything that made civilization worth having by the time she was as presentable as she had any way of getting jimmy lin was out of the helmet and his face wore a broad grin that he announced was great listen im not one to kiss and tell but do not tell then martin said savagely yes but honestly shut up pat ordered ah said jimmy understanding at last id just be rubbing salt in the wounds eh well i can see how you feel but i have to sayno he corrected himself catching pats glare at him i guess i dont have to say but you know what im thinking and he turned and headed for the cooker over his shoulder he called the dinner was great too gave me an appetite son of a bitch patrice said moodily and changed the subject patsy did you hear about dandan what about dandanlooking at him dannerman said reluctantly i guess its important enough to tell all right about half an hour ago i took a turn in the helmet i was awake all right i was getting dressed and i had a hell of a hangover what were you celebrating do you know patsy asked curiously i dont think i was celebrating anything at all i think my duplicate is in the deep shit i was wearing a collar you see collar the tracker kind he said impatiently the kind they put on you so they always know where you are so they can hear everything you say and everything anybody says to you oh hell patsy said suddenly sympathetic she wanted to put her arm around him checked the impulse with pat standing right there so youre in trouble too house arrest i guess pretty much the same as martin and you pat turned to patsy any ideas can you figure out why were all in trouble back homeall but jimmy anyway maybe dannerman offered it has something to do with what martin is saying about lying to them but why would we all be lying patrice asked reasonably i mean all but jimmy i guess what reason could we have dannerman shrugged no one said anything for a while and patsy looked around the cell martin and rosaleen were talking quietly over by the cooker jimmy lin was sitting with his back to the wall hands locked behind his head a broad reminiscent gring on his face pat was looking at him too bastard she said but hey think about it suppose we could get this little piece of technology back to earth suppose we put these bugs into i dont know maybe a couple of vid stars boy and girlor boy and boy or whatever listen any kind of preference anybody had and then we could rent out helmets while they were getting it on can you imagine what kind of money people would pay mad sex any kind of sex without all that trouble of actually having to find mr right and then getting a motel room and all and no worry about catching something or getting pregnant or well she said hastily aware of dannermans eyes on her i mean simply as a commercial venture i know what you mean he said kindly then he added i was thinking of something too i was thinking what if the bureau had this technology then they wouldnt have to get people like me to infiltrate terrorist groups or criminal gangs or whatever just catch one of the gang stick a bug into him set him loose from that moment on everything he saw or did would go right to the bureau oh dan patrice said in dismay do you know what youre saying it wouldnt have to be just criminals what if some government used that to keep track of everybody all the time talk about your police states and pat said meditatively maybe that isnt a kind of technology we would want to bring back after all silence for a moment and then dan said i wonder if we have a choice i wonder if that might not be some of this wonderful stuff that the beloved leaders are going to give the human race if theyre let in then there was more silence a lot of it as everybody thought about that until patsy sighed and shook herself maybe i should take another turn in the helmet she said and accepted the device as dannerman handed it to her as soon as she was locked in the pictures flashed before her just as beforethe same doubled images herself in the helmet as seen through patrices eyes and at the same time the bare cell on earth there she discovered she seemed to be eating breakfast some machinescrambled eggs far overcooked for her taste some dry toast a cup of weak coffee she didnt much like the taste of the food even less liked the dizzying duplication of images which threatened to give her a headache she closed her eyes to shut them out for a moment and discovered that made no difference she could feel that her eyelids were clamped shut but she was still seeing both scenes maybe she thought there was a way to ease that particular problem at least if patrice were simply to keep her eyes closed and sit as still as possible while she herself was in the helmet wouldnt that cut down on the spillover it might be worth a try she thought and was on the point of taking the helmet off to tell her so when the floor shook again under her feet she staggered the helmet images blurred and distorted but through patrices eyes she could see that the wall was flaring again by the time she got the helmet off it was a kaleidoscope of color and the ground was still shaking slow remorseless swings back and forth patsy sat down abruptly to keep from falling as everyone else was doingand they watched the light show on the wall in fascination and fear it flickered through the spectrum settling on a dull red that felt as though it were actually radiating heat thenit disappeared there was no color at all where the wall had been the smooth resilient floor had turned into a pattern of closely woven metal strands the ceiling too had changed the even white glow was gone where it had been there was now a mesh that looked like bleached burlap through which a pale light filtered from somewhere else the same light illuminated the scene beyond the walls rosaleens file cabinets the broad corridor along which dopey had brought them to the cell the twodomed metal object and all sorts of other things too many and too strange to take in at once nothing obstructed her view everybody was up and staring now and jimmy lin standing at the urinal reached out with one hand to where the wall had been he pulled his arm back slowly and turned blinking to the others theres nothing there he said there isnt any wall at all anymore chapter twentyseven patsy there was a story patsy remembered about a lion in a zoo for ten years that lion had paced restlessly back and forth in his cage snarling at the bars then one day the keeper was careless he went away and left the door open when the keeper was gone the lion padded over to the door and sniffed at the air of freedom for a moment and then turned and lay down in the farthest corner of his cage his head on his paws his eyes squeezed shut until at last the keeper came back and closed the door thats you dr patknownaspatsy adcock she told herself youve been pissing and moaning about wanting to get out of here ever since you arrived now youve got your big chance theres nothing to stop you walking out of here whenever you like well but she hesitated so did everyone else all of them staring apprehensively at the vista around them strange machines and distant gleams of light and from somewhere a pall of smoke drifting over them no one moved until jimmy lin glancing wildly back at the rest of them took a deep breath then carefully stepped over the little puddle of his own recent urine and walked through the space where the wall had been not far just a step or two actually before he stopped to stare around but he was definitely outside that did it for patsy adcock if jimmy lin could do it she certainly could she turned and marched resolutely out into the space she had never seen before behind her pat called worriedly hey watch it hon whatre you going to do if the power comes back on and youre stuck out there that stopped patsy frozen on one foot until she remembered no it isnt like that she called back what she remembered was how it had been when dopey brought them to the cell it was a oneway wall they hadnt even seen the thing as they approached from outside had simply walked into the space where the others were clustered and had then been astonished to see the wall of mirrors bright and impenetrable behind them everyone was staring after her she saw rosaleen her face still gray crossing herself and martin standing with his mouth open and dannerman experimentally poking his own arm through the space where the wall had been and she took a deep breath looking at the bizarre structures around her and said to herself okay sweetie now youve got your freedom use it or lose it things were happening in that outside world now revealed to them patsy sniffed acrid smoke heard distant and sometimes not so very distant at all crashes and pops from whatever it was that was going on just out of sight jimmy lin greatly daring had ventured a step at a time five or six meters down the broadest of the passages patrice close behind him and martin and rosaleen peering after them dannerman and pat were on their knees at the margin of their cell poking at something on the floor when patsy drew close she saw that where the base of the mirror wall had been there was now only a shiny line of alternating coppery and colorless segments each less than a centimeter long it wasnt real pat marveled looking up at patsy the wall i mean it wasnt solid it was just some kind of projection and when the power went off it just disappeared and so did the floor dannerman added not just our floor look outside here the floor on the other side of the boundary was the same metal mesh as inside or most of it was but a few meters away there was a section that looked as though it had been repaired with ordinary cementnot recently either the patch was stained and potholed actually everything looked pretty helterskelter to patsy some of the machines looked naked as though they had been meant to have some sort of case or cover some looked very old corroded with time its a mess jimmy lin reported returning theres a machine out there that looks as though it ran itself to destruction bearings scorched housing popped offlike a car engine that ran out of oil i dont think they used oil patrice said rosaleen said thoughtfully i wouldnt be surprised if they used some kind of energy to reduce frictionlike maglev you know or something like the balls the cooker moved on and when the power went off the cooker jimmy lin interrupted looking stricken and when they put it to the test it was what they had feared the packet of chili pat dropped in sat there at the bottom of the well unwarmed oh hell jimmy said contemplating another period of uncooked food and of worse at a sudden thought he picked up the helmet and tried it on then morosely set it down again no power there either he said what do we do now dannerman had a prompt answer i think he said that somebody ought to go out and see whats going on are you volunteering pat asked because if you are ill go along dannerman looked pleased then frowned better not he said reluctantly i wont go far and its easier if i do it alone dont you want to eat something first rosaleen asked put some in to soak he ordered ill eat it when i get back and turned and left without looking at pat again when dannerman was out of sight pat stared after him for a moment then sulkily took over the job of opening packets and filling them with cold water to soften patsy looked at her with compassion she was pretty sure that exploration hadnt been the only thing on pats mind or on dannermans either if ever she had seen two people with a strong compulsion to get off by themselves it was they but dannerman patsy thought had been right he had the skills of his bureau training and dr pat adcock did not score one for responsibility in the face of temptation she joined pat at the task of preparing food it wasnt a job she really enjoyed but it had one great advantage it was a task she was confident she could handle and confidence in dealing with everything else in this challenging new environment was absent from her frame of mind were the others as stunned well say the word as frightenedas she was she couldnt tell they didnt seem to show it if they were but on the other hand she told herself probably she wasnt showing that total interior terror either by the time her job was done the others were clustered at the base of the things that looked like file cabinets as she joined them she heard rosaleen say as she stood with one hand on martins shoulder listen am i wrong or have the explosions mostly stopped there arent very many now anyway martin agreed looking up at the top of the cabinets i wish i could get up there i might be able to see something useful you cant pat said positively youre too big to lift but im not if you guys give me a hand i think i can make it to the top it turned out that indeed she couldnot easily and not without a couple of near misses that threatened to drop her to the floor but she did it stepped from jimmy lins crouching back to martins hunkereddown shoulders braced herself with her palms against the cabinets as the general slowly rose got her arms across the top of the cabinets and with both men pushing from beneath scrambled on patsy heard a faint sound of crunching as pat got to her feet examining the legs of her slacks its a mess up here she reported panting theres scratchy stuff all over like spun glass but not that hard there are big balls of it on some of the tops but a lot is just broken into powder i think that might be what i saw before rosaleen called is it orange and luminous orange yes luminous no pat raised herself on tiptoe shading her eyes to gaze in the direction the others had gone no sign of dan i can see where the smokes coming from though its a firei can see the flamesbut not very big and a long way off and around in the other directionas she turnedthereshey theres sunlight real sunlight id bet a million dollars on it andoh my godtrees trees patsy couldnt say which of them had incredulously repeated the wordmaybe it was all of thembut pat was positive you damn bet theyre trees and not too far away either closer than the fire she appeared at the edge of the cabinet peering down do you think some of us should go take a look no said rosaleen firmly not now wait till dan comes back because she didnt say dan was the only one of them who seemed to have an actual planor patsy thought if not a real flan at least the determination to keep trying to find things that would be useful to them and then she thought what it would be like if dan didnt get back and shuddered chapter twentyeight patsy it was foolishness patsy scolded herselfyes and it was gender treason as wellto allow herself to feel so lost simply because dan dannerman was away it was also embarrassing because the other women in the party were clearly not as troubled about it as she all three of them were asleep even pat while jimmy was morosely poking at the machine that looked like a twohumped camel just outside the cell boundaries martin was flat on his back hands locked behind his head open eyes regarding their tattered ceiling with incurious distaste once more he had positioned himself next to the sleeping rosaleen at least patsy was grateful to him for that if freedom was an unexpected challenge for all of them it was a challenge that could hardly be met for rosaleen artzybachova the old lady couldnt move without wincing taking part in any exploration was out of the question for her the ancient body wasnt up to it but patsys body was and she was too restless to sit still im going to look around she called to martin keeping her voice low but not low enough martin didnt answer but rosaleen did be careful she said not opening her eyes yell if you need us and what patsy asked herself could a couple of unarmed men and three equally unarmed women one of them frail and old do if she should really need help as well she might in this baffling combat zone that was a thought that should have been frightening oddly she wasnt particularly frightened oh there was a lot of fear even something not too remote from panic that sat there at the back of her mind ready to appear if something startled her but curiosity outweighed the fear everything she saw was a new mysterynot one that she could hope to solve no but something to wonder at that smoke that drifted overhead sometimes pale sometimes inky black and stinking with some foul chemical odor the machines all aroundall silent some in ruin when she looked up crane her neck as she would she could get no glimpse of anything that looked like sky only layers and layers of construction and mechanical puzzles the first time she saw a doc standing motionless before her she yelped out loud she couldnt help it but the creature didnt move its eyes were open behind the fuzzy beard but unfocused the halfdozen limbs were hanging loose and still so it was with the next one she saw a moment later it was alive all right she could see an artery pulsing in the docs throat and it seemed to be breathing patsy couldnt resist she passed a hand before the creatures eyes the way they said tourists used to do for the guards at places like buckingham palace it didnt blink patsy was almost smiling as she turned away and that was when she saw the dead dopey oh jesus she whispered to herself staring the body had been roughly handled it lay in a pool of sticky dark fluid and its head had been crushed but it was smaller than dopeysmaller than their dopey at leastand the peacock plume was far more modest matted and discolored now but nothing like the great fan that dopey had worn that was enough for patsy she turned on her heel and headed back to the company of the others rosaleen was standing at the perimeter of the cell leaning on the useless cooker martin close behind they were both watching for her yes rosaleen said and patsy poured out everything she had seen i was frightened she finished im sorry but why should you be sorry of course you were rosaleen didnt say scared shitless she was kind and only said startled thank you patsy said and then was immediately startled again they heard a faint chittering sound and when she turned something very strange was coming slowly toward them it was a round well a round thing turtleshaped beachballsize possibly it was an animal possibly not feathery fronds extended upward from the shortlegged body and clinging to the tip of each frond was a tiny creature no bigger than a mouse the little creatures were all peering worriedly behind them chittering softly to each other and patsy was almost certain she had seen them before that sharktoothed grin on the tiny faces surely belonged to the variety of the seven ugly dwarfs called happy but i didnt think they would be so small she said stupidly she had spoken softly but the little things heard one of the creatures turned and saw the humans staring at them it squeaked in shrill alarm all dozen of them turned toothy mouths wide in fear there was a chorus of chittering and they turned their mount toward another corridor and galloped away out of sight in obvious panic my god rosaleen remarked behind patsy crossing herself patsy did it not seem to you that they were running away from something and so it had but it was martin who saw what that something was and called its all right its only dan coming back in spite of everything some little part inside of patsy had been hoping that when dan returned he would be bringing good news she couldnt imagine what the good news might be certainly not likelikewell like finding that colonel duvaliers expedition had got to starlab and found the transmitter there and used it to ship themselves and a brigade or two of commandos here to rescue them she hadnt really expected anything like that but there had still been a hope that dan would have something to report that might make things look better for the captives he didnt what he had was a bundle of metal rods tucked under one arm and a discouraging report looks like somebodys dismantling this whole enterprise he said i went about two or three hundred meters down one of the corridors heading toward where the smoke was coming from i didnt want to get too close thank god pat put in dan gave her a glum look i figured i had to be cautious he said defending himself although pat obviously hadnt intended an attack there was a lot of destruction some of it still going on i saw a big damn thing that looked like a school bus a bus well it was all yellow and it had wheels or anyway those big ballbearing things and it was on fire i could see it melting liquid metal flowing out onto the ground like water and a stink you wouldnt believe and then there was this other thing right next to it kind of a pyramid and it began to burn too i hope you had the sense to get out of there pat said dan gave her a somewhat mollified look you bet i did but wherever i went there was all this wreckage oh and bodies i saw a couple dead dopeys and a bunch of others i couldnt recognizemaybe like that thing you said you saw patrice that looked like the bashful but these were too burned to tell and some of them were pretty ripe too i think theyd been lying there for days some of them that seemed to conclude the report no one spoke until rosaleen said philosophically your food is ready me i think i will get some sleep martin was frowning over the pile of metal rods dan had dropped and what are these things i picked them up dan said selecting one of them and hefting it i thought they might do for clubs or spears maybe and who knows we might be needing some kind of weapons before long there was another unwelcome thought for patsy weapons to defend themselves that was against some invisible enemy that could melt metal objects without even being seen perhaps some of her fellow prisoners could take comfort in having a club to bash somebody withif they ever came across somebody who could be dealt with by simple bashingbut all the rods meant to patsy was one more wholly inadequate response to problems they could not really hope to solve for lack of something better to do patsy picked out a couple of packets of food and carried them over to where rosaleen lay huddled in silence next to the water tank although the old lady wasnt moving patsy didnt think she was asleep still she tried to be quiet as she juggled the food packets but she dropped one it made hardly any noise as it bounced from the mesh flooring but rosaleen opened her eyes and looked at her oh sorry patsy said i didnt want to disturb you i thought you might be ah yes you thought i might be what well praying i guess praying rosaleen looked surprised then comprehending ah you saw me crossing myself well yes patsy was embarrassed to have brought the subject up conversations about religion with religious people always embarrassed her she said its just that well how long have we known each other rosie and i never knew you were religious before am i rosaleen pondered the question i dont think i am exactly you might say im just stubborn its a kind of a family tradition my mothers grandfather was the metropolitan of rostov back in soviet times he died in the camps like a lot of our family so i kind of go to church every now and then just to spite the memory of joe stalin on the other hand she looked wistful then smiled you know my mother didnt want me to take science courses in school she thought it would ruin me as a believer now if theres really some scientific proof of heaven id really like to have had a chance to show it to her patsy suddenly shivered you knowmaybe you will but really you had to face up to this eschaton thing she told herself you cant just go on ignoring the whole subject suppose what the french colonel said is real suppose it doesnt matter all that much what happens to you here even if maybe you die no she amended herself thats not a maybe you damn near certainly will die here and probably before very long okay fine for if the colonel was telling the truth then all that happens is you go to sleep and next thing you know youre wide awake and healthy and happy and hey immortal that wasnt too shabby was it living forever in heaven but it wasnt really a very comforting thought future immortality was a theory dying was a fact not to mention the other thing even if the theory was right what about these damn mysterious horch or for that matter about the equally damn mysterious beloved leaders she shuddered again and began picking over the stored foods they were as discouraging to her as ever but she settled on something that called itself potato soup and set it to soak in cold water maybe it would turn itself into vichyssoise she thought optimistically then on second thought sighing she picked out a couple of others and set them to soak for when the others woke up rosaleen was giving her a questioning look patsy said sorrowfully i wish i hadnt got you into this rosie rosaleen looked surprised then gave her a little nevermind headshake oh dont blame yourself patsy look at the bright side im not dead yethere i mean whereas actually if i understand what has happened the one of me on earth isnt that lucky so perhaps accepting your invitation to come along has produced a net gain for me after all then she smiled what foolish things we think of shall i tell you what has been on my mind for hours now i have been wondering who might have taken over my old office at the observatory nearby patrice confided you know so am i patsy who do you suppose has taken over ours i hope nobody patsy said with indignation this jail thing must be some kind of misunderstanding when it gets cleared up well be back in charge patsy looked at her in surprise then nodded oh yeah i see what you mean that would make a problem wouldnt it i mean if we all got back anyway she said stretching her arms i wonder how old papathanassious getting along with his gammaburster counts and poor dumb mick and all the rest of the guys and patrice began and stopped frowning something was moving toward them through the maze of machinery everyone was suddenly standing half of them with metal rods already in their hands they they saw what it was a doc walking slowly and gazing from side to side when it saw them it stopped immobile waiting and what it was waiting for that appeared a moment later it was dopey bedraggled limping along hurrying fearfully toward them please he begged help me theyll kill me if they find me chapter twentynine patsy there was the world turned upside down for you patsy thought their arrogant little jailer now pleading hysterically for their protection it is not safe here he sobbed wringing his fussy little hands they go about looking for the leaders people and they butcher us also theyre destroying everything in the base the horch pat asked moved to sympathy no not the horch themselves what would the horch be doing in a place like this it is the machines theyve sent the killing ones and i am very hungry dannerman gave a quick look at pathow kindly did she feel to the little freakbefore he said im afraid we really dont have enough even for ourselves dopey looked astonished then indignant but i cannot eat your food no there is plenty of good food for me in the base but i dare not go near itthe whole area is swarming with the surrogates of the horch you must help me i have thought this out carefully what you must do is very clear you are a very violent race i am well informed in this respect remember i monitored your whole planet for some years you can fight them drive them out with this dannerman demanded brandishing his spear you took our guns away from us but you can have them back dopey said eagerly i can get them for you there are better weapons as well beloved leader weapons very powerful as powerful as those of the horch surrogates and i will show you where they are if youve got weapons like that why dont you fight them yourself dopey looked sorrowful the beloved leaders weapons require a great deal of energy dannerman laughed sharply and the powers out so this is all bullshit bullshit dopey looked trances for a moment then indignant no certainly what i ask of you is not bullshit there is a standby power source which is quite adequate but i dare not activate it by myself the horch surrogates would be sure to detect it and then the creature shuddered and added also fighting is not a characteristic of my race those others who were fighters were of a different kind and they are already dead as i will be if you do not help me now pat gave him a curious look you seem to be really scared of dying all of a sudden no dopey said you have misjudged this matter i am not afraid of dying the death of one copy is of little importance when new copies can easily be made but afraid of failing to carry out the tasks of the beloved leaders oh yes i am very much afraid of that so youd rather die than fail to carry out your task no no how can you misunderstand me so to die is no excuse do not forget the eschaton ah thought patsy her curiosity satisfied at last the eschaton the eternity of immortal bliss in heaven that waited for them allassuming the beloved leaders were rightbut less blissful by a good deal it seemed for anyone the beloved leaders found wanting in his duties to them if it was a fantasy it was clearly very real to dopey he showed it in his look and demeanor the plume draggled and gray the little kitten face wrinkled in worry then impatiently must we stay here and argue it is not safe here the horch surrogate machines may detect us at any time you must leave the base for a place of safety and wait there my bearer and i will secure your weapons and bring them to you it will take some time as we must go very cautiously and by a roundabout route but i believe we can accomplish this and then once you are armed i will lead you to the power generator hold it dannerman ordered go back a bit whats this about a place of safety a place of relative safety perhaps i should say dopey qualified outside the bounds of the base there is a habitat area which has been prepared for youit was to have been in a later stage of your experiment but it is available now i promise you you will find it quite pleasant not unlike certain portions of your own planet also there are dwellings already prepared there is clean water in a stream there are trees and flowers i knew it pat shouted triumphantly i saw them and they were in the open with real sunshine dopey squinted at her in reproof there is no sunshine at present he corrected her as it is presently night in this portion of the planet but you will be safe there relatively and i will have the bearer prepare a map to guide you if its nighttime how will we find our way rosaleen objected i said it was night i did not say it was dark dopey told her glancing at the doc he didnt say a word or even make a gesture that patsy could see but at once the golem stirred itself pulled out a pen like rosaleenshell no patsy realized it wasnt like rosaleens it was rosaleens a copy no doubt made as they copied anything else they choseand swiftly began to sketch a diagram on a scrap of wrapping paper it is not far dopey reassured them perhaps ah two kilometers see heresnatching the completed map from the docyou go that way past that large orange object do you see then you will see the open space just ahead go across this meadow here and around this lake here and there will be a path it will lead you to the encampment and you will wait there until the bearer and i return with your weapons then stop right there dannerman ordered why should we do what you tell us why because that is what the beloved leaders would wish dopey said in surprise also to save your own lives since it can be only a very short time before the horch surrogates arrive here thats what you say dannerman said we have no reason to trust you weve seen what you people do dopey looked perplexed you have seen on the helmet dannerman told him your beloved leaders have blown up dozens of planets dopey looked stricken i did not realize the horch had taken over that circuit he moaned but the people of those planets were enemies they refused to cooperate with the beloved leaders so you killed them all pat asked in horror dopey said earnestly it was not an evil act do you not understand in effect we merely transported them all instantly to their immortality at the eschaton dannerman was staring at him jesus he said shaking his head then obstinately but you yourself sent copies of us back to earth from starlab dopey recovered himself quickly so much argument for so little purpose when time is passing by he said in indignation but of course we sent copies to earth how else could we obtain primarysource data the observation units we installed did the copies no harm that was too much for patsy then why the hell are our copies in jail she demanded ah dopey said yes i see why you are concerned but it was necessary to alter the memories of those copies since we did not wish to prematurely reveal our presence and then they became suspicious after they discovered the device in dr artzybachova at the autopsy he stopped there suddenly aware of the way rosaleen was staring at him the autopsy she repeated as though she had to say it out loud to make it real unfortunately yes he said sadly i am sorry to say that your copy was the first living human subject in which we implanted the device of course we had experimented on the head of the corpse in starlab but that was in a very poor state of preservation and we were not well experienced in the procedure when we did your copy dr artzybachova i regret it but your copy did not survive by the time dopey had left with his zombieurging haste at every breathall the captives had had a chance to study the map it impressed patsy the doc had sketched as quickly as it could move the pen but the result was as carefully drawn as any geodetic survey chart who would have thought that speechless golem capable of such detail but the important thing was that everyone agreed that they could follow it rosaleen who had been very quiet not to say subduedwell patsy thought why wouldnt she be now that her fears were confirmedspoke up at last it is all quite clear she said her voice colorless her expression blank we should have no problem if we go to this place dannerman said argumentatively martin scowled at him do we have a choice you yourself have seen what damage these surrogate things can do maybe we dont dannerman conceded but his tone was reluctant patsy was studying his face whats the matter she asked dont you want to leave here he shrugged martins right about that we probably cant stay here its the part that comes after that that i dont like the son of a bitch wants us to fight his battles for him christ we dont owe him a thing its his fault were here in the first place but we are here she said reasonably and those horch surrogates do look as though theyre killing everything they can catch maybe hes right maybe we need to fight them just to stay alive he grunted youre pretty warlike all of a sudden i dont want to die any sooner than necessary is that so strange she gave him a disapproving look i thought you were the trained killer here what happened he shook his head what happened he said is that im well enough trained to stay out of other peoples fights especially against superior forces martin rumbled i understand your concern dannerman but we can deal with what comes later later the question is what do we take with us when we leave food of course remember what dopey said he cannot eat our food so we probably cannot eat anything we find there either how the hell are we going to carry all these things jimmy lin said staring at the mound of food containers well that i can answer for you dannerman said we can use the rods i brought back and the blankets from starlab to make travoises martin kicked at the rods contemptuously most of those rods are too thick to fit through the blanket loops he pointed out so we use the others lets get on with it hey said patsy and pat at once and patrice added its not that easy what did dopey say two kilometers rosaleen cant walk that far fine dannerman said she wont have to well make a travois for her too martin said with disdain using those toothpicks the thing will come apart in ten minutes and then you will drop the old lady on her ass its simpler for me to carry her chapter thirty patsy when they started on their trek to their new home patsy was filled with worries what was waiting for them there would they be able to follow the docs hastily drawn map without getting lost would they be able to see where they were going at all since dopey had told them it was night outside but when they reached the edge of the beloved leader basecut as cleanly as with a knife one moment surrounded by the hulking dead machinery the next looking out on a sprawl of meadow and woodsat least one of those worries disappeared they all stopped dead in their tracks looking up oh my god patsy breathed will you look at that sky they all were looking they couldnt help it overhead there were a zillion stars far brighter than anything she had ever seen on earth and far more of them there were red stars and blue ones yellow ones white ones on earth star colors were so muted that you had to stare at even say betelgeuse to be sure that it was really ruddy instead of featureless white here there was no doubt the colors were as unmistakable as traffic lights and nearly as brilliant there seemed to be at least a thousand stars up there that were brighter than venus at its maximum from earth there were a dozen or more that seemed even brighter than the moon patsy had heard of but had never seen starlight you could read a book by this was starlight you could do brain surgery by next to her pat sighed you know what friends she murmured were definitely not in kansas anymore two kilometers wasnt much patsy had jogged more than that some mornings before breakfast along the bridle path in the park in the days when patsy was still dr pat adcock who not only jogged but worked out in the gym once a weekmost weeks anyway those days were past confinement in that tiny cell had left them all out of shape and a twokilometer hike was now a lot they took turns dragging the travoises that were loaded with most of their starlab food three of them at a time with rosaleen limping painfully along when she could and riding on martins back when she couldnt and the other two following behind to pick up whatever rations fell from a travois and toss them back onto the pile but there was so much to see when she was dragging a travois patsys eyes were on the sky as much as on where she was going when jimmy lin relieved her to drop back and do pickup she was glad to see who was there with her patrice she hissed trying to keep her voice low enough that the others might not hear do you know what i think i think were in the middle of a globular cluster patrice bent to pick up a pair of softplastic packs and tossed them into jimmy lins travois so does pat she whispered we were talking about it before at first i thought maybe we were at the core of the galaxy you know the star density might be about the same but wed know that all right and hey back there dannerman called pay attention to what youre doing we cant afford to lose any food but he had stopped at the edge of a dark lake setting down the handles of his own travois to consult over the map with rosaleen and the general patsy would have supposed that jimmy lin would be right up there to take part in the debate but he lingered when everyone had stopped what were you guys saying about a globular cluster patrice frowned sorry we were trying to keep it quiet what about it well to start with what is it its what it says it is its a tight cluster of thousands of stars more or less shaped like a ball but if thats what were in then were really pretty far from home most of them are in the galactic halo none of them closer than several thousand lightyears wherever they are their stars are really jammed close together patsy added thousands of them might fit into the space between earth and alpha centauri a lot like what you see up there jimmy craned his neck then had an objection so how do you know were not in the core of our own galaxy christo papathanassiou told me once that there were a lot of stars crowded together there too sure there are but theres something else at the core and thats a hell of a big black hole if we were anywhere near that wed know because wed all be dead now from the radiation from up ahead dannerman was trying to get their attention quiet he ordered do you hear that and as soon as they stopped talking patsy did it was a thick slobbering noise not quite a roar definitely not friendly in a moment patsy saw what it was something was crossing from a patch of shrubbery toward the lake off to their right no more than thirty or forty meters away there were two somethings one larger than the other patsy couldnt make out details but the heads looked as hugemouthed and widenostriled as a hippopotamusthough wearing something puzzlingly like a mustache not really a mustache she corrected herself the strands werent hair more like the tentacles of an octopus the bodies though were streamlined as a seals and they flopped along the ground on their fins like any pinniped as she watched the smaller of the two slipped into the water the other planted itself on the shore and gargled at them again before following the other christ pat breathed from up ahead was i wrong or were those things wearing some kind of collars perhaps they are pets rosaleen said dryly i dont think i want to try to return them to their owners just now though please can we proceed they did they gave the lakeside a wide berth all of them watching worriedly to see what might come up at them out of the water but nothing did once past the lake the distance was short they crossed a meadowdelightfully speckled with patches of phosphorescent grasses smelling peculiarly of mown wild onions and mint once or twice patsy thought she heard a distant whickering from the woods and jimmy lin startled everybody when he declared hed seen something flying there but then they crossed a little ridge and there before them laid out in the brilliant starshine was a valley with a bright stream running through it and some sort of structures beside the stream they look like tents patrice said in awe yes said rosaleen summoning up the strength to stand for die last little bit dopey said there would be dwellings for us tents arent dwellings jimmy lin complained and then when they were closer my god they arent even tents theyre what you call yurts like the things the uighur ethnics live in up in xinjiang province you know and they stink so they did as soon as patsy came within range she smelled it a longago aroma of spice and decay on the other hand she was well aware that she herself was far from fragrant and she eyed the stream water longingly she wasnt the only one though not for the same reason behind her dannerman asked think we can drink that river water rosaleen was limping after him what choice do we have she asked painfully crouching over the stream for a closer look most of the others followed at that point in its course the stream ran over a pebbly bottom and in the glory of starlight from that blazing sky it looked crystalclear it also looked empty if the stream held any population offish or insectsor of whatever would pass for either in this placepatsy couldnt see them she put a finger in the water and quickly revised her thoughts of a quick bath that water was cold next to her dannerman hesitated then dipped his cupped hands into the stream he lifted the water to his nose to smell then tasted it it seems all right he said judiciously tastes good in fact that was enough for patsy she cupped her hands in the stream drank and then realized how thirsty she was and drank more and then more still she wasnt the only one either most of the others were following dannermans example until rosaleen said thoughtfully i wonder if we shouldnt have boiled it first boiled it how pat asked but patsy wasnt listening she was remembering what a case of violent diarrhea was like learned well from some heavydrinking and poorly sanitized picnics in her college days what would that be like here without any pink medicine waiting in the dorm dispensary to calm the outraged bowels down but it was a little late to think of that and now everybody no she corrected herself every one of the men the women seemed less bossyhad a plan to offer we need to make a fire jimmy lin was saying and martin was arguing first we must fix up some sleeping accommodations for rosaleen and dannerman was urging that they check the woods out in case there were surprises there fire first jimmy insisted to keep vermin away and so we can cook some of this crap instead of eating it cold cook it in what pat asked it was a reasonable question patsy thought wistfully of the score or so of pots and kettles and asparagus cookers and omelette pans in her kitchen in new york would they have to reinvent pottery dig out clay throw bowls on a wheel the way she vaguely remembered from one of the less enjoyable courses shed taken in high school but jimmy dismissed all questions get me firewood he ordered preferably dead stuff thats fallen to the ground let me worry about the rest of it and when there still were arguments grandly dont forget i was an eagle scout at kamehameha high it was dannerman who lost out exploration they decreed would have to wait for daylight meanwhile martin and jimmy lin had their way patsy found herself carting wood from the edge of the forestears alert for any sound eyes searching the dimnesswhile dannerman cut it into quartermeter lengths with the serrated blade from his belt and martin drafted pat and patrice to drag everything out of the yurts for inspection everything the yurts contained was old fragile and decayed but there had been things that could only have been pallets that still seemed useful well maybe useful certainly not comfortable they were sacks filled with powder that had once been leaves and grasses along with brittle sticks that still had sharp edges and they were more than three meters long and less than a meter wide they would do martin ordered four of them returned to the largest and cleanest of the yurts three to anotherwhy patsy thought amused they were doing sexsegregated dormitories and when he had made sure rosaleen was comfortable or as comfortable as she could hope for he emerged to help jimmy lin rasp deadwood into a kind of powder with the little files from rosaleens hair sticks and then jimmy did his eagle scout thing spinning a stick between his palms against a rock finally getting a smoldering glow from the friction and ten minutes later he had his campfire going throwing out orders in all directions only put in small sticks he commanded not too much wood what we want is an indian campfiresmall so it wont use up our fuel too fast and nowwhos for a real homecooked meal but no one was what they wanted was sleep exploration could wait eating could wait it had been a long day for everyone for patsy too but somehow she found herself volunteering to take the first watch to keep the fire fed she had had some idea that once everyone else was well and truly asleep she might just dip herself into that brook and try to get at least the surface layers of grime and stench off her longunwashed body that notion didnt last when she tried the water with one toe it was even colder than she had remembered replenishing the fire was about the easiest job patsy had ever had jimmys orders had been explicit no more than four or five sticks at a time none at all until there were no more flames just glowing coals because you didnt want actual flames patsy debated what to do with the longest sticks too long to fit in the tiny fire she didnt want to try to break them for fear of waking the others up wasnt sure she had the strength to do it anyhow and had no idea where dannerman had left his glassy blade but then she worked out a simple solution she laid them across the fire until the middle sections had burned through then picked up the ends and tossed them in nothing to it the hard part was staying awake for the first hour or so little pinpricks of fear kept the adrenaline flowing distant whickerings in the wood the gentle plop of something falling from a tree a nearby growl every sound was an alarm almost anything patsy thought could leap raging at her out of the trees but then time passed and nothing did and the fears while not going away changed character were they really going to try to take on the might of the horch killing machines with a handful of popguns should they be doing that anyhow and that biggest question of all how much truth was there in the promise of eternal bliss in this improbable eschaton the questions revolved themselves through her tired brainwith of course no answers she was fed up with the endless supply of unanswerable questions but then she had only to lift her eyes to the sky to see the kind of marvel she had never expected to behold it wasthere was only one word for itmagnificent she noticed as time went on that the stars were appropriately wheeling across the heaven just as they should do that pair of bluewhite beacons that had been low on the horizon when they arrived was now gone from view and on the other side of the skyshe supposed she should call it the eastthere was a whole new puzzle to gape at streamers of pale light stretched among the newly risen stars some of them almost as bright as the stars themselves almost enough to make her squint she realized with a sudden shiver part excitement part wonder at being privileged to see such a thing with her own unaided eyesthat she was looking at stars in the very act of stealing gas from one another a spectacle she had never before beheld except in plates from starlab or the old kecks she was so absorbed in the sight overhead that she wasnt aware dannerman was coming up to her until he called her name and then she jumped jesus dandan what are you doing up time to relieve you he said following her example and staring toward the east what the hells that it looks like something youd see under a microscope well it did all filamentary and webby but she was glad to be able to explain something at least when so little was explainable theyre exchanging matter stars can do that when theyre close and some of those are probably nearer each other than pluto is to the sun so youre looking at the naked hearts of stars dan if our models of star evolution are right she went on warming to the subject some of those stars used to be red giants but when the gas was stripped away they were rejuvenated they became what we call blue stragglers with surface temperatures five or six times as hot as our own sun the bad part of that she began but dannerman held up his hand please patsy dont tell me any bad parts right now okay you better get some sleep while you can its almost daylight and he was right about that too of course past the cobwebby gas streamers the far horizon was beginning to lighten and patsy felt the sudden weight of her fatigue gratefully enough she climbed onto the pallet that had been set aside for her pat stirring gently as she came in rosaleen moaning faintly in her sleep it was not a comfortable bed whoever made it must have had skins like armor plate she thought and closed her eyes but she hadnt told him what the bad part was the bad part was that some of those cannibal stars would sooner or later glut themselves on the mass they had stolen from the others and then there would be a nova maybe even a supernova flooding the space around it with radiation of all kinds at the congested distances of the globular cluster when might that happen the astronomical time scale was far slower than the human such things might take centuries to occur but when they did when they did this would not be a good place to be and the life expectancy of anyone out in the open under that suddenly lethal sky would be short indeed chapter thirtyone patsy patsy woke up with bright sunlight outside the opening of the yurt and the sound of somebody yelling at somebody not very near but not all that far away either when she peered out she saw that it was dannerman who was doing the yelling the person he was yelling at was pat placidly hanging her underwear on a tree branch to dry its just damn foolish for you to go wandering off by yourself he scolded who knows whats out there but you said yourself we needed to check out our surroundings pat said reasonably adjusting the bra to catch the sun not alone no she said acknowledging the justice of what he said but not patsy thought particularly penitent about it either i should have waited till the others woke up but dan i found this lovely pond just a little way down the stream and i got a bath well sort of a bathno soap of course and it was really coldbut i cant tell you how much better i feel maybe the two of us can go out later and then looking past him well good morning patsy did you have a nice sleep damn the woman patsy thought damn the man too they might as well be married if they were going to squabble like that she didnt answer simply turned and headed for the bushes then delighting in the luxury of being able at last to pee without an audience she relented she was just jealous she admitted to herself not merely jealous of the danpat relationship although she was certainly envious of that but extremely jealous of the bath on the way back she paused to peer down the stream and yes she was nearly sure that just past where the brook made a bend around a grove of tall emeraldleaved trees there was a definite widening that went right to the top of her list of priorities not to be taken advantage of just yet maybe she hadnt missed pats complaint about the cold but as soon as the air warmed up a little it was astonishing how that thought elevated her mood she glanced up and there was the sky the blue sky with fleecy little muffins of fairweather clouds scattered around and the sun the sun of course it wasnt their familiar sun of earth too large too orangey but it was a great deal better than that unending featureless white glow they had lived under in their cell and she was interested to observe that even in daylight a scattering of those incredible stars were bright enough to be visible in the sky this was not an awful place she told herself it was even sort of pretty the grove of trees behind her was hung with clusters of things like brightyellow berries the spiky groundcover stuff underfoot that was like grass was spotted with wildflower dots of color most important of all she was outside things might be heading for something even worse than what had gone before but at this moment patsy thought they didnt seem bad at all so she had a cheery smile for pat and dan as she rejoined the group and another for rosaleen and martin delasquez doing something with the stack of ration containers the only ones missing were patrice and jimmy lin and about as soon as the thought crossed her mind they both appeared out of their respective yurts patrice heading toward the bushes without a word jimmy yawning barely glancing at the others making a beeline to check the condition of his pet campfire to patsys eyes the fire was behaving just as it was supposed to behave it was a neat bed of glowing coals sixty or seventy centimeters across with only a couple of lately added sticks palely flaming on top clearly however it did not meet jimmy lins expectations he pushed the burning sticks together and carefully added two more just so muttering to himself then he caught sight of rosaleen what are you doing he demanded she didnt take offense were counting our rations she said and at the same time looking for containers that wont burn if we boil water in them thought so he said patiently superior i told you to leave that sort of thing to me didnt i what you should do now is find a big empty container and fill it with water while i get some rocks from the brook he made a production out of it selecting golfballsized pebbles which he carried back and painstakingly placed on the coals give them ten minutes he said wise old expert showing the tenderfeet how to get along in the wild then the rocks will be hot enough we drop them in the water and theyll have it hot in no time hey pat said admiring against her will more boy scout stuff he didnt deign to answer merely walked off to the shelter of the trees to relieve himself bastard dannerman said but his tone was tolerant he glanced at pat shall we eat something and then go explore if rosaleens through with her count pat said looking toward the stack of rations in a minute rosaleen called martins found a couple of other packetsi guess we dropped them but martin was standing a good three or four meters away how could we have dropped any of the packets over there patsy wonderedand his expression was forbidding he was holding two of what looked like dehydrated stew packets and staring at the ground somethings been nibbling at these things he called and i think i see what was doing it only theyre dead jimmy lins hotwater scheme worked fineto be sure at the cost of some burned fingers transferring the hot pebbles to the container of water but in a few minutes the container was gently simmering and meals were coming along when patsy got her stew though it was lukewarm and only partially softened it didnt matter shed lost most of her appetite when she saw the three little dead creatureslooking a little like lizards maybe though densely furredwith their mouths wide open in the rictus of death different chemistry rosaleen said soberly i guess i can forget that idea and when someone asked what idea she was talking about she explained i was thinking we might try some of the fruits from those trees when our rations run out but if our food kills them i doubt their food will be any better for us patsy stopped eating to look at the heap of rations it had not occurred to her to think of it as a nonrenewable resource she didnt like the conclusions that thought led to rosaleen with seven of us eating how long do you think the food will last rosaleen looked at the tally in her hand lets see three meals per day per person thats twentyone portions a day divided into according to this two hundred and seventythree portions say thirteen days a bit more maybe and then and by then rosaleen said firmly i presume dopey will have come back with the guns and well have taken over the base and therell be all the food we want from starlab or not patrice said rosaleen nodded or else we will probably have been killed in the attempt so its not a problem so then why were you counting the food she hesitated i suppose because there is always the chance that dopey wont come back it was what patsy had known she would hear but that didnt make it any nicer she pressed the point and if dopey doesnt come back and thats all there is how long before we starve to death rosaleen didnt answer at first while she was thinking dannerman spoke up did you ever hear of a man named william bligh i dont think so he was the captain of an old sailing ship the bounty hundreds of years ago i guess he was a pretty mean son of a bitch even for those days anyway his crew mutinied somebody made a book out of it i never read the book but one summer in graduate school i worked for a local theater and they put on a musical based on it i sang the first mate the guy who led the mutiny he was a man named fletcher christian i didnt know you were a singer who said i was a singer they werent fussy about that kind of thing at the theater neither was i they didnt pay anything but you got to meet a lot of girls there anyway christian made the mutineers put the captain and some of his loyal crew over the side in a longboat instead of hanging them out of hand the mutineers gave them two days rations or so and captain bligh managed to get every man in the boat safely to a british port a couple of thousand miles away they rowed six or eight weeks before they reached land and all that time they lived on the little bit of water they could catch when there were rainstorms and the food that was only supposed to be rations for a couple of days she thought that over another month or two in this place with nothing to eat at all and no realistic hope of rescue thats not particularly good news she said dannerman nodded we dont really need three meals a day though two would be enough i think that ought to give us another couple of weeks anyway but that wasnt really great news either chapter thirtytwo patsy when everyone had eaten pat and dan took off on their mission of exploration it surprised no one to see that they were walking hand in hand as they left no one said anything thoughwell no one but jimmy lin hey guess what he said grinning pointing to where pats laundry still hung on the tree the lady left her underwear behind probably figured it would just get in the way nobody responded but patsy and she said only shut your mouth she turned her back on him and walked over to where patrice was sitting crosslegged on the ground studying some carved wooden objects pulled out of the yurts its none of his damn business what they do she saidthen lowering her voice although you know hes probably right how about that bath in a while patrice said absently looking at a piece of agedarkened wood as long as her forearm one end flattened and rounded rosaleen wants to go along but shes resting patsy what do you think this thing is patsy considered the question although the object was worn and chipped at the edges she was pretty sure of its identity id say a snow shovelif they ever had snow here she hazarded some kind of a shovel anyway she squatted beside the other woman poking through the little pile of artifacts most were woodthe shovel a rod with a pointed firehardened end something that looked like a salad fork several things that didnt look like anything patsy recognized at all what wasnt wood was glassy rockone pretty obviously a sharpedged knife the others harder to identify they didnt have any metal did they patsy discovered sort of like the stone age more like precolumbian america patrice said thoughtfully those yurts are pretty well built and doesnt this look like writing she flipped over an oval chunk of wood and it was true there were things that looked like wobbly characters incized on the wood makes you wonder who these people were but patsy didnt want to wonder about these unknown people they were tall and skinny they lived in tents they farmed there was the remains of an overgrown produce plot along the streamand they were gone that much they knew and the only important fact in the lot was the last one the skinnies were gone there was no chance they would ever know anything more about them but when patsy said as much patrice got a funny expression youre sure of that you dont think well all meet up again at the eschaton patsy gave her a hard look and got up to put some new pebbles in the fire to heat that was another thing she didnt want to think about then when rosaleen woke up and announced it was time for the adventure of the bath there was another one patrice helped rosaleen to the ladies room in the bushes martin gathering wood for the fire decorously diverted himself to a part of the grove they hadnt investigated and a moment later appeared again looking perturbed theres something odd here he called come look as the others straggled over patsy saw what he was talking about it just stops she said looking in wonderment at the vegetation it did the gnarly trees they had used for firewood stopped short in a mathematically precise straight line the branches on the near side swooped and dangled in all directions but on the side away from them the branches were bent at sharp angles past them was a growth of quite different vegetation equally dense but thick shrubbery rather than trees there was no point where a shrub crossed into tree territory or a tree branch into the shrubs rosaleen studied the line of demarcation for a moment then painfully lowered herself to grub at the ground a moment later she had revealed the same sort of line that had surrounded their cell metal and glassy segments alternating do you know what i think she said wonderingly i believe there used to be one of those walls here i think so too martin confirmed and it had to be here for a long timelong enough for the trees to grow up against it patsy was craning her neck to see what was past the shrubbery and what she saw made her catch her breath look at that she called there was open ground there but planted planted in regular rows of tall stalks it looks like farmland patrice said staring and theres a pathand hey whats that thing over there on the ground the thing along the path was definitely a machine it had three wheels bicyclesize though the spokes were woodthe whole thing was wood as far as patsy could see and it had a sort of basketwork thing in the middle a farm cart but if there was a farm where was the farmer that was the next shock there was a stirring among the tall ruddyleafed stalks and a creature appeared holding half a dozen bananashaped fruits and staring at them it was nothing patsy had ever encountered before though even at first glimpse there was something about it that looked vaguely familiar what it looked like was a scale model of one of the ancient bigbodied longnecked dinosaurs maybe the kind that was called apatosaurusthough in this case an apatosaurus that was covered with curly hair all over its body strands poking out from the colorful embroidered shirt and kilt it wore on its tubby watermelonsize body and curly bangs that hung over its tiny lashed eyesand a very small apatosaurus at most a couple of meters from the end of the tail that rose behind it to the little head on the end of its sinuous long neck it stood on its hind legs and its front legsno patsy decided youd definitely have to call them arms and handswere holding what it had just collected if the watchers were startled the creature was petrified with fear it made a sharp mewing sound dropping its harvest and flopped itself onto the machine in the path patsy saw what the basket was for it supported the creatures belly as it lay flat its legs pumping reciprocating levers that turned the rear wheels its hands on a tiller that evidently guided the wheel in front as the vehicle rolled away the long neck swayed around so that the fearfilled eyes could stare back at them when he was out of sight patrice shook herself he doesnt look like one of the seven ugly dwarfs she said thoughtfully and hes definitely not a beloved leader but i could swear ive seen somebody like him before patsy had the same feeling she said maybe hes a prisoner like us maybe there are other intelligent races of captives aroundeven those things in the water last night maybe oh hell no patrice said positively this thing had a velocipede and it wore clothes they didnt rosaleen sighed and turned automatically reaching for martins arm think about it patrice if you live in the water what do you need with a velocipede or clothes for that matter people like us wear clothes to protect us against the weather but there isnt any weather underwater in any case its time for my bath martin looked alarmed thats risky maybe that thing went to get help yes perhaps so rosaleen said but its time for me to clean myself up a bit youve all been very polite but i really need a bath well take a couple of spears along patsy promised youll take me too martin insisted we will not patrice said indignantly but in the long run prudence won over modestywhat was left of modesty after those long nude days in their first pen the compromise they finally reached was that martin would come along to carry rosaleen to the bathing pond while jimmy lin stayed behind to keep an eye on the place where they had seen the dinosaur with the velocipede then martin would stay nearby as long as they were in the water but he would concede enough to their modesty to sit with his back to them and no peeking rosaleen called goodnaturedly as they began to undress patsy was the first to be naked but she paused before getting into the water appalled at the sight of rosaleens nude body the woman was skeletal her breasts never ample were mere flaps of flesh her ribs showed her hip joints protruded and so did her knees and elbows patrice had begun helping rosaleen toward the water patsy turned away in embarrassment and splashed in the water was still cold but bearable after the first shock patsy began to swim she couldnt help glancing around at the woods every few moments but really there wasnt much to fear was there and it was so wonderful so fine to be free in the cleansing water after all that time of filth and deprivation she rolled over on her back to look back at where patrice was helping rosaleen in the shallows she noticed that patrice was holding one of dans metal spears and wondered if she shouldnt have one toowondered a moment later whether she wasnt being reckless in swimming out so far from the others treading water she looked around that was when she saw the tiny pairs of eyes on the surface of the pond three or four sets of them nearer to the other bathers than to herself she screamed a warning and didnt wait to see if they would respond she began to swim as fast as she could toward the shore yells and screams spurred her on when she reached the bank she stood up to look martin was there already splashing fully dressed in the shallows furiously stabbing at something in the water with his own spear she didnt see the eyes she did see the water swirling there as though something large were moving under the surface patrice was hurrying rosaleen out of the water peering back over her shoulder in panic patsy began to run along the bank toward them pausing to catch up another spear from the stack beside their clothes martin might need help martin did need help something huge and slate gray erupted from the water behind him he screamed somethingin spanish patsy thought though she could not make out the words and fell back into the water oh god patrice cried it got him patsy didnt hesitate she splashed into the shallows to where martin was half floating half resting on the muddy bottom of the lake she didnt see the creature that had attacked him there was a stain in the waterblood from martin but it was some distance away and the surface was swirling there something was there and bleeding when she reached martins body it was motionless dead patsy tried to imagine what it was like to be killed to die suddenly without warning but maybe he wasnt dead the spear in one hand she wrapped her fingers in his long coarse hair trying to pull him ashore the man weighed twice as much as she she was barely able to move him and his face was underwater time passing if he hadnt been killed by the amphibian he might drown when patrice splashed in to join her she let her take over with the task of pulling the general toward dry land while she remained in the water on guard with the spear watching the swirl of bloody water across the pond something was heaving itself out of the water a good sign patsy thought hopefully they were running away the thing didnt really look like a hippo more like a walrus and it galumphed across the ground in its pinniped fashion it stopped turning to look at her with those protuberant eyes then leaned forward scooped up some mud formed it into a ball and threw it at her with its finlike paws the mud fell far short splashing in the middle of the pool patsy almost laughed at that pitiful display of hostility why theyre as frightened as we are she thought it did not occur to her that there had been several of the creatures she didnt even see the one that was coming up behind her she never saw it at all only felt the sudden touch of something cold on her back and then the sharp agony of an electric shock and then patsy adcocks question was answered and she knew at last what it was like to die chapter thirtythree dan before dannerman and pat had gone a hundred meters they werent walking hand in hand anymore they were arm in arm very soon thereafter their arms were around each others waists and their pace had slowedno longer a march now an affectionate stroll they werent so wrapped up in each other that they didnt take note of what was around them that was what they were there for to explore their surroundings dannerman observed that the path they were on had once been trodden hard by some creatures feetbut not recently since it was now broken here and there with clumps of the wiry grass spikes it was pat who first saw the trees that looked so much like cherries and it was dannerman who pointed out the hill that rose off to their left looming a good hundred meters over the surrounding terrain but they both knew that the thing they were most interested in exploring was not geography and when pat looked up at dannerman he naturally kissed her and when they moved their faces away the only question was which of them could first get out of their clothes they wasted no time the weeks of enforced abstinence and excessive intimacy were all the foreplay they needed when they were done dannerman propped himself up on one elbow to take some of his weight off her body and gazed reminiscently at her face you know i thought about doing this a lot when we were kids well so did i she said taking his ears gently in two hands and pulling his head down for a kiss but right now its a little uncomfortable oh dont let go of melets hug for a while okay only next time she added as they shifted position we ought to bring a blanket this mossy stuff has some pretty sharp stickers after a while they walked a little farther down the path remembering that they were supposed to be checking out the area for points of interest they didnt find many they had their clothes back on but dannerman was comfortably aware that they could get them off again quickly enough if they chose he rather expected they would choose it crossed his mind that probably they shouldnt stay away from the others too longdopey might come back and then they would have to think seriously about this mad plan of his to reconquer the base for the beloved leaders or alternatively dopey might not come back at all then they would have to think even more seriously about simple survival but he didnt want to think about such matters just then because he was too busy feeling good it was he decided about the best he had felt in a long timecertainly since they had boarded the clipper for the trip to starlab maybe for a good deal longer than that finally it was pat who had to say maybe we ought to start back dannerman blinked down at her oh do you think so i was sort of thinking that maybe we could of course we can she said patting his shoulder it doesnt have to be here theres plenty of nice secluded spots right near the yurts so whenever we like we can just excuse ourselves for a bit and she paused looking curiously at his face whats the matter it just seems so well obvious he said then she did laugh out loud oh dandan do you think theres one soul back there who isnt absolutely sure of what we were doing here come on lets see if we can get back without getting lost but of course they didnt get lost because theyd never got that far off the wellmarked old path and of course what pat said was right dannerman switched gears without difficulty he didnt forget the pleasant feeling in his loins but he remembered to pick a few of the bright red fruits to carry back just in case and even before that he was testing strategies in his mind in the event that dopey really did bring them their weapons that was the part of the dannerman mind that the bureau training and experience had honed to a sharp edge he considered the prospects if in spite of everything they were going to get involved in combat with the horch machines the first thing they would need was more information they would need to know from dopey just what parts of the horch machines were vulnerable to a projectile weapon and they would have to decide how to allocate the available weapons he had no doubt that jimmy lin and the general could handle a gun the females were iffier pat he asked have you ever been checked out on that little gun you used to carry but she wasnt listening she was suddenly straining to hear something whats that she asked her face suddenly worried but by then he had heard the sudden distant screaming too and he was already beginning to run when they reached the bathing pool there was martin delasquez lying on his face by the side of the pond his feet still in the water with rosaleen naked struggling to try to turn him over and just meters away a clothed jimmy lin and a naked pat were frantically trying to pull the limp form of the other pat also naked to dry land what he couldnt see was what it was that they were trying to flee from but the women were shouting the answer to that the amphibians how could that be what were they doing here so far from their own pond but then he saw the little eyes only a few meters from shore and then there was no doubt he didnt waste time wondering he and jimmy got the inert hulk of martin delasquez pulled away from the water while the two pats did the same for the third let me jimmy panted taking over from the pats once again his boy scout training was useful dannerman stood guard knee deep in the muddy shallows at the waters edge spear ready when he stole glances over his shoulder he saw jimmy bending over the motionless woman doing the mouthtomouth and the rhythmic chesthammering of cpr while rosaleen and the other pats copied his actions on the form of martin which pat was which hard enough to tell them apart at any time it was impossible when they were naked if the amphibians had any intention of attacking on dry land they kept it in check dannerman knew they were there saw water swirling caught a glimpse or two of gray flesh but they seemed more interested in getting their own wounded member to the safety of deep water than in the creatures that had stabbed him slowly dannerman retreated to the high ground spear still ready but beginning to feel a little safer when he looked around martin was stirring at last coughing looking dazedly around trying to sit up but the other pat jimmy was still working on her he kept it up for long minutes kept it up long past the time when dannerman could still feel hope then lin sat somberly back on his haunches shes dead he said he thought for a moment if we had adrenaline or shock paddles he began and then shook his head and repeated shes dead dead dannerman felt the word like a physical blow dead it did not seem possible yes sure they had all fated the strong probability that they might all be dead before long starvation most likely possibly some other assault from this hostile place but not now not so soon dan it was rosaleen drawing on her clothes and looking at him dont you think we ought to get out of here he roused himself yes of course but he hesitated looking at the two living pats and the one that lay motionless on the ground but which the nearest pat glared at him angrily its patsy you fool she said and began to cry chapter thirtyfour dan they didnt walk back to the yurts they fled as rapidly as they could all of them craning their necks to watch for pursuitbut dannerman knew that if the amphibians attacked again there was very little they could do about it he had organized them as best he could but under the circumstances his best was not a lot martin had turned out to be able to walk more or less he was staggering confused seeming tranced and bewildered with little strength in his limbs but jimmy lin supported him on one side and patrice on the other and he managed rosaleen artzybachova was making it on her ownnot very well either but limping after the others with pats help pat was carrying patsys bundledup clothing too and she had a spear to handle as well since she was all they had in the way of a rear guard against the amphibians dannerman was carrying the body of patsy jimmy lin had offered but dannerman could not let the man touch her damp cooling and naked body dannerman had her cradled in his two hands each one also holding a spear part of the time he walked backward scanning the path behind them for possible attackers there were none one of patsys lax arms hung toward the ground the other lay across her body as though trying to preserve modesty but she had no modesty left to preserve though her head hung down dannerman could see that her eyes were open and so was her mouth patsy adcock would never have let herself be seen in so unflattering a pose she didnt look pretty she barely looked like herself she looked only dead dannerman looked away they had other things to think of they would have to bury patsy which meant somehow digging a grave he would have to organize some sort of guard duty to watch for a possible attack what he would do if that happened he did not know the yurts were simply not defensible but there would have to be some sort of plan useless or not it would have to be tried there was another thought swelling inside him bursting to come outwell no he corrected himself not a thought exactly a pain a deep hurt that he had never experienced before and did not know how to deal with sooner or later he would have to let it come to the surface but not yet as soon as they had crossed the little stream he put patsys body down as gently as he could and began giving orders martin was to be put to bed in one of the yurts rosaleen in the other jimmy lin would be the first to stand guard while pat searched the yurts for something to dig a grave with the others listened attentively they didnt offer objections to his seizure of command they moved but they did not exactly obey jimmy lins first care was for his precious little fire and only when that was fed did he not pat begin looking for digging tools rosaleen flatly refused to be shut away from the others so patrice hauled a pallet out of a yurt for the old lady to lie on then jimmy returned with a couple of flatbladed wooden things that would do as scoops and he and dannerman began using their metal spears to loosen clods of dirt while pat and patrice silently dressed patsys body they didnt talk much there wasnt much to say digging a grave took a long time with crude tools even though pat and patrice pitched in scooping the clods of earth away when dannerman and jimmy had loosened them dannerman didnt notice the passage of time he was glad for something to do because that interior ache was rising willynilly to the surface of his thoughts when the grave got too deep for both of them to be able to dig he hopped out and let jimmy stab and scoop while he confronted it the problem was this how did you mourn the death of onethird of a lover this stiffening corpse by the side of the deepening grave was pat true it was not the pat with whom he had made love just hours before but certainly a pat indistinguishable from the very alive woman with whom he had talked and played and shared so much of a life from childhood on no there was no doubt of it when someone you lovedit was the first time he had used that word even to himselfwhen someone you loved died you had to feel pain dannerman did feel pain a lot of pain but how baffling it was to see two copies of that beloved woman alive and well and helping to dig the grave to be sure those other two were definitely mourning there was no confusion in the tears and selfreproach if i hadnt panicked and stabbed the thing patrice kept muttering to pat even while she was scooping away the loose dirt into a pile maybe they wouldnt have done anything maybe the maybes were not helpful dannerman stood up my turn jimmy he called and replaced the astronaut in the pit he had barely begun to dig when jimmy lin yelled and grabbed for a spear and when dannerman turned to look he saw a regular circus parade approaching four or five of the great docs marching toward them with dopey perched in the arms of one of them what is going on dopey called fretfully why are you digging holes i have brought you your gunsit took a very long time to secure them with much danger now there is no time for the digging of holes since we must hurry and reclaim our base from the horch dopey didnt take kindly to being told that the conquest of the horch machines would have to wait but then when someone had explained to him what had happened he was disgusted but surprisingly helpful general delasquez he remarked is forming a habit of electrocution fortunately one of these bearers is medically trained i will have him treat the general the hell you will patrice snapped surprised and angered what does that thing know about human medicine why a great deal dopey assured her it was he who implanted the devices on your starlab he will know what to do for general delasquezalso for dr artzybachova who i observe is also quite unwell patrice started to reject the offer with indignation but rosaleen overrode her she raised herself on one elbow and said lets see what he can do patrice im not much use to you this way that was all the consent dopey needed he didnt speak but one of his golems bent over rosaleen picked her up with surprising gentleness and bore her away to the yurt where delasquez was raucously snoring dopey didnt bother to look after them he waddled toward the grave where dannerman had replaced lin at the bottom gazing disapprovingly at dannermans digging what are you doing is this some form of human death ritual if you wish a hole dug to dispose of the cadaver one of my bearers can do this far more quickly dannerman didnt look up well do it ourselves he said shortly dopey clucked in annoyance how you waste time he complained i am very near to the limit of my endurance we must act at once or i must rest for a bit rest then jimmy lin says if the amphibians attack well let you know attack why would they attack although he added meditatively it is unfortunately the case that they are not truly civilized anymore they subdue their prey with electric shocks you have seen such animals on your own planet i believe they are called electric eels but it was foolish of you to get so near them they have no recent experience of land dwellers you see they have been isolated in their own pen for many generations now that the walls are down they are no longer confined and who knows where they may wander to no one responded but jimmy lin turning his head to glare somberly at the alien and all he said was shut up dopey looked surprised but obeyed the command perhaps he was getting used to it very well he said after a moment it is foolish to delay but i will rest for a few minutes wake me when you are ready for the reconquest of the base dannerman glanced up long enough to see dopey climb into the huge arms of a doc he didnt bother to watch as the huge golem carried him away another doc waddling irritably after he was concentrating on carving out a straight flat base for the grave he lost track of time he was surprised when patrice called down to him thats good enough dan he looked up in confusion all five of his fellow prisoners were standing there looking down on him even rosaleen and martin he had not even noticed that they had left the yurt he peered up at rosaleen she was standing straighter and there even seemed to be color in her face what did he do to you he asked wonderingly rosaleen gave him the ghost of a smile god knows as soon as the doc touched me i was asleep when i woke up dopey was there lying on the groundhes exhausted you know and the doc was doing something to martin and then martin woke up and we came out here dopeys still in the yurt oh yes sound asleep funny she added i didnt even know he could sleep he snores yes yes pat interrupted singleminded and impatient dan do you need help getting patsy down there of course not he took patsys body from pat and patrice and gently clumsily stretched it out at the bottom of the pit as he climbed out pat jumped in to straighten patsys corpse at the graveside patrice fretted i wish we had a coffin i wishdo you think we should say some words over her my mother taught me some of the funeral prayers my grandfather used to say rosaleen offered i learned them in ukrainian but i could try to translate but pat was shaking her head as dannerman helped her out of the grave ill say what needs to be said she said firmly patsy we loved you goodbye chapter thirtyfive patrice once youve dug a grave you need to fill it back up again patrice knew that but as the first scoops of dirt plopped onto patsys body she could hardly bear to look much less to take part in the work for the first time she understood why people bothered to box their dead in coffins before they laid them away the coffins werent to protect the deceased they were there for the sake of the witnesses to spare them the sight and sound of clods falling on a face that was once as alive as their own but as each successive shovelful of dirt fell on patsys body the shape at the bottom of the hole looked less like a human person and more like some random lump of anonymous earth and grimly patrice picked up a scoop and took her place with the others that earned her a grateful look from jimmy lin thanks he said and then paused to look back at where martin and rosaleen were sorting over the guns dopey was returning in the arms of one of die docs jimmy looked at patrice again this time pleading listen you can finish without me cant you because id really like to check those weapons out go ahead she said and beside her pat saw the expression on dannermans face and added you too dan well be all right the funny thing was patrice thought as the men hurried to join the others that pat actually did seem to be all right she wasnt weeping she didnt even look particularly unhappy she was frowning slightly in concentration as she dealt with the task at hand efficiently sliding her ancient scoop into the dwindling pile of dirt methodically dropping the clods in place to fill the lowest parts of the rising layers of dirt it was a good example to follow patrice followed it it was easier refilling the grave than digging it had been and then when it was all in and they had scraped all the loose dirt possible off the ground there was a small mound to mark the burial place patrice knelt to pat it smooth she was so absorbed in her task it was a surprise to hear pats voice patrice thats good enough im going to clean up a little another good example to follow and patrice followed it but then as they knelt beside the stream she looked over at the others then wed better see whats going on she offered sure pat said absently scrubbing at her hands the water was cold and the clayey soil sticky the dirt didnt want to come off then she paused looking over at patrice listen youre not sore at me are you about what patrice was honestly baffled for a moment then clarity came oh you mean about you making out with dandan no of course not pat didnt seem satisfied with the answer she was looking at the gravesite she sighed easy for you to say maybe she said it might not be so easy for patsy she was the one that got killed then just before she plunged her face into the water she added you know what im wondering i wonder if theres any truth to this idea of everybody meeting everybody again at the eschaton because if there is dan and i might have some explaining to do is patrice rinsed the tearstains off her own face she considered what pat had said could it be true that some sort of hightech heaven was waiting for all of them for herself for patsyfor all of the pats including the one on earth and for husbands one and two and for feckless illtempered mick jarvas and all the other people at the observatory and even for uncle cubby finally getting to see what his heirs had done with his money not to mention hitler and stalin and napoleon and everybody else all the way back to tiglathpilesar and nebuchadnezzar and dopey too in fact all the dopeys there had ever been as well as all the other myriad extraterrestrials in this astonishingly populated universe wherever found she couldnt imagine it would patsy in fact be ticked off at being allowed to get killed would it be like the wronged dead of the old superstitions coming back as ghosts to haunt those who had harmed them in life only these wouldnt be the sort of ghosts that contented themselves with dripping blood from an unseen wound or shrieking pitifully in the night these would be realat least as real as she would be herself in this fantastic risingup time in the remote future she lifted her face from the water and stopped herself short no it wouldnt be like that at all if they did see patsy again it would be that same patsy who was themselves who knew everything about them and forgave all just as they forgave themselvesand for the things that werent really forgivable simply accepted them and got on with it she laughed out loud and stood up startling pat who was drying her face with the hem of her shirt no she said if its all true you wont have to explain itll be all right chapter thirtysix patrice the others were gathered around the guns that lay on the ground spilled out of the copperymesh sack dopey had brought them in there were far more than patrice had expected and as they approached rosaleen smiled at them pick a couple for yourselves she invited all the guns are duplicated so theres plenty to go around but whats going on patrice asked dannerman and dopey were confronting each other still in the docs arms dopeys face was at a level with dannermans and they both looked angry oh what do you think rosaleen said sounding exasperated much argumentation simply listen and you will hear it all for yourself her voice carried to dannerman who twitched slightly but stood his ground you stay out of this he ordered dopey we have to consider our options but you have no options dopey squawked of course we do fighting your damn horch machines for you is only one of them we can stay here you cannot why not youve supplied us with guns we can defend ourselves in case the amphibians come back or who knows what other wild animals might be around dopey said plaintively you speak such nonsense agent dannerman there arent any wild animals on this planet not even the ones that killed patsy jimmy asked not even them they are simply control groupsexactly like yourselves you see there are eight different species out here kept in separate reservations and theyre all intelligent some of them have been here for many many generations theyre all thats left of races that have become extinct in their home planetsit is he added boastfully in a sense a kind of ecological thing but no wild animals what about the furry lizards patrice demanded i know nothing of lizards perhaps they were food animals for one of the species no the reason you have the guns is to deal with the horch machines they are quite large they have highpowered torches and cutting instruments and their job is to destroy this whole base so let them martin growled i vote with dannerman we stay here the little alien squealed in irritation but you cannot you will die if we stay here dannerman said soberly maybe we should take that chance we may be able to find something growing that we can eat so we wont starve not starve dopey said impatiently fry here ask your own astronomers now that they have finished with this foolish ritual you should understand the problem drs adcock have you not observed the stars patrice had a sinking feeling but it was pat who spoke up are you talking about dangerous radiation from black holes supernovas all that but there hasnt been any or wed all be dead already of course there has not been any that is because the beloved leaders long ago established a screen around this entire planet so that all lethal radiation was filtered out but when the power went down so did the screen that stopped them all dopey seized his advantage so you see he said you have no other option no you must help me i have given you weapons i have also provided all these bearers to carry the excess weaponry and whatever else we need for our task and of course to help with dr artzybachova he added politely now we must restore power and wipe out the remaining horch surrogates before they finish destroying so much that took so long to build jimmy lin emitted a sarcastic yelp what the six of us against machines that defeated your own fighters but your numbers are not a problem dopey said in surprise once the standby power is restored we can make many copies of you all you needa whole army if you want them commander lin lin looked flustered but dannerman was the one who responded the hell you will weve had enough of making copies dopey looked astonished you object to this but why we need not keep the extra copies forever once the machines are gone we can simply delete the unwanted ones no pat cried dopey stared at her is this some taboo for your people well perhaps we need not make more copies it is possible that some of your experimental copies may still be alive and there was another conversation stopper dopey paused surprised by the sudden silence as everyone was staring at him it was patrice who asked the question once more angry and startledand very nearly fed up with dopeys habit of dropping unexpected surprises on them what experimental copies are you talking about dopey looked uneasy perhaps i neglected to tell you of them he said apologetically there were only a few actually i do not think many will have survived there was quite heavy fighting in the laboratory area it was rosaleens turn to be indignant laboratory to investigate your anatomy and biochemistry of course how else could the beloved leaders know how best to help your people and then when he saw the expressions on their faces i was not personally involved in these studies he added hastily some of the copies may still be quite fit please do not argue anymore do you want me to take you to look for these other copies or not chapter thirtyseven patrice one thing you could say about dan dannermanpatrice thought as they approached the stark metal structures of the compoundwas that he reacted fast conquering the wilderness was out rescuing their other copiesif anywas in dopey would not allow them to enter near their old cell too far to travel in horch territory too dangerous so they traveled a quarter of the way around the compound perimeter before he paused and pointed to a passage there he said this way will be safestthough we must be alert and ready for attack at every moment everyone stopped while dannerman conferred with the little creature patrice was glad enough for the chance to sit down all this activity after all those weeks of confinement was tiring she glanced up at the sky and shivered that alien sun was setting those enemy stars were popping out in all their incredible number and the breeze had turned cold she touched the butt of the thirtyshot weapon in its holster under her arm and wondered what it would be like to fire at something that would probably be doing its best to kill her she was not ready for this kind of adventure but ready or not it was time to move on dannerman finished his conversation with dopey and turned to give his orders two of the docs will go first then the rest of us spread out all but rosaleen i can walk she protested sure when you have to you will but for now one of the docs will carry you at the back and everybody quiet dopey says the horch machines are not particularly sensitive to sound but well take no chances all clear then lets go patrice shivered again this time it was excitement not cold the last time she had taken part in an invasion of enemy territory she had been ten years old playing good guys and bad guys with the abwyth kids from next door she was out of practice she hadnt had a real gun in her hand then either probably wouldnt be holding one ready for action now if it werent for the fact that right in front of her dan and jimmy lin had their guns out so did pat by her side for them it seemed to be deadly serious it didnt seem that way to patrice it seemed like just another childrens game behind the two docs in single file at the head of the procession and the five humans who were capablewell more or less capableof firing their guns were the other docs one carried their spare weapons then there was another doc that carried rosaleen in one of its assorted arms and the last one carrying dopey himself it was a regular circus parade and why were they in it because dan dannerman had said so and what an exasperating man he was first he warned them all against getting into other peoples fights then he reversed himself without notice now he wasand all the others with him suddenly a warrior on the side of the beloved leaders against the horch patrice gazed darkly at the back of his neck in a way she didnt envy pat for her lover in some ways dan was a most unsatisfactory man lovers were supposed to communicate not dan dannerman you never knew what he was going to be doing next but in another way of course she envied pat very much indeed she hoped the doc who was striding ahead of them knew where he was going patrice didnt nothing looked familiar except in the way that one patch of desolation looked pretty much like all the others she had long since stopped wondering about the strange objects they were passing there was one period not long after they entered the compound that she didnt like to think about first there was a hint of something foul in the air it became a definite stenchgrowing then horribly intense then gradually fading againthat could be nothing but dead things she never quite saw the corpses whatever species they were but there was no doubt of what she was smelling and no doubt that there had been a lot of killing somewhere nearby but after that there was nothing but their slow march and nothing happening then something did happen between the time patrice saw the first doc suddenly turn and begin to run back squeaking in a shrill soprano and the time she saw the big silvercolored spidery thing appear from between the orangecolored crystal sphere and the jade pylons and they all began shooting at it there was only a moment it was time enough for her to be astonished that the doc had spoken at all before that she had never heard one of them make a sound but then she saw that dannerman had flung himself to the ground on one side of the corridor his thirtyshot out and firing and jimmy lin had done the same on the other and she realized she had to follow their example it all happened very fast the doc was able to run only a few steps before there was this sudden staccato sound like shrill bees buzzing bzhit bzhit bzhit patrice saw nothing that looked like either a projectile or a ray but she saw the effects all right as at once the first docs head burst openspray of orangered blood and tissue flying out in all directionsand then the horch machine was skating toward them fast on its spidery wheeled legs the second doc leaped forward to catch its fellowtoo lateand there was more bzhit bzhit and the whole right side of that ones body exploded too but by then everybody was shootingeven patrice herself startled at the unexpected recoil from the gun dannerman had given her and her shots going wild even pat next to her on the ground even martin delasquez standing wobbly but erect in the middle of the passage but shooting his heavier gun with two hands they didnt all miss pieces flew off the machine two of its legs collapsed and it clattered to the ground a moment later something inside it flared and crackled and it lay still and behind her where he had hidden himself behind the massive trunk of the doc that had been carrying him dopey was crying stop firing the machines do not respond quickly to sound but it will attract them if you keep on shooting in the sudden silence both jimmy lin and dannerman jumped to their feet and ran to inspect the wrecked machine dannerman gave it only a glance then turned back leaving jimmy to kick at the thing suspiciously dannerman ran straight to patrice and dropped to his knees beside her are you all right he demanded she rolled over to gaze up at him im fine she said but im patrice thats your patwho was already getting up and looking toward themover there the two docs that had been given the point were both messily dead but so was the horch machine dopey was fretting i should not have used two of them to draw fire i can only spare one now but we must not delay have you all got loaded guns dannerman might or might not have been listening his expression was unreadable he was standing over the destroyed machine his gun in one hand the other arm around pats waist beside him patrice was standing nearby somberly watching them she did after all wish it was she that dannerman was holding it wasnt envy exactly she didnt feel any real jealousy of patshe definitely wanted pat to have someone to hold her too she wanted nothing but good for pat but it would have been better she thought if dopey had produced an extra dan dannerman or two along with the pat adcocks she turned to look at the others rosaleen and martin were fussing over each other while jimmy lin checked the magazine of his gun and the three remaining docs were standing quietly waiting for orders that was reassuring a little bit they had all got through at least this first firefightwell all but the two dead docs dannerman kicked at the dead machine triangular body now blazing quietly the long legs crumpled he turned challengingly to dopey if theyre that easy to kill why couldnt your people handle them dopey looked defensive because there were so many of them they kept coming every time we thought we had them cleaned up the horch managed to capture another channel and they sent more of them in and it was all to do over againand finally we had no fighters left to oppose them please let us move on we are very exposed here dannerman shook his head tell me first how many more of those things are there how do i know a few not very many i thinkbut please dannerman disregarded the urging he had another question are you sure you know where were going out of my own knowledge no of course not how could i there is so much destruction i cannot recognize anything but the bearers do so please hurry dannerman didnt answer right away he stood there with his arm around pats waist he was thinking about something but patrice could not guess what whatever it was he did not choose to share it jimmy lin was losing patience are we going or not he demanded yes sure dannerman said at last then kissed pat and took up his place in the procession as dopey ordained it with two docs fewer to deploy dopey ordered the one with the weapons to take the point then came dannerman and jimmy then pat and patrice and martin then the other docs with their passengers rosaleen and dopey himself patrices heart was still pounding from the excitement of the fight she had seen shootouts on the television news of coursejust before they left there had been the one between the police and the subway terrorists when the lennilenape ghost dance revengers tried to blow up grand central terminal and there had been at least a dozen other battles over the yearsbut she had never expected to take part in a gunfight herself she had never imagined someone actually trying to kill her and herself shooting back the funny thing was that she wasnt frightened it had something to do with having a chance to do some shooting herself it was certainly far better to be taking action any kind of action than just having things happen to her she rehearsed every moment of the fight critically looking for things she might have done wrong she resolved to be ready for the weapons recoil next timeif there was a next time she wouldnt miss she vowed and almost fired her gun in reflex when the lead doc suddenly stopped glanced around then down at the ground then it moved on a few more meters to an intersection and simply stood there waiting dannerman and jimmy lin were the first ones on the spot and they both recoiled oh christ jimmy moaned makes me want to puke it did patrice too as soon as she saw what they were looking at it was a corpsenot human not a dopey or a docor more accurately it was about half of a corpse its a bashful patrice said recognizing it one of the ones she and patsy had seen before being brought to the cell it looks like that other dopey did after we killed him lin said in disgust apparently the builtin wastedisposal system in the flooring had been in the process of disposing of this bit of waste when the power went off yes said dopey climbing down from his bearer and puffing toward them it is one of our fighters mercilessly murdered by die abominable horch machines and see he has his weapon with him this thing dannerman asked picking up the shiny object that lay next to the corpse he handled it cautiously jimmy lin and martin fidgeting as close to him as they could stand both obviously yearning to get their own hands on the thing patrice had no such desire she didnt want to touch it at all it looked deadly clearly it was not designed for a human being it didnt have a stock it had a belly plate of some dark red substance that looked rubbery it didnt have a trigger but a pair of metal loops like the finger holes on a pair of scissors and it didnt have sights when jimmy lin pointed that out dopey said impatiently sights why would it have sights such things are not necessary when it is aimed there is a beam of green radiation like a pocket torch you mean a flashlight yes are they not the same thing that green ray is not the particle flux itself only a beam of light to help you guide it but what you touch with the beam of light will be destroyed by the particle flux to fire it nothing is easier you put your fingers in those loops and draw them together the closer they are drawn the more energy the particle beam carries like this jimmy lin asked experimenting dopey closed his eyes in silent despair yes exactly like that he said obviously restraining himself and if there had been any power for the weapon you would have killed dr artzybachova please all of you i know you are not experienced with this weapon but you must take care to patsys surprise dannerman had another of those offthemainpoint questions so why are you bothering with us amateurs why dont you make more of your trained fighters dopey looked evasive yes that would be better in some ways perhaps he agreed but but you cant do it right dopey hesitated for a moment that is true he said at last at this moment once we have restored the poweronce we have access to the damaged terminalsthen it is quite possible that we could do so but please let us not waste time dannerman held his ground thats the other thing so we get the power on and we kill the rest of the horch machines for you for all of us agent dannerman your lives are also at risk whatever you say then what why then we attempt to restore the damaged terminals if we cannot we simply wait for the beloved leaders to restore communication is that not obvious now i must insist which will be when oh agent dannerman why do you choose this time to ask foolish questions it will happen when it happens first the beloved leaders must send another physical spacecraft with a new tachyon terminal dedicated to the proper channel how long will that take to get here i do not know how long since such a spacecraft cannot exceed the speed of light perhaps very long but you see he added reasonably the length of time does not matter if we grow too old to be serviceable we will simply generate new copies of ourselves to replace us that will be no problem no problem dannerman repeated mildly enough not at all and we can repeat it as often as necessary in that way we can continue to carry on our duties here for centuries if that is necessary now no more questions we must go chapter thirtyeight patrice until without warning the lead doc stopped short and stood motionless waiting for the rest to catch up patrice hardly noticed where they were going she could not get what dopey had said out of her mind for centuries if that is necessary but centuries of what of carrying out dopeys plan growing old in this miserable place never going home again manufacturing a new pat adcock and a new dopey and a new everybody else when the present ones were too old or too enfeebled to carry on and then what then quietly allowing themselves to die with the next generation in place and the next and the next whatever joy that prospect might have for dopey it had none for patrice on the other hand on the other hand she told herself to test out the implications of it all those replacements would likely include an allotment of new dan dannermans so that there might be enough of him for patrice to have one of her own but then what make some more pat adcocks too so that martin and jimmy lin might have mates as well and what did you say to the new arrival blinking and confused as he stepped out of the machine hi im patrice and weve copied you so that i can get laid now and then unfortunately theres not much else to do around here but welcome the thought was comical enough to make patrice laugh out loud it wasnt a happy laugh and it made pat turn and frown at her but none of the others heard because dopey was pounding his little fists on a machine that looked like a huge greenenameled refrigerator and shrieking joyously thats it thats the terminal patrice looked around bewildered everybody else seemed excited about it even rosaleen and martin supporting each other tottered over to touch the thing and pat and dannerman were hugging each other ive been here before she whispered so softly that no one heard but it was true it had been a different place then everything working and intact but it was where she and patsy had first discovered themselves in this place it was different now and what struck patrice was the pervasive odor that hung in the air it was the same decayingmeat stink she had smelled before there definitely had been fighting around here she thought the terminal was intact and so was everything on that side of the little square they were in but on the other side ruined machinery and longdead ashes showed that somebody had been doing something violent not long before dannerman turned to dopey you said you were going to bring us to the experimental copies he said accusingly dopey looked away from the doc he was talking to the copies yes their space was quite near here i do not see them so perhaps he shrugged and returned to the doc which silently listened then moved away dannerman advanced on the alien his gun in his hand his expression dangerous if there are any human beings here we want to see them now dopey looked up at him the kitten whiskers trembling the plume draggled certainly you can look around agent dannerman if any survive i do not think they would have gone far this is where their food was kept but please remain on guard the horch machines were careful not to destroy this terminal so it is quite likely one or more will be somewhere near this area to watch over it and he stopped gazing toward the second doc which had abruptly moved swiftly toward the wreckage and begun to pull away one of the metal plates there was movement behind it at once everybody turned guns ready a face peered out of the space behind the plate it was looking directly at patrice and oh god said yet another dr patrice adcock youre more of me chapter thirtynine patrice it all evened out in the long run patrice thought to herself wondering if she were going out of her mind you lose one pat you get another to fill the gap this particular pat though was something special she had clearly been through hell even more hell than the rest of them her face was haggard her bearing twitchy patrice longed to comfort her but reunions had to wait dopey had no particular interest in one pat more or lesshis main concern was dispatching one of the docs to find the standby generator and start it upand the only interest the new pat showed in dopey and his docs was to stay as far away from them as she could first things first dannerman ordered i want somebody with a gun at every entrance in case one of those things shows up nobody argued though patrice would have preferred to fuss over the new pat as rosaleen alone could be spared to do instead of standing guard weapon out and ready where she could see a few dozen meters down a passage she wasnt doing a very good job of guarding she couldnt help peering worriedly over her shoulder at the new pat adcock the woman looked really terrible extreme fatigue yes that figured marks of pain and stress on her face why not shed obviously been through a tough time but there was something else that was nagging at patrice while her new copy was doing her best to answer questions and there were lots of questions are there any others not anymore do you mean the others are dead christ yes cant you smell them but listen do you guys have anything to eat well they didnt dopey had promised there would be all the food they wanted once the terminal was working again so why encumber themselves he was fidgeting about doing his best to ignore the petty human concerns please he begged in agitation it will be some time before the bearer can have the power on line perhaps as much as an hour then all will be well but now we are still in great danger be vigilant we must not be stopped now when we are so close what dannerman was saying something to him pointing to the new pat oh very well dopey said impatiently and glanced at the two remaining docs who at once moved toward the new pat who shrieked keep them away from me and turned as though about to run but dannerman stopped her its all right he soothed honest i just want you checked over this ones done it for us before with martin and rosaleen hes a kind of medical specialist i know what kind of specialists they are but by then the one doc had her firmly held and the other was gently tapping and probing with its smaller arms just as they had done with martin delasquez the new pat whimpered softly throughout the examination but she didnt resist the procedure took only a few moments then the docs released her and stepped back once again motionless in that corpselike standby mode this transcription appears to be well enough dopey announced there is a certain amount of malnutrition yes but that will be mended when we have the terminal going otherwise her condition is normal apart from some exhaustionallowing of course for the fact that she is pregnant one conversation stopper after another patrice thought the creature was full of them she backed away from her sentry postnot so far that she couldnt still see down the short corridor far enough so that she could look their new recruit in the face are you uh all right she asked the woman stared at her backing away from dopey and the docs he says so she said shortly and then well i guess i am more or less she was looking from pat to patrice it seemed a time for introductions im patrice this is pat there was another onewell patrice said firmly closing that topic there was another one but she died what should we call you the newcomer opened her eyes wide at that but she answered civilly enough the others just called me pat mostly because there was usually only one of us alive at a time but rosaleen said i was pat five if that helps dannerman swore pat five they had that many of you they had at least that many of me she corrected i dont guarantee the count but you can call me five if you want to whats happening and when they had done their best to fill her in she scowled at the dopey you mean the best we can hope for is to stay alive with the bird and the brutes in this wreckageforever the dopey craned his neck to peer at her over his plume wreckage but it will not remain wreckage dr adcock five once the horch problem is eliminated we will build it all up again better than ever you will see that will be a job for the bearers that is what they are good at they seem to be pretty handy gadgets to have around dannerman remarked causing patrice to give him a sharp look what was the matter with the man was he losing his mind or thinking about something he didnt want to discuss she wondered which oh yes highly intelligent dopey was agreeing unfortunately their people foolishly declined to cooperate with the beloved leaders they resisted quite violently in fact ultimately it was necessary to dispatch most of their race directly to the eschaton these specimens have been preserved they are quite tractable now since they were amended to remove their violent natures of course they are no longer capable of acting on their own very much but they are very good at following orders dopeys mind didnt seem to be on what he was saying he was twisting in all directions to peer down the various approaches youve all got your weapons ready we could be attacked at any time patrice exhaled softly amended she repeated to herself quite tractable she looked around at the others to see if they were thinking what she was she couldnt tell dannerman had gone off to talk to martin and rosaleen the others simply looked grim whether it was because like herself they were considering the possibility that the beloved leaders might have some similar plans for the human race she did not know damn pat said ruefully you know i was almost getting to like the little shit pat five looked at her curiously for gods sake why lamely well he brought us food and other things we would have starved without him pat five said in disgust oh pat whats the matter with you you dont really understand what kind of people they are do you tell me something when you see the supermarket fish clerk checking the pumps in the lobster tank do you think she does it because she wants the lobsters to be happy she glared at pat then abruptly added why didnt you ever ask me how i got pregnant uncomfortably i did wonder i mean about the implants right the implants said pat five nodding the implants made a real problem for the damn birds when they found out about them they just took the things right out and honey that was not fun not for me even though i was the lucky one i survived the operation dan three told me that the first two of us they tried didnt of course they didnt bother with anesthesia and then they killed dan too i think it was something about studying how the human body reacted to pain he was screaming so loud i bet he could be heard all over the compound patrice shuddered but there was something else she wanted to know as delicately as possible she began who was the ahthe the father pat five shrugged morosely rosaleen thought it was jimmy one of the jimmys but i dont know im not sure i ever met the gent she glanced casually at the surviving jimmy who was standing suddenly thunderstruck all i know for sure is they had sperm theyd collectedi dont know whoseand so they did it to me by artificial insemination you see looked like they just didnt want us to have any fun at all hey said jimmy lin finding his voice at last i mean hey pat five scowled at him what are you getting excited about im not going to ask for child support it isnt that he protested i justyou knowi mean i feel sort of responsible if it was my uh sperm pat five looked at him thoughtfully then softened well dont worry about it listen i think being pregnant had its advantage im pretty sure thats why they kept me alive when the horch started shooting and the birds terminated all the others theyd gone to a lot of trouble to knock me up i guess they didnt want to waste all that work she glanced at dopey nervously making his rounds of the guard posts there were two of those goddam birds arguing about it in the examining room she said nodding toward the shattered partitions at the far end of their space while a couple of the goons held me down i was sure id had it but then the birds walked off and the goons just dropped me and went away and ive been here alone ever since patrice couldnt stand still another minute pat fives tale of horrors was more than she could handle she moved toward the broken partitions over here she asked is that where they were doing it dont go wandering away from your post jimmy lin ordered and pat five chimed in i wouldnt go there at all if i were you but that came too late patrice had reached the partitions and peered through them she couldnt see clearly in the minimal light that filtered in from outside but that patrice thought the contents of her stomach trying to rise up through her throat was a good thing there were bodies there a dannerman a jimmy lin another of those halfabsorbed corpses caught incompletely flushed away when the power died that was facedown but she thought probably had been another jimmy lin the stench of decay was awful she retreated to the others holding her hand over her face pat five laughednot unkindly i warned you she said ive been living with that for days the birds said it was all right you know they just sent them on early to the eschaton so they told you about the eschaton pat asked that tipler business sure they were asking a lot of questions about it just before they terminated the guys is something the matter pat and patrice were exchanging glances you remembered the name pat cried of course i remembered the name frank tipler tulane university he wrote a book i also remembered that old whatshisface told us it was a lot of crap since the hubble constant showed that the universe wasnt ever going to collapse again anyway ive been wondering about that myself patrice said and pat put in dan says it doesnt matter if its true what matters is that the horch and the beloved leaders act as if they believe its true and she stopped there blinking they were all blinking as suddenly the lights were on and from across the space dopey chortled we have the power now we can serve the beloved leaders again chapter forty patrice the return of the lighting made things clearer but didnt make them better the place was still a ruin an eyehurting flicker told patrice that in spite of damage just beside her one of those magic mirror walls was trying to reconstitute itself near the examining room bright mirror surface leaping from floor to ceiling then crackling and turning dark again over and over stand back patrice rosaleen warned urgently but there was no danger there patrice was already hastily backing away at the tachyon terminal dopey was babbling in excitement as a doc was doing something to its controls patrice couldnt see what exactly but she couldnt even see the controls for that matter whatever they were they were invisible to her but dopey was in ecstasydelight certainly fear too this is our most dangerous time he called then joyously see here are some weapons take them be ready the machines will surely detect this energy and theyoh hurry but he was talking to the doc again not to the humans who were quick to seize the trombone like things as the doc lifted them out of the cavernous interior of the terminal then closed the door for the next batch what about our food jimmy lin demanded hefting the weapon dopey looked at him distractedly please be careful with that now there is power food of course well get food from your starlab as soon as we are prepared to deal with the horch machines first the weapons then a few more fighters i believe we should make more copies of you agent dannerman since it is probable that there will be some losses also general delasquez and commander lin i think it is best to copy the males first dont you since as i understand it all of you males have had some weapons training while the females have not or not very much but of course he added hastily turning away to urge the doc to greater speed if you wish we will copy more females as well as soon as we have finished destroying the horch machines shut up dannerman said pointing one of the weapons at dopey who goggled at him uncomprehendingly but i have asked you agent dannerman to be very careful with that weapon it could easily accidentally go off not accidentally dannerman said patrice had never seen the alien look so bewildered he stared his plume agitatedly flickering then turned to the nearest armed human which happened to be martin delasquez i order you to shoot him he said martin glanced quizzically at dannerman then shifted his weapon as well to cover dopey no he said do what dannerman says dopey was wringing his little hands again but what but the horch machines dannerman said its simple if you can get things from starlab you can send things to starlab like us that is true yes dopey said uncomprehending but reasonable however so do it tell that thing to transmit us right away no no dopey cried in panic we must fight them here the beloved leaders would wish that rosaleen had been listening intently now she took a hand dopey she said soothingly you just havent thought it through if we fight the machines here we might lose dont you see what dan means if we go to starlab well be safe theres only one terminal there we can guard it day and night until your beloved leaders get around to reestablishing the communication channel there thats what you had in mind isnt it dan wouldnt that work dannerman didnt bother to answer dopey looked bewildered then pettishly he said yes i suppose so perhaps but i absolutely forbid it i dannerman put his fingers in the loops of the weapon dont forbid he said the gun squarely pointing at dopey youll do it our way or youll have failed your assignment because youre dead and then what will you tell your bosses when your eschaton comes around it wasnt that easy dopey hadnt stopped arguing in fact he never did stop his frantic arguing or pleadingeven after he had given in and allowed the doc to start the transmissions dannerman had to singe a corner of the aliens plume with the weapon before he would go that far but it was happening they were going home patrice stared in wonder and unbelief as the first batch entered the chamberrosaleen and the two other patsand the door closed behind them to take them home which meant that in a moment patrice herself could go home she could hardly believe it could not take in the sudden change in her outlookfirst a dreary and interminable existence in the ruins then in the blink of an eye the sudden prospect of return to starlabto earthto her life and it was all happening the terminal door opened again and it was empty now you dannerman ordered pointing to jimmy lin and take dopey with you but keep an eye on he stopped listening dopey squealed in terror and then patrice heard it too a heavy rapid thudding and the distant buzzing sound like a hive of bees the doc that had started the generator was running ponderously toward them and behind it rapidly catching up one of the spiderlegged machines this time patrice was ready she had her gun in both hands aiming it carefully whether she hit the thing or not she couldnt tellboth martin and jimmy lin were firing at the same time and she saw the pale beam from dannermans beloved leaders weapon wavering toward the thing as well someone did the machine spun around crazily and burst into flame just as the other had dannerman didnt wait do it lin he ordered you too dopey therell be more but dopey was complaining wringing his little hands i cannot function without the bearers then take them damn it all but the one running the transmitter and as the alien started to object simply picked him up and threw him inside the two docs followed stolidly making a tight fit but then the door closed and they were gone as the door opened again dannerman looked around and saw patrice standing there now you he ordered martin too ill hold them off patrice obeyed but not martin he grunted who elected you hero and shoved dannerman bodily inside as the door closed all patrice saw was a pale lavender flash that went right through her closed eyelids and a sickening jolt and then the door opened and they all fell in a heap out into the weightlessness of starlab that son of a bitch martin dannerman groaned well wait maybe hell make it they did wait for long minutes but martin didnt come chapter fortyone patrice never had the stale air of starlab smelled so much like home never had the queasiness of microgravity felt so dear patrice couldnt stop grinningnor either of the other pats nor jimmy lin nor even rosaleen arms crossed over her belly to hold in some unannounced pain only dopey and dannerman seemed immune dopey held in the arms of one of the docs was babbling please you must keep a weapon drawn and pointed at the terminal in case one of the horch machines follows why are you not listening to me but it is urgent and though dannerman had his gun in his handhis own gun not one of the now useless energy weaponshe was indeed not listening he was looking around the starlab corridor as though trying to get his bearings jimmy he snapped do you think you can find the astronaut return capsule go check it out i want to know if its still workable and if you think you can fly it sure lin said if thats what you want but wouldnt it be easier to radio for a rescue ship do you want to hang around here just do it go and as lin went off dopey was frantically demanding to know what was happening but you cant just leave the terminal unguarded agent dannerman have you not heard me if one of those machines follows it wont dannerman said grimly stand back he took aim at the closed door of the terminal and fired the whole clip now that was foolish of you dan rosaleen said gravely how did you know they wouldnt ricochet around and kill us all i didnt dannerman admitted i guess i didnt think but it looks like it worked the highspeed loads had gone right through the door and from inside there was a crackling and a smell of something electrical burning but lets make sure he said wheres that bar you conked jimmy with dopey gazed in horror as dannerman methodically began to smash at the portal no he screamed over the crash of metal you mustnt well be cut off from the beloved leaders until they send another drone perhaps for many many years so i hope dannerman agreed in fact im counting on it the longer the better if its long enough just maybethe next time you guys come around to visit uswell know how to handle you after later much later and a very long distance away dan dannerman saw the pale lavender flash the door of thetachyon terminal opened and he leaped triumphantly out eager to join the others in the safety of starlab startlingly the others werent there still more startlingly he wasnt even in starlab he was in a place hed never seen a pair of the wheelfooted horch machines were standing there but they werent shooting at him nor could he have fired back if they had he had no gun in his hand behind him he heard the door cycle shut behind him then open again the disheveled figure of dopey spilled out catapulting into him the little creature glared at him then as he saw the quietly buzzing machines observing them dopeys plume turned woeful gray and he began to sob whats happened dannerman demanded and clutching at straws did we die is this your damn eschaton dopey stared at him mournfully eschaton oh you are a great fool agent dannerman of course we have not yet reached the eschaton we simply have been copied once more and now we are in the hands of the horch authors note one of the questions that confront a sciencefiction reader is to decide how much of the science in a story is realie is at the time of writing consensually agreed by a significant number of actual scientistsand how much is made up by the author i dont personally make up much in my writing i do however quite often make use of scientific ideas that have been put forth by some actual scientist but fall a long way short of being consensual for example i did not make up the fasterthanlight tachyons i have used in this story in order to provide a mechanism for getting my characters around this very large universe in reasonable travel times they were originally proposed by dr gerry feinberg and others thirty or more years ago tachyons may or may not exist there is no direct evidence that they do feinberg was able to show that they are not excluded by relativity theory but they have never been detected so the question remains open for scientistsbut in my view such concepts are perfectly legitimate for writers like myself to borrow which i think is also true of the concept which provides the central thesis of this story the omega point or eschaton at which every person who has ever lived will it is said live again and then go on doing so forever much of what i know about the stranger scientific ideas that are floating around comes from the kindness of friends who know what sort of thing interests me and are often good enough to send me copies of obscure papers from unlikely sources the stimulus which led to the present story came from a paper by dr frank tipler sent to me some years ago by dr hans moravec of the robotics institute at carnegiemellon university tiplers paper originally published in a journal devoted to religious questions was quite tentative in tone however it appears that having started thinking on the subject tipler began to feel that he was onto something really important so in he published a book the physics of immortality expanding on the original notion and buttressing it with what he says are formal scientific proofs that it is true there are some differences between the arguments in the original paper and those in the book however and i should mention that in this novel i have preferred to follow those of the original paper tiplers claimed scientific proofs take the form of quite abstruse arguments that are dense with equations and occupy pages in his book i am not qualified to pass judgment on the accuracy of his science and the reviews of the book that i have seen in various scientific publications have been to put it as impartially as possible pretty uniformly unconvinced still tipler is a heavyweight scientist in his own right and we all know that the history of science is full of pioneers who were at first scornedbut were ultimately shown to be correct so the question remains are we indeed all going to be reborn at some remote time eons in the future i dont know if i had to bet i must confess that i would be inclined to bet quite heavily against it but it is certainly pretty to think so frederik pohl palatine illinois march
