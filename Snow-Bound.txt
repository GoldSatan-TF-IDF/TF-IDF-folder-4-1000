the snow and driving oer the fields seems nowhere to alight the whited air hides hills and woods the river and the heaven and veils the farmhouse at the gardens end the sled and traveller stopped the couriers feet delayed all friends shut out the housemates sit around the radiant fireplace enclosed in a tumultuous privacy of storm emerson illustration snow bound the sun that brief december day rose cheerless over hills of gray and darkly circled gave at noon a sadder light than waning moon slow tracing down the thickening sky its mute and ominous prophecy a portent seeming less than threat it sank from sight before it set a chill no coat however stout of homespun stuff could quite shut out a hard dull bitterness of cold that checked midvein the circling race of lifeblood in the sharpened face the coming of the snowstorm told the wind blew east we heard the roar of ocean on his wintry shore and felt the strong pulse throbbing there beat with low rhythm our inland air meanwhile we did our nightly chores brought in the wood from out of doors littered the stalls and from the mows raked down the herdsgrass for the cows heard the horse whinnying for his corn and sharply clashing horn on horn impatient down the stanchion rows the cattle shake their walnut bows while peering from his early perch upon the scaffolds pole of birch the cock his crested helmet bent and down his querulous challenge sent illustration unwarmed by any sunset light the gray day darkened into night a night made hoary with the swarm and whirldance of the blinding storm as zigzag wavering to and fro crossed and recrossed the wingйd snow and ere the early bedtime came the white drift piled the windowframe and through the glass the clothesline posts looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts illustration so all night long the storm roared on the morning broke without a sun in tiny spherule traced with lines of natures geometric signs in starry flake and pellicle all day the hoary meteor fell and when the second morning shone we looked upon a world unknown on nothing we could call our own around the glistening wonder bent the blue walls of the firmament no cloud above no earth below a universe of sky and snow the old familiar sights of ours took marvellous shapes strange domes and towers rose up where sty or corncrib stood or garden wall or belt of wood a smooth white mound the brushpile showed a fenceless drift what once was road the bridle post an old man sat with looseflung coat and high cocked hat the wellcurb had a chinese roof illustration and even the long sweep high aloof in its slant splendor seemed to tell of pisas leaning miracle a prompt decisive man no breath our father wasted boys a path well pleased for when did farmer boy count such a summons less than joy our buskins on our feet we drew with mittened hands and caps drawn low to guard our necks and ears from snow we cut the solid whiteness through illustration and where the drift was deepest made a tunnel walled and overlaid with dazzling crystal we had read of rare aladdins wondrous cave and to our own his name we gave with many a wish the luck were ours to test his lamps supernal powers illustration we reached the barn with merry din and roused the prisoned brutes within the old horse thrust his long head out and grave with wonder gazed about the cock his lusty greeting said and forth his speckled harem led the oxen lashed their tails and hooked and mild reproach of hunger looked the hornйd patriarch of the sheep like egypts amun roused from sleep shook his sage head with gesture mute and emphasized with stamp of foot all day the gusty northwind bore the loosening drift its breath before low circling round its southern zone the sun through dazzling snowmist shone no churchbell lent its christian tone to the savage air no social smoke curled over woods of snowhung oak a solitude made more intense by dreary voicйd elements the shrieking of the mindless wind the moaning treeboughs swaying blind and on the glass the unmeaning beat of ghostly fingertips of sleet illustration beyond the circle of our hearth no welcome sound of toil or mirth unbound the spell and testified of human life and thought outside we minded that the sharpest ear the buried brooklet could not hear the music of whose liquid lip had been to us companionship and in our lonely life had grown to have an almost human tone as night drew on and from the crest of wooded knolls that ridged the west the sun a snowblown traveller sank from sight beneath the smothering bank we piled with care our nightly stack of wood against the chimneyback illustration the oaken log green huge and thick and on its top the stout backstick the knotty forestick laid apart and filled between with curious art the ragged brush then hovering near we watched the first red blaze appear heard the sharp crackle caught the gleam on whitewashed wall and sagging beam until the old rudefurnished room burst flowerlike into rosy bloom while radiant with a mimic flame outside the sparkling drift became and through the bareboughed lilactree our own warm hearth seemed blazing free the crane and pendent trammels showed the turks heads on the andirons glowed while childish fancy prompt to tell the meaning of the miracle whispered the old rhyme under the tree when fire outdoors burns merrily there the witches are making tea the moon above the eastern wood shone at its full the hillrange stood illustration transfigured in the silver flood its blown snows flashing cold and keen dead white save where some sharp ravine took shadow or the sombre green of hemlocks turned to pitchy black against the whiteness at their back for such a world and such a night most fitting that unwarming light which only seemed whereer it fell to make the coldness visible shut in from all the world without we sat the cleanwinged hearth about content to let the northwind roar in baffled rage at pane and door while the red logs before us beat the frostline back with tropic heat and ever when a louder blast shook beam and rafter as it passed the merrier up its roaring draught the great throat of the chimney laughed the housedog on his paws outspread laid to the fire his drowsy head the cats dark silhouette on the wall a couchant tigers seemed to fall and for the winter fireside meet between the andirons straddling feet the mug of cider simmered slow the apples sputtered in a row and close at hand the basket stood with nuts from brown octobers wood illustration what matter how the night behaved what matter how the northwind raved blow high blow low not all its snow could quench our hearthfires ruddy glow o time and change with hair as gray as was my sires that winter day how strange it seems with so much gone of life and love to still live on ah brother only i and thou are left of all that circle now the dear home faces whereupon that fitful firelight paled and shone henceforward listen as we will the voices of that hearth are still look where we may the wide earth oer those lighted faces smile no more we tread the paths their feet have worn illustration we sit beneath their orchardtrees we hear like them the hum of bees and rustle of the bladed corn we turn the pages that they read their written words we linger oer but in the sun they cast no shade no voice is heard no sign is made no step is on the conscious floor yet love will dream and faith will trust since he who knows our need is just that somehow somewhere meet we must illustration alas for him who never sees the stars shine through his cypresstrees who hopeless lays his dead away nor looks to see the breaking day across the mournful marbles play who hath not learned in hours of faith the truth to flesh and sense unknown that life is ever lord of death and love can never lose its own we sped the time with stories old wrought puzzles out and riddles told or stammered from our schoolbook lore the chief of gambias golden shore how often since when all the land was clay in slaverys shaping hand as if a trumpet called ive heard dame mercy warrens rousing word does not the voice of reason cry claim the first right which nature gave from the red scourge of bondage fly nor deign to live a burdened slave our father rode again his ride on memphremagogs wooded side illustration sat down again to moose and samp in trappers hut and indian camp lived oer the old idyllic ease beneath st franзois hemlocktrees again for him the moonlight shone on norman cap and bodiced zone again he heard the violin play which led the village dance away and mingled in its merry whirl the grandam and the laughing girl or nearer home our steps he led where salisburys level marshes spread illustration milewide as flies the laden bee where merry mowers hale and strong swept scythe on scythe their swaths along the low green prairies of the sea we shared the fishing off boars head and round the rocky isles of shoals the hakebroil on the driftwood coals the chowder on the sandbeach made dipped by the hungry steaming hot with spoons of clamshell from the pot illustration we heard the tales of witchcraft old and dream and sign and marvel told to sleepy listeners as they lay stretched idly on the salted hay adrift along the winding shores illustration when favoring breezes deigned to blow the square sail of the gundalow and idle lay the useless oars our mother while she turned her wheel or run the newknit stockingheel told how the indian hordes came down at midnight on cochecho town and how her own greatuncle bore his cruel scalpmark to fourscore recalling in her fitting phrase so rich and picturesque and free the common unrhymed poetry of simple life and country ways the story of her early days she made us welcome to her home old hearths grew wide to give us room we stole with her a frightened look at the gray wizards conjuringbook the fame whereof went far and wide through all the simple country side we heard the hawks at twilight play the boathorn on piscataqua the loons weird laughter far away illustration we fished her little troutbrook knew what flowers in wood and meadow grew what sunny hillsides autumnbrown she climbed to shake the ripe nuts down saw where in sheltered cove and bay the ducks black squadron anchored lay and heard the wildgeese calling loud beneath the gray november cloud then haply with a look more grave and soberer tone some tale she gave from painful sewells ancient tome beloved in every quaker home of faith firewinged by martyrdom or chalkleys journal old and quaint gentlest of skippers rare seasaint who when the dreary calms prevailed and waterbutt and breadcask failed and cruel hungry eyes pursued his portly presence mad for food with dark hints muttered under breath of casting lots for life or death offered if heaven withheld supplies to be himself the sacrifice then suddenly as if to save the good man from his living grave a ripple on the water grew a school of porpoise flashed in view take eat he said and be content these fishes in my stead are sent by him who gave the tangled ram to spare the child of abraham illustration our uncle innocent of books was rich in lore of fields and brooks the ancient teachers never dumb of natures unhoused lyceum in moons and tides and weather wise he read the clouds as prophecies and foul or fair could well divine by many an occult hint and sign holding the cunningwarded keys to all the woodcraft mysteries himself to natures heart so near that all her voices in his ear of beast or bird had meanings clear like apollonius of old who knew the tales the sparrows told or hermes who interpreted what the sage cranes of nilus said a simple guileless childlike man content to live where life began strong only on his native grounds the little world of sights and sounds whose girdle was the parish bounds whereof his fondly partial pride the common features magnified as surrey hills to mountains grew in white of selbornes loving view he told how teal and loon he shot illustration and how the eagles eggs he got the feats on pond and river done the prodigies of rod and gun till warming with the tales he told forgotten was the outside cold the bitter wind unheeded blew from ripening corn the pigeons flew illustration the partridge drummed i the wood the mink went fishing down the riverbrink in fields with bean or clover gay the woodchuck like a hermit gray peered from the doorway of his cell the muskrat plied the masons trade and tier by tier his mudwalls laid and from the shagbark overhead the grizzled squirrel dropped his shell next the dear aunt whose smile of cheer and voice in dreams i see and hear the sweetest woman ever fate perverse denied a household mate who lonely homeless not the less found peace in loves unselfishness and welcome wheresoeer she went a calm and gracious element whose presence seemed the sweet income and womanly atmosphere of home called up her girlhood memories the huskings and the applebees the sleighrides and the summer sails weaving through all the poor details and homespun warp of circumstance a golden woofthread of romance illustration for well she kept her genial mood and simple faith of maidenhood before her still a cloudland lay the mirage loomed across her way the morning dew that dries so soon with others glistened at her noon through years of toil and soil and care from glossy tress to thin gray hair all unprofaned she held apart the virgin fancies of the heart be shame to him of woman born who hath for such but thought of scorn illustration there too our elder sister plied her evening task the stand beside a full rich nature free to trust truthful and almost sternly just impulsive earnest prompt to act and make her generous thought a fact keeping with many a light disguise the secret of selfsacrifice o heart soretried thou hast the best that heaven itself could give thee rest rest from all bitter thoughts and things how many a poor ones blessing went with thee beneath the low green tent whose curtain never outward swings as one who held herself a part of all she saw and let her heart against the household bosom lean upon the motleybraided mat our youngest and our dearest sat lifting her large sweet asking eyes now bathed within the fadeless green and holy peace of paradise o looking from some heavenly hill or from the shade of saintly palms or silver reach of river calms do those large eyes behold me still with me one little year ago illustration the chill weight of the winter snow for months upon her grave has lain and now when summer southwinds blow and brier and harebell bloom again i tread the pleasant paths we trod i see the violetsprinkled sod whereon she leaned too frail and weak the hillside flowers she loved to seek yet following me whereer i went illustration with dark eyes full of loves content the birds are glad the brierrose fills the air with sweetness all the hills stretch green to junes unclouded sky but still i wait with ear and eye for something gone which should be nigh a loss in all familiar things in flower that blooms and bird that sings and yet dear heart remembering thee am i not richer than of old safe in thy immortality what change can reach the wealth i hold what chance can mar the pearl and gold thy love hath left in trust with me and while in lifes late afternoon where cool and long the shadows grow i walk to meet the night that soon shall shape and shadow overflow i cannot feel that thou art far since near at need the angels are and when the sunset gates unbar shall i not see thee waiting stand and white against the evening star the welcome of thy beckoning hand brisk wielder of the birch and rule the master of the district school held at the fire his favored place its warm glow lit a laughing face freshhued and fair where scarce appeared illustration the uncertain prophecy of beard he teased the mittenblinded cat played crosspins on my uncles hat sang songs and told us what befalls in classic dartmouths college halls born the wild northern hills among from whence his yeoman father wrung by patient toil subsistence scant not competence and yet not want he early gained the power to pay his cheerful selfreliant way could doff at ease his scholars gown to peddle wares from town to town or through the long vacations reach in lonely lowland districts teach where all the droll experience found at stranger hearths in boarding round the moonlit skaters keen delight the sleighdrive through the frosty night the rustic party with its rough accompaniment of blindmansbuff illustration and whirling plate and forfeits paid his winter task a pastime made happy the snowlocked homes wherein he tuned his merry violin or played the athlete in the barn or held the good dames winding yarn or mirthprovoking versions told of classic legends rare and old wherein the scenes of greece and rome illustration had all the commonplace of home and little seemed at best the odds twixt yankee pedlers and old gods where pindusborn araxes took the guise of any gristmill

unbent wills majestic pride she sat among us at the best a not unfeared halfwelcome guest rebuking with her cultured phrase our homeliness of words and ways a certain pardlike treacherous grace swayed the lithe limbs and drooped the lash lent the white teeth their dazzling flash and under low brows black with night rayed out at times a dangerous light the sharp heatlightnings of her face presaging ill to him whom fate condemned to share her love or hate a woman tropical intense in thought and act in soul and sense she blended in a like degree the vixen and the devotee revealing with each freak or feint the temper of petruchios kate the raptures of sienas saint her tapering hand and rounded wrist had facile power to form a fist the warm dark languish of her eyes was never safe from wraths surprise brows saintly calm and lips devout knew every change of scowl and pout and the sweet voice had notes more high and shrill for social battlecry since then what old cathedral town has missed

path may be the lords sweet pity with her go the outward wayward life we see the hidden springs we may not know nor is it given us to discern what threads the fatal sisters spun through what ancestral years has run the sorrow with the woman born what forged her cruel chain of moods what set her feet in solitudes and held the love within her mute what mingled madness in the blood a lifelong discord and annoy water of tears with oil of joy and hid within the folded bud perversities of flower and fruit it is not ours to separate the tangled skein of will and fate to show what metes and bounds

circuit through pointed with mutelywarning sign its black hand to the hour of nine that sign the pleasant circle broke my uncle ceased his pipe to smoke knocked from its bowl the refuse gray and laid it tenderly away then roused himself to safely cover the dull red brands with ashes over and while with care our mother laid the work aside her steps she stayed one moment seeking to express her grateful sense of happiness for food and shelter warmth and health and loves contentment more than wealth with simple wishes not the weak vain prayers which no fulfilment seek but such as warm the generous heart oerprompt to do with heaven its part that none might lack that bitter night for bread and clothing warmth and light within our beds awhile we heard the wind that round the gables roared with now and then a ruder shock which made our very bedsteads rock we heard the loosened clapboards tost the boardnails snapping in the frost and on us through the unplastered wall felt the light sifted snowflakes fall but sleep stole on as sleep will do when hearts are light and life is new faint and more faint the murmurs grew till in the summerland of dreams they softened to the sound of streams low stir of leaves and dip of oars and lapsing waves on quiet shores illustration illustration next morn we wakened with the shout of merry voices high and clear and saw the teamsters drawing near to break the drifted highways out down the long hillside treading slow we saw the halfburied oxen go shaking the snow from heads uptost their straining nostrils white with frost before our door the straggling train drew up an added team to gain the elders threshed their hands acold passed with the cidermug their jokes from lip to lip the younger folks down the loose snowbanks wrestling rolled then toiled again the cavalcade oer windy hill through clogged ravine and woodland paths that wound between low drooping pineboughs winterweighed illustration from every barn a team afoot at every house a new recruit where drawn by natures subtlest law haply the watchful young men saw illustration sweet doorway pictures of the curls and curious eyes of merry girls lifting their hands in mock defence against the snowballs compliments and reading in each missive tost the charm with eden never lost we heard once more the sleighbells sound and following where the teamsters led the wise old doctor went his round illustration just pausing at our door to say in the brief autocratic way of one who prompt at dutys call was free to urge her claim on all that some poor neighbor sick abed at night our mothers aid would need for one in generous thought and deed what mattered in the sufferers sight the quaker matrons inward light the doctors mail of calvins creed all hearts confess the saints elect who twain in faith in love agree and melt not in an acid sect the christian pearl of charity so days went on a week had passed since the great world was heard from last the almanac we studied oer read and reread our little store of books and pamphlets scarce a score one harmless novel mostly hid from younger eyes a book forbid and poetry or good or bad a single book was all we had where ellwoods meek drabskirted muse a stranger to the heathen nine sang with a somewhat nasal whine the wars of david and the jews illustration at last the floundering carrier bore the village paper to our door lo broadening outward as we read to warmer zones the horizon spread in panoramic length unrolled we saw the marvels that it told before us passed the painted creeks and daft mcgregor on his raids in costa ricas everglades illustration and up taygetos winding slow rode ypsilantis mainote greeks a turks head at each saddlebow welcome to us its weekold news its corner for the rustic muse its monthly gauge of snow and rain its record mingling in a breath the wedding knell and dirge of death jest anecdote and lovelorn tale the latest culprit sent to jail its hue and cry of stolen and lost its vendue sales and goods at cost and traffic calling loud for gain we felt the stir of hall and street the pulse of life that round us beat the chill embargo of the snow was melted in the genial glow wide swung again our icelocked door and all the world was ours once more clasp angel of the backward look and folded wings of ashen gray and voice of echoes far away the brazen covers of thy book the weird palimpsest old and vast wherein thou hidst the spectral past where closely mingling pale and glow the characters of joy and woe the monographs of outlived years or smileillumed or dim with tears green hills of life that slope to death and haunts of home whose vistaed trees shade off to mournful cypresses with the white amaranths underneath even while i look i can but heed the restless sands incessant fall importunate hours that hours succeed each clamorous with its own sharp need and duty keeping pace with all shut down and clasp the heavy lids i hear again the voice that bids the dreamer leave his dream midway for larger hopes and graver fears life greatens in these later years the centurys aloe flowers today yet haply in some lull of life some truce of god which breaks its strife the worldlings eyes shall gather dew dreaming in throngful city ways of winter joys his boyhood knew and dear and early friends the few who yet remain shall pause to view these flemish pictures of old days sit with me by the homestead hearth and stretch the hands of memory forth to warm them at the woodfires blaze and thanks untraced to lips unknown shall greet me like the odors blown from unseen meadows newly mown or lilies floating in some pond woodfringed the wayside gaze beyond the traveller owns the grateful sense of sweetness near he knows not whence and pausing takes with forehead bare the benediction of the air illustration
