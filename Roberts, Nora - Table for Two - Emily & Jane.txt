chapter her name was summer it was a name that conjured visions of hot petaled flowers sudden storms and long restless nights it also brought images of sunwarmed meadows and naps in the shade it suited her as she stood hands poised body tensed eyes alert there wasnt a sound in the room no one absolutely no one took their eyes off her she might move slowly but there wasnt a person there who wanted to chance missing a gesture a motion all attention all concentration was riveted upon that one slim solitary figure strains of chopin floated romantically through the air the light slanted and shot through her neatly bound hair rich warm brown with hints and tints of gold two emerald studs winked at her ears her skin was a bit flushed so that a rose tinge accented already prominent cheekbones and the elegant bone structure that comes only from breeding excitement intense concentration deepened the amber flecks that were sprinkled in the hazel of her eyes the same excitement and concentration had her soft molded lips forming a pout she was all in white plain unadorned white but she drew the eye as irresistibly as a butterfly in full dazzling flight she wouldnt speak yet everyone in the room strained forward as if to catch the slightest sound the room was warm the smells exotic the atmosphere taut with anticipation summer might have been alone for all the attention she paid to those around her there was only one goal one end perfection shed never settled for less with infinite care she lifted the final diamondshape and pressed the angelica onto the savarin to complete the design shed created the hours shed already spent preparing and baking the huge elaborate dessert were forgotten as was the heat the tired leg muscles the aching arms the final touch the appearance of a summer lyndon creation was of the utmost importance yes it would taste perfect smell perfect even slice perfectly but if it didnt look perfect none of that mattered with the care of an artist completing a masterpiece she lifted her brush to give the fruits and almonds a light delicate coating of apricot glaze still no one spoke asking no assistance indeed she wouldnt have tolerated any summer began to fill the center of the savarin with the rich cream whose recipe she guarded jealously hands steady head erect summer stepped back to give her creation one last critical study this was the ultimate test for her eye was keener than any others when it came to her own work she folded her arms across her body her face was without expression in the huge kitchen the ping of a pin dropped on the tile would have reverberated like a gunshot slowly her lips curved her eyes glittered success summer lifted one arm and gestured rather dramatically take it away she ordered as two assistants began to roll the glittering concoction from the room applause broke out summer accepted the accolade as her due there was a place for modesty she knew and she knew it didnt apply to her savarin it was to put it mildly magnificent magnificence was what the italian duke had wanted for his daughters engagement party and magnificence was what hed paid for summer had simply delivered mademoiselle foulfount the frenchman whose specialty was shellfish took summer by both shoulders his eyes were round and damp with appreciation incroyable enthusiastically he kissed both her cheeks while his thick clever fingers squeezed her skin as they might a freshbaked loaf of bread summer broke out in her first grin in hours merci someone had opened a celebratory bottle of wine summer took two glasses handing one to the french chef to the next time we work together mon ami she tossed back the wine took off her chefs hat then breezed out of the kitchen in the enormous marblefloored chandeliered dining room her savarin was even now being served and admired her last thought before leaving was thank god someone else had to clean up the mess two hours later she had her shoes off and her eyes closed a gruesome murder mystery lay open on her lap as her plane cruised over the atlantic she was going home shed spent almost three full days in milan for the sole purpose of creating that one dish it wasnt an unusual experience for her summer had baked charlotte malakqff in madrid flamed crepes fouree in athens and molded ile flottante in istanbul for her expenses and a stunning fee summer lyndon would create a dessert that would live in the memory long after the last bite drop or crumb was consumed have wisk will travel she thought vaguely and smiled through a yawn she considered herself a specialist not unlike a skilled surgeon indeed shed studied apprenticed and practiced as long as many respected members of the medical profession five years after passing the stringent requirements to become a cordon bleu chef in paris the city where cooking is its own art summer had a reputation for being as temperamental as any artist for having the mind of a computer when it came to remembering recipes and for having the hands of an angel summer half dozed in her firstclass seat and fought off a desperate craving for a slice of pepperoni pizza she knew the flight time would go faster if she could read or sleep her way through it she decided to mix the two taking the light nap first summer was a woman who prized her sleep almost as highly as she prized her recipe for chocolate mousse on her return to philadelphia her schedule would be hectic at best there was the bombe to prepare for the governors charity banquet the annual meeting of the gourmet society the demonstration shed agreed to do for public television and that meeting she remembered drowsily what had that birdvoiced woman said over the phone summer wondered drake no blake cocharan blake cocharan hi of the cocharan hotel chain excellent hotels summer thought without any real interest shed patronized a number of them in various comers of the world mr cocharan the third had a business proposition for her summer assumed that he wanted her to create some special dessert exclusively for his chain of hotels something they could attach the cocharan name to she wasnt averse to the notion under the proper circumstances and for the proper fee naturally shed have to investigate the entire cocharan enterprise carefully before she agreed to involve her skill or her name with it if any one of their hotels was of inferior quality with a yawn summer decided to think about it later after shed met with the third personality blake cocharan iii she thought again with a sleepily amused smile plump balding probably dyspeptic italian shoes swiss watch french shirts german car and no doubt hed consider himself unflaggingly american the image she created hung in her mind a moment and bored with it she yawned again then sighed as the idea of pizza once again invaded her thoughts summer tilted her seat back farther and determinedly willed herself to sleep blake cocharan iii sat in the plush rear seat of the gunmetalgray limo and meticulously went over the report on the newest cocharan house being constructed in saint croix he was a man who could scoop us a mess of scattered details and align them in perfect systematic order chaos was simply a form of order waiting to be unjumbled with logic blake was a very logical man point a invariably led to point b and from there to c no matter how confused the maze with patience and logic one could find the route because of his talent for doing just that blake at thirtyfive had almost complete control of the cocharan empire hed inherited his wealth and as a result rarely thought of it but hed earned his position and valued it quality was a cocharan tradition nothing but the finest would do for any cocharan house from the linen on the beds to the mortar in the foundations his report on summer lyndon told him she was the best setting aside the saint croix packet blake slipped another file from the slim briefcase by his feet a single ring ovalfaced gold and scrolled gleamed dully on his hand summer lyndon he mused flipping the file open twentyeight graduate sorbonne certified cordon bleu chef father rothschild lyndon respected member of british parliament mother monique dubois lyndon former star of the french cinema parents amicably divorced for twentythree years summer lyndon had spent her formative years between london and paris before her mother had married an american hardware tycoon based in philadelphia summer had then returned to paris to complete her education and currently had living quarters both there and in philadelphia her mother had since married a third time a paper baron on this round and her father was separated from his second wife a successful banister all of blakes probing had produced the same basic answer summer lyndon was the best dessert chef on either side of the atlantic she was also a superb allaround chef with an instinctive knowledge of quality a flair for creativity and the ability to improvise in a crisis on the other hand she was reputed to be dictatorial temperamental and brutally frank these qualities however hadnt alienated her from heads of state aristocracy or celebrities she might insist on having chopin piped into the kitchen while she cooked or summarily refuse to work at all if the lighting wasnt to her liking but her mousse alone was enough to make a strong man beg to grant her slightest wish blake wasnt a man to beg for any thing but he wanted summer lyndon for cocharan house he never doubted he could persuade her to agree to precisely what he had in mind a formidable woman he imagined respecting that he had no patience with weak wills or soft brains particularly in people who worked for him not many women had risen to the position or the reputation that summer lyndon held women might traditionally be cooks but men were traditionally chefs he imagined her thick waisted from sampling her own creations strong hands he thought idly her skin was probably a bit pasty from all those hours indoors in kitchens a nononsense woman he was sure with an uncompromising view on what was edible and why organized logical and cultured perhaps a bit plain due to her preoccupation with food rather than fashion blake imagined that they would deal with each other very well with a glance at his watch blake noted with satisfaction that he was right on time for the meeting the limo cruised to a halt beside the curb ill be no more than an hour blake told the driver as he climbed out yes sir the driver checked his watch when mr cocharan said an hour you could depend on it blake glanced up at the fourth floor as he crossed to the wellkept old building the windows were open he noted warm spring air poured in while music a melody he couldnt quite catch over the sounds of traffic poured out when blake went in he learned that the single elevator was out of order he walked up four flights after blake knocked the door was opened by a small woman with a stunning face who was dressed in a tshirt and slim black jeans the maid on her way out for a day off blake wondered idly she didnt look strong enough to scrub a floor and if she was going out she was going out without her shoes after the brief objective glance his gaze was drawn irresistibly back to her face classic naked and undeniably sensuous the mouth alone would make a mans blood move blake ignored what he considered an automatic sexual pull blake cocharan to see ms lyndon summers left brow rose a sign of surprise then her lips curved slightly a sign of pleasure plump he wasnt she observed hard and lean racketball tennis swimming he was obviously a man more prone to these than lingering over executive lunches balding no his hair was rich black and thick it was styled well with slight natural waves that added to the attractiveness of a cool sensual face a sweep of cheekbones a firm line of chin she liked the look of the former that spoke of strength and the latter just barely cleft that spoke of charm black brows were almost straight over clear waterblue eyes his mouth was a bit long but beautifully shaped his nose was very straight the sort shed always thought was made to be looked down perhaps shed been right about the outward trimmings the italian shoes and so forth but summer admitted shed been off the mark with the man the assessment didnt take her long three perhaps four seconds but her mouth curved more blake couldnt take his eyes off it it was a mouth a man if he breathed wanted to taste please come in mr cocharan summer stepped back swinging the door wider in invitation its very considerate of you to agree to meet here please have a seat im afraid im in the middle of something in the kitchen she smiled gestured and disappeared blake opened his mouth he wasnt used to being brushed off by servants then closed it again he had enough time to be tolerant as he set down his briefcase he glanced around the room there were fringed lamps a curved sofa in plush blue velvet a fussily carved cherrywood table aubusson carpets two softly faded in blues and grays were spread over the floors a ming vase potpourri in what was certainly a dresden compote the room had no order it was a mix of european periods and styles that should never have suited but was instantly attractive he saw that a pedestal table at the far end of the room was covered with jumbled typewritten pages and handwritten notes street sounds drifted in through the window chopin floated from the stereo as he stood there drawing it in he was abruptly certain there was no one in the apartment but himself and the woman who had opened the door summer lyndon fascinated with the idea and with the aroma creeping from the kitchen blake crossed the room six pastry shells just touched with gold and moisture sat on a rack one by one summer filled them to overflowing with what appeared to be some rich white cream when blake glanced at her face he saw the concentration the seriousness and intensity he might have associated with a brain surgeon it should have amused him yet somehow with the strains of chopin pouring through the kitchen speakers with those delicate slimfingered hands arranging the cream in mounds he was fascinated she dipped a fork in a pan and dribbled what he guessed was warmed caramel over the cream it ran lavishly down the sides and gelled he doubted that it was humanly possible not to lust after just one taste again one by one she scooped up the tarts and placed them on a plate lined with a lacy paper doily when the last one was arranged she looked up at blake would you like some coffee she smiled and the line of concentration between her brows disappeared the intensity that had seemed to darken her irises lightened blake glanced at the dessert plate and wondered how her waist could be handspannable yes i would its hot she told him as she lifted the plate help yourself i have to run these next door she was past him and to the doorway of the kitchen before she turned around oh therere some cookies in the jar if you like ill be right back she was gone and the pastries with her with a shrug he turned back to the kitchen which was a shambles summer lyndon might be a great cook but she was obviously not a neat one still if the scent and look of the pastries had been any indication he started to root in the cupboards for a cup then gave in to temptation standing in his saville row suit blake ran his finger along the edge of the bowl that had held the cream he laid it on his tongue with a sigh his eyes closed rich thick and very french hed dined in the most exclusive restaurants in some of the wealthiest homes in dozens of countries all over the world logically practically honestly he couldnt say hed ever tasted better than what he now scooped from the bowl in this womans kitchen in deciding to specialize in desserts and pastries summer lyndon had chosen well he concluded he felt a momentary regret that shed taken those rich fat tarts to someone else this time when blake started his search for a cup he spotted the ceramic cookie jar shaped like a panda normally he wouldnt have been interested he wasnt a man with a particularly active sweet tooth but the flavor of the cream lingered on his tongue what sort of cookie did a woman who created the finest of haute cuisine make with a cup of english bone china in one hand blake lifted off the top of the pandas head setting it down he pulled out a cookie and stared in simple wonder no american could mistake that particular munchie a classic he mused a tradition an oreo blake continued to stare at the chocolate sandwich cookie with its double dose of white center he turned it over in his hand the brand was unmistakably stamped into both sides this from a woman who baked and whipped and glazed for royalty a laugh broke from him as he dropped the oreo back into the panda throughout his career hed had to deal with more than his share of eccentrics running a chain of hotels wasnt just a matter of who checked in and who checked out there were designers artists architects decorators chefs musicians union representatives blake considered himself knowledgeable of people it wouldnt take him long to learn what made summer tick she dashed back into the kitchen just as he was finally pouring the coffee im sorry to have kept you waiting mr cocharan i know it was rude she smiled as if she had no doubt shed be forgiven as she poured her own coffee i had to get those pastries finished for my neighbor shes having a small engagement tea this afternoon with prospective inlaws her smile turned to a grin and sipping her black coffee she plucked the top from the panda did you want a cookie no please you go ahead taking him at his word summer chose one and nibbled you know she said thoughtfully these are uniformly excellent for their kind she gestured with the half cookie she had left shall we go sit down and discuss your proposition she moved fast he mused with approval perhaps hed at least been on the mark about the nononsense attitude with a nod of acknowledgment blake followed her he was successful in his profession not because he was a thirdgeneration cocharan but because he had a quick and analytical mind problems were systematically solved at the moment he had to decide just how to approach a woman like summer lyndon she had a face that belonged in the shade of a tree on the bois de boulogne very french very elegant her voice had the round clear tones that spoke unmistakably of european education and upbringing a wisp of france again but with the discipline of britain her hair was pinned up a concession to the heat and humidity he imagined though she had the windows open ignoring the available airconditioning the studs in her ears were emeralds round and flawless there was a goodsized tear in the sleeve of her tshirt sitting on the couch she folded her legs under her her bare toes were painted with a wild rose enamel but her fingernails were short and unvarnished he caught the allure of her scent a touch of the caramel from the pastries but under it something unmistakably french unapologetically sexual how did one approach such a woman blake reflected did he use charm flattery or figures she was reputed to be a perfectionist and occasionally a firebrand shed refused to cook for an important political figure because he wouldnt fly her personal kitchen equipment to his country shed charged a hollywood celebrity a small fortune to create a twentytiered wedding cake extravaganza and shed just handbaked and handdelivered a plate of pastries to a neighbor for a tea blake would much prefer to have the key to her before he made his offer he knew the advantages of taking a circular route indeed some might call it stalking im acquainted with your mother blake began easily as he continued to gauge the woman beside him really he caught both amusement and affection in the word i shouldnt be surprised she said as she nibbled on the cookie again my mother always patronized a cocharan house when we traveled i believe i had dinner with your grandfather when i was six or seven the amusement didnt fade as she sipped at her coffee small world an excellent suit summer decided relaxing against the back of the sofa it was well cut and conservative enough to have gained her fathers approval the form it was molded to was well built and lean enough to have gained her mothers it was perhaps the combination of the two that drew her interest good god he is attractive she thought as she took another considering survey of his face not quite smooth not quite rugged his power sat well on him that was something she recognized in herself and in others she respected someone who sought and got his own way as she judged blake did she respected herself for the same reason attractive she thought again but she felt that a man like blake would be so regardless of physical appearance her mother would have called him séduisant and accurately so summer would have called him dangerous a difficult combination to resist she shifted perhaps unconsciously to put more distance between them business after all was business youre familiar then with the standards of a cocharan house blake began quite suddenly he wished her scent werent so alluring or her mouth so tempting he didnt care to have business muddled with attraction no matter how pleasant of course summer set down her coffee because drinking it only seemed to accentuate the odd little flutter in her stomach i invariably stay at them myself ive been told your standards of quality are equally high this time when summer smiled there was a hint of arrogance to it im the very best at what i do because i have no intention of being otherwise the first key blake decided with satisfaction professional vanity so my information tells me ms lyndon the very best is all that interests me so summer propped an elbow on the back of the sofa then rested her head on the palm how exactly do i interest you mr cocharan she knew the question was loaded but couldnt resist when a woman was constantly taking risks and making experiments in her professional life the habit often leaked through six separate answers skimmed through his mind none of which had any bearing on his purpose for being there blake set down his coffee the restaurants at the cocharan houses are renowned for their quality and service however recently the restaurant here in our philadelphia complex seems to be suffering from a lack of both frankly ms lyndon its my opinion that the food has become too pedestrian too boring i plan to do some remodeling both in physical structure and in staff wise restaurants like people often become too complacent i want the best head chef available he aimed a level look my research tells me thats you summer lifted a brow not in surprise this time but in consideration thats flattering but i freelance mr cocharan and i specialize specialize yes but you do have both experience and knowledge in all areas of haute cuisine as for the freelancing youd be free to continue that to a large extent at least after the first few months youd need to establish your own staff and create your own menu i dont believe in hiring an expert then interfering she was frowning again concentration not annoyance it was tempting very tempting perhaps it was just the travel weariness from her trip back from italy but shed begun to grow a bit tired bored with the constant demands of flying to any given country to make that one dish it seemed hed hit her at the right moment to stir her interest in concentrating on one place and one kitchen for a span of time it would be interesting work if he were being truthful about the free hand shed have redoing a kitchen and the menu in an old established and respected hotel it would take her perhaps six months of intense effort and then it was the and then that made her hesitate again if she gave that much time and effort to a fulltime job would she still retain her flair for the spectacular that too was something to consider shed always had a firm policy against committing herself to any one establishment a wariness of commitments ribboned through all areas of her life if you locked yourself into something to someone you opened yourself to all manner of complications besides summer reasoned if she wanted to affiliate herself with a restaurant she could open and run her own she hadnt done it yet because it would tie her too long to one place attach her too closely to one project she preferred traveling creating one superb dish at a time then moving on the next country the next dish that was her style why should she consider altering it now a very flattering offer mr cochran a mutually advantageous one he interrupted perceptive enough to catch the beginning of a refusal with deliberate ease he tossed out a sixdigit annual salary that rendered summer momentarily speechless not a simple task and generous she said when she found her voice again one doesnt get the best unless ones willing to pay for it id like you to think about this ms lyndon he reached in his briefcase and pulled out a sheaf of papers this is a draft of an agreement you might like to have your attorney look it over and of course points can be negotiated she didnt want to look at the damn contract because she could feel quite tangibly that she was being maneuvered into a corner a very plush one mr cocharan i do appreciate your interest but after youve thought it over id like to discuss it with you again perhaps over dinner say friday summer narrowed her eyes the man was a steamroller she decided a very attractive very sleek steamroller no matter how elegant the machinery you still got flattened if you were in the path haughtiness emanated from her im sorry im working friday evening the governors charity affair ah yes he smiled though his stomach had tightened he had a suddenly vivid completely wild image of making love to her on the ground of some moist shadowy forest that alone nearly made him consider accepting her refusal and that alone made him all the more determined not to i can pick you up there we can have a late supper mr cocharan summer said in a frigid voice youre going to have to learn to take no for an answer like hell he thought grimly but gave her a rather rueful rather charming smile my apologies ms lyndon if i seem to be pressuring you you were my first choice you see and i tend to go with my instincts however seemingly reluctant he rose the knot of tension and anger in summers stomach began to loosen if your minds made up he plucked the contract from the table and started to slip it into his briefcase perhaps you can give me your opinion on louis lapointe lapointe the word whispered through summers lips like venom very slowly she uncurled from the sofa then rose her whole body stiff you ask me of lapointe in anger her french ancestry became more pronounced in her speech id appreciate anything you could tell me blake went on amiably knowing full well hed scored his first real point off her seeing that you and he are associates and with a toss of her head summer said something short rude and to the point in her mothers tongue the gold flecks in her eyes glimmered sherlock holmes had professor moriarty superman had lex luthor summer lyndon had louis lapointe slimy pig she grated reverting to english he has the mind of a peanut and the hands of a lumberjack you want to know about lapointe she snatched a cigarette from the case on the table lighting it as she did only when extremely agitated hes a peasant what else is there to know according to my information hes one of the five top chefs in paris blake pressed because a good pressure point was an invaluable weapon his canard en croute is said to be unsurpassable shoe leather she all but spat out the words and blake had to school every facial muscle to prevent the grin professional vanity he thought again she had her share then as she drew in a deep breath he had to school the rest of his muscles to hold off a fierce surge of desire sensuality perhaps she had more than her share why are you asking me about lapointe im flying to paris next week to meet with him since youre refusing my offer youll offer this she wagged a finger at the contract still in blakes hand to him admittedly hes my second choice but there are those on the board who feel louis lapointe is more qualified for the position is that so her eyes were slits now behind a screen of smoke she plucked the contract from his hand then dropped it beside her cooling coffee the members of your board are perhaps ignorant they are he managed perhaps mistaken indeed summer took a drag of her cigarette then released smoke in a quick stream she detested the taste you can pick me up at nine oclock on friday at the governors kitchen mr cocharan well discuss this matter further my pleasure ms lyndon he inclined his head careful to keep his face expressionless until hed closed the front door behind him he laughed his way down four flights of steps chapter contents prev next making a good dessert from scratch isnt a simple matter creating a masterpiece from flour eggs and sugar is something else again whenever summer picked up a bowl or a whisk or beater she felt it her duty to create a masterpiece adequate as an adjective in conjuction with her work was the ultimate insult adequate to summer was the result achieved by a newlywed with a cookbook first opened the day after the honeymoon she didnt simply bake mix or freeze she conceived developed and achieved an architect an engineer a scientist did no more no less when shed chosen to study the art of haute cuisine she hadnt done so lightly and she hadnt done so without the goal of perfection in mind perfection was still what she sought whenever she lifted a spoon shed already spent the better part of her day in the kitchen of the governors mansion other chefs fussed with soups and sauces or each other all of summers talent was focused on the creation of the finale the exquisite mix of tastes and textures the overall aesthetic beauty of the bombe the mold was already lined with the moist cake shed baked then systematically sliced into a pattern this had been done with templates as meticulously as when an engineer designs a bridge the mousse a paradise of chocolate and cream was already inside the desserts dome this deceptively simple element had been chilling since early morning between the preparations the mixing making and building summer had been on her feet essentially that long now she had the beginnings of her bombe on a waisthigh table with a large stainless steel bowl of crushed berries at her elbow at her firm instructions chopin drifted through the kitchen speakers the first course was already being enjoyed in the dining room she could ignore the confusion reigning around her she could shrug off the pressure of having her part of the meal complete and perfect at precisely the right moment that was all routine but as she stood there prepared to begin the next step her concentration was scattered lapointe she thought with gritted teeth naturally it was anger that had kept her attention from being fully focused all day the idea of having louis lapointe tossed in her face it hadnt taken summer long to realize that blake cocharan had used the name on purpose knowing it however didnt make the least bit of difference to her reaction except perhaps that her venom was spread over two men rather than one oh he thinks hes very clever summer decided thinking of blake as she had too often that week she took three cleansing breaths as she studied the golden dome in front of her asking me me to give lapointe a reference despicable french swine she muttered silently referring to lapointe as she scooped up the first berries she decided that blake must be an equal swine even to be considering dealing with the frenchman she could remember every frustrating annoying contact shed had with the beadyeyed undersized lapointe as she carefully coated the outside of the cake with crashed berries summer considered giving him a glowing recommendation it would teach that sneaky american a lesson to find himself stuck with a pompous ass like lapointe while her thoughts raged her hands were delicately smoothing the berries rounding out and firming the shape behind her one of the assistants dropped a pan with a clatter and a bang and suffered a torrent of abuse neither summers thoughts nor her hands faltered smug selfassured jerk she thought grimly of blake in a steady flow she began layering rich french cream over the berries her face though set in concentration betrayed anger in the flash in her eyes a man like him delighted in maneuvering and outmaneuvering it showed she thought in that ohsosmooth delivery in that gloss of sophistication she gave a disdainful little snort as she began to smooth out the cream shed rather have a man with a few rough edges than one so polished that he gleamed shed rather have a man who knew how to sweat and bend his back than one with manicured nails and fivehundreddollar suits she rather have a man who summer stopped smoothing the cream while her thoughts caught up with her consciousness since when had she considered having any man and why for gods sake was she using blake for comparisons ridiculous the bombe was now a smooth white dome waiting for its coating of rich chocolate summer frowned at it as an assistant whisked empty bowls out of her way she began to blend the frosting in a large mixer as two cooks argued over the thickness of the sauce for the entree for that matter her thoughts ran on it was ridiculous how often shed thought of him the past few days remembering foolish details his eyes were almost precisely the shade of the water in the lake on her grandfathers estate in devon how pleasant his voice was deep with that faint but unmistakable inflection of the american northeast how his mouth curved in one fashion when he was amused and another when he smiled politely it was difficult to explain why shed noticed those things much less why shed continued to think of them days afterward as a rule she didnt think of a man unless she was with him and even then she only allowed him a carefully regulated portion of her concentration now summer reminded herself as she began to layer on frosting wasnt the time to think of anything but the bombe shed think of blake when her job was finished and shed deal with him over the late supper shed agreed to oh yes her mouth set shed deal with him blake arrived early deliberately he wanted to see her work that was reasonable even logical after all if he were to contract summer to cocharan house for a year he should see firsthand what she was capable of and how she went about it it wasnt at all unusual for him to check out potential employees or associates on their own turf if anything it was characteristic of him good business sense he continued to tell himself so over and over because there was a lingering doubt as to his own motivations perhaps he had left her apartment in high good spirits knowing hed outmaneuvered her in the first round her face at the mention of her rival lapointe had been priceless and it was her face that he hadnt been able to push out of his mind for nearly a week uncomfortable he decided as he stepped into the huge echoing kitchen the woman made him uncomfortable hed like to know the reason why knowing the reasons and motivations was essential to him with them neatly listed the answers to any problem would eventually follow he appreciated beauty in art in architecture and certainly in the female form summer lyndon was beautiful that shouldnt have made him uncomfortable intelligence was something he not only appreciated but invariably demanded in anyone he associated with she was undoubtedly intelligent no reason for discomfort there style was something else he looked for hed certainly found it in her what was it about her the eyes he wondered as he passed two cooks in a heated argument over pressed duck that odd hazel that wasnt precisely a definable color those gold flecks that deepened or lightened according to her mood very direct very frank eyes he mused blake respected that yet the contrast of moody color that wasnt really a color intrigued him perhaps too much sexuality it was a foolish man who was wary because of a natural feminine sexuality and hed never considered himself a foolish man nor a particularly susceptible one yet the first time hed seen her hed felt that instant curl of desire that immediate pull of man for woman unusual he thought dispassionately something hed have to consider carefully then dispose of there wasnt room for desire between business associates and they would be that he thought as his lips curved blake counted on his own powers of persuasion and his casual mention of lapointe to turn summer lyndon his way she was already turning that way and after tonight he reflected then stopped dead for a moment it felt as though someone had delivered him a very quick very stunning blow to the base of the spine hed only had to look at her she was halfhidden by the dessert she worked on her face was set intent he saw the faint line that mightve been temper or concentration run down between her brows her eyes were narrowed the lashes swept down so that the expression was unreadable her mouth that soft molded mouth that she seemed never to paint was forming a pout it was utterly kissable she should have looked plain and efficient all in white the chefs hat over her neatly bound hair could have given an almost comic touch instead she looked outrageously beautiful standing there blake could hear the chopin that was her trademark smell the exotic pungent scents of cooking feel the tension in the air as temperamental cooks fussed and labored over their creations all he could think and think quite clearly was how she would look naked in his bed with only candles to vie with the dark catching himself blake shook his head stop it he thought with grim amusement when you mix business and pleasure one or both suffers that was something blake invariably avoided without effort he held the position he did because he could recognize weigh and dismiss errors before they were ever made and he could do so with a coldblooded ruthlessness that was as clean as his looks the woman might be as delectable as the concoction she was creating but that wasnt what he wanted correction what he could afford to want from her he needed her skill her name and her brain that was all for now he comforted himself with that thought as he fought back waves of a more insistent and much more basic need as he stood as far outside of the melee as possible blake watched her patiently methodically apply and smooth on layer after layer there was no hesitation in her hands something he noticed with approval even as he noted the fineboned elegant shape of them there was no lack of confidence in her stance looking on blake realized that she might have been alone for all the noise and confusion around her mattered the woman he decided could build her spectacular bombe on the ben franklin parkway at rush hour and never miss a step good he couldnt use some hysterical female who folded under pressure patiently he waited as she completed her work by the time summer had the pastry bag filled with white icing and had begun the final decorating most of the kitchen staff were on hand to watch the rest of the meal was a fait accompli there was only the finale now on the last swirl she stepped back there was a communal sigh of appreciation still she didnt smile as she walked completely around the bombe checking rechecking perfection nothing less was acceptable then blake saw her eyes clear her lips curve at the scattered applause she grinned and was more than beautiful she was approachable he found that disturbed him even more take it in with a laugh she stretched her arms high to work out a dozen stiffened muscles she decided she could sleep for a week very impressive arms still high summer turned slowly to find herself facing blake thank you her voice was very cool her eyes wary sometime between the berries and the frosting shed decided to be very very careful with blake cocharan iii its meant to be in looks he agreed glancing down he saw the large bowl of chocolate frosting that had yet to be removed he ran his finger around the edge then licked it off the taste was enough to melt the hardest hearts fantastic she couldnt have prevented the smile a little boys trick from a man in an exquisite suit and silk tie naturally she told him with a little toss of her head i only make the fantastic which is why you want me correct mr cocharan mmm the sound might have been agreement or it might have been something else wisely both left it at that you must be tired after being on your feet for so long a perceptive man she murmured pulling off the chefs hat if youd like well have supper at my penthouse its private quiet youd be comfortable she lifted a brow then sent a quick distrustful look over his face intimate suppers were something to be considered carefully she might be tired summer mused but she could still hold her own with any man particularly an american businessman with a shrug she pulled off her stained apron thats fine itll only take me a minute to change she left him without a backward glance but as he watched she was waylaid by a small man with a dark moustache who grabbed her hand and pressed it dramatically to his lips blake didnt have to overhear the words to gauge the intent he felt a twist of annoyance that with some effort he forced into amusement the man was speaking rapidly while working his way up summers arm she laughed shook her head and gently nudged him away blake watched the man gaze after her like a forlorn puppy before he clutched his own chefs hat to his heart quite an effect she has on the male of the species blake mused again dispassionately he reflected that there was a certain type of woman who drew men without any visible effort it was an innate skill he supposed was the correct term a skill he didnt admire or condemn but simply mistrusted a woman like that could manipulate with the flick of the wrist on a personal level he preferred women who were more obvious in their gifts he positioned himself well out of the way while the cacophony and confusion of cleaning up began it was a skill he figured wouldnt hurt in her position as head chef of his philadelphia cocharan house in nine more than the minute shed claimed shed be summer strolled back into the kitchen shed chosen the thin poppycolored silk because it was perfectly simple so simple it had a tendency to cling to every curve and draw every eye her arms were bare but for one ornately carved gold bracelet she wore just above the elbow drop spiral earrings fell almost to her shoulders unbound now her hair curled a bit around her face from the heat and humidity of the kitchen she knew the result was part eccentric part exotic just as she knew it transmitted a primal sexuality she dressed as she did from jeans to silks for her own pleasure and at her own whim but when she saw the fire quickly banked in blakes eyes she was perversely satisfied no iceman she mused of course she wasnt interested in him in any personal way she simply wanted to establish herself as a person an individual rather than a name he wanted neatly signed on a contract her work clothes were jumbled into a canvas tote she carried in one hand while over her other shoulder hung a tiny exquisitely beaded purse in a rather regal gesture she offered blake her hand ready of course her hand was cool small and smooth he thought of streaming sunlight and wet fragrant grass because of it his voice became cool and pragmatic youre lovely she couldnt resist humor leaped into her eyes of course for the first time she saw him grin fast appealing dangerous in that moment she wasnt quite certain who held the upper hand my drivers waiting outside blake told her smoothly together they walked from the brightly lit noisy kitchen out into the moonlit street i take it you were satisfied with your part of the governors meal you didnt choose to stay for the criticism or compliments as she stepped into the back of the limo summer sent him an incredulous look criticism the bombe is my specialty mr cocharan its always superb i need no one to tell me that she got in the car smoothed her skirt and crossed her legs of course blake murmured sliding beside her its a complicated dish he went on conversationally if my memory serves me it takes hours to prepare properly she watched him remove a bottle of champagne from ice and open it with only a muffled pop theres very little that can be superb in a short amount of time very true blake poured champagne into two tulip glasses and handing summer one smiled to a lengthy association summer gave him a frank look as the streetlights flickered into the car and over his face a bit scottish warrior a bit english aristocrat she decided not a simple combination then again simplicity wasnt always what she looked for with only a brief hesitation she touched her glass to his perhaps she said you enjoy your work mr cocharan she sipped and without looking at the label identified the vintage of the wine she drank very much he watched her as he drank noting that shed done no more than sweep some mascara over her lashes when shed changed for an instant he was distracted by the speculation of what her skin would feel like under his fingers its obvious by what i caught of that session in there that you enjoy yours yes she smiled appreciating him and what she thought would be an interesting struggle for power i make it a policy to do only what i enjoy unless im very much mistaken you have the same policy he nodded knowing he was being baited youre very perceptive ms lyndon yes she held her glass out for a refill you have excellent taste in wines does that extend to other areas his eyes locked on hers as he filled her glass all other areas her mouth curved slowly as she brought the champagne to it summer enjoyed the effervescence she could feel just before she tasted it of course would it be accurate to say that youre a discriminating man what the hell was she getting at if you like blake returned smoothly a businessman she went on an executive tell me dont executives delegate often and you dont you delegate that depends i wondered why blake cocharan hi himself would take the time and trouble to woo a chef into his organization he was certain she was laughing at him more he was certain she wanted him to know it with an effort he suppressed his annoyance this project is a personal pet of mine since i want only the best for it i take the time and trouble to acquire the best personally i see the limo glided smoothly to the curb summer handed blake her empty glass as the driver opened her door then how strange that you would even mention lapointe if only the best will serve you with the haughty grace a woman can only be born with summer alighted that she thought smugly should poke a few holes in his arrogance the cocharan house of philadelphia stood only twelve stories and had a weathered brick facade it had been built to blend and accent the colonial architecture that was the heart of the city other buildings might zoom higher might gleam with modernity but blake cocharan had known what hed wanted elegance style and discretion that was cocharan house summer was forced to approve in a great many things she preferred the old world to the new the lobby was quiet and if the gold was a bit dull the rugs a bit soft and faded looking it was a deliberate and canny choice old established wealth was the ambience no amount of gloss gleam or gilt would have been more effective taking summers arm blake passed through with only a nod here and there to the many good evening mr cocharans he received after inserting a key into a private elevator he led her inside they were enveloped by silence and smoked glass a lovely place summer commented its been years since ive been inside id forgotten she glanced around the elevator and saw their reflections trapped deep in gray glass but dont you find it confining to live in a hotel to live that is where you work no convenient a pity summer mused when she wasnt working she wanted to remove herself from the kitchens and timers shed never been one as her mother and father had been to bring her work home with her the elevator stopped so smoothly that the change was hardly noticeable the doors slid open silently do you have the entire floor to yourself therere three guest suites as well as my penthouse blake explained as they walked down the hall none of them are occupied at the moment he inserted a key into a single panel of a double oak door then gestured her inside the lights were already dimmed hed chosen his colors well she thought as she stepped onto the thick pewtertoned carpet grays from silvery pale to smoky dominated in the low spreading sofa the chairs the walls with the lights low it had a dreamlike effect that was both sensuous and soothing it might have been dull even bland but there were splashes of color cleverly interspersed the deep midnight blue of the drapes the pearllike tones of the army of cushions lining the sofa the rich primal green of an ivy tangling down the rungs of a breakfront then there were the glowing colors of the one painting a french impressionist that dominated one wall there was none of the clutter she would have chosen for herself but a sense of style she admired immediately unusual mr cocharan summer complimented as she automatically stepped out of her shoes and effective thank you another drink ms lyndon the bars fully stocked or theres champagne if you prefer still determined to come out of the evening on top summer strolled to the sofa and sat she sent him a cool easy smile i always prefer champagne while blake dealt with the bottle and cork she took an extra moment to study the room again not an ordinary man she decided too often ordinary was synonymous with boring summer was forced to admit that because shed associated herself with the bohemian the eccentric the creative for most of her life shed always thought of people in business as innately boring no blake cocharan wouldnt be dull she almost regretted it a dull man no matter how attractive could be handled with the minimum of effort blake was going to be difficult particularly since shed yet to come to a firm decision on his proposition your champagne ms lyndon when she lifted her eyes to his blake had to fight back a frown the look was too measuring too damn calculating just what was the woman up to now and why in gods name did she look so right so temptingly right curled on his sofa with pillows at her back you must be hungry he said astonished that he needed the defense of words if youd tell me what youd like the kitchen will prepare it or i can get you a menu if youd prefer a menu wont be necessary she sipped more cold frothy french champagne id like a cheeseburger blake watched the silk shift as she nestled into the corner of the sofa a what cheeseburger summer repeated with a side order of fries shoestring she lifted her glass to examine the color of the liquid do you know this was a truly exceptional year ms lyndon with strained patience blake dipped his hands in his pockets and kept his voice even exactly what game are you playing she sipped slowly savoring game do you seriously want me to believe that you a gourmet a cordon bleu chef want to eat a cheeseburger and shoestring fries i wouldnt have said so otherwise when her glass was empty summer rose to refill it herself she moved he noted lazily with none of that sharp almost military motion shed used when cooking your kitchen does have lean prime beef doesnt it of course certain she was trying to annoy him or make a fool of him blake took her arm and turned her to face him why do you want a cheeseburger because i like them she said simply i also like tacos and pizza and fried chicken particularly when someone else is cooking them that sort of thing is quick tasty and convenient she grinned relaxed by the wine amused by his reaction do you have a moral objection to junk food mr cocharan no but id think you would ah ive shattered your image of a gastronomic snob she laughed a very appealing purely feminine sound as a chef i can tell you that rich sauces and heavy creams arent easy on the digestion either besides that i cook professionally for long periods of time im surrounded by the finest of haute cuisine delicacies foods that have to be prepared with absolute perfection splitsecond timing when im not working i like to relax she drank champagne again id prefer a cheeseburger medium rare to filet aux champignons at the moment if you dont mind your choice he muttered and moved the phone to order her explanation had been reasonable even logical there was nothing which annoyed him more than having his own style of maneuvering used against him with her glass in hand summer wandered to the window she liked the looks of a city at night the buildings rose and spread in the distance and traffic wound its way silently on the intersecting roads lights darkness shadows she couldnt have counted the number of cities shed been in or viewed from a similar spot but her favorite remained paris yet shed chosen to live for long lengths of time in the states she liked the contrast of people and cultures and attitudes she liked the ambition and enthusiasm of americans which she saw typified in her mothers second husband ambition was something she understood she had a lot of her own she understood this to be the reason she looked for men with more creative ability than ambition in her personal relationships two competitive careeroriented people made an uneasy couple shed learned that early on watching her own parents with each other and their subsequent spouses when she chose permanence in a relationship something summer considered was at least a decade away she wanted someone who understood that her career came first any cook from a child making a peanut butter sandwich to a master chef had to understand priorities summer had understood her own all of her life you like the view blake stood behind her where hed been studying her for a full five minutes why should she seem different from any other woman hed ever brought to his home why should she seem more elusive more alluring and why should her presence alone make it so difficult for him to keep his mind on the business hed brought her there for yes she didnt turn because she realized abruptly just how close he was it was something she should have sensed before summer thought with a slight frown if she turned theyd be facetoface thered be a brush of bodies a meeting of eyes the quick scramble of nerves made her sip the champagne again ridiculous she told herself no man made her nervous youve lived here long enough to recognize the points of interest blake said easily while his thoughts centered on how the curve of her neck would taste would feel under the brush of his lips of course i consider myself a philadelphian when im in philadelphia im told by some of my associates that ive become quite americanized blake listened to the flow of the european accented voice drew in the subtle sexy scent of paris that was her perfume the dim light touched on the gold scattered through her hair like her eyes he thought he had only to turn her around and look at her face to see her sculptured exotic look and he wanted overwhelmingly to see that face americanized blake murmured his hands were on her shoulders before he could stop them the silk slid cool under his palms as he turned her no his gaze flicked down over her hair and eyes and lingered on her mouth i think your associates are very much mistaken do you her fingers had tightened on the stem of her glass her mouth had heated will power alone kept her voice steady her body brushed his once then twice as he began to draw her closer needs tightly controlled began to smolder while her mind raced with the possibilities summer tilted her head back and spoke calmly what about the business were here to discuss mr cocharan we havent started on business yet his mouth hovered over hers for a moment before he shifted to whisper a kiss just under one eyebrow and before we do it might be wise to settle this one point her breathing was clogging backing up in her lungs drawing away was still possible but she began to wonder why she should consider it point your lips will they taste as exciting as they look her lashes were fluttering down her body softening interesting point she murmured then tilted her head back in invitation their lips were only a breath apart when the sharp knock sounded at the door something cleared in summers brain reason while her body continued to hum she smiled concentrating hard on that one slice of sanity the service in a cocharan house is invariably excellent tomorrow blake said as he drew reluctantly away im going to fire my room service manager summer laughed but took a shaky sip of wine when he left her to answer the door close she thought letting out a long steadying breath much too close it was time to steer the evening into business channels and keep it there she gave herself a moment while the waiter set up the meal on the table smells wonderful summer commented crossing the room as blake tipped and dismissed the waiter before sitting she glanced at his meal steak rare a steaming potato popping out of its skin buttered asparagus very sensible she shot him a teasing grin over her shoulder as he held out her chair we can order dessert later never touch them she said tongue in cheek with a generous hand she spread mustard over her bun i read over your contract did you he watched as she cut the burger neatly in two then lifted a half it shouldnt surprise him blake mused she did after all keep oreos in her cookie jar so did my attorney blake added some ground pepper to his steak before cutting into it and and it seems to be very much in order except she allowed the word to hang while she took the first bite closing her eyes summer simply enjoyed except blake prompted if i were to consider such an offer id need considerably more room blake ignored the if she was considering it and they both knew it in what area certainly youre aware that i do quite a bit of traveling summer dashed salt on the french fries tasted and approved often its a matter of two or three days when i go to say venice and prepare a gateau st honore some of my clients book me months in advance on the other hand there are some that deal more spontaneously a few of these summer bit into the cheeseburger again ill accommodate because of personal affection or professional challenge in other words youd want to fly to venice or wherever when you felt it necessary however incongruous he felt the combination was blake poured more champagne into her glass while she ate precisely though your offer does have some slight interest for me it would be impossible even i feel unethical to turn my back on established clients understood she was crafty blake thought but so was he i should think a reasonable arrangement could be worked out you and i could go over your current schedule summer nibbled on a fry then dusted her fingers on a white linen napkin you and i that would keep it simpler then if we agreed to discuss whatever other occasions might crop up during the year on an individual basis he smiled as she picked up the second half of her cheeseburger i like to think im a reasonable man ms lyndon and to be frank i personally would prefer signing you with my hotel at the moment the boards leaning toward lapointe but why the word was a demand and an accusation nothing could have pleased blake more characteristically the great chefs are men she cursed bluntly and brutally in french blake merely nodded yes exactly and through some discreet questioning weve learned that monsieur lapointe is very interested in the position the swine would scramble at a chance to roast chestnuts on a street corner if only to have his picture in the paper tossing down her napkin she rose you think perhaps i dont understand your strategy mr cocharan the regal lifting of her head accentuated her long slender neck blake remembered quite vividly how that skin had felt under his fingers you throw lapointe in my face thinking that ill grab your offer as a matter of ego of pride he grinned because she looked magnificent did it work her eyes narrowed but her lips wanted badly to curve lapointe is a philistine i am an artist and she knew better than to agree to anything in anger knew better but you accommodate my schedule mr cocharan the third and ill make your restaurant the finest establishment of its kind on the east coast and damn it she could do it she found she wanted to do it to prove it to both of them blake rose lifting both glasses to your art mademoiselle he handed her a glass and to my business may it be a profitable union for both of us to success she amended clinking glass to glass which in the end is what we both look for chapter contents prev next well ive done it summer thought scowling she swept back her hair and secured it with two motherofpearl combs critically she studied her face in the mirror to check her makeup shed learned the trick of accenting her best features from her mother when the occasion called for it and she was in the mood summer exploited the art although she felt the face that was reflected at her would do she frowned anyway whether it had been anger or ego or just plain cussedness shed agreed to tie herself to the cocharan house and blake for the next year maybe she did want the challenge of it but already she was uncomfortable with the longterm commitment and the obligations that went with it three hundred sixtyfive days no that was too overwhelming she decided fiftytwo weeks was hardly a better image twelve months well shed just have to live with it no shed have to do better than that summer decided as she wandered back into the studio where shed be taping a demonstration for public tv she had to live up to her vow to give the philadelphia cocharan house the finest restaurant on the east coast and so she would she told herself with a flick of her hair over her shoulder so she damn well would then shed thumb her nose at blake cocharan iii the sneak hed manipulated her twice hed manipulated her even though shed been perfectly aware of it the second time shed strolled down the garden path anyway why summer ran her tongue over her teeth and watched the television crew set up for the taping the challenge she decided twisting her braided gold chain around one slim finger it would be a challenge to work with him and stay on top competing was her greatest weakness after all that was one reason shed chosen to excel in a career that was characteristically maledominated oh yes she liked to compete best of all she liked to win then there was that ripe masculinity of his polished manners couldnt hide it tailored clothes couldnt cloak it if she were honest and she decided she would be for the moment summer had to admit shed enjoy exploring it she knew her effect on men a genetic gift shed always thought from her mother it was rare that she paid much attention to her own sexuality her life was too full of the pressures of her work and the complete relaxation she demanded between clients but it might be time summer mused now to alter things a bit blake cocharan iii represented a definite challenge and how shed love to shake up that smug male arrogance how shed like to pay him back for maneuvering her to precisely where hed wanted her as she considered varied ways and means to do just that summer idly watched the studio audience file in they had the capacity for about fifty and apparently theyd have a full house this morning people were talking in undertones the mumbles and shuffles associated with theaters and churches the director a small excitable man whom summer had worked with before hustled from grip to gaffer light to camera tossing his arms in gestures that signaled pleasure or dread only extremes when he came over to her summer listened to his quick nervous instructions with half an ear she wasnt thinking of him nor was she thinking of the vacherin she was to prepare on camera she was still thinking of the best way to handle blake cocharan perhaps she should pursue him subtly but not so subtly that he wouldnt notice then when his ego was inflated shed shed totally ignore him a fascinating idea the first baked shell is in the center storage cabinet yes simon i know summer patted the directors hand while she went over the plan for flaws it had a big one she could remember all too clearly that giddy sensation that had swept over her when hed nearly just barely kissed her a few evenings before if she played the game that way she just might find herself muddling the rules so the second is right beneath it yes i know hadnt she put it there herself to cool after baking summer gave the frantic director an absent smile she could ignore blake right from the start treat him not with contempt but with disinterest the smile became a bit menacing her eyes glinted that should drive him crazy all the ingredients and equipment are exactly where you put them simon summer began kindly stop worrying i can build a vacherin in my sleep we roll tape in five minutes where is she both summer and simon looked around at the bellowing voice her grin was already forming before she saw its owner carlo aha dark and wiry and as supple as a snake carlo franconi wound his way around people and over cable to grab summer and pull her jarringly against his chest my little french pastry fondly he patted her bottom laughing she returned the favor carlo whatre you doing in downtown philadelphia on a wednesday morning i was in new york promoting my new book pasta by the master he drew back enough to wiggle his eyebrows at her and i said carlo you are just around the corner from the sexiest woman who ever held a pastry bag so i come just around the corner summer repeated it was typical of him if hed been in los angeles hed have done the same thing theyd studied together cooked together and perhaps if their friendship had not become so solid and important they might have slept together let me look at you obligingly carlo stepped back to pose he wore straight tight jeans that flattered narrow hips a salmoncolored silk shirt and a cloth federa that was tilted rakishly over his dark almondshaped eyes an outrageous diamond glinted on his finger as always he was beautiful male and aware of it you look fantastic carlo fantastico but of course he ran a finger down the brim of his hat and you my delectable puff pastry he took her hands and pressed each palm to his lips esquisita but of course laughing again she kissed him full on the mouth she knew hundreds of people professionally socially but if shed been asked to name a friend it would have been carlo franconi whod have come to her mind its good to see you carlo whats it been four months five you were in belgium the last time i was in italy four months and twelve days he said easily but who counts its only that i lusted for your napoleans your éclairs your he grabbed her again and nibbled on her fingers chocolate cake its vacherin this morning she said dryly and youre welcome to some when the shows over ah your meringue to die for he grinned wickedly i will sit in the front row and cross my eyes at you summer pinched his cheek try to lighten up carlo youre so stuffy ms lyndon please summer glanced at simon whose breathing was becoming shallower as the countdown began its all right simon im ready get your seat carlo and watch carefully you might learn something this time he said something short and rude and easily translated as they went their separate ways relaxed summer stood behind her work surface and watched the floor director count off the seconds easily ignoring the face carlo made at her summer began the show talking directly to the camera she took this part of her profession as seriously as she took creating the royal wedding cake for a european princess if she were to teach the average person how to make something elaborate and exciting she would do it well she did look exquisite carlo thought then she always did and confident competent cool on one hand he was glad to find it true for he was a man who disliked things or people who changed too quickly particularly if he had nothing to do with it on the other hand he worried about her as long as hed known summer good god had it been ten years shed never allowed herself a personal involvement it was difficult for a volatile emotional man like himself to fully understand her quality of reserve her apparent disinterest in romantic encounters she had passion hed seen it explode in temper in joy but never had he seen it directed toward a man a pity he thought as he watched her build the meringue rings a woman he felt was wasted without a man just as a man was wasted without a woman hed shared himself with many once over kircsh cake and chablis shed loosened up enough to tell him that she didnt think that men and women were meant for permanent relationships marriage was an institution too easily dissolved and therefore not an institution at all but a hypocrisy perpetuated by people who wanted to pretend they could make commitments love was a fickle emotion and therefore untrustworthy it was something exploited by people as an excuse to act foolishly or unwisely if she wanted to act foolish shed do so without excuses at the time because hed been on the down end of an affair with a greek heiress carlo had agreed with her later hed realized that while his agreement had been the temporary result of sour grapes summer had meant precisely what shed said a pity he thought again as summer took out the previously baked rings from beneath the counter and began to build the shell if he didnt feel about her as he would about a sister it would be a pleasure to show her the appealing side of the man woman mystique ah well he settled back that was for someone else keeping an easy monologue with the camera and the studio audience summer went through the stages of the dessert the completed shell decorated with strips of more meringue and dotted with candied violets was popped into an oven the one that shed baked and cooled earlier was brought out to complete the final stage she filled it arranged the fruit covered it all with rich raspberry sauce and whipped cream to the murmured approval of her audience the camera came in for a closeup brava carlo stood applauding as the dessert sat tempting and complete on the counter bravissima summer grinned and pastry bag in hand took a deep bow as the camera clicked off brilliant ms lyndon simon rushed up to her whipping off his earphones as he came just brilliant and as always perfect thank you simon shall we serve this to the audience and crew yes yes good idea he snapped his fingers at his assistant get some plates and pass this out before we have to clear for the next show aerobic dancing he muttered and dashed off again beautiful cara carlo told her as he dipped a finger into the whipped cream a masterpiece he took a spoon from the counter and took a hefty serving directly from the vacherin now i will take you to lunch and you can fill me in on your life mine he shrugged still eating is so exciting it would take days maybe weeks we can grab a slice of pizza around the corner summer pulled off her apron and tossed it on the counter as it happens theres something id like your advice about advice though the idea of summers asking advice of him of anyone stunned him carlo only lifted a brow naturally he said with a silky smile as he drew her along who else would an intelligent woman come to for advice or for anything but carlo youre such a pig darling careful he slipped on dark glasses and adjusted his hat or you pay for the pizza within moments summer was taking her first bite and bracing herself as carlo zoomed his rented ferrari into philadelphia traffic carlo managed to steer and eat and shift gears with maniacal skill so tell me he shouted over the boom of the radio whats on your mind ive taken a job summer yelled back at him her hair whipped across her face and she tossed it back again a job so you take lots of jobs this is different she shifted crossing her legs beneath her and turning sideways as she took the next bite ive agreed to revamp and manage a hotel restaurant for the next year hotel restaurant carlo frowned over his slice of pizza as he cut off a station wagon what hotel she took a deep sip of soda through a straw the cocharan house here in philadelphia ah his expression cleared first class cam i should never have doubted you a year carlo goes quickly when one has ones health he finished blithely she let the grin come first damn it carlo i painted myself into a corner because well i just couldnt resist the idea of trying it and this this american steamroller tossed lapointe in my face lapointe carlo snarled as only an italian can what does that gallic slug have to do with this summer licked sauce from her thumb i was going to turn down the offer at first then blake thats the steamroller asked me for my opinion on lapointe since he was also being considered for the position and did you give it to him carlo asked with relish i did and i kept the contract to look it over the next hitch was that it was a tremendous offer with the budget i have i could turn a tworoom slum into a gourmet palace she frowned not noticing when carlo zoomed around a compact with little more than wind between metal in addition to that theres blake himself the steamroller yes i cant control the need to get the best of him hes smart hes smug and damn it hes sexy as hell oh yes i have this tremendous urge to put him in his place carlo breezed through a yellow light as it was turning red which is under my thumb with a laugh summer polished off her pizza so because of those things ive locked myself into a yearlong commitment are you going to eat the rest of that carlo glanced down to the remains of his pizza then took a healthy bite yes and the advice you wanted after drawing through the straw again summer discovered shed hit bottom if im going to stay sane while locked into a project for a year i need a diversion grinning she stretched her arms to the sky whats the most foolproof way to make blake cocharan iii crawl heartless woman carlo said with a smirk you dont need my advice for that you already have men crawling in twenty countries no i dont you simply dont look behind you cara mia summer frowned not certain she liked the idea after all turn left at the corner carlo well drop in on my new kitchen the sights and smells were familiar enough but within moments summer saw a dozen changes shed make the lighting was good she mused as she walked arminarm with carlo and the space but theyd need an eyelevel walloven there brick lined a replacement for the electric oven and certainly more kitchen help she glanced around checking the corners of the ceiling for speakers none that too would change not bad my love carlo took down a large chefs knife and checked it for weight and balance you have the rudiments here its a bit like getting a new toy for christmas and having to assemble it si hmmm absently she picked up a skillet stainless steel she noted and set it down again the pans would have to be replaced with copper washed with tin she turned and thudded firmly into blakes chest there was a fraction of a second when she softened enjoying the sensation of body against body his scent sophisticated slightly aloof pleased her then came the annoyance that she hadnt sensed him behind her as she felt she should have mr cocharan she drew away masking both the attraction and the annoyance with a polite smile somehow i didnt think to find you here my staff keeps me well informed ms lyndon i was told you were here the idea of being reported on might have grated but summer only nodded this is carlo franconi she began one of the finest chefs in italy the finest chef in italy carlo corrected extending his hand a pleasure to meet you mr cocharan ive often enjoyed the hospitality of your hotels your restaurant in milan makes a very passable linguini very passable is a great compliment from carlo summer explained he doesnt think anyone can make an italian dish but himself not think know carlo lifted the lid on a steaming pot and sniffed summer tells me shell be associated with your restaurant here youre a fortunate man blake looked down at summer glancing at the lean tanned hand carlo had placed on her shoulder jealousy is a sensation that can be recognized even if it has never been experienced before blake didnt care for it or the cause yes i am since youre here ms lyndon you might like to sign the final contract it would save us both a meeting later all right carlo go do your business they do a rack of lamb over there it interests me without a backward glance he went to add his two cents well hes happy summer commented as she walked through the kitchen with blake is he in town on business no he just wanted to see me it was said carelessly and truthfully and had the effect of knotting blakes stomach muscles so she liked slick italians he thought grimly and slipped a proprietary hand over her arm without being aware of it that was certainly her business his was to get her into the kitchens as quickly as possible in silence he led her though the lobby and into the hotel offices quiet and efficient those were brief impressions before she was led into a large private room that was obviously blakes the colors were bones and creams and browns the decor a bit more modern than his apartment but she could recognize his stamp on it without being asked summer walked over and took a chair it was hardly past noon but it occurred to her that shed been on her feet for almost six consecutive hours handy that i happened to drop by when you were around she began sliding her toes out of her shoes it simplifies this contract business since ive agreed to do it we might as well get started then there will be only three hundred and sixtyfour days she added silently and sighed he didnt like her careless attitude about the contract any more than he liked her careless affection toward the italian blake walked over to his desk and lifted a packet of papers when he looked back at her some of his anger drained you look tired summer the lids she allowed to droop lifted again his first his only use of her given name intrigued her he said it as though he was thinking of the heat and the storms she felt her chest tighten and blamed it on fatigue i am i was baking meringue at seven oclock this morning coffee no thanks im afraid ive overdone that already today she glanced at the papers he held then smiled with a trace of selfsatisfaction before i sign those i should warn you im going to order some extensive changes in the kitchen one of the essential reasons youre to sign them she nodded and held out her hand you might not be so amiable when you get the bill taking a pen from a holder on his desk blake gave it to her i think were both after the same thing and would both agree cost is secondary i might think so with a flourish she looped her name on the line but im not signing the checks so she passed the contract back to him its official yes he didnt even glance at her signature before he dropped the paper on his desk id like to take you to dinner tonight she rose though she found her legs a bit reluctant to hold weight again well have to put the seal on our bargain another time ill be entertaining carlo smiling she held out her hand of course youre welcome to join us it has nothing to do with business blake took her hand then surprised them both by taking her other one and i want to see you alone she wasnt ready for this summer realized she was supposed to begin the maneuvers in her own time on her own turf now she was forced to realign her strategy and to deal with the blood warming just under her skin determined not to be outflanked this time she tilted her head and smiled we are alone his brow lifted was that a challenge or was she plainly mocking him either way this time he wasnt going to let it go deliberately he drew her into his arms she fit there smoothly it was something each of them noticed something they both found disturbing her eyes were level on his but he saw fascinated that the gold flecks had deepened amber now they seemed to glow against the cloudy changeable hazel of her irises hardly aware of what he did blake brushed the hair away from her cheek in a gesture that was as sweet and as intimate as it was uncharacteristic summer fought not to be affected by something so casual a hundred men had touched her in greeting in friendship in anger and in longing there was no reason why the mere brush of a fingertip over her skin should have her head spinning an effort of will kept her from melting into his arms or from jerking away she remained still watching him waiting when his mouth lowered toward hers she knew she was prepared the kiss would be different naturally because he was different it would be new because he was new but that was all it was still a basic form of communication between man and woman a touch of lips a pressure a testing of anothers taste it was no different from the kiss of the first couple and so it went through culture and time and the moment she experienced that touch of lips that pressure that taste she knew she was mistaken different new those words were much too mild the brush of lips for it was no more at first changed the fabric of everything her thoughts veered off into a chaos that seemed somehow right her body grew hot from within and without in the space of a heartbeat the woman whod thought she knew exactly what to expect sighed with the unexpected and reached out again she murmured when his lips hovered a breath from hers with her hands on either side of his face she drew him to her through the smoke and into the fire hed thought shed be cool and smooth and fragrant hed been so sure of it perhaps that was why the flare of heat had knocked him back on his heels smooth she was her skin was like silk when he ran his hands up her back to cup her neck fragrant she had a scent that he would from that moment on always associate with woman but not cool there was nothing cool about the mouth that clung to his or the breath that mixed with his as two pairs of lips parted there was something mindless here he couldnt grip it couldnt analyze it could only experience it with a deep almost feline sound of pleasure she ran her hands through his hair god shed thought there wasnt a taste she hadnt already known a texture she hadnt already felt but his his was beyond her scope and now just now within her reach summer wallowed in it and let her lips and tongue draw in the sweetness more shed never known greed shed grown up in a world of affluence where enough was always available for the first time in her life summer knew true hunger true need those things brought pain she discovered a deep well of it that spread from the core more the thought ran through her mind again with the knowledge that the more she took the more she would ache for blake felt her stiffen not knowing the cause he tightened his hold he wanted her now at once more than hed ever wanted or had conceived of wanting any woman she shifted in his arms resisting for the first time since hed drawn her here throwing her head back she looked up into the passion and impatience of blakes eyes enough no his hand was still tangled possessively in her hair no its not no she agreed on an unsteady breath thats why you have to let me go he released her but didnt back away youll have to explain that she had more control now barely summer realized shakily but it was better than none it was time to establish the rules her rules quickly and precisely blake youre a businessman im an artist each of us has priorities this she took a step back and stood straight cant be one of them want to bet her eyes narrowed more in surprise than annoyance odd that shed missed the ruthlessness in him it would be best if she considered that later when there was some distance between them well be working together for a specific purpose she went on smoothly but were two different people with two very different outlooks youre interested in a profit naturally and in the reputation of your company im interested in creating the proper showcase for my art and my own reputation we both want to be successful lets not cloud the issue that issues perfectly clear blake countered sos this one i want you ah the sound came out slowly deliberately she reached for her neglected purse straight and to the point it would be a bit ridiculous to take a more circular route at the moment amusement was overtaking frustration he was grateful for that because it would give him the edge hed begun to lose the minute hed tasted her youd have to be unconscious not to realize it and im not still she backed away relying on poise to get her out before she lost whatever slim advantage she had but its your kitchen and itll be my kitchen thats my main concern right now with the amount of money youre paying me you should be grateful i understand the priorities ill have a tentative list of changes and new equipment youll have to order on monday fine well go to dinner saturday summer paused at the door turned and shook her head no ill pick you up at eight it was rare that anyone ignored a statement shed made rather than temper summer tried the patient tone she remembered from her governess it was bound to infuriate blake i said no if he was infuriated he concealed it well blake merely smiled at her as one might smile at a fussy child two it seemed could play the same game with equal skill eight he repeated and sat on the corner of his desk we can even have tacos if you like youre very stubborn yes i am so am i yes you are ill see you saturday she had to put a lot of effort into the glare because she wanted to laugh in the end summer found satisfaction by slamming the door quite loudly chapter contents prev next incredible nerve summer mumbled she took another bite of her hot dog scowled and swallowed the man has incredible nerve you shouldnt let it affect your appetite cara carlo patted her shoulder as they strolled along the sidewalk toward the proud weathered bricks of independence hall summer bit into the hot dog again when she tossed her head the sun caught at the ends of her hair and flicked them with gold shut up carlo hes so arrogant with her free hand she gestured wildly while continuing to munch almost vengefully on the dog and bun carlo i dont take orders from anyone especially some tailored polished american executive with dictatorial tendencies and incredible blue eyes carlo lifted a brow at her description then shot an approving look at a leggy blonde in a short pink skirt who passed them of course not mi amore he said absently craning his neck to follow the blondes progress down the street this philadelphia of yours has the most fascinating tourist attractions si i make my own decisions run my own life summer grumbled jerking his arm when she saw where his attention had wandered i take requests franconi not orders its always been so carlo gave a last wistful look over his shoulder perhaps he could talk summer into stopping somewhere a park bench an outdoor cafe where he could get a more complete view of philadelphias attractions you must be tired of walking love he began im definitely not having dinner with him tonight that should teach him to push summer lyndon around the park carlo thought might have the most interesting of possibilities she gave him a dangerous stare youre amused because youre a man youre amused carlo corrected grinning and interested i am not oh yes cara mia you are why dont we sit so i can take in the beauty and attractions of your adopted city after all he tipped the brim of his hat at a strolling brunette in brief shorts im a tourist si she caught the gleam in his eyes and the reason for it after letting out a huff of breath summer turned a sharp right ill show you tourist attractions amico but summer carlo caught sight of a redhead in snug jeans walking a poodle the view from out here is very educational and uplifting ill lift you up she promised and ruthlessly dragged him inside the second continental congress met here in when the building was known as the pennsylvania state house there was an echoing of feet of voices a group of schoolchildren flocked by led by a prim sternfaced teacher wearing practical shoes fascinating carlo muttered why dont we go to the park summer its a beautiful day for female joggers in tiny shorts and tiny shirts id consider myself a poor friend if i didnt give you a brief history lesson before you leave this evening carlo she linked her arm more firmly through his it was actually july not july that the declaration of independence was read to the crowd in the yard outside this building incredible hadnt that brunette been heading for the park i cant tell you how interesting i find this american history but some fresh air perhaps you cant leave philadelphia without seeing the liberty bell taking him by the hand summer dragged him along a symbol of freedom is international carlo she didnt even hear his muttered assent as her thoughts began to swing back to blake again just what was he trying to prove with that gloss and machismo she demanded telling me hed pick me up at eight after id refused to go gritting her teeth she put her hands on her hips and glared at carlo men youre all basically the same arent you but no carissima amused he gave her a charming smile and ran his fingers down her cheek we are all unique especially franconi there are women in every city of the world who can attest to that pig she said bluntly refusing to be swayed with humor she sidled closer to him unconcerned that there was a group of three female college students hanging on every word dont throw your women up to me you italian lecher ah but summer he brought her palm to his lips watching the three young women over it the word is connoisseur her comment was an unladylike snort you men she corrected jerking her hand from his think of woman as something to toy with enjoy for a while then disregard no ones ever going to play that game with me grinning from ear to ear carlo took both her hands and kissed them ah no no cara mia a woman she is like the most exquisite of meals summers eyes narrowed as the three girls edged closer she struggled with a grin of her own a meal you dare to compare a woman with a meal an exquisite one carlo reminded her one you anticipate with great excitement one you linger over savor even worship her brows arched and when your plates clean carlo it stays in your memory touching his thumb and forefinger together he kissed them dramatically returns in your dreams and keeps you forever searching for an equally sensual experience very poetic she said dryly but im not going to be anyones entree no my summer you are the most forbidden of desserts and therefore the most desirable irrepressible he winked at the trio of girls this cocharan do you not think his mouth waters whenever he looks at you summer gave a short laugh took two steps away then stopped the image had an odd primitive appeal intrigued she looked back over her shoulder does it because he knew hed distracted her carlo slipped an arm around her waist and began to lead her from the building there was still time for fresh air and leggy joggers in the park behind them the three girls muttered in disappointment cara i am a man who has made a study of amore i know what i see in another mans eyes summer fought off a surge of pleasure and shrugged you italians insist on giving a pretty label to basic lust with a huge sigh carlo led her outside summer for a woman with french blood you have no romance romance belongs in books and movies romance carlo corrected belongs everywhere though shed spoken lightly carlo understood that she was being perfectly frank it worried him and in the way of friend for friend disappointed him you should try candlelight and wine and soft music summer let yourself experience it it wont hurt you she gave him a strange sidelong smile as they walked wont it you can trust carlo like you trust no one else oh i do laughing again she swung an arm around his shoulders i trust no one else franconi that too was the unvarnished truth carlo sighed again but spoke with equal lightness then trust yourself cara be guided by your own instincts but i do trust myself do you this time it was carlo who slanted a look at her i think you dont trust yourself to be alone with the american with blake he could feel her stiffen with outrage under the arm he still held around her waist thats absurd then why are you so upset about the idea of having a simple dinner with him your english is suffering carlo upsets the wrong word im annoyed she made herself relax under his arm again then tilted her chin im annoyed because he assumed id have dinner with him then continued to assume i would even after id refused its a normal reaction i believe your reaction to him is very normal one might say even ah basic he took out his dark glasses and adjusted them meticulously perhaps squint lines added character to a face but he wanted none on his i saw what was in your eyes as well that day in the kitchen summer scowled at him then lifted her chin a bit higher you dont know what youre talking about im a gourmet carlo corrected with a sweep of his free arm of food yes but also of love just stick to your pasta franconi he only grinned and patted her flank carissima my pasta never sticks she uttered a single french word in the most dulcet tones it was one most commonly seen scrawled in parisian alleyways in tune with each other they walked on but both were speculating about what would happen that evening at eight it was quite deliberate well thought out and very satisfying summer put on her shabbiest jeans and a faded tshirt that was unraveled at the hem on one sleeve she didnt bother with even a pretense of makeup after seeing carlo off at the airport shed gone through the drivein window at a local fastfood restaurant and had picked up a cardboard container of fried chicken complete with french fries and a tiny plastic bowl of coleslaw she opened a can of diet soda and flicked the television on to a syndicated rerun of a situation comedy picking up a drumstick summer began to nibble shed considered dressing to kill then breezing by him when he came to the door with the careless comment that she had a date very selfsatisfying but this way summer decided as she propped up her feet she could be comfortable and insult him at the same time after a day spent walking around the city while carlo ogled and flirted with every female between six and sixty comfort was every bit as important as the insult satisfied with her strategy summer settled back and waited for the knock it wouldnt be long she mused if she was any judge of character shed peg blake as a man who was obsessively prompt and fastidious she added taking a pleased survey of her cluttered comfortably disorganized apartment lets not forget smug she reminded herself as she polished off the drumstick hed arrive in a sleek tailored suit with the shirt crisp and monogramed on the cuffs there wouldnt be a smudge on the italian leather of his shoes not a hair out of place pleased she glanced down at the tattered hem on her oldest jeans a pity they didnt have a few good holes in them grinning gleefully she reached for her soda holes or not she certainly didnt look like a woman waiting anxiously to impress a man and that summer concluded was what a man like blake expected surprising him would give her a great deal of pleasure infuriating him would give her even more when the knock came summer glanced around idly before unfolding her legs taking her time she rose stretched then moved to the door for the second time blake wished hed had a camera to catch the look of blank astonishment on her face she said nothing only stared with a hint of a smile on his lips blake tucked his hands into the pockets of his snug faded jeans there was no one he reflected whom hed ever gotten more pleasure out of outwitting so much so it was tempting to make a career out of it dinner ready he took an appreciative sniff of the air smells good damn his arrogance and his perception summer thought how did he always manage to stay one step ahead of her except for the fact that he wore tennis shoes tattered ones he was dressed almost identically to her it was only more annoying that he looked every bit as natural and every bit as attractive in jeans and a tshirt as he did in an elegant business suit with an effort summer controlled her temper and twin surges of humor and desire the rules might have changed but the game wasnt over my dinners ready she told him coolly i dont recall inviting you i did say eight i did say no since you objected to going out he took both her hands before breezing inside i thought wed just eat in with her hands caught in his summer stood in the open doorway she could order him to leave she considered demand it and he might although she didnt mind being rude she didnt see much satisfaction in winning a battle so directly shed have to find another more devious more gratifying method to come out on top youre very persistent blake one might even say pigheaded one might whats for dinner very little freeing one hand summer gestured toward the takeout box blake lifted a brow your penchant for fast foods very intriguing ever thought of opening your own chain minute croissants drive through pastries she wouldnt be amused youre the businessman she reminded him im an artist with a teenagers appetite strolling over blake plucked a drumstick from the box he settled on the couch then propped his feet on the coffee table not bad he decided after the first bite no wine no she didnt want to be amused was determined not to be but watching him make himself at home with her dinner summer fought off a grin maybe her plan to insult him hadnt worked but there was no telling what the evening might bring she only needed one opening to give him a good solid jab diet soda she sat down and lifted the can theres more in the kitchen this is fine blake took the drink from her and sipped is this how one of the greatest dessert chefs spends her evenings lifting a brow summer took the can back from him the greatest dessert chef spends her evenings as she pleases blake crossed one ankle over the other and studied her the flecks in her eyes were more subtle this evening perhaps because she was relaxed he liked to think he could make them glow again before the night was over yes im sure you do does that extend to other areas yes summer took another piece of chicken before handing blake a paper napkin ive decided your companys tolerable for the moment watching her he took another bite have you thats why youre here eating half my meal she ignored his chuckle and propped her own feet on the table beside his there was something cozy about the setting that appealed to her something intimate that made her wary she was too cautious a woman to allow herself to forget the effect that one kiss had had on her she was too stubborn a woman to back down im curious about why you insisted on seeing me tonight a commercial on floor wax flicked across the television screen summer glanced at it before turning to blake why dont you explain he took a plastic fork and sampled the coleslaw the professional reason or the personal one he answered a question with a question too often she decided it was time to pin him down why dont you take it one at a time how did she eat this stuff he wondered as he dropped the fork back into the box when you looked at her you could see her in the most elegant of restaurants flowers french wine starchily correct waiters shed be wearing silk and toying with some exotic dessert summer rubbed the bottom of one bare foot over the top of the other while she took another bite of chicken blake smiled even as he asked himself why she attracted him business first then well be working together closely for several months at least i think its wise if we get to know each other find out how the other works so we can make the proper adjustments when necessary logical summer plucked out a couple of french fries before offering the box to blake its just as well that you find out up front that i dont make adjustments at all i work only one way my way so personal he enjoyed her confidence and the complete lack of compromise he planned to explore the first and undo the second personally i find you a beautiful interesting woman dipping his hand into the box he watched her i want to take you to bed when she said nothing he nibbled on a fry and i think we should get to know each other first her stare was direct and unblinking he smiled logical yes and egotistical you seem to have your share of both qualities but she wiped her fingers on the napkin before she picked up the soda again youre honest i admire honesty in other people rising she looked down at him finished his gaze remained as cool as hers while he handed her the box yeah i happen to have a couple of éclairs in the fridge if youre interested supermarket special her lips curved slowly slightly no i do have some standards theyre mine then i could hardly insult you by turning them down this time she laughed im sure diplomacys your only motive that and basic gluttony he added as she walked away shes a cool one blake reflected thinking back to her reaction or lack of one to his statement about taking her to bed the coolness the control intrigued him or perhaps more accurately challenged him was it a veneer if it was hed like the opportunity to strip off the layers slowly he decided even lazily until he found the passion beneath it would be there he imagined it would be like one of her desserts dark and forbidden beneath a cool white icing before too much time had passed blake intended to taste it her hands werent steady summer cursed herself as she opened the refrigerator hed shaken her just as hed meant to she only hoped he hadnt been able to see through her offhand response yes hed intended to shake her but hed said precisely what hed meant that she understood at the moment she didnt have the time to absorb and dissect her feelings there was only her first reaction not shock not outrage but a kind of nervous excitement she hadnt experienced in years silly summer told herself while she arranged éclairs on two meissen plates she wasnt a teenager who delighted in fluttery feelings nor would she tolerate being informed she was about to become someones lover affairs she knew were dangerous timeconsuming and distracting and there always seemed to be one party who was more involved therefore more vulnerable than the other she wouldnt allow herself to be in that position but the little twinges of nervous excitement remained she was going to have to do something about blake cocharan summer decided as she poured out two cups of coffee and she was going to have to do it quickly the problem was what as summer arranged cups and plates on a tray she decided to do what she did best under pressure shed wing it youre about to have a memorable sensuous experience blake glanced up at the announcement and watched her come into the room tray in hand desire hit him surprisingly hard surprisingly fast it warned him that if he wanted to stay in control hed have to play the game with skill my éclairs arent to be taken lightly summer continued nor are they to be eaten with anything less than reverence he waited until she sat beside him again before he took a plate very skillfully done he thought again as her scent drifted to him ill do my best actually she brought down the side of her fork and broke off the first bite no efforts required just taste buds unable to resist summer brought the fork to his lips he watched her and she him as she fed him the light slanted through the window behind them and caught in her eyes more green now blake thought almost feline a man any man could lose himself trying to define that color read that expression the rich cream and flaky pastry melted in his mouth exotic unique desirable like its creator the first taste like the first kiss demanded more incredible he murmured and as her lips curved he wanted them under his naturally as she broke off another portion blakes hand closed over her wrist her pulse scrambled briefly he could feel it but her eyes remained cool and level ill return the favor he said it quietly and his fingers stayed lightly on her wrist as he took the fork in his other hand he moved slowly deliberately keeping his eyes on hers bringing the pastry to her lips then pausing he watched them part saw the tip of her tongue it would have been so easy to close his mouth over hers just then from the rapid beat of her pulse under his fingers he knew thered be no resistance instead he fed her the éclair his stomach muscles tightening as he imagined the taste that was even now lying delicately on her tongue shed never felt anything like this shed sampled her own cooking countless times but had never had her senses so heightened the flavor seemed to fill her mouth summer wanted to keep it there exploring the sensation that had become so unexpectedly so intensely sexual it took a conscious effort to swallow and another to speak more she asked his gaze flicked down from her eyes to her mouth then back again always a dangerous game she knew it but opted to play and to win taking her time she fed him the next bite was the color of his eyes deeper she didnt think she was imagining it nor the waves of desire that seemed to pound over her did they come from her or from him on the television someone broke into raucous laughter neither of them noticed it would be wise to step back now cautiously even as the thought passed through her mind she opened her mouth for the next taste some things exploded on the tongue others heated it or tantalized this was a cool elegant experience no less sensual than champagne no less primitive than ripened fruit her nerves began to calm but her awareness intensified he was wearing some subtle cologne that made her think of the woods in autumn his eyes were the deep blue of an evening sky when his knee brushed hers she felt a warmth that seeped through two layers of material and touched flesh moment after moment passed without her being aware that they werent speaking only slowly luxuriously feeding each other the intimacy wrapped around her no less intense no less exciting than lovemaking the coffee sat cooling shadows spread through the room as the sun went down the last bite summer murmured offering it you approve he caught the ends of her hair between his thumb and finger completely her skin tingled much too pleasantly although she didnt shift away summer set the fork down with great care she was feeling soft too soft and too vulnerable one of my clients has a secret passion for éclairs four times a year i go to brittany and make him two dozen last fall he gave me an emerald necklace blake lifted a brow as he twined a strand of her hair around his finger is that a hint im fond of presents she said easily but then that sort of thing isnt quite ethical between business associates as she leaned forward for her coffee blake tightened his fingers in her hair and held her still in the moment her eyes met his he saw mild surprise and mild annoyance she didnt like to be held down by anyone our business association is only one level were both acutely aware of that by this time business is the first level and the first priority maybe it was difficult to admit even to himself that he was beginning to have doubts about that in any case i havent any intention of staying at level one if she were ever going to handle him it would have to be now summer draped her arm negligently across the back of the sofa and wished her stomach would unknot im attracted to you and i think it should be difficult and interesting to work around that for the next few months you said you wanted to understand me i rarely explain myself but ill make an exception leaning forward again she plucked a cigarette from its holder have you a light it was strange how easily she drew feelings from him without warning now it was annoyance blake took out his lighter and flicked it on he watched her pull in smoke then blow it out quickly in a gesture he realized came more from habit than pleasure go on you said you knew my mother summer began youd know of her in any case shes a beautiful talented intelligent woman i love her very much both as a mother and as a person whos full of the joy of life if she has one weakness it is men summer folded her legs under her and concentrated on relaxing shes had three husbands and innumerable lovers shes always certain each relationship is forever when shes involved with a man shes blissfully happy his interests are her interests his dislikes her dislikes naturally when it ends shes crushed again summer drew on her cigarette shed expected him to make some passing comment when instead he only listened only watched she went further than shed intended my father is a more practical man and yet hes been through two wives and quite a few discreet affairs unlike my mother who accepts flaws even enjoys them for a short time he looks for perfection since there is no perfection in people only in what people create hes continually disappointed my mother looks for elation and romance my father looks for the perfect companion i dont look for either of those why dont you tell me what you look for then success she said simply romance has a beginning so it follows it has an end a companion demands compromise and patience i give all my patience to my work and i have no talent for compromise it should have satisfied him even relieved him after all he wanted nothing more than a casual affair no strings no commitments he didnt understand why he wanted to shake the words back down her throat only knew that he did no romance he said with a nod no companionship that doesnt rule out the fact that you want me and i want you no the smoke was leaving a bitter taste in her mouth as summer crushed out her cigarette she thought how much their discussion sounded like a negotiation yet wasnt that how she preferred things i said it would be difficult to work around but its also necessary you want a service from me blake and i agreed to give you that because i want the experience and the publicity ill get out of it but changing the tone and face of your restaurant is going to be a long complicated process combining that with my other commitments i wont have time for any personal distractions distractions why should that one word have infuriated him it did just as her businesslike dismissal of desire infuriated him perhaps she hadnt meant it as a challenge but he couldnt take it as anything less does this distract you he ran his finger down the side of her throat before he cupped the back of her neck she could feel the firm pressure of each of his fingers against her skin and in his eyes she could see the temper the need both pulled at her youre paying me a great deal of money to do a job blake her voice was steady good her heartbeat wasnt as a businessman you should want the complications left to a minimum complications he repeated he drew his other hand through her hair so that her face was tilted back summer felt a jolt of excitement shoot down her spine is this he brushed his lips over her cheek a complication yes her brain sent out the signal to pull away but her body refused the command and a distraction he took his mouth on a slow journey to hers but only nibbled there was no pressure but the slight grip he kept on the base of her neck with fingers moving slowly rhythmically over her skin summer didnt move away though she told herself she still could shed never permitted herself to be seduced and tonight was no different just a sample she thought she knew how to taste and judge then step away from even the most tempting of flavors just as she knew how to absorb every drop of pleasure from that one tiny test yes she murmured and let her eyes flutter closed she needed no visual image now but only the sensations warm soft moist his mouth against hers firm strong persuasive the fingers against her skin subtle male intriguing the scent that clung to him when he spoke her name his voice flowed over her like a breeze one that carried a trace of heat and the hint of a storm how simple do you want it to be summer it was happening again he realized that total involvement he neither looked for nor wanted the total involvement he couldnt resist theres only you and me theres nothing simple about that even as she disagreed her arms were going around him her mouth was seeking his again it was only a kiss she told herself that as his lips slanted lightly over hers she could still end it she was still in control but first she wanted just one more taste without thinking she touched the tip of his tongue with hers to fully explore the flavor her own moan sounded softly in her ears as she drew him closer body against body firm and somehow right this new thought drifted to her even as the sensation concentrated on the play of mouth to mouth why had kisses seemed so basic so simplistic before this there were hundreds of pulse points in her body shed remained unaware of until this moment there were pleasures deeper richer than shed ever imagined that could be drawn out and exploited by the most elemental gesture between a man and a woman shed thought shed known the limits of her own needs the depth of her own passions until now barely touching her blake was tearing something from her that wasnt calm ordered and disciplined and when it was totally free what then she found herself at the verge of something shed never come to before where emotions commanded her mind completely a step further and he would have all of her not just her body not just her thoughts but that most private most well guarded possession her heart she felt a greed for him and pulled away from it if she were greedy if she took then he would too he still held her lightly enough for her to draw back firmly enough to keep her close she was breathless moved as she struggled to think clearly summer decided it would be foolish to try to deny either i think i proved my point she managed yours blake countered as he ran a hand up her back or mine she took a deep breath expelling it slowly that one small show of emotion had desire clawing at him again ive mixed enough ingredients to know that business affairs and personal affairs arent palatable on monday i go to work for cocharan i intend to give you your moneys worth there cant be anything else theres quite a bit else already he cupped her chin in his hand so that their eyes held steady inside he was a mass of aching needs and confusion with that kiss that long slow kiss hed all but forgotten his strictest rule keep the emotions harnessed both in business and in pleasure otherwise you make mistakes that arent easily rectified he needed time and he realized he needed distance we know each other better now he said after a moment when we make love well understand each other summer remained seated when he rose she wasnt completely sure she could stand on monday she said in a firmer voice well be working together thats all there is between us from this point on when you deal with as many contracts as i do summer you learn that paper is just that paper its not going to make any difference he walked to the door thinking he needed some fresh air to clear his head a drink to settle his nerves and distance a great deal of distance before he forgot everything except the raging need to have her with his hand on the knob blake turned around for one last look at her there was something in the way she frowned at him with her eyes focused and serious her lips soft in a half pout that made him smile monday he told her and was gone chapter contents prev next why in hell couldnt he stop thinking of her blake sat at his desk examining the details of a twentypage contract in preparation for what promised to be a long tense meeting in the boardroom he wasnt taking in a single word uncharacteristic he knew it resented it and could do nothing about it for days summer had been slipping into his mind and crowding out everything else for a man who took order and selfcontrol for granted it was nerveracking logically there was no reason for his obsession with her blake called it obsession for lack of a better term but it didnt please him she was beautiful he mused as his thoughts drifted further away from clauses and terms hed known hundreds of beautiful women she was intelligent but intelligent women had been in his life before desirable even now in his neat quiet office he could feel the first stirrings of need but he was no stranger to desire he enjoyed women as friends and as lovers enjoyment blake reflected was perhaps the key word hed never looked for anything deeper in a relationship with a woman but he wasnt certain it was the proper word to describe what was already between himself and summer she moved him too strongly too quickly to the point where his innate control was shaken no he didnt enjoy that but it didnt stop him from wanting more why utilizing his customary method of working through a problem blake leaned back and picking up a pen began to list the possibilities perhaps part of the consistent attraction was the fact that he liked outmaneuvering her it wasnt easily done and took quick thinking and careful planning up till this point hed countered her at every turn blake was realistic enough to know that that wouldnt last but he was human enough to want to try just where would they clash next he wondered over business or over something more personal in either case he wanted to go head to head with her just as much well almost as much as he wanted to make love with her and perhaps another reason was that he knew the attraction was just as strong on her part yet she continued to refuse it he admired that strength of will in her she mistrusted intimacy he mused because of her parents track record yes partially he decided but he didnt think that was all of it hed just have to dig a bit deeper to get the whole picture he wanted to dig he realized for the first time in his life blake wanted to know a woman completely her thought process her eccentricities what made her laugh what annoyed what she really wanted for and in her life once he knew all there was to know he couldnt see past that but he wanted to know her understand her and he wanted her as a lover as hed never wanted anything else when the buzzer on his desk sounded blake answered it automatically with his thoughts still centering on summer lyndon your fathers on his way back mr cocharan blake glanced down at the contract on his desk and mentally filed it he still needed an hour with it before the board meeting thanks even as he released the intercom button the door swung open blake cocharan ii strolled into the room and took it over in build and coloring he was similar to his son exercise and athletics had kept him trim and hard over the years there were threads of gray in the dark hair that was covered by a white sea captains hat but his eyes were young and vibrant he walked with the easy rolling gait of a man more accustomed to decks than floors he wore canvas on his sockless feet and a swiss watch on his wrist when he grinned the lines etched by time and squinting at the sun fanned out from his eyes and mouth as he stood to greet him blake caught the salty seabreezy scent he always associated with his father bc their hands clasped one older and rougher than the other both firm just passing through on my way to tahiti going to do some sailing bc grinned again appealingly as he ran a finger along the brim of his cap want to play hookey and crew for me cant im booked solid for the next two weeks you work too hard boy in an old habit bc walked over to the bar at the west side of the room and poured himself bourbon neat blake grinned at his fathers back as bc tossed down three fingers of liquor it was still shy of noon i came by it honestly with a chuckle bc poured a second drink when it had been his office hed stocked only the best bourbon he was glad his son carried on the tradition maybe but i learned to play just as hard you paid your dues bc yeah twentyfive years of tenhour days he reflected of hotel rooms airports and board meetings so did the old man sove you he turned back to his son like looking into a mirror thats twenty years past he thought and smiled rather than sighed ive told you before you cant wrap your life up in hotels he sipped appreciatively at the bourbon this time then swirled it gives you ulcers not so far sitting again blake steepled his fingers watching his father over them he knew him too well had apprenticed under him watched him wheel and deal tahiti might be his destination but he hadnt stopped off in philadelphia without a reason you came in for the board meeting bc nodded before he found some salted almonds under the bar have to put in my two cents worth now and again he popped two nuts in his mouth and bit down with relish he was always grateful that the teeth were still his and his eyesight was keen if a man had those and a fortyfoot sloop he needed little else if we buy the hamilton chain its going to mean twenty more hotels over two thousand more employees a big step blake lifted a brow too big with a laugh bc dropped down into a chair across from the desk i didnt say that dont think that and apparently you dont think so either no i dont blake waved away his fathers offering of almonds hamiltons an excellent chain simply mismanaged at this point the buildings themselves are worth the outlay he gave his father a mild knowledgeable look you might check out the hamilton tahiti while youre there grinning bc leaned back the boy was sharp he thought pleased but then he came by that honestly too thought crossed my mind by the way your mother sends her love how is she up to her neck in a campaign to save another crumbling ruin the grin widened keeps her off the streets going to meet me on the island next week hell of a first mate your mother he nibbled on another almond pleased to think of having some time alone with his wife in the tropics so blake hows your sex life too used to his father to be anything but amused blake inclined his head adequate thanks with a short laugh bc downed the rest of his drink adequates a disgrace to the cocharan name we do everything in superlatives blake drew out a cigarette ive heard stories all true his father told him gesturing with the empty glass one day ill have to tell you about this dancer in bangkok in in the meantime ive heard you plan to do some facelifting right here the restaurant blake nodded and thought of summer it promises to be fascinating work bc caught the tone and began to gently probe i cant disagree that the place needs a little glitzing up so you hired on a french chef to oversee the operation half french a woman thats right blake blew out smoke aware which path his father was trying to lead him down bc stretched out his legs knows her business does she i wouldnt have hired her otherwise young blake drew on his cigarette and suppressed a smile moderately i suppose attractive that depends on your definition i wouldnt call her attractive too tame a word blake thought much much too tame exotic alluring those suited her more i can tell you that shes dedicated to her profession an ambitious perfectionist and that her éclairs his thoughts drifted back to that intoxicating interlude her éclairs are an experience not to be missed her éclairs bc repeated fantastic blake leaned back in his chair absolutely fantastic he kept the grin under control as his buzzer sounded again ms lyndon is here mr cocharan monday morning he thought business as usual send her in lyndon bc set down his glass thats the cook isnt it chef blake corrected im not sure if she answers to the term cook the knock was brief before summer walked in she carried a slim leather folder in one hand her hair was braided and rolled at the nape of her neck so that the hints of gold threaded through the brown her suit in a deep plum color was chanel simple and exquisite over a highnecked lace blouse that rose to frame her face the strict professionalism of her attire made blake instantly speculate on what she wore beneath something brief silky and sexy the same color as her skin blake following her own selflecture on priorities summer held out her hand impersonal businesslike and formal she wasnt going to think about what happened when his mouth touched hers ive brought you the list of changes of equipment and suggestions we spoke about fine he saw her turn her head as bc rose from his chair and he saw the gleam light his fathers eyes as it always did when he was in the company of a beautiful woman summer lyndon blake cocharan ii bc ms lyndon will be managing the kitchen here at the philadelphia cocharan house mr cocharan summer found her hand enveloped in a large calloused one he looks she realized with a jolt exactly as blake will in thirty years distinguished weathered with that perennial touch of polish then bc grinned and she understood that blake would still be dangerous in three decades bc he corrected lifting her fingers to his lips welcome to the family summer shot blake a quick look family we consider anyone associated with cocharan house part of the family bc gestured to the chair hed vacated please sit down let me get you a drink thank you perhaps some perrier she watched bc cross the room before she sat and laid the folder on her lap i believe youre acquainted with my mother monique dubois that stopped him bc turned the bottle of perrier still in his hand the glass in the other still empty monique youre moniques girl ill be damned and so he might be bc thought years before was it nearly twenty now during a period of marital upheaval on both sides hed had a brief searing affair with the french actress theyd parted on amicable terms and hed reconciled with his wife but the two weeks with monique had been memorable now he was in his sons office pouring perrier for her daughter fate he thought wryly was a tricky sonofabitch if summer had suspected before that her mother and blakes father had once been lovers she was now certain of it her thoughts on fate directly mirrored his as she crossed her legs like mother like daughter she wondered oh no not in this case bc was still staring at her for a reason she didnt completely understand she decided to make it easy for him mother is a loyal client of cocharan houses shell stay nowhere else ive already mentioned to blake that we once had dinner with your father he was very gracious when it suits him bc returned relieved she knows he concluded before his gaze strayed to blakes there he saw a frown of concentration that was all too familiar and so will he if i dont watch my step bc decided hot water he mused after twenty years i could still be in hot water his wife was the love of his life his best friend but twenty years wasnt long enough to be safe from a transgression so he finished pouring the perrier then brought it to her you decided against following in your mothers footsteps and became a chef instead im sure blake would agree that following in a parents footsteps is often treacherous instinct told blake that it wasnt business she spoke of now a look passed between his father and summer that he couldnt comprehend it depends where the path leads blake countered in my case i preferred to look at it as a challenge blake takes after his grandfather bc put in he has that cagey kind of logic yes summer murmured ive seen it in action apparently you made the right choice bc went on blake told me about your éclairs slowly summer turned her head until she was facing blake again the muscles in her stomach in her thighs tightened with the memory her voice remained calm and cool did he actually my specialty is the bombe blake met her gaze directly a pity you didnt have one available the other night there were vibrations there bc thought that didnt need to bounce off a third party well ill let you two get on with your business ive some people to see before the board meeting a pleasure meeting you summer he took her hand again and held it as his eyes held hers please give my best to your mother she saw his eyes were like blakes in color in shape in appeal her lips curved i will blake ill see you this afternoon he only murmured an assent watching summer rather than his father the door closed before he spoke why do i feel as though there were messages being passed in front of me i have no idea summer said coolly as she lifted the folder id like you to glance over these papers while im here if you have time zipping open the folder she pulled them out that way if there are any questions or any disagreements we can get through them now before i begin downstairs all right blake picked up the first sheet but studied her over it is that suit supposed to keep me at a distance she sent him a haughty look i have no idea what youre talking about yes you do and another time id like to peel it off you layer by layer but at the moment well play it your way without another word he lowered his gaze to the paper and started to read arrogant swine summer said distinctly when he didnt even bother to look up she folded her arms over her chest she wanted a cigarette to give her something to do with her hands but refused herself the luxury she would sit like a stone and when the time came she would argue for every one of the changes shed listed and win every one of them on that level she was in complete control she wanted to hate him for realizing shed worn the elegant careeroriented suit to set a certain tone instead she had to respect him for being perceptive enough to pick up on small details she wanted to hate him for making her want so badly with only a look and a few words it wasnt possible when shed spent the remainder of the weekend alternately wishing shed never met him and wishing hed come back and bring her that excitement again he was a problem there was no denying it she understood that you solved problems one step at a time step one her kitchen accent on the personal pronoun two new gas ovens he murmured as he scanned the sheet one electric oven and two more ranges of each kind without lowering it he glanced at her over the top of the page i believe i explained to you before the need for both gas and electric ovens first yours are antiquated second in a restaurant of this size the need for two gas ovens is imperative you specify brands of course i know what i like to work with he only lifted a brow thinking that procurement was going to grumble all new pots and pans definitely perhaps we should have a yard sale blake mumbled as he went back to the sheet he hadnt the vaguest idea what a sautoir was or why she required three of them and this particular heavyduty mixer essential the one you have is adequate i dont accept adequate he smothered a laugh as he recalled his fathers view on adequate in relation to love lives did you list so much of this in french to confuse me i listed in french summer countered because french is correct he made an indefinable sound as he passed over the next sheet in any case ive no intention of quibbling over equipment in french or english good because ive no intention of working with any less than the best she smiled at him and settled back first point taken blake flipped over the second sheet and went on to the third you intend to rip out the existing counters have the new ranges built in add an island and an additional six feet of counter space more efficient summer said easily and timeconsuming in a hurry you hired me blake not minute chef his quick grin made her eyes narrow my function is to organize your kitchen which means making it as efficient and creative as i know how once the nuts and bolts of that are done ill beef up your menu and this he flipped through the five typed sheets is all necessary for that i dont bother with anything that isnt necessary when it comes to business if you dont agree she said as she rose we can terminate the agreement hire lapointe she suggested firing up youll have an ostentatious overpriced secondrate kitchen that produces equally ostentatious overpriced and secondrate meals i have to meet this lapointe blake murmured as he stood youll get what you want summer as a satisfied smile formed on her lips he narrowed his eyes and you damn well better deliver what you promised the fire leapt back accenting the gold in her irises and as he saw it he wanted ive given you my word your middleclass restaurant with its mediocre prime rib and soggy pastries will be serving the finest in haute cuisine within six months or so he wanted collateral summer thought and heaved a breath or my services for the term of the contract are gratis does that satisfy you completely blake held out a hand as i said youll have precisely what youve asked for down to the last egg beater a pleasure doing business with you summer tried to draw her hand away and found it caught firm perhaps you dont she began but i have work to do youll excuse me i want to see you she let her hand remain passively in his rather than risk a struggle she might lose you have seen me tonight sorry she smiled again though her teeth were beginning to clench i have a date she felt the quick increase in pressure of his fingers over hers and was perversely pleased all right when ill be in the kitchen every day and some evenings to oversee the remodeling you need only ride the elevator down he drew her closer and though the desk remained between them summer felt that the ground beneath was a bit less firm i want to see you alone he said quietly lifting her hand to his lips he kissed her fingers slowly one by one away from here outside of business hours if blake cocharan ii had been anything like blake cocharan iii in his youth summer could understand how her mother had become so quickly so heatedly involved the yearning was there and the temptation but she wasnt monique in this case she was determined history would not repeat itself ive explained to you why thats not possible i dont enjoy covering the same ground twice your pulse is racing blake pointed out as he ran a finger across her wrist it generally does when i become annoyed or aroused tilting her head she sent him a killing look would you amuse yourself with lapointe in this way temper stirred and he suppressed it knowing she wanted him to be angry at the moment i dont care whether youre a chef or a plumber or a brain surgeon at the moment he repeated i only care that youre a woman and one that i desire very much she wanted to swallow because her throat had gone dry but fought off the need at the moment i am a chef with a specific job to do ill ask you again to excuse me so i can begin to do it this time blake thought as he released her hand but by god this time was the last time sooner or later summer perhaps she agreed as she picked up her leather folder perhaps not in one quick gesture she zipped it closed enjoy your day blake as if her legs werent weak and watery she strolled to the door and out summer continued to walk calmly through the outer office over the plush carpet past the busy secretaries and through the reception area once in the elevator she leaned back against the wall and let out the long tense breath shed been holding nerves jumping she began the ride down that was over she told herself shed faced him in his office and won every point sooner or later summer she let out another breath almost every point she corrected the important thing now was to concentrate on her kitchen and to keep busy it wasnt going to help matters if she allowed herself to think of him as she had over the weekend as her nerves began to calm summer straightened away from the wall shed handled herself well shed made herself clear and shed walked out on him all in all a successful morning she pressed a hand against her stomach where a few muscles were still jumping damn it things would be simpler if she didnt want him so badly when the doors slid open she stepped out then wound her way around to the kitchen in the prelunch bustle she went unnoticed she approved of the noise a quiet kitchen to summer meant there was no communication without that there was no cooperation for a moment she stood just inside the doorway to watch she approved of the smells it was a mixture of lunchtime aromas over the stilllingering odors of breakfast bacon sausage and coffee she caught the scent of baking chicken of grilled meat of cakes fresh from the oven narrowing her eyes she envisioned the room as it would be in a short time made to her order better summer decided with a nod ms lyndon distracted she frowned up at a big man in white apron and cap yes im max his chest expanded his voice stiffened head chef ego in danger she thought as she extended a hand how do you do max i missed you when i was in last week mr cocharan has instructed me to give you full cooperation during this transition period marvelous she thought with an inward moan resentment in a kitchen was as difficult to deal with as a deflated soufflé left to herself she might have been able to keep injured feelings to a minimum but the damage had already been done she made a mental note to give blake her opinion of his tact and diplomacy well max id like to go over the proposed structural changes with you since you know the routine here better than anyone else structural changes he repeated his full round face flushed the moustache over his mouth quivered she caught the gleam of a single gold tooth in my kitchen my kitchen summer mentally corrected but smiled im sure youll be pleased with the improvements and the new equipment you must have found it frustrating trying to create something special with outdated appliances this oven he said and gestured dramatically toward it this range both have been here since i began at cocharan we are none of us outdated so much for cooperation summer thought wryly if it was too late for a friendly transition of authority shed have to go with the coup well be receiving three new ovens she began briskly two gas one electric the electric will be used exclusively for desserts and pastries this counter she continued walking toward it without looking back to see if max was following will be removed and the ranges i specified built into a new counter butcher block the grill remains therell be an island here to provide more working area and to make use of what is now essentially wasted space there is no wasted space in my kitchen summer turned and aimed her haughtiest stare that isnt a matter for debate creativity will be the first priority of this kitchen efficiency the second well be expected to produce quality meals during the remodeling difficult but not impossible if everyone makes the necessary adjustments in the meantime you and i will go over the current menu with an eye toward adding excitement and flair to what is now pedestrian she heard him suck in his breath but continued before he could rage mr cocharan contracted me to turn this restaurant into the finest establishment in the city i fully intend to do just that now id like to observe the staff in lunch preparations unzipping her leather folder summer pulled out a note pad and pen without another word she began walking through the busy kitchen the staff she decided after a few moments was well trained and more orderly than many credit max cleanliness was obviously a first priority another point for max she watched a cook expertly bone a chicken not bad summer decided the grill was sizzling pots steaming lifting a lid she ladeled out a small portion of the soup du jour she sampled it holding the taste on her tongue a moment basil she said simply then walked away another cook drew apple pies from an oven the scent was strong and wholesome good she mused but any experienced grandmother could do the same what was needed was some pizzazz people would come to this restaurant for what they wouldnt get at home charlottes clafouti flambees the structural changes came from her practical side but the menu the menu stemmed from her creativity which was always paramount as she surveyed the kitchen the staff drew in the smells absorbed the sounds summer felt the first real stirrings of excitement she would do it and she would do it for her own satisfaction just as much as in answer to blakes challenge when she was finished this kitchen would bear her mark it would be different entirely from jetting from one place to the next to create a single memorable dish this would have continuity stability a year from now five years from now this kitchen would still retain her touch her influence the thought pleased her more than shed expected shed never looked for continuity only the flash of an individual triumph and wouldnt she be behind the scenes here she might be in the kitchen in milan or athens but the guests in the dining room knew who was preparing the charlotte royal clients wouldnt come into the restaurant anticipating a summer lyndon dessert but a cocharan hotel meal even as she mulled the thought over in her mind she found it didnt matter why she was still unsure for now she only knew the pleasurable excitement of planning think about it later she advised herself as she made a final note there were months to worry about consequences reasons pitfalls she wanted to begin get elbow deep in a project she now for whatever reason considered peculiarly her own slipping her folder under her arm she walked out she couldnt wait to start working on menus chapter contents prev next russian beluga malasol caviar that should be available from lunch to latenight dining all night through room service summer made another scrawled note during the past two weeks shed changed the projected menu a dozen times after one abortive session with max shed opted to go solo on the task she knew the ambiance she wanted to create and how to do so through food to save herself time shed set up a small office in a storage room off the kitchen there she could oversee the staff and the beginnings of the remodeling while having enough privacy to work on what was now her pet project avoiding blake had been easy because shed kept herself so thoroughly busy and it appeared he was just as involved in some complicated corporate deal buying out another hotel chain if rumor were fact summer had little interest in that for her concentration focused on items like medallions of veal in champagne sauce as long as the remodeling was going on the staff remained in a constant state of panic or near panic shed come to accept that most of the kitchens shed worked in were full of the tension and terror only a cook would understand perhaps it was that creative tension and the terror of failure that helped form the best meals for the most part she left the staff supervision to max she interfered with the routine hed established as little as possible incorporating the changes shed initiated unobtrusively shed learned the qualities of diplomacy and power from her father if it placated max at all it wasnt apparent in his attitude toward summer that remained icily polite summer shrugged this off and concentrated on perfecting the entrees her kitchen would offer calfs liver berlinoise an excellent entree not as popular certainly as a broiled filet or prime rib but excellent as long as she didnt have to eat it summer thought with a smirk as she noted it down once shed organized the meat and poultry shed put her mind to the seafood and naturally there had to be a cold buffet available twentyfour hours a day through room service that was something else to work out soups appetizers salads all of those had to be considered decided on and confirmed before she began on the desserts and at the moment shed have traded any of the elegant offerings jotted down in front of her for a cheeseburger on a sesame seed bun and a bag of chips so this is where youve been hiding blake leaned against the doorway hed just completed a grueling fourhour meeting and had fully intended to go up to his suite for a long shower and a quiet solitary meal instead hed found himself heading for the kitchen and summer she looked as she had the first time hed seen her her hair down her feet bare on the table in front of her were reams of scrawledon paper and a halfempty glass of diluted soda behind her boxes were stacked sacks piled the room smelled faintly of pine cleaner and cardboard in her own way she looked competent and completely in charge not hiding she corrected working tired she thought he looked tired it showed around the eyes been busy we havent seen you down here for the past couple of weeks busy enough stepping inside he began to poke through her notes wheeling and dealing from what i hear she leaned back realizing all at once that her back ached taking over the hamilton chain he glanced up then shrugged and looked back at her notes again its a possibility discreet she smiled wishing she werent quite so glad to see him again well while youve been playing monopoly ive been dealing with more intimate matters when he glanced at her again with his brow raised exactly as shed expected it to be she laughed food blake is the most basic and personal of desires no matter what anyone might say to the contrary for many eating is a ritual experienced three times a day its a chefs job to make each experience memorable for you eatings a jaunt through adolescence as i said summer continued mildly food is very personal agreed after another glance around the room he looked back at her summer its not necessary for you to work in a storage room its a simple matter to set you up in a suite she pushed through the papers looking for her list on poultry this is convenient to the kitchen theres not even a window the place is packed with boxes no distractions she shrugged if id wanted a suite id have asked for one for the moment this suits me and its several hundred feet away from you she added silently since youre here you might want to see what ive been doing he lifted a sheet of paper that listed appetizers coquilles st jacques escargots bourguignonne pâte de campagne is it too personal a question to ask if you ever eat what you recommend from time to time if i trust the chef youll see if you go more thoroughly through my notes that i want to offer a more sophisticated menu because the american palate is becoming more sophisticated blake smiled at the term american and the way she said it before he sat across from her is it its been a slow process she said dryly today you can find a good food processor in almost every kitchen with one and a competent cookbook even you could make an acceptable mousse amazing therefore she continued ignoring him to lure people into a restaurant where theyll pay and pay well to be fed you have to offer them the superb a few blocks down the street they can get a wholesome filling meal for a fraction of what theyll pay in the cocharan house summer folded her hands and rested her chin on them so you have to give them a very special ambience incomparable service and exquisite food she picked up her soda and sipped personally id rather pick up a takeout pizza and eat it at home but she shrugged blake scanned the next sheet because you like pizza or you like being alone both now do you stay out of restaurants because you spend so much time in a kitchen behind them or because you simply dont like being in a group she opened her mouth to answer and found she didnt know uncomfortable she toyed with her soda youre getting more personal and off the point i dont think so youre telling me we have to appeal to people whore becoming sophisticated enough to make dishes that were once almost exclusively professionally prepared as well as draw in clientele who might prefer a quick less expensive meal around the corner you due to your profession and your taste fall into both categories what would a restaurant have to offer not only to bring you in but to make you want to come back a logical question summer frowned at it she hated logical questions because they left you no choice but to answer privacy she answered at length it isnt an easy thing to accomplish in a restaurant and of course not everyone looks for it many go out to eat to see and be seen some like myself prefer at least the illusion of solitude to accomplish both you have to have a certain number of tables situated in such a way that they seem removed from the rest easily enough done with the right lighting a clever arrangement of foliage the key words are right and clever and privacy is your prerequisite in choosing a restaurant i dont generally eat in them summer said with a restless movement of her shoulders but if i do privacy ranks equally with atmosphere food and service why she began to push the papers together on her desk and stack them thats definitely a personal question yes he covered her hands with one of his to still them why she stared at him a moment certain she wouldnt answer then she found herself drawn by the quiet look and the gentle touch i suppose it stems back to eating in so many restaurants as a child and i suppose one of the reasons i first became interested in cooking was as a defense against the interminable ritual of eating out my mother was is of the type who goes out to see and be seen my father often considering eating out a business so much of my parents lives and therefore mine was public i simply prefer my own way now that he was touching her he wanted more now that he was learning of her he wanted all he should have known better than to believe it would be otherwise hed nearly convinced himself that he had his feelings for her under control but now sitting in the cramped storage room with kitchen sounds just outside the door he wanted her as much more than ever i wouldnt consider you an introvert or a recluse no she didnt even notice that shed laced her fingers with his there was something so comfortable so right about the gesture i simply like to keep my private life just that mine and private yet in your field youre quite a celebrity he shifted and under the table his leg brushed against hers he felt the warmth glow through him and the need double without thinking she moved her leg so that it brushed his again the muscles in her thighs loosened perhaps or you might say my desserts are celebrities blake lifted their joined hands and studied them hers was shades lighter than his inches smaller and more narrow she wore a sapphire oval deeply blue in an ornate antique setting that made her fingers look that much more elegant is that what you want she moistened her lips because when his eyes came back to hers they were intense and as darkly blue as the stone on her hand i want to be successful i want to be considered the very best at what i do nothing more no nothing why was she breathless she asked herself frantically young girls got breathless or romantics she was neither when you have that blake rose drawing her to her feet without effort what else because they were standing she had to angle her head to keep her eyes level with his its enough as she said it summer had her first doubts of the truth of that statement what about you she countered arent you looking for success more success the finest hotels the finest restaurants im a businessman slowly he walked around the table until nothing separated them their hands were still joined i have a standard to maintain or improve im also a man he reached for her hair then let it flow through his fingers and therere things other than account books i think about they were close now her body brushed his and caused her skin to hum she forgot all the rules shed set out for both of them and reached up to touch his cheek what else do you think about you his hand was at her waist then sliding gently up her back as he drew her closer i think very much about you and this lips touched softly eyes remained open and aware pulses throbbed desire tugged lips parted slowly a look said everything there was to say pulses hammered desire tore free she was in his arms clinging greedy burning every hour of the past two weeks all the work the planning the rules melted away under a blaze of passion if she sensed impatience in him it only matched her own the kiss was hard long desperate body strained against body in exquisite torment tighter whether she said the word aloud or merely thought it he seemed to understand his arms curved around her crushing her to him as she wanted to be she felt the lines and planes of his body mold to hers even as his mouth molded to hers and somehow she seemed softer than shed ever imagined herself to be feminine sultry delicate passionate was it possible to be all at once the need grew and expanded for him for a taste and touch shed found nowhere else the sound she made against his lips came as much from confusion as from pleasure good god how could a woman take him so far with only a kiss he was already more than halfmad for her control was losing its meaning in a need that was much more imperative her skin would slide like silk under his hands he knew it he had to feel it he slipped a hand under her sweater and found her beneath his palm her heartbeat pounded not enough the thought raced through his mind that it would never be enough but questions reason were for later burying his face against her throat he tasted her skin the scent he remembered lingered there enticing him further drawing him closer to the edge where there could be no turning back the fatigue hed felt when hed entered the room vanished the tension he felt whenever she was near evaporated at that moment he considered her completely his without realizing hed wanted exclusive possession her hair brushed over his face cloud soft fragrant it made him think of paris right before the heat of summer took over from spring but her skin was hot and vibrating making him envision long humid nights when lovemaking would be slow endlessly slow he wanted her there in the cramped little room where the floor was littered with boxes she couldnt think summer could feel her bones dissolve and her mind empty sensation after sensation poured over her she could have drowned in them yet she wanted more she could feel her body craving more wanting all storm thunder heat just once the longing seeped into her with whispering promises and dark pleasure she could let herself be his take him as hers just once and then with a moan she tore her mouth from his and buried her face against his shoulder once with blake would haunt her for the rest of her life come upstairs blake murmured tilting her head back he ran kisses over her face come up with me where i can make love with you properly i want you in my bed summer soft naked mine blake she turned her face away and tried to steady her breathing what had happened to her when how this is a mistake for both of us no taking her by the shoulders he kept her facing him this is right for both of us i cant get involved you already are she let out a deep breath no further than this its already more than i intended when she started to back away he held her firmly in front of him i need a reason summer a damn good one you confuse me summer blurted it out before she realized it then swore at the admission damn it i dont like to be confused and i ache for you his voice was as impatient as hers his body as tense i dont like to ache weve got a problem she managed dragging a hand through her hair i want you something in the way he said it made her hand pause in midair and her gaze lift to his there was nothing casual in those three words i want you more than ive ever wanted anyone im not comfortable with that a big problem she whispered and sat unsteadily on the edge of the table theres one way to solve it she managed a smile two ways she corrected and i think mines the safest safest reaching down he ran a fingertip over the curve of her cheek you want safety summer yes it was easily said because shed discovered it was true safety was something shed never thought about until blake because shed never felt endangered until then ive made myself a lot of promises blake set a lot of goals instinct tells me you could interfere i always go with my instincts ive no intention of interfering with your goals nevertheless i have a few very strict rules one of them is never to become intimate with a business associate or a client in one point of view you fall into both categories how do you intend to prevent it from happening intimacies come in a lot of degrees summer you and i have already reached some of them how could she deny it she wanted to run from it we managed to keep out of each others way for two weeks she pointed out its simply a matter of continuing to do so both of us are very busy at the moment so it shouldnt be too difficult eventually one of us is going to break the rules and it could be me just as easily as it could be him she thought i cant think about eventually only about now ill stay downstairs and do my job you stay upstairs and do yours like hell blake muttered and took a step forward summer was halfway to her feet when a knock sounded on her door mr cocharan theres a phone call for you your secretary says its urgent blake controlled his fury ill be there he gave summer a long hard look were not finished she waited until hed reached the door i can turn this place into a palace or a greasy spoon she said quietly its your choice turning around he measured her blackmail insurance she corrected and smiled play it my way blake and everybodys happy your point summer he acknowledged with a nod this time when the door closed behind him she sat again she may have outmaneuvered him this time she mused but the game was far from over summer gave herself another hour before she left her temporary office to go back to the kitchen busboys wheeled in and out with trays of dirty dishes the dishwasher hummed busily pots simmered someone sang as she basted a chicken two hours to the dinner rush in another hour the panic and confusion would set in it was then when the scent of food hit her that summer realized she hadnt eaten deciding to kill two birds with one stone she began to root through the cupboards shed find something for a late lunch and see just how provisions were organized she couldnt complain about the latter the cupboards were not only well stocked they were systematically stocked max had a number of excellent qualities she thought a pity an open mind wasnt among them she continued to scan shelf after shelf but the item she was looking for was nowhere to be found ms lyndon hearing maxs voice behind her summer slowly closed the cabinet door she didnt have to turn around to see the cold politeness in his eyes or the tight disapproval of his mouth she was going to have to do something about this situation before long she decided but at the moment she was a bit tired quite a bit hungry and not in the mood to deal with it yes max she opened the next door and surveyed the stock perhaps i can help you find what youre looking for perhaps actually im checking to see how well stocked we are while searching out a jar of peanut butter apparently she closed that door and went on to the next were very well stocked indeed and very well organized my kitchen is completely organized max began stiffly even in the midst of all this this carpentry the carpentrys almost finished she said easily i think the new ovens are working out well to some new is always better to some she countered progress is always a death knell where do i find the peanut butter max i really want a sandwich this time she did turn in time to see his eyebrows raise and his mouth purse below he said with a hint of a smirk as he pointed we keep such things on hand for the childrens menu good unoffended summer crouched down and found it would you like to join me thank you no i have work to do fine summer took two slices of bread and began to spread the peanut butter tomorrow nine oclock you and i will go over the proposed menus in my office im very busy at nine no she corrected mildly were very busy from seven to nine then things tend to ease off particularly midweek until the lunch rush nine oclock she repeated over his huff of breath excuse me i have to get some jelly for this leaving max gritting his teeth summer went to one of the large refrigerators pompous narrowminded ass she thought as she found a restaurantsized jar of grape jelly as long as he continued to be uncooperative and stiff things were going to be difficult more than once shed expected max to turn in his resignation and there were times though she hated to be so hard line that she wished he would the changes in the kitchen were already making a difference she thought as she closed the second slice of bread over the jelly and peanut butter any fool could see that the extra range the more efficient equipment tightened the flow of preparation and improved the quality of food annoyed she bit into her sandwich just as excited chatter broke out behind her maxll be furious furious nothing he can do about it now except yell and throw things perhaps it was the underlying glee in the last statement that made summer turn she saw two cooks huddled over the stove whatll max be furious about she asked over another mouthful of sandwich the two faces turned to her both were flushed either from the heat of the stove or excitement maybe you ought to tell him ms lyndon one of the cooks said after a moment of indecision the glee was still there she noticed barely suppressed tell him what julio and georgia eloped we just got word from julios brother they took off for hawaii julio and georgia after a quick flip through her mental file summer placed them as two cooks who worked the fourtoeleven shift a glance at her watch told her they were already fifteen minutes late i take it they wont be coming in today they quit one of the cooks snapped his fingers just like that he glanced across the room where max was babying a rack of lamb maxll hit the roof he wont solve anything up there she murmured so were two short for the dinner shift three the second cook corrected charlie called in sick an hour ago wonderful summer finished off her sandwich then rolled up her sleeves then the rest of us better get to work with an apron covering her jeans and sweater summer took over one section of the new counter perhaps it wasnt her usual style she mused as she began mixing the first oversized bowl of cake batter but circumstances called for immediate action and she thought as she licked some batter from her knuckle they damn well better get the stereo speakers in before the end of the week summer might bake without chopin in an emergency once but she wouldnt do it twice she was arranging several layers of black forest cake in the oven when max spoke over her shoulder youre making yourself some dessert now he began no summer set the tinier then moved back to the counter to start preparations on chocolate mousse it seems theres been a wedding and an illness though i dont think the first has anything to do with the second were shorthanded tonight im taking over the desserts max and i dont exchange small talk when im working wedding what wedding julio and georgia eloped to hawaii and charlies sick i have this mousse to deal with at the moment eloped he exploded eloped without my permission she took the time to look over her shoulder i suppose charlie should have checked with you before he got sick as well save the hysterics max and have someone peel me some apples i want to do a charlotte de pommes after this now youre changing my menu he exploded she whirled fire in her eyes i have a dozen different desserts to make in a very short time id advise you to stay out of my way while i do it im not known for graciousness when im cooking he sucked in his stomach and pulled back his shoulders well see what mr cocharan has to say about this terrific keep him out of my way too for the next three hours or someones going to end up with a face full of my best whipped cream spinning back around she went to work there wasnt time she couldnt take the time to study and approve each dessert as it was completed later summer would think of the hours as assembly line work at the moment she was too pressed to think julio and georgia had been the dessert chefs it was now up to her to do the work of two people in the same amount of time she ignored the menu and went with what she knew she could make from memory the diners that evening were in for a surprise but as she finished topping the second black forest cake summer decided it would be a pleasant one she arranged the cheeries quickly cursing the need to rush impossible to create when one was on such a ridiculous timetable she thought and muttered bad temperedly under her breath by six the bulk of the baking was done and she concentrated on the finishing touches of a line of desserts designed to satisfy an army chocolate icing there a dab of cream here a garnish a spoon of jam or jelly she was hot her arms aching her oncewhite apron was streaked and splashed no one spoke to her because she wouldnt answer no one approached her because she tended to snarl occasionally she would indicate with a wave of her arm a section of dishes that were to be taken away this was done instantly and without a sound if there was talk it was done in undertones and out of her hearing none of them had ever seen anything quite like summer lyndon on a roll problems summer heard blake speak quietly over her shoulder but didnt turn cars are made this way she mumbled not desserts early reports from the dining room are more than favorable she grunted and rolled out pastry dough for tarts the next time im in hawaii im going to look up julio and georgia and knock their heads together a bit testy arent you he murmured and earned a lethal glare and hot he touched her cheek with a fingertip how long have you been at it since a bit after four after shrugging his hand away she began to rapidly cut out pastry shells blake watched surprised hed never seen her work quickly before move he stepped back but continued to watch her by his calculations shed worked on the menus in the windowless storage room for more than six hours and had now been on her feet for nearly three too small he thought as a protective urge moved through him too delicate summer cant someone else take over now you should rest no one touches my desserts this was said in such a strong authoritative voice that the image of a delicate flower vanished he grinned despite himself anything i can do ill want some champagne in an hour dom perignon he nodded as an idea began to form in his mind she smelled like the desserts lined on the counter in front of her tempting delicious since hed met her blake had discovered he possessed a very demanding sweet tooth have you eaten a sandwich a few hours ago she said testily do you think i could eat at a time like this he glanced at the sumptuous array of cakes and pastries he could smell delicately roasted meats spicy sauces blake shook his head no of course not ill be back summer muttered something then fluted the edges of her pastry shells chapter contents prev next by eight oclock summer was finished and not in the best of humors for nearly four hours shed whipped rolled fluted and baked often shed spent twice that time and twice that effort perfecting one single dish that was art this on the other hand had been labor plain and simple she felt no flash of triumph no glow of selfsatisfaction but simply fatigue an army cook she thought disdainfully it was hardly different from producing the quickest and easiest for the masses at the moment if she never saw the inside of another egg again it would be too soon there should be enough made up to get us through the dinner hour and room service tonight she told max briskly as she pulled off her soiled apron critically she frowned at a line of fruit tarts more than one of them were less than perfect in shape if thered been time shed have discarded them and made others i want someone in touch with personnel first thing in the morning to see about hiring two more dessert chefs mr cocharan has already contacted personnel max stood stiffly not wanting to give an inch though hed been impressed with how quickly and efficiently shed avoided what could easily have been a catastrophe he clung tightly to his resentment even though he had to admit to himself that she baked the best apricot tart hed ever tasted fine summer ran a hand over the back of her neck the skin there was damp the muscles drawn taut nine oclock tomorrow max in my office lets see if we can get organized im going home to soak in a hot tub until morning blake had been leaning against the wall watching her work it had been fascinating to see just how quickly the temperamental artist had put her nose to the grindstone and produced shed shown him two things he hadnt expected a speed and lack of histrionics when shed been forced to deal with a less than ideal situation and a calm acceptance of what was obviously a touchy area with max however much she played the role of prima donna when her back was against the wall she handled herself very well when she removed her apron he stepped forward give you a lift summer glanced over at him as she pulled the pins from her hair it fell to her shoulders tousled and a bit damp at the ends from the heat i have my car and i have mine the arrogance with that trace of aloofness was still there even when he smiled and a bottle of dom perignon my driver can pick you up in the morning she told herself she was only interested in the wine the cool smile had nothing to do with her decision properly chilled she asked arching her brow the champagne that is of course youre on mr cocharan i never turn down champagne the cars out in the back he took her hand rather than her arm as shed expected before she could make any counter move he was leading her from the kitchen would it embarrass you if i said i was very impressed with what you did this evening she was used to accolades even expected them somehow she couldnt remember ever getting so much pleasure from one before she moved her shoulders hoping to lighten her own response i make it my business to be impressive it doesnt embarrass me perhaps if she hadnt been tired he wouldnt have seen through the glib answer so easily when they reached his car blake turned and took her by the shoulders you worked very hard in there just part of the service no he corrected soothing the muscles thats not what you were hired for when i signed the contract that became my kitchen what goes out of it has to satisfy my standards my pride not an easy job you wanted the best apparently i got it she smiled though she wanted badly just to sit down you definitely got it now you did say something about champagne yes i did he opened the door for her you smell of vanilla i earned it when she sat she let out a long pleasurable sigh champagne she thought a hot bath with mountains of bubbles and smooth cool sheets in that order chances are she murmured even as we speak someone in there is taking the first bite of my black forest cake blake shut the drivers door then glanced at her as he started the ignition does it feel odd he asked having strangers eat something you spent so much time and care creating odd summer stretched back enjoying the plush luxury of the seat and the view of the dusky sky through the sun roof a painter creates on canvas for whoever will look a composer creates a symphony for whoever will listen true enough blake maneuvered his way onto the street and into the traffic the sun was red and low the night promised to be clear but wouldnt it be more gratifying to be there when your desserts are served she closed her eyes completely relaxed for the first time in hours when one cooks in ones own kitchen for friends relatives it can be a pleasure or a duty then there might be the satisfaction of watching something youve cooked being appreciated but again its a pleasure or a duty not a profession you rarely eat what you cook i rarely cook for myself she countered except the simpler things why when you cook for yourself theres no one there to clean up the mess he laughed and turned into a parking lot in your own odd way youre a very practical woman in every way im a practical woman lazily she opened her eyes why did we stop hungry im always hungry after i work turning her head she saw the blue neon sign of a pizza parlor knowing your tastes by now i thought youd find this the perfect accompaniment to the champagne she grinned as the fatigue was replaced with the first real stirrings of hunger absolutely perfect wait here he told her as he opened the door i had someone call ahead and order it when i saw you were nearly finished grateful and touched summer leaned back and closed her eyes again when was the last time shed allowed anyone to take care of her she wondered if memory served her the last time shed been pampered shed been eight and cranky with a case of chicken pox independence had always been expected of her by her parents and by herself but tonight this one time it was a rather sweet feeling to let someone else make the arrangements with her comfort in mind and she had to admit she hadnt expected simple consideration from blake style yes credit where credit was due yes but not consideration hed put in a hard day himself she thought remembering how tired hed looked that afternoon still hed waited long past the time when he could have had his own dinner in comfort relaxed in his own way hed waited until she was finished surprises she mused blake cocharan iii definitely had some surprises up his sleeve shed always been a sucker for them when blake opened the car door the scent of pizza rolled pleasurably inside summer took the box from him then leaned over and kissed his cheek thanks i shouldve tried pizza before he murmured she settled back again letting her eyes close and her lips curve dont forget the champagne those are two of my biggest weaknesses ive made a note of it blake pulled out of the parking lot and joined the traffic again her simple gratitude shouldnt have surprised him it certainly shouldnt have moved him he had the feeling she would have had the same lowkey pleased reaction if hed presented her with a fulllength sable or a bracelet of bluewhite diamonds with summer it wouldnt be the gift but the nature of the giving he found he liked that idea very much she wasnt a woman who was easily impressed he mused yet she was a woman who could be easily pleased summer did something she rarely did unless she was completely alone she relaxed fully though her eyes were closed she was no longer sleepy but aware she could feel the smooth motion of the car beneath her hear the rumble of traffic outside the windows she had only to draw in a breath to smell the tangy scent of sauce and spice the car was spacious but she could sense the warmth of blakes body across the seat pleasant that was the word that drifted through her mind so pleasant there seemed to be no need for caution for defenses it was a pity she reflected that they werent driving aimlessly strange shed never chosen to do anything aimlessly and yet tonight to drive along a long deserted beach with the moon full shining off the water and the sand white youd be able to hear the surf ebb and flow and see the hundreds of stars you so rarely noticed in the city youd smell the salt and feel the spray the moist warm air would flow over your skin she felt the car swing off the road then purr to a stop for an extra moment summer held on to the fantasy whatre you thinking about the beach she answered stars she caught herself surprised that shed indulged in what could only be termed romanticism ill take the pizza she said straightening you can bring the champagne he put a hand on her arm lightly but it stopped her slowly he ran a finger down it you like the beach i never really thought about it at the moment she found shed like nothing better than to rest her head against his shoulder and watch waves surge against the shore star counting why should she want to indulge in something so foolish now when she never had before for some reason it just seemed like the night for it and she wondered if she were answering his question or her own since theres no beach well just have to come up with something else hows your imagination good enough quite good enough summer thought to see where shed end up if she didnt change the mood hers as well as his and at the moment i imagine the pizzas getting cold and the champagne warm opening the door she climbed out with the box in hand once inside the building summer started up the stairs does the elevator ever work blake shifted the bag in his arm and joined her off and on mostly its off personally i dont trust it in that case whyd you pick the fourth floor she smiled as they rounded the second landing i like the view and the fact that salesmen are usually discouraged when theyre faced with more than two flights of steps you couldve chosen a more modern building with a view a security system and a working elevator i look at modern tools as essential a new car well tuned as imperative drawing out her keys summer jiggled them lightly as they approached her door as to living arrangements im a bit more openminded my flat in paris has temperamental plumbing and the most exquisite cornices ive ever seen when she opened the door the scent of roses was overwhelming there were a dozen white in a straw basket a dozen red in a sevres vase a dozen yellow in a pottery jug and a dozen pink in venetian glass run into a special at the florists summer raised her brows as she set the pizza on the dinette i never buy flowers for myself these are from enrico blake set the bag next to the box and drew out the champagne all hes a bit flamboyant enrico gravanti you mightve heard of him italian shoes and bags two hundred million dollars worth of shoes and bags as blake recalled he flicked a finger down a rose petal i hadnt heard gravanti was in town he normally stays at the cocharan house no hes in rome as she spoke summer went into the kitchen for plates and glasses he wired these when i agreed to make the cake for his birthday next month four dozen roses for a cake five summer corrected as she came back in theres another dozen in the bedroom theyre rather lovely a kind of peach color in anticipation she held out both glasses and after all it is one of my cakes with a nod of acknowledgment blake loosened the cork air fizzed out while the champagne bubbled toward the lip of the bottle so i take it youll be going to italy to bake it i dont intend to ship it air freight she watched the pale gold liquid rise in the glass as blake poured i should only be in rome two days three at most raising the glass to her lips she sipped eyes closed senses keen excellent she sipped again before she opened her eyes and smiled im starving after lifting the lid on the box she breathed deep pepperoni somehow i thought it suited you with a laugh an easy one she sat down very perceptive shall i serve please and as she began to blake flicked on his lighter and set the three staggeredlength tapers she had on the table burning champagne and pizza he said as he turned off the lights that demands candlelight dont you think if you like when he sat summer lifted her first piece the cheese was hot enough to make her catch her breath the sauce tangy mmmm wonderful has it occurred to you that we spend a great deal of our time together eating hmm well its something i thoroughly enjoy i always try to look at eating as a pleasure rather than a physical necessity it adds something pounds usually she shrugged and reached for the champagne of course if one isnt wise enough to take ones pleasure in small doses greed is what adds pounds ruins the complexion and makes one miserable you dont succumb to greed she remembered abruptly that it had been just that exactly that that shed felt for him but shed controlled it summer reminded herself she hadnt succumbed no she ate slowly savoring i dont in my profession it would be disastrous how do you keep your pleasure in small doses she wasnt sure she trusted the way the question came out taking her time she set a second piece on each plate id rather have one spoonful of a superb chocolate soufflé than an entire plateful of food that doesnt have flair blake took another bite of pizza and this has flair she smiled because it was so obviously not the sort of meal he was used to an excellent balance of spices perhaps just a tad heavy on the oregano a good marriage of sauce and crust the proper handling of cheese and the bite of pepperoni with the proper use of the senses almost any meal can be memorable with the proper use of the senses blake countered other things can be memorable she reached for her glass again her eyes laughing over the rim were speaking of food taste of course is paramount but appearance he linked his hand with hers and she found herself watching him your eyes tell you first of the desire to taste his face was lean the eyes a deep blue she found continuously compelling then a scent teases you entices you his was dark woodsy tempting you hear the way champagne bubbles into a glass and you want to experience it or the way he said her name quietly after all this she continued in a voice that was beginning to take on a faint huskiness a faint trace of feeling you have the taste the texture to explore and his mouth held a flavor she couldnt forget so he lifted her hand and pressed his mouth to the palm your advice is to savor every aspect of the experience in order to absorb all the pleasure then turning her hand over he brushed his lips then the tip of his tongue over her knuckles the most basic of desires becomes unique in an arrowstraight line the heat shot up her arm no experience is acceptable otherwise and atmosphere lightly with just a fingertip he traced the shape of her ear wouldnt you agree that the proper setting can enhance the same experience candlelight for instance their faces were closer now she could see the soft shifting light casting shadows mysteries outside devices can often add more intensity to a mood you could call it romance he took his fingertip down the length of her jawline you could champagne never went to her head yet her head was light slowly luxuriously her body was softening she made an effort to remember why she should allow neither to happen but no answer came and romance for some is another very elemental need for some he murmured when his lips followed the trail of his fingertip but not for you he nipped at her lips and found them soft and warm no not for me but her sigh was as soft and warm as her lips a practical woman he was raising her to her feet so that their bodies could touch yes she tilted her head back inviting the exploration of his lips candlelight doesnt move you its only an attractive device she curved her arms up his back to bring him closer as chefs were taught that such things can lend the right mood to our meals and it wouldnt matter if i told you that you were beautiful in the full sun where your skins flawless in candlelight which turns it to porcelain it wouldnt matter he continued as he ran a line of moist heat down her throat if i told you you excite me as no other woman ever has just looking at you makes me want touching you drives me mad words she managed though her head was spinning i dont need then his mouth covered hers the one long deep kiss made lies of all her practical claims tonight though shed never wanted such things before she wanted the romance of soft words soft lights she wanted the slow savoring loving that emptied the mind and made a furnace of the body tonight she wanted and there was only one man if tomorrow there were consequences tomorrow was hours away he was here she didnt resist as he lifted her tonight if only for a short while shed be fragile soft she heard him blow out the candles and the light scent of melted wax followed them toward the bedroom moonlight the silvery sorcery of moonlight slipped through the windows roses the fragile fragrance of roses floated on the air music the muted magic of beethoven drifted in from the apartment below there was a breeze summer felt it whisper over her face as he placed her on the bed atmosphere she thought hazily if she had planned on a night of lovemaking she could have set the stage no better perhaps she drew him down to join her perhaps it was fate she could see his eyes deep blue direct involving he watched her while doing no more than tracing the shape of her face of her lips with his finger had anyone ever shown her that kind of tenderness had she ever wanted it no and if the answer was no the answer had abruptly changed she wanted this new experience the sweetness shed always disregarded and she wanted the man who would bring her both taking his face in her hands she studied him this was the man she would share this one completely private moment with the one who would soon know her body as well as her vulnerabilities she might have wavered over the trust reminded herself of the pitfalls if shed been able to resist the need and the strength she saw in his eyes kiss me again she murmured no ones ever made me feel the way you do when you kiss me he felt a surge of pleasure intense stunning lowering his head he touched his lips to hers toying with them watching her as she watched him while their emotions heightened and their need sharpened should he have known shed be even more beautiful in the moonlight with her hair spread over a pillow could he have known that desire for her would be an ache unlike any desire hed known was it still as simple as desire or had he crossed some line hed been unaware of there were no answers now answers were for the daylight with a moan he deepened the kiss and felt her body yield beneath his even as her mouth grew avid little tongues of passion flickered still subdued beneath a gentleness they both seemed to need odd because neither of them had needed it before or often thought to show it her hands were light on his face over his neck then slowly combing through his hair though his body was hard on hers there was no demand yet savor me the thought ran silkily through her mind even as blakes lips journeyed over her face slowly shed never known a man with such patience or an arousal so heady mouth against mouth then mouth against skin each drew her deeper and still deeper into a languor that encompassed both body and mind touch me and he seemed to understand this fresh need his hands moved but still without hurry over her shoulders down her sides then up again to whisper over her breasts until it was no longer enough for either of them then wordlessly they began to undress each other fingers of moonlight fell across exposed flesh a shoulder the length of an arm a lean torso luxuriously summer ran her hands over blakes chest and learned the muscle and form lazily he explored the length of her and learned the subtle curves and silk even when the last barrier of clothing was drawn away they didnt rush so much to touch taste and time had no meaning the breeze flitted in but they grew warmer wherever her fingers wandered his flesh would burn then cool only to burn again as he took his lips over her finding pleasure learning secrets she began to heat and demand crept into both of them more urgently now with quick moans trembling breaths they took each other further he hadnt known he could be led and shed always refused to be yet now one guided the other to the same destination summer felt reality slipping away from her but had no will to stop it the music penetrated only faintly into her consciousness but his murmurs were easily heard it was his scent no longer the roses that titillated she would feel whatever she was meant to feel go wherever she was meant to go as long as he was with her along with the strongest physical desire shed ever known was an emotional need that exploded inside her she couldnt question it couldnt refuse it her body mind heart ached for him with his name trembling on her lips she took him into her then for both of them the pleasure was so acute that sanity was forgotten sensation waves floods storms whipped through her the calm had become a hurricane to revel in together they were swept away had hours passed or minutes summer lay in the filtered moonlight and tried to orient herself shed never felt quite like this sated exhilarated exhausted once shed have said it was impossible to be all at once she could feel the brush of blakes hair against her shoulder the whisper of his breath against her cheek his scent and hers were mixed now so that the roses were only an accent the music had stopped but she thought she could still hear the echo his body was pressed into hers but his weight was a pleasure she knew without effort she could wrap her arms around him and stay just so for the rest of her life so through the hazy pleasure came the first stirrings of fear oh god how far had she gone in such a short time shed always been so certain her emotions were perfectly safe it wasnt the first time shed been with a man but she was too aware that it was the first time shed made love in the true sense of the word mistake she forced the word into her head even as her heart tried to block it she had to think had to be practical hadnt she seen what uncontrolled emotions and dreams had done to two intelligent people both her parents had spent years moving from relationship to relationship looking for what this her heart told her but again she blocked it out she knew better than to look for something she didnt believe existed permanency commitment they were illusions and illusions had no place in her life closing her eyes a moment she waited for herself to settle she was a grown woman sophisticated enough to understand and accept mutual desire that held no strings treat it lightly she warned herself dont pretend its more than it is but she couldnt resist smoothing his hair as she spoke odd how pizza and champagne affect me raising his head blake grinned at her at the moment he felt he couldve taken on the world i think it should be your staple diet he kissed the curve of her shoulder its going to be mine want some more pizza and champagne laughing he nuzzled her neck that too he shifted drawing her against his side it was one more gesture of intimacy that had something inside her trembling set out the rules summer told herself do it now before before it would be much too easy to forget i like being with you she said quietly and i you he could see the shadows play on the ceiling hear the muted sound of traffic outside but he was still saturated with her now that weve been together like this its going to affect our relationship one of two ways puzzled he turned his head to look at her one of two ways its either going to increase the tension while were working or alleviate it im hoping it alleviates it in the darkness he frowned at her what happened just now had absolutely nothing to do with business whatever you and i do together is bound to affect our working relationship moistening her lips she tried to continue in the same light way making love with you was personal but tomorrow morning were back to being associates this cant change that i think itd be a mistake to let it change the tone of our business dealings was she rambling was she making sense she wished desperately that he would say something anything at all i think we both knew this was bound to happen now that it has its cleared the air cleared the air infuriated and to his surprise hurt he rose on his elbow it did a damn sight more than that summer we both know that too lets keep it in perspective how had she begun this so badly and how could she keep rambling on when she only wanted to curl up next to him and hold on were both unattached adults whore attracted to each other on that level we shouldnt expect any more from each other thans reasonable on a business level we both have to expect total involvement he wanted to push the business level down her throat violently the emotion didnt please him nor did the sudden realization that he wanted total involvement on a very personal level with an effort he controlled the fury he needed to ask and answer some questions for himself soon in the meantime he needed to keep a cool head summer i intend to make love with you often and when i do business can go to hell he ran a hand down her side and felt her body respond if she wanted rules he thought furiously hed give her rules his when were here there isnt any hotel or any restaurant theres just you and me back at cocharan house well be as professional as you want she wasnt certain if she wanted to calmly agree with him or scream in protest she remained silent and now he continued drawing her still closer i want to make love with you again then i want to sleep with you at nine oclock tomorrow well get back to business she might have spoken then but his mouth touched hers tomorrow was hours away chapter contents prev next damn it was frustrating blake had heard men complain about women calling them incomprehensible contradictory baffling because hed always found it possible to deal with women on a sensible level hed never put much credence in any of it until summer now he found himself searching for more adjectives rising from his desk blake paced to the window and frowned out at his view of the city when theyd made love the first time he realized that hed never known that a woman could be that soft that giving strong still strong yes but with a fragility that had a man lying in velvet had it been his imagination or had she been totally his in every way one person could belong to another hed have sworn that for that space of time shed thought of nothing but him wanted nothing but him and yet before their bodies had cooled shed been so practical so unemotional damn wasnt a man supposed to be grateful for that a man who wanted the pleasure and companionship of a woman without all the complications he could remember other relationships where a neat set of rules had proven invaluable but now below a couple walked along the sidewalk their arms slung around each others shoulders as he watched he imagined them laughing at something no one else would understand and as he watched blake thought of his own statement of the degrees of intimacy instinct told him that he and summer had shared an intimacy as deep as any two people could experience not just a merging of bodies but a touching a twining of thoughts and needs and wants that was absolute but if his instincts had told him one thing she had told him another which was he to believe frustrating he thought again and turned away from the window he couldnt deny that hed gone to her apartment the night before with the idea of seducing her and putting an end to the tension between them but he couldnt deny that hed been seduced after five minutes alone with her he couldnt see her and not want to touch her he couldnt hear her laugh without wanting to taste the curve of her lips now that hed made love with her he wasnt certain a night would pass without his wanting her again there must be a term for what he was experiencing blake was always more comfortable when he could label something and therefore file it properly the most efficient heading the most logical category what was it called when you thought of a woman when you should be thinking about something else what name did you give to this constant edgy feeling love the word crept up on him not entirely pleasantly good god uneasy blake sat again and stared at the far wall he was in love with her it was just as simple and just as terrifying as that he wanted to be with her to make her laugh to make her tremble with desire he wanted to see her eyes glow with temper and with passion he wanted to spend quiet evenings and wild nights with her and he was deadly sure hed want the same thing twenty years down the road since the first time hed walked down those four flights of stairs from her apartment he hadnt thought of another woman love if it could ever be considered logical was the logical conclusion and he was stuck with it taking out a cigarette blake ran his fingers down the length of it he didnt light it but continued to stare at the wall now what he asked himself he was in love with a woman whod made herself crystal clear on her feelings about commitments and relationships she wanted no part of either he on the other hand believed in the permanency and even the romance of marriage though hed never considered it specifically applying to himself things were different now he was a man too well ordered both outwardly and mentally not to see marriage as the direct result of love with love you wanted stability vows endurance he wanted summer blake leaned back in his chair and he firmly believed there was always a way to get what you wanted if he even mentioned the word love shed be gone in a flash even he wasnt completely comfortable with it as yet strategy he told himself it was all a matter of strategy or so he hoped he simply had to convince her that he was essential to her life that theirs was the relationship designed to break her set of rules apparently the game was still on and he still intended to win frowning at the wall he began to work his way through the problem summer was having problems of her own four cups of strong black coffee hadnt quite brought her up to maximum working level ten hours sleep suited her well eight could be tolerated with less than that and shed had a good deal less than that the night before she edged perilously close to nastiness add to that a state of emotional turmoil and maxs frigid resentment and it didnt promise to be the most pleasant or productive morning by using one of the traditional french garnitures for the roast of lamb well add something european and attractive to the entree summer folded her hands on some of the scattered papers on her desk shed brought a few of enricos flowers in and set them in a water glass they helped cover some of the dusty smell my roast of lamb is perfect as it is for some tastes summer said evenly for mine its only adequate i dont accept adequate their eyes warred violently as neither gave way she continued i prefer to go with clamart artichoke hearts filled with buttered peas and potatoes sautéed in butter weve always used watercress and mushrooms meticulously she changed the angle of a rosebud the small distraction helped her keep her temper now we use clamart summer noted it down underlined it then went on as to the prime rib you will not touch my prime rib she started to snap back but managed to grit her teeth instead it was common knowledge in the kitchen that the prime rib was maxs specialty one might say his baby the wisest course was to give in graciously on this point and hold a hard line on others her british heritage of fair play came through the prime rib remains precisely as it is she told him my function here is to improve what needs improving while incorporating the cocharan house standard well said summer congratulated herself while max huffed and subsided in addition well keep the new york strip and the filet sensing he was mollified summer hit him with the poultry entree well continue to serve the very simple roast chicken with the choice of potatoes or rice and the vegetables of the day but we add pressed duck pressed duck max blustered we have no one on staff whos capable of preparing that dish properly nor do we have a duck press no which is why ive ordered one and why im hiring someone who can use it youre bringing someone into my kitchen just for this im bringing someone into my kitchen she corrected to prepare the pressed duck and the lamb dish among other things hes leaving his current job in chicago to come here because he trusts my judgment you might begin to do the same with this she began to tidy papers thats all for today max id like you to take along these notes while the headache began to drum inside her head she handed him a stack of papers if you have any suggestions on what ive listed please jot them down she bent back over her work as he rose and strode silently out of the room perhaps she shouldnt have been so abrupt summer understood injured feelings and fragile egos she might have handled it better yes she might have with a weary sigh she rubbed her temple if she wasnt feeling a bit injured and fragile herself your own fault she reminded herself then propping her elbows on the table she dropped her head into the cupped hands now that it was tomorrow she had to face the consequences shed broken one of her own primary rules never become intimate with a business associate she should have been able to shrug and say rules were made to be broken but it worried her more that it wasnt that particular rule that was causing the turmoil but another shed broken never let anyone who could really matter get too close blake if she didnt draw in the lines now and hold them could really matter drinking more coffee and wishing for an aspirin she began to go over everything again she was certain shed been casual enough and clear enough the night before over the lack of ties and obligations but when theyd made love again nothing shed said had made sense she shook her head trying to block that out that morning theyd been perfectly at ease with each other two adults preparing for a workday without any morningafter awkwardness thats what she wanted too many times shed seen her mother glowing and bubbling at the beginning of an affair this man was the man this man was the most exciting the most considerate the most poetic until the bloom faded summers belief was that if you didnt glow you didnt fade and life was a lot simpler yet she still wanted him after a brief knock one of the kitchen staff stuck his head around her door ms lyndon mr cocharan would like to see you in his office summer finished off her rapidly cooling coffee yes when immediately she lifted a brow no one summoned her immediately people requested her at her leisure i see her smile was icy enough to make the messenger shrink back thank you when the door closed again she sat perfectly still these were working hours she reflected and she was under contract it was reasonable and right that he should ask her to come to his office that was acceptable but she was still summer lyndon she went to no one immediately she spent the next fifteen minutes deliberately dawdling over her papers before she rose after strolling through the kitchen and taking the time to check on the contents of a pot or skillet on the way she went to an elevator on the ride up she glanced at her watch pleased to note that shed arrive nearly twentyfive minutes after the call as the doors opened she flicked a speck of lint from the sleeve of her blouse then sauntered out mr cocharan would like to speak to me she gave the words the intonation of a question as she smiled down at the receptionist yes ms lyndon youre to go right through hes been waiting unsure if the last statement had been censure or warning summer continued down the hall to blakes door she gave a peremptory knock before going in good morning blake when she entered he set aside the file in front of him and leaned back in his chair have trouble finding an elevator no crossing the room she chose a chair and settled down he looked she thought as he had the first time shed come into his office aloof aristocratic this then was the perfect level for them to deal on this is one of the few hotels which has elevators one doesnt grow old waiting for youre aware what the term immediately means im aware of it i was busy perhaps i should make it clear that i dont tolerate being kept waiting by an employee and ill make two things clear she tossed back im not merely an employee but an artist secondly i dont come at the snap of anyones fingers its eleventwenty blake began with a mildness summer instantly suspected on a workday my signature is at the base of your checks therefore you do answer to me the faint telltale flush crept along her cheekbones youd turn my work into something to be measured in dollars and cents and minute by minute business is business he countered spreading his hands i think you were quite clear on that subject shed maneuvered herself successfully toward that particular comer and hed given her a helpful shove into it as a result her attitude only became more haughty youll notice i am here at present youre wasting time as an ice queen she was magnificent blake thought he wondered if she realized how a change of expression a tone of voice could alter her image she could be half a dozen women in the course of a day whether she knew it or not summer had her mothers talent i received another dissatisfied call from max he told her flatly she arched a brow and looked like royalty about to dispense a beheading yes he objects strongly to some of the proposed changes in the menu ah blake glanced down at the pad on his desk pressed duck seems to be the current problem though several others were tossed in around it summer sat straighter in her chair tilting up her chin i believe you contracted me to improve the quality of cocharan house dining i did that is precisely what im doing the french was beginning to seep into the intonation of her voice her eyes were beginning to glow despite the fact it annoyed him she was undeniably at her most attractive this way i also contracted you to manage the kitchen which means you should be able to control your staff control she was up and the ice queen was now the enraged artist her gestures were broad her movements dramatic i would need a whip and chain to control such a narrowminded illtempered old woman who worries only about his own egocentricities his way is the only way his menu is carved in stone sacrosanct pah it was a peculiarly french expletive that would have been ridiculous coming from anyone else from summer it was perfect blake tapped his pen against the edge of his desk while he watched the performance he was nearly tempted to applaud is this whats known as artistic temperament she drew in a breath mockery would he dare youve yet to see true temperament mon ami he only nodded it was tempting to push her into full gear but business was business max has worked for cocharan for over twentyfive years blake set down the pen and folded his hands calm in direct contrast to summers temper hes loyal and efficient and obviously sensitive sensitive she nearly spat the word i give him his prime rib and his precious chicken but still hes not satisfied i will have my pressed duck and my clamart my menu wont read like something from the corner diner he wondered if he recorded the conversation and played it back to her shed see the absurdity of it at the moment though he had to clear his throat to disguise a chuckle he doubted it exactly blake said and kept his face expressionless ive no desire to interfere with the menu the point is ive no desire to interfere at all far from mollified summer tossed her hair behind her shoulders and glared at him then why do you bother me with these trivialities these trivialities he countered are your problem not mine as manager part of your function is to do simply that manage if your supervisory chef is consistently dissatisfied youre not doing your job youre free to make whatever compromises you think necessary compromises her whole body stiffened again he thought she looked magnificent i dont make compromises being hardheaded wont bring peace to your kitchen she let out her breath in a hiss hardheaded exactly now the problem of max is back in your court i dont want any more phone calls in a low dangerous voice she let out a stream of french and though he was certain it was colloquial he caught the drift with a toss of her head she started toward the door summer she turned and the stance reminded him of one of the mythical female archers whose aim was killingly true she wouldnt even wince as her arrow went straight through the heart ice queen or warrior he wanted her i want to see you tonight her eyes went to slits you dare now that weve tabled the first issue its time to go onto the second we might have dinner you tabled the first issue she retorted i dont table things so easily dinner have dinner with your account book thats what you understand he rose and approached her without hurry we agreed that when were away from here were not business associates were not away from here her chin was still angled im standing in your office where i was summoned you wont be standing in my office tonight i stand wherever i choose tonight so tonight he continued easily we wont be business associates werent those your rules personal and professional and that tangible line of demarcation yes thats the way shed wanted it but it wasnt as easy for her to make the separation as shed thought it would be tonight she said with a shrug i may be busy blake glanced at his watch its nearly noon we might consider this lunch hour he looked back at her half smiling lifting a hand he tangled it in her hair during lunch hour theres no business between us summer and tonight i want to be with you he touched his lips to one corner of her mouth then the other i want to spend long his lips slanted over hers softly private hours with you she wanted it too why pretend otherwise shed never believed in pretenses only in defenses in any event shed already decided to handle max and the kitchen in her own way linking her hands around his neck she smiled back at him then tonight well be together youll bring the champagne she was softening but not yielding blake found it infinitely more exciting than submission for a price her laugh was wicked and warm a price i want you to do something for me you havent done before she tilted her head then touched the tip of her tongue to her lip such as cook for me surprise lit her eyes before the laughter sprang out again cook for you well thats a much different request from what i expected after dinner i might come up with a few others so you want summer lyndon to prepare your dinner she considered it as she drew away perhaps i will though such a thing usually costs much more than a bottle of champagne once in houston i prepared a meal for an oil man and his new bride i was paid in stock certificates blue chip blake took her hand and brought it to his lips i bought you a pizza pepperoni thats true eight oclock then and id advise you to eat a very light lunch today she reached for the door handle then glanced over her shoulder with a grin you do like cervelles braisees i might if i knew what it was still smiling she opened the door braised calfs brains au revoir blake stared at the door shed certainly had the last word that time the kitchen smelled of cooking and sounded like a drawing room strains of chopin were muted as summer rolled the boneless breasts of chicken in flour on the range the clarified butter was just beginning to deepen in color perfect stuffed tomatoes were already prepared and waiting in the refrigerator buttered peas were just beginning to simmer she would sauté the potato balls while she sautéed the supremes timing of course was critical supremes de volaille a brun had to be done to the instant even a minute of overcooking and she would like any temperamental cook throw them out in disgust hot butter sizzled as she slipped the floured chicken into it she heard the knock but remained where she was its open she called out meticulously she adjusted the heat under the skillet ill take the champagne in here cherie if id only thought to bring some stunned summer turned and saw monique glorious in midnight black and silver framed by her kitchen doorway mother with the kitchen fork still in her hand summer closed the distance and enveloped her mother with that part bubbling part sultry laugh she was famous for monique kissed both of summers cheeks then drew her daughter back you are surprised oui i adore surprises im astonished summer countered whatre you doing in town monique glanced toward the range at the moment apparently interrupting the preparations for an intimate tête a tête oh whipping around summer dashed back to the skillet and turned the chicken breasts not a second too soon what i meant was what are you doing in philadelphia she checked the flame again and was satisfied didnt you once say youd never set foot in the town of the hardware king again time mellows one monique claimed with a characteristic flick of the wrist and i wanted to see my daughter you are not so often in paris these days no it doesnt seem so does it summer split her attention between her mother and her range something she would have done for no one else you look wonderful moniques smooth cheeks dimpled i feel wonderful mignonne in six weeks i start a new picture a new picture carefully summer pressed a ringer to the top of the chicken when they sprang back she removed them to a hot platter where in hollywood they have pestered me and at last i give in moniques infectious laugh bubbled out again the script is superb the director himself came to paris to woo me keil morrison tall somewhat gangly intelligent face fiftyish summer had a clear enough picture from the glossies and from a party for a reigning box office queen where shed prepared ile flottante from her mothers tone of voice summer knew the answer before she asked the question and the director he too is superb how would you feel about a new step poppa chérie resigned summer said then smiled that was too hard a word pleased of course if youre happy mother she began to prepare the brown butter sauce while monique expounded oh but he is brilliant and so sensitive ive never met a man who so understands a woman at last ive found my perfect match the man who finally brings everything i need and want into my life the man who makes me feel like a woman nodding summer removed the skillet from the heat and stirred in the parsley and lemon juice whens the wedding last week monique smiled brilliantly as summer glanced up we were married quietly in a little churchyard outside paris there were doves a good sign i tore myself away from keil because i wanted to tell you in person stepping forward she flashed a thin diamondcrusted band elegant oui keil doesnt believe in the how do you say ostentatious so for the moment neither would monique dubois lyndon smith clarion morrison she supposed when the news broke the glossies and trades would have a field day monique would eat up every line of publicity summer kissed her mothers cheek be happy ma mere im ecstatic you must come to california and meet my keil and then she broke off as the knock interrupted her ah this must be your dinner guest shall i answer for you please with the tongue caught between her teeth summer poured the sauce over the supremes shed serve them within five minutes or dump them down the sink when the door opened blake was treated to a slightly more voluptuous slightly more glossy version of summer the candlelight disguised the years and enhanced the classic features her lips curved slowly in the way her daughters did as she offered her hand hello summer is busy in the kitchen im her mother monique she paused a moment as their hands met but you are familiar to me yes but yes she continued before blake could speak the cocharan house you are the son bcs son weve met before a pleasure to see you again mademoiselle dubois this is odd oui and amusing i stay in your hotel while in philadelphia already my bags are checked in and my bed turned down youll let me know personally if theres anything i can do for you while you stay with us of course she studied him in the brief but thorough way a woman of experience has like mother like daughter she mused each had excellent taste please come in summer is putting the finishing touches on your meal ive always admired her skill in the kitchen myself im helpless diabolically helpless summer put in as she entered with the hot platter she always made sure she burned things beyond recognition and therefore no one asked her to cook an intelligent move to my thinking monique said easily and now ill leave you to your dinner youre welcome to join us mother sweet monique framed summers face in her hands and kissed both cheeks again but i need my beauty rest after the long flight tomorrow we catch up non monsieur cocharan we will all have dinner at your wonderful hotel before i go in her sweeping way she was at the door bon appetit a spectacular woman blake commented yes summer went back to the kitchen for the rest of the meal she continually amazes me after placing the vegetables on the table she picked up her glass shes just taken her fourth husband shall we drink to them he began to remove the foil from the bottle but her tone had him pausing a bit cynical realistic in any case i do wish her happiness when he removed the cork she took it and absently waved it under her nose and i envy her perennial optimism after both glasses were filled summer touched hers to his to the new mrs morrison to optimism blake countered before he drank if you like summer said with a shrug as she sat she transferred one of the supremes from the platter to his plate unfortunately the calfs brains looked poor today so we have to settle for chicken a pity the first bite was tender and perfect would you like some time off to spend with your mother while shes in town no its not necessary motherll divide her time between shopping and the health spa during the day she tells me shes about to begin a new film really it only took him a minute to put things together morrison the director youre very quick summer acknowledged toasting him summer he laid a hand over hers do you object she opened her mouth to answer quickly then thought it over no no object isnt the word her lifes her own i simply cant understand how or why she continually plunges into relationships tying herself up into marriages which on the average have lasted years apiece is the word optimism i wonder or gullibility monique doesnt strike me as a gullible woman perhaps its a synonym for romantic no but romantic might be synonymous with hope her way isnt yours yet we both chose lovers from the same bloodline summer reminded herself just what would blakes reaction be to that little gem keep the past in the past summer advised herself and concentrate on the moment she smiled at him no its not and how do you find my cooking perhaps it was best to let the subject die for a time he needed to ease her over that block gently as i find everything about you blake told her magnificent she laughed as she began to eat again it wouldnt be advisable for you to become too used to it i rarely prepare meals for only compliments that had occurred to me so i brought what i thought was the proper token summer tasted the wine again yes the champagne is excellent but an inadequate token for a summer lyndon meal when she shot him a puzzled look he reached in his inside pocket and drew out a small thin box ah presents amused she accepted the box you mentioned a fondness for them blake saw the amusement fade as she opened the box inside were diamonds elegant even delicate in the form of a slender bracelet they lay white and regal against the dark velvet of the box she wasnt often overwhelmed now she found herself struggling through waves of astonishment the meals too simple for a token like this she managed if id known idve prepared something spectacular i wouldnt have thought art ever simple perhaps not but she looked up telling herself she wasnt supposed to be moved by such things they were only pretty stones after all but her heart was full blake its lovely exquisite i think youve taken me too seriously when i talk of payments and gifts i didnt do this tonight for any reason more than i wanted to do it this made me think of you he said as if she hadnt spoken see how cool and haughty the stones are but he slipped the bracelet out of the box if you look closely if you hold it to light theres warmth even fire as he spoke he let the bracelet dangle from his fingers so that it caught and glittered with the flames from the candles at that moment it might have been alive so many dimensions from every angle you can see something different a strong stone and more elegant than any other laying the bracelet over her wrist he clasped it his gaze lifted and locked on hers i didnt do this tonight for any reason other than i wanted to do it she was breathless vulnerable would it be like this every time he looked at her you begin to worry me summer whispered the one quiet statement had the need whipping through him almost out of control he rose then drawing her to her feet crushed her against him before she could agree or protest good his mouth wasnt patient this time there seemed to be a desperate need to hurry take all take everything hunger that had nothing to do with the meal still unfinished on the table sped through him she was every desire and every answer biting off an oath he pulled her to the floor this was the whirlwind shed never been here before trapped exhilarated elated by the speed trembling from the power summer moved with him there was no patience with clothes this time they were tugged and pulled and tossed aside until flesh could meet flesh hot and eager her body arched against his she wanted the wind and the fury that only he could bring her as his hands sped over her she delighted in their firmness in the strength of each individual finger her own demands raged equally her mouth raced down his throat teeth nipping tongue darting each unsteady breath told her that she drove him just as he drove her there was pleasure in that she discovered to give passion and to have it returned to you even though her mind clouded she knew the instant his control snapped he was rough but she delighted in it she had taken him beyond the civilized only by being his mouth was everywhere tasting on a crazed journey from her lips to her breasts lingering then lower still lower until she caught her breath in astonished excitement the world peeled away the floor the walls ceiling then the sky and the ground itself she was beyond all that in some spiraling tunnel where only the senses ruled her body had no bounds and she had no control she moaned struggling for a moment to pull it back but the first peak swept her up tossing her blindly even the illusion of reason shattered he wanted her like this some dark primitive part of him needed to know he could bring her to this throbbing mindless world of sensations she shuddered beneath him gasping yet he continued to drive her up again and again with hands and mouth only he could see her face in the candlelight those flickers of passion of pleasure of need she was moist and heated and he was greedy her skin pulsed under him everywhere he touched when he touched his mouth to the sensitive curve where thigh meets hip she arched and moaned his name the sound of it tore through him pounding in his blood long after there was silence tell me you want me he demanded as he raced up her shuddering body again and only me i want you she could think of nothing she would have given him anything only you they joined in a violence that went on and on then shattered into a crystal contentment she lay beneath him knowing shed never gather the strength to move there was barely the strength to breathe it didnt seem to matter for the first time she noticed the floor was hard beneath her but it didnt inspire her to shift to a more comfortable position sighing she closed her eyes without too much effort she could sleep exactly where she was blake moved only to draw himself up and take his weight on his own arms she seemed so fragile suddenly so completely without defense he hadnt been gentle with her yet during the loving shed seemed so strong so full of fire he gave himself the enjoyment of looking at her while she half dozed wearing nothing more than diamonds at her wrist as he watched her eyes fluttered open and she watched him catlike from halflowered lids her lips curved he grinned at her then kissed them whats for dessert chapter contents prev next unfortunately summer was going to need a phone in her office she preferred to work undisturbed and phones had a habit of disturbing but the final menu was almost completed she was approaching the practical stage of selective marketing with so many new things and difficulttocomeby items on the bill of fare she would have to begin the process of finding the best suppliers it was a job she would have loved to have delegated but she trusted her own negotiating skills and her own intuition more than anyone elses when choosing a supplier of the best oysters or okra you needed both after tidying her mornings work summer gave the stack of papers a satisfied nod her instincts about taking this very different sort of job had been valid she was doing it and doing it well the kitchen remodeling was exactly what shed envisioned the staff was well trained and with her carefully screened and selected additions would be only more so the two new pastry chefs were better than shed expected them to be julio and georgia had sent a postcard from hawaii and it had been taped with some honor to the front of a refrigerator summer had only had a moments temptation to throw darts at it shed interfered very little with the setup in the dining room the lighting there was excellent the linen impeccable the food her food alone would be all the refreshing the restaurant required soon she thought shed be able to have the new menus printed she had only to pin down a few prices first and haggle over terms and delivery hours the next step was the installation of a phone choosing to deal with it immediately she headed for the door she entered the kitchen from one end as monique entered from the other all work ceased it amused summer and rather pleased her that her mother had that stunning effect on people she could see max standing staring with a kitchen spoon in one hand that dripped sauce unheeded onto the floor and of course monique knew how to make an entrance it might be said she was a woman made for entrances she smiled slowly it almost appeared hesitantly as she stepped in bringing the scent of paris and spring with her her eyes were more gray than her daughters and despite the difference in years and experience held more innocence summer had yet to decide if it was calculated or innate perhaps someone could help me six men stepped forward max came perilously close to allowing the stock from the spoon to drip on moniques shoulder summer decided it was time to restore order mother she brushed her way through the circle of bodies surrounding monique ah summer just who i was looking for even as she took her daughters hands she gave the group of male faces a sweeping smile how fascinating i dont believe ive ever been in a hotel kitchen before its so ah large oui please ms dubois madame unable to contain himself max took moniques hand id be honored to show you whatever youd like to see perhaps youd care to sample some of the soup how kind her smile would have melted chocolate at fifty yards of course i must see everything where my daughter works daughter obviously summer mused max had heard nothing but violins since monique walked into the room my mother summer said clearly monique dubois this is max whos in charge of the kitchen staff mother max thought dumbly but of course the resemblance was so strong he felt like a fool for not seeing it before there wasnt a dubois film he hadnt seen at least three times a pleasure rather gallantly he kissed the offered hand an honor how comforting to know my daughter works with such a gentleman though summers lip curled she said nothing and i would love to see everything just everything perhaps later today she added before max could begin again now i must steal summer away for just a short time tell me would it be possible to have some champagne and caviar delivered to my suite caviar isnt on the menu summer put in with an arch look at max as yet oh prettily monique pouted i suppose some pate or some cheese would do ill see to it personally right away madame so kind with a flutter of lashes monique slipped her arm through summers and swept from the room laying it on a bit thick summer muttered monique threw back her head and gave a bubbling laugh dont be so british chérie i just did you an enormous service i learned from the delightful young cocharan this morning that not only is my daughter an employee at this very hotel which you didnt bother to tell me but that you had a few internal problems in the kitchen i didnt tell you because its only a temporary arrangement and because its been keeping me quite busy as to the internal problems in the form of one very large max monique glided into the elevator i can handle them just fine by myself summer finished but it doesnt hurt to have him impressed by your parentage after pressing the button for her floor monique turned to study her daughter so i look at you in the light and see that youve grown more lovely that pleases me if one must have a grown daughter one should have a beautiful grown daughter laughing summer shook her head youre as vain as ever ill always be vain monique said simply god willing ill always have a reason to be now she motioned summer out of the elevator ive had my morning coffee and croissants and my massage im ready to hear about this new job of yours and your new lover from the look of you both agree with you i believe its customary for mothers and daughters to discuss new jobs but not new lovers pooh monique tossed open the door to her suite we were never just mother and daughter but friends nestce pas and chère amies always discuss new lovers the job summer said distinctly as she dropped into a buttersoft daybed and brought up her legs is working out quite well i took it originally because it intrigued me and well because blake threw lapointe up in my face lapointe the beadyeyed little man you detest so much the one who told the paris papers you were his mistress summer said violently ah yes such a foolish word mistress so antiquated dont you agree unless one considers that mistress is the feminine term for master monique smiled serenely as she draped herself on the sofa and were you certainly not i wouldnt have let him put his pudgy little hands on me if hed been half the chef he claims to be you might have sued then more people wouldve snickered and said where theres smoke theres fire the little french swine wouldve loved that she was gritting her teeth so she deliberately relaxed her jaw dont get me started on lapointe it was enough that blake maneuvered me into this job with him as an edge a very clever man your blake that is hes not my blake summer said pointedly hes his own man just as im my own woman you know i dont believe in that sort of thing the discreet knock had monique waving negligently and summer rising to answer she thought as the tray of cheeses and fresh fruit and the bucket of iced champagne was wheeled in that max must have dashed around like a madman to have it served so promptly summer signed the check with a flourish and dismissed the waiter idly monique inspected the tray before choosing a single cube of cheese but youre in love with him busy with the champagne cork summer glanced over what youre in love with the young cocharan the cork exploded out champagne fizzed and geysered from the bottle monique merely lifted her glass to be filled im not in love with him summer said with an underlying desperation her mother recognized one is always in love with ones lover no one is not with a bit more control summer poured the wine affairs dont have to be romantic and flowery im fond of blake i respect him i consider him an attractive intelligent man and enjoy his company its possible to say the same of a brother or an uncle even perhaps an exhusband monique commented this is not what i think you feel for blake i feel passion for him summer said impatiently passion is not to be equated with love ah summer amused monique chose a grape you can think with your british mind but you feel with your french heart this young cocharan isnt a man any woman would lightly dismiss like father like son the moment it was said summer regretted it but monique only smiled softly reminiscently it occurred to me i havent forgotten bc nor he you interested monique flipped back from the past youve met blakes father briefly when your name was mentioned he looked as though hed been struck by lightning the soft smile became brilliant how flattering a woman likes to believe she remains in a mans memory long after they part you may be flattered i can tell you i was damned uncomfortable but why mother restless summer rose again and began to pace i was attracted to blake very much attracted and he to me how do you think i felt when i was talking to his father and both bc and i were thinking about the fact that youd been lovers i dont think blake has any idea if he did do you realize how awkward the situation would be why on a long breath summer turned to her mother again bc was and is married to blakes mother i get the impression blakes rather fond of his mother and of his father what does that have to do with it moniques gesture was typically french a slight shrug a slight lifting of the hand palm out i was fond of his father too listen to me she continued before summer could retort bc was always in love with his wife i knew that then we consoled each other made each other laugh in what was a miserable time for both of us im grateful for it not ashamed of it neither should you be im not ashamed frustrated summer dragged a hand through her hair i dont ask you to be but damn it mother its awkward life often is youll remind me there are rules and so there are she threw back her head and took on the regal haughtiness her daughter had inherited i dont play by the rules and i dont apologize mother cursing herself summer went and knelt beside the couch i wasnt criticizing you its only that whats right for you whats good for you isnt right and good for me you think i dont know that you think id have you live my life monique laid a hand on her daughters head perhaps ive seen more deep happiness than youve seen but ive also seen more deep despair i cant wish you the first without knowing youd face the second i want for you only what you wish for yourself some things youre afraid to wish for no but some things are more carefully wished for i will give you some advice she patted summers head then drew her up to sit on the sofa when you were a little girl i gave you none because small children have always been a mystery to me when you grew up you wouldnt have listened to any perhaps now weve come to the point between mother and daughter when each understands the other is intelligent with a laugh summer picked a strawberry from the tray all right ill listen it does not make you less of a woman to need a man when summer frowned she continued to need one to exist yes this is nonsense to need one to give one scope and importance this is dishonest but to need a man one man to bring joy and passion this is life there can be joy and passion in a womans life without a man some joy some passion monique agreed why settle for some what is it that you prove by cutting off what is a natural need perhaps its a foolish woman who takes a different man as a husband four times again i dont apologize but only remind you that summer lyndon is not monique dubois we look for different things in different ways but we are both women i dont regret my choices with a sigh summer laid her head on her mothers shoulder i want to be able to say that for myself ive always thought i could youre an intelligent woman what choice you make will be right for you my greatest fear has always been to make a mistake perhaps your greatest fear is your greatest mistake she touched summers cheek again come pour me some more champagne ill tell you of my keil when summer returned to the kitchen her mind was still playing back her conversation with monique it was rare that monique pressed her for details about her personal life and rarer still for her to offer advice it was true that most of the hour theyd spent together had been devoted to a listing of keil morrisons virtues but in those first few moments monique had said things designed to make summer think designed to make her begin to doubt her own list of priorities but when she approached the swinging doors leading into the kitchen and the sounds of the argument met her she knew her thinking would have to wait my casseroles perfect too much milk too little cheese youve never been able to admit that my casseroles are better than yours perhaps the scene was laughable huge max and little charlie the undersized korean cook who came no higher than his superiors breastbone they stood glaring at each other while both of them held a solid grip on a spinach casserole it might have been laughable summer thought wearily if the rest of the kitchen staff hadnt already been choosing up sides while the luncheon orders were ignored inferior work max retorted hed yet to forgive charlie for being out sick three days running your casseroles are always inferior work mine are perfect too much milk max said solidly not enough cheese problem summer stepped up lining herself between them this scrawny little man who masquerades as a cook is trying to pass this mass of soggy leaves off as a spinach casserole max tried to tug the glass dish away and found that the scrawny little man was surprisingly strong this big lump of dough who calls himself a chef is jealous because i know more about vegetables than he does summer bit down hard on her bottom lip damn it it was funny but the timing was all wrong perhaps the rest of you might get back to work she began coolly before what clientele we have left in the dining room evacuates to the nearest golden arches for decent service now she turned back to the two opponents any moment she decided thered be bared teeth and snarls this i take it is the casserole in question the dish is a casserole max tossed back whats in it is garbage he tugged again garbage the little cook squealed in outrage then curled his lip garbage is what you pass off as prime rib the only thing edible on the plate is the tiny spring of parsley you part with he tugged back gentleman might i ask a question without waiting for an answer she touched a finger to the dish it was still warm but cooling fast has anyone tasted the casserole i dont taste poison max gave the dish another yank i pour poison down the sink i wouldnt have this this ox taste one spoonful of my spinach charlie yanked right back hed contaminate it all right children summer said in sweet tones that had both mens annoyance turning on her why dont i do the testing both men eyed each other warily tell him to let go of my spinach charlie insisted max he lets go first im his superior charlie the only thing superior is his weight and the tugofwar began again out of patience summer tossed up her hands all right enough it might have been the shock of having her raise her voice something shed never done in the kitchen or it might have been that the dish itself was becoming slippery from so much handling either way at her word the dish fell out of both mens hands with force it struck the edge of the counter shattering so that glass flew even before the casserole and its contents hit the floor in unison max and charlie erupted with abuse and accusations summer distracted by the pain in her right arm glanced down and saw the blood begin to seep from a fourinch gash amazed she stared at it for a full three seconds while her mind completely rejected the idea that blood her blood could pour out so quickly excuse me she managed at length do you think the two of you could finish this round after i stop bleeding to death charlie looked over a torrent of abuse trembling on his tongue instead he stared wideeyed at the wound then broke into an excited ramble of korean if youd stop interfering max began even as he caught sight of the blood running down summers arm he blanched then to everyones surprise moved like lightning grabbing a clean cloth he pressed it against the gash in summers arm sit he ordered and nudged her onto a kitchen stool you he bellowed at no one in particular clean up this mess already he was fashioning a tourniquet relax he said to summer with unaccustomed gentleness i want to see how deep it is giddy she nodded and kept her eyes trained on the steam from a pot across the room it didnt really hurt so very much she thought as her vision blurred then refocused shed probably imagined all that blood what the hells going on in here she heard blakes voice vaguely behind her you can hear the commotion in here clear out to the dining room he strode over intending to give both summer and max the choice of unemployment or peaceful coexistence the redstained cloth stopped him cold summer an accident max said hurriedly while summer shook her head to clear it the cuts deep shell need stitches blake was already grabbing the cloth from max and pushing him aside summer how the hell did this happen she focused on his face and registered concern and perhaps temper in his eyes before everything started to swim again then she made the mistake of looking down at her arm spinach casserole she said foolishly before she slid from the stool in a dead faint the next thing she heard was an argument isnt this where i came in she thought vaguely it only took her a moment to recognize blakes voice but the other female and dry was a stranger im staying mr cocharan you arent a relative its against hospital policy for you to remain while we treat ms lyndon believe me its only a matter of a few stitches a few stitches summers stomach rolled she didnt like to admit it but when it came to needles the kind the medical profession liked to poke into flesh she was a complete coward and if her sense of smell wasnt playing tricks on her she knew where she was the odor of antiseptics was much too recognizable perhaps if she just sat up and quietly walked away no one would notice when she did sit up she found herself in a small curtained examining room her gaze lit on a tray that held all the shiny terrifying tools of the trade blake caught the movement out of the corner of his eye and was beside her summer just relax moistening her lips she studied the room again hospital emergency room theyre going to fix your arm she managed a smile but kept her gaze locked on the tray id just as soon not when she started to swing her legs over the side of the examining table the doctor was there to stop her lie still ms lyndon summer stared back at the tough lined female face she had frizzy hair the color of a peach and wirerim glasses summer gauged her own strength against the doctors and decided she could win im going home now she said simply youre going to lie right there and get that arm sewed up now be quiet well perhaps if she recruited an ally blake you need stitches love i dont want them need the doctor corrected briskly nurse while she scrubbed her hands in a tiny sink she looked back over her shoulder mr cocharan youll have to wait outside no summer managed to struggle back into a sitting position i dont know you she told the whitecoated woman at the sink and i dont know her she added when the nurse pushed passed the curtains if im going to have to sit here while you sew up my arm with cat gut or whatever it is you use im going to have someone here that i know she tightened her grip on blakes hand i know him she lay back down but kept the death hold on blakes hand very well recognizing both a strong will and basic fear the doctor gave in just turn your head away she advised this wont take long ive already used yards of cat gut today blake summer took a deep breath and looked straight into his eyes she wouldnt think about what the two women on the other side of the table were doing to her arm i have a confession to make i dont deal very well with this sort of thing she swallowed again when she felt the pressure on her skin i have to be tranquilized to get through a dental appointment out of the corner of his eye he saw the doctor take the first stitch we almost had to do the same thing for max he ran his thumb soothingly over his knuckles after this you could tell him youre going to put in a woodburning stove and a hearth and he wouldnt give you any trouble a hell of a way to get cooperation she winced felt her stomach roll and swallowed desperately talk to me about anything we should take a weekend soon and go to the beach some place quiet right on the ocean it was a good image she struggled to focus on it which ocean any one you want well do nothing for three days but lie in the sun make love the young nurse glanced over and a sigh escaped before the doctor caught her eye as soon as im back from rome all you have to do is find some little island in the pacific while im gone id like a few palm trees and friendly natives ill look into it in the meantime the doctor put in as she snipped off a length of bandage keep this dressing dry have it changed every third day and come back in two weeks to have the stitches removed a nasty slice she added giving the bandage a last professional adjustment but youll live cautiously summer turned her head the wound was now covered in the sterile white gauze it looked neat trim and somehow competent the nausea faded instantly i thought they made the stitches so they dissolved its a nice arm the doctor rinsed off her hands in the sink we wouldnt want a scar on it ill give you a prescription for some pain pills summer set her jaw i wont take them with a shrug the doctor dried her hands suit yourself oh and you might try the solomon islands off new guinea whipping back the curtain she strode out quite a lady summer muttered as blake helped her off the table terrific bedside manner i cant think why i dont hire her as my personal physician the spunk was back blake thought with a grin but kept a supportive arm around her waist she was exactly what you needed you didnt need any more sympathy or worry than you were getting from me she frowned up at him as he led her into the parking lot when i bleed she corrected i need a great deal of sympathy and worry what you need he kissed her forehead before opening the car door is a bed a dark room and a few hours rest im going back to work she corrected the kitchens probably chaos and i have a long list of phone calls to make as soon as you arrange to have a phone hooked up for me youre going home to bed ive stopped bleeding summer reminded him and though i admit im a complete baby when it comes to blood and needles and doctors in white coats thats done now im fine youre pale he stopped at a light and turned to her it wasnt entirely clear to him how hed gotten through the last hour himself you arms certainly throbbing now or soon will be i make it a policy whenever one of my staff faints on the job they have the rest of the day off very liberal and humanitarian of you i wouldnt have fainted if i hadnt looked home summer she sat up folded her hands and took a deep breath her arm was throbbing but she wouldnt have admitted it now for anything with the new ache and annoyance it was easy to forget that shed clung to his hand a short time before blake i realize ive mentioned this before but sometimes it doesnt hurt to reiterate i dont take orders silence reigned in the car for almost a full minute blake turned west away from cocharan house and toward summers apartment building ill just take a cab she said lightly what youll take is a couple of aspirin right before i draw the shades and tuck you into bed god that sounded like heaven ignoring the image she set her chin just because i depended on you a little while that woman was plying her needle doesnt mean i need a keeper there was a way to convince her to do as he wanted blake considered it perhaps the direct way was the best way i dont suppose you noticed how many stitches she put in your arm no summer looked out the window i did i counted them as she sewed fifteen you didnt notice the size of the needle either no pressing a hand to her stomach she glared at him dirty pool blake if it works then he slipped a hand over hers a nap summer ill stay with you if you like how was she supposed to deal with him when he went from being kind to filthy to gentle how was she supposed to deal with herself when all she really wanted was to curl up beside him where she knew it would be safe and warm ill rest all at once she felt she needed to badly but it no longer had anything to do with her arm if he continually stirred her emotions like this the next few months were going to be impossible alone she finished firmly you have enough to do back at the hotel when he pulled up in front of her building she put out a hand to stop him from turning off the engine no you neednt bother to come up ill go to bed i promise because she could feel him tense with an objection she smiled and squeezed his hand i have to go up alone she realized if he came with her now everything could change im going to take those aspirin turn on the stereo and lie down id feel better if youd go by the kitchen and make certain everythings all right there he studied her face her skin was pale her eyes weary he wanted to stay with her have her hold onto him for support again even as he sat beside her he could feel the distance she was putting between them no he wouldnt allow that but for now she needed rest more than she needed him if thats what you want ill call you tonight leaning over she kissed his cheek then climbed from the car quickly thanks for holding my hand chapter contents prev next it was beginning to grate on her nerves it wasnt as though summer didnt enjoy attention more than enjoying it shed come to expect it as a matter of course in her career it wasnt as if she didnt enjoy being catered to that was something shed developed a taste for early on growing up in households with servants but as any good cook knows sugar has to be dispensed with a careful hand monique had extended her stay a full week claiming that she couldnt possibly leave philadelphia while summer was still recovering from an injury the more summer tried to play down the entire incident of her arm and the stitches the more monique looked at her with admiration and concern the more admiration and concern she received the more summer worried about that next visit to the doctor though it wasnt in character monique had gotten into the habit of coming by summers office every day with healing cups of tea and bowls of healthy soup then standing over her daughter until everything was consumed for the first few days summer had found it rather sweet though tea and soup werent regulars on her diet as far as she could remember monique had always been loving and certainly kind but never maternal for this reason alone summer drank the tea ate the soup and swallowed complaints along with them but as it continued and as monique consistently interrupted the final stages of her planning summer began to lose patience she might have been able to tolerate moniques overreaction and mothering if it hadnt been for the same treatment by the kitchen staff headed by max she was permitted to do nothing for herself if she started to brew a pot of coffee someone was there taking over insisting that she sit and rest every day at precisely noon max himself brought her in a tray with the luncheon specialty of the day poached salmon lobster soufflé stuffed eggplant summer ate because like her mother he hovered over her while she had visions of a bacon double cheeseburger with a generous side order of onion rings doors were opened for her concerned looks thrown her way conciliatory phrases heaped on her until she wanted to scream once when shed been unnerved enough to snap that she had some stitches in her arm not a terminal illness shed been brought yet another soothing cup of tea with a saucer of plain vanilla cookies they were killing her with kindness every time she thought shed reached her limit blake managed to level things for her again he wasnt callous of her injury or even unkind but he certainly wasnt treating her as though she were the star attraction at a deathbed he had an uncanny instinct for choosing the right time to phone or drop in on the kitchen he was there calm when she needed calm ordered when she yearned for order he demanded things of her when everyone else insisted she couldnt lift a finger for herself when he annoyed her it was in an entirely different way a way that tested and stretched her abilities rather than smothered them and with blake summer didnt have that hampering guilt about letting loose with her temper she could shout at him knowing she wouldnt see the bottomless patience in his eyes that she saw in maxs she could be unreasonable and not be worried that his feelings would be hurt like her mothers without realizing it she began to see him as a pillar of solidity and sense in a world of nonsense and for perhaps the first time in her life she felt an intrinsic need for that pillar along with blake summer had her work to keep her temper and her nerve ends under some kind of control she poured herself into it there were long sessions with the printer to design the perfect menu an elegant slate gray with the words cocharan house embossed on the front thick creamy parchment paper inside listing her final choices in delicate script then there were the room service menus that would go into each unit not quite so luxurious perhaps but summer saw to it that they were distinguished in their own right she talked for hours with suppliers haggling demanding and enjoying herself more than she would ever have guessed until she got precisely the terms she wanted it gave her a glow of success perhaps not the flash she felt on completing some spectacular dish but a definite glow she found that in a different way it was equally satisfying and it was unpardonably annoying to be told after the completion of a particularly long and successful negotiation that she should take a little nap cherie monique glided into the storage room just as summer hung up the phone with the butcher bearing the inevitable cup of herbal tea its time you had a break you mustnt push yourself so im fine mother glancing at the tea summer sincerely hoped she wouldnt gag she wanted something carbonated and cold preferably loaded with caffeine im just going over the contracts with the suppliers its a bit complicated and ive still got one or two calls to make if shed hoped that would be a gentle hint that she needed privacy to work she was disappointed too complicated when youve already worked so many hours today monique insisted and took a seat on the other side of the desk you forget youve had a shock i cut my arm summer said with strained patience fifteen stitches monique reminded her then frowned with disapproval as summer reached for a cigarette those are so bad for your health summer sos nervous tension she muttered then doggedly cleared her throat mother im sure keils missing you desperately just as you must be missing him you shouldnt be away from your new husband for so long ah yes monique sighed and looked dreamily at the ceiling for a new bride a day away from her husband is like a week a week can be a year abruptly she pressed her hands together shaking her head but my keil he is the most understanding of men he knows i must stay when my daughter needs me summer opened her mouth then shut it again diplomacy she reminded herself tact youve been wonderful she began a bit guiltily because it was true i cant tell you how much i appreciate all the time all the trouble youve taken over this past week or so but my arms nearly healed now im really fine i feel terribly guilty holding you here when you should be enjoying your honeymoon with her light sexy laugh monique waved a hand my sweet youll learn that a honeymoon isnt a time or a trip but a state of mind dont concern yourself with that besides do you think i could leave before they take those nasty stitches out of your arm mother summer felt the hitch in her stomach and reached for the tea in defense no no i wasnt there for you when the doctor treated you but here her eyes filled and her lips trembled i will be by your side when she removes them one at a time summer had an alltoovivid picture of herself lying once again on the examining table the toughfaced doctor over her monique frail in black would be standing by dabbing at her eyes with a lacy handkerchief she wasnt sure if she wanted to scream or just drop her head between her knees mother youll have to excuse me ive just remembered i have an appointment with blake in his office without waiting for an answer summer dashed from the storage room almost immediately moniques eyes were dry and her lips curved leaning back in her chair she laughed in delight perhaps she hadnt always known just what to do with a daughter when summer had been a child but now woman to woman she knew precisely how to nudge her daughter along and she was nudging her along to blake where monique had no doubt her strongwilled practical and muchloved daughter belonged a lamour she said and lifted the tea in a toast it didnt matter to summer that she didnt have an appointment only that she see blake talk to him and restore her sanity i have to see mr cocharan she said desperately as she pushed right past the receptionist but ms lyndon heedless summer dashed through the outer office and tossed open his door without knocking blake he lifted a brow motioned her inside then continued with his telephone conversation she looked he thought as if she were on the last stages of a manhunt and on the wrong side of the bloodhounds his first instinct might have been to comfort to soothe but common sense prevailed it was all too obvious that she was getting enough of that and detesting it frustrated she whirled around the room nervous energy flowed from her she stalked to the window then restless turned away from the view ultimately she walked to the bar and poured herself a defiant portion of vermouth the moment she heard the phone click back on the cradle she turned to him something has to be done if youre going to wave that around he said mildly indicating her glass youd better drink some first itll be all over you scowling summer look a long sip blake my mother has to go back to california oh he finished scrawling a memo well well be sorry to see her go no no she has to go back but she wont she insists on staying here and nursing me into catatonia and max she continued before he could comment something has to be done about max today today it was shrimp salad and avocado i cant take much more she sucked in a breath then continued in a dazed rambling of complaints charlie looks at me as if i were joan of arc and the rest of the kitchen staff is just as bad if not worse theyre driving me crazy i can see that the tone of voice had her pacing coming to a quick halt and her eyes narrowing dont aim that coolly amused smile at me was i smiling or that innocent look either she snapped back you were smiling inside and nervous breakdowns are definitely not funny youre absolutely right he folded his hands on the desk why dont you sit down and start from the beginning listen she dropped into a chair sipped the vermouth then was up and pacing again its not that i dont appreciate kindness but theres a saying about too much of a good thing i think ive heard that ignoring him she plunged on you can ruin a dessert with too much pampering too much attention you know he nodded the sames sometimes said of a child just stop trying to be cute damn it it doesnt seem to take any effort he smiled she scowled are you listening to me she demanded every word i wasnt cut out to be pampered thats all my mother every day its cup after cup of herbal tea until i have visions of sloshing when i walk you should rest summer youre not strong yet summer damn it im strong as an ox he took out a cigarette enjoying the show idve said so myself and max the mans positively smothering me with good will lunch every day twelve on the dot with a groan she pressed a hand against her stomach i havent had a real meal in a week i keep getting these insane cravings for tacos but im so full of tea and lobster bisque i cant do anything about it if one more person tells me to put up my feet and rest i swear im going to punch them right in the mouth blake scrutinized the end of his cigarette ill make sure i dont mention it thats just it you dont she spun around the desk then sat on it directly in front of him youre the only one around here whos treated me like a normal person since this ridiculous thing happened you even shouted at me yesterday i appreciate that think nothing of it with a half laugh she took his hand im serious i feel foolish enough for being so careless as to let an accident like that happen in my kitchen you dont constantly remind me of it with pats on the head and concerned looks i understand you blake linked his fingers with hers ive been making a study of you almost from the first instant we met the way he said it had her pulse fluctuating im not an easy person to understand no i dont always understand let me tell you about summer lyndon then he measured her hand against his before he linked their fingers shes a beautiful woman a bit spoiled from her upbringing and her own success he smiled when her brows drew together shes strong and opinionated and intensely feminine without being calculating shes ambitious and dedicated with a skill for concentration that reminded me once of a surgeon and shes romantic though shell claim otherwise thats not true summer began she listens to chopin when she works even while she chooses to have an office in a storage room she keeps roses on her desk therere reasons why stop interrupting he told her simply and with a huff she subsided what fears she has are kept way below the surface because she doesnt like to admit to having any shes tough enough to hold her own against anyone and compassionate enough to tolerate an uncomfortable situation rather than hurt someones feelings shes controlled and shes passionate she has a taste for the best champagne and junk food theres no one ive known whos annoyed me quite so much or who id trust quite so implicitly she let out a long breath it wasnt the first time hed put her in a position where words were hard to come by not an entirely admirable woman not entirely blake agreed but a fascinating one she smiled then sat on his lap ive always wanted to do this she murmured snuggling sit on some big corporate executives lap in an elegant office im suddenly quite sure id rather be fascinating than admirable i prefer you that way he kissed her but lightly youve chased off my nervous breakdown again he brushed at her hair thinking he was close very close to winning her completely we aim to please now if i just didnt have to go back down and face all that sugar she sighed and all those earnestly concerned faces what would you rather do linking her hands around his neck she laughed and drew back if i could do anything i wanted anything thoughtfully she ran her tongue over her teeth then grinned id like to go to the movies a perfectly dreadful movie and eat pounds of buttered popcorn with too much salt okay he gave her a friendly slap on the bottom lets go find a dreadful movie you mean now right now but its only four oclock he kissed her then hauled her to her feet its known as playing hookey ill fill you in on the way she made him feel young foolishly young and irresponsible sitting in a darkened corner of the theater with a huge barrel of popcorn on his lap and her hand in his when he looked back over his life blake could remember no time when he hadnt felt secure but irresponsible never that having a multimillion dollar business behind him had ingrained in him a very demanding sense of obligation however much hed benefited growing up having enough and always the best thered always been the unspoken pressure to maintain that standard for himself and for the family business because hed always taken that position seriously he was a cautious man impulsiveness had never been part of his style but perhaps that was changing a bit with summer hed had the impulse to give her whatever shed wanted that afternoon if it had been a trip to paris to eat supper at maxims hed have arranged it then and there then again he should have known that a box of popcorn and a movie were more her style it was that style the contrast of elegance and simplicity that had drawn him in from the first he knew without question that there would never be another woman who would move him in the same way summer knew it had been days since she had fully relaxed in fact she hadnt been able to relax at all since the accident with anyone but blake hed given her support but more importantly hed given her space they hadnt been together often over the past week and she knew blake was closing the deal with the hamilton chain theyd both been busy preoccupied pressured yet when they were alone and away from cocharan house they didnt talk business she knew how hard hed worked on this purchase the negotiations the paperwork the endless meetings yet hed put all that aside for her summer leaned toward him sweet hmm you she whispered under the dialogue on the screen youre sweet because i found a dreadful movie with a chuckle she reached for more popcorn it is dreadful isnt it terrible which is why the theaters nearly empty i like it this way antisocial no it just makes it easier leaning closer he caught the lobe of her ear between his teeth to indulge in this sort of thing oh summer felt the thrill of pleasure start at her toes and climb upward and this sort of thing he nipped at the cord of her neck enjoying her quick little intake of breath you taste better than the popcorn and its excellent popcorn summer turned her head so that her mouth could find his so warm so right summer felt it was almost possible to say that her lips were made to fit his if shed believed in such things if shed believed in such things she might have said that theyd been meant to find each other at this stage of their lives to meet to clash to attract to merge one man to one woman enduringly when they were close when his lips were heated on hers she could almost believe it she wanted to believe it he ran a hand down her hair soft fresh just the touch of that and no more could make him want her unreasonably he never felt stronger than when he was with her and he never felt more vulnerable he didnt hear the explosion of sound and music from the speakers she didnt see the sudden kaleidoscope of color and movement on the screen hampered by the small seats they shifted in an effort to get that much closer excuse me the young usher who had the job until september when school started up again shifted his feet in the aisle then he cleared his throat excuse me glancing up blake noticed that the house lights were on and the screen was blank after a surprised moment summer pressed her mouth against his shoulder to muffle a laugh movies over the boy said uncomfortably we have to ah clear the theater after every show glancing at summer he decided any man might lose interest in a movie with someone like her around then blake stood tall broad shouldered with that one aloofly raised eyebrow the boy swallowed and a lot of guys didnt like to be interrupted ah thats the rule you know the manager and reasonable enough blake interrupted when he noticed the boys adams apple working well just take the popcorn along summer said as she rose she tucked the barrel under one arm and slid her other through blakes have a nice evening she told the usher over her shoulder as they walked out when they were outside she burst out laughing poor child he thought you were going to manhandle him the thought crossed my mind but only very briefly long enough for him to get nervous about it after climbing into the car she placed the popcorn in her lap you know what he thought dont you what that we were having an illicit affair leaning over she nipped at blakes ear the kind where your wife thinks youre at the office and my husband thinks im shopping why didnt we go to a motel thats where were going now nibbling on popcorn again she sent him a wicked glance though i think in our case we might substitute my apartment im willing to be flexible summer he drew her against his side as they breezed through a light just what was that movie about laughing she let her head lay against his shoulder i havent the vaguest idea later they lay naked in her bed the curtains open to let in the light the windows up to let in the breeze from the apartment below came the repetitive sound of scales being played a bit unsteadily on the piano perhaps shed dozed for a short time because the sunlight seemed softer now almost rosy but she wasnt in any hurry for night to fall the sheets were warm and wrinkled from their bodies the air was ripe with supper smells grilling pork from the piano teachers apartment spaghetti sauce from the newlyweds next door the breeze carried the mix of both appealingly its nice summer murmured with her head nestled in the curve of her lovers shoulder just being here like this knowing that anything there is to do can be done just as well tomorrow you probably havent played hookey enough she was quite sure she hadnt if i did the business would suffer and the board would begin to grumble complainings one of their favorite things absently she rubbed the bottom of her foot over the top of one of his i havent asked you about the hamilton chain because i thought you probably got enough of that at the office and from the press but id like to know if you got what you wanted he thought about reaching for a cigarette then decided it wasnt worth the effort i wanted those hotels as it turned out the deal satisfied all parties in the end you cant ask for more than that no thoughtfully she rolled over so that she could look at him directly her hair brushed over his chest why did you want them is it the acquisition itself the property or just a matter of enjoying the wheeling and dealing the strategy of negotiations its all of that part of the enjoyment in business is setting up deals working out the flaws following through until youve gotten what you were aiming for in some ways its not that different from art business isnt art summer corrected archly there are parallels you set up an idea work out the flaws then follow through until youve created what you wanted youre being logical again in art you use the emotion in equal parts with the mind you cant do that in business her shrug was typically french somehow she became more french whenever her craft was under discussion this is all facts and figures you left out instinct facts and figures arent enough without that she frowned considering perhaps but you wouldnt follow instinct over a solid set of facts even a solid set of facts varies according to the circumstances and the players he was thinking of her now and himself reaching up he tucked her hair behind her ear instincts are very often more reliable and she was thinking of him now and herself often more summer murmured but not always more that leaves room for failure no amount of planning no amount of facts precludes failure no she laid her head on his shoulder again trying to ward off the little trickle of panic that was trying to creep in he ran a hand down her back she was still so cautious he thought a little more time a little more room a change of subject i have twenty new hotels to oversee to reorganize he began that means twenty more kitchens that have to be studied and graded ill need an expert she smiled a little as she lifted her head again twenty is a very demanding and timeconsuming number not for the best tilting her head she looked down her straight elegant nose naturally not but the best is very difficult to come by the best is currently very soft and very naked in my arms her lips curved slowly the way he most enjoyed them very true but this i think is not a negotiating table youve a better idea how to spend the evening she ran a fingertip along his jawline much better he caught her hand in his and drawing her finger into his mouth nipped lightly show me the idea appealed and excited it seemed that whenever they made love she was quickly dominated by her own emotions and his skill this time she would set the pace and in her own time in her own way she would destroy the innate control that brought her both admiration and frustration just the thought of it sent a thrill racing up her spine she brought her mouth close to his but used her tongue to taste slowly very slowly she traced his lips already she could feel the heat rising with a lazy sigh she shifted so that her body moved over his as she trailed kisses down his jaw a strong face she thought aristocratic but not soft intelligent but not cold it was a face some women would find haughty until they looked into the eyes she did so now and saw the intensity the heat even the ruthlessness i want you more than i should she heard herself say i have you less than i want before he could speak she crushed her mouth to his and started the journey for both of them he was still throbbing from her words alone hed wanted to hear that kind of admission from her hed waited to hear it just as hed waited to feel this strong pure emotion from her it was that emotion that stripped away all his defenses even as her seeking hands and mouth exploited the weaknesses she touched his skin heated she tasted his blood sang she encompassed his mind swam vulnerable blake discovered the new sensation in himself she made him so in the soft lowering light near dusk he was trapped in that midnight world of quietly raging powers her fingers were cool and very sure as they stroked enticed he could feel them slide leisurely over him pausing to linger while she sighed and while she sighed she exploited his body was weighed down with layer after layer of pleasures to be seduced so carefully to be desired so fully with long lengthy openmouthed kisses she explored all of him reveling in the firm masculinity of his body knowing she would soon rip apart that impenetrable control she was obsessed with it and with him could it be that now after shed made love with him after shed begun to understand the powers and weaknesses in his body she would find even more delight in learning of them again there seemed to be no end to the variations of her feelings to the changes of sensations she could experience when she was with him like this each time every time was as vital and unique as the first had been if this was a contradiction to everything shed ever believed was true about a man and woman she didnt question it now she exalted in it he was hers body and mind she felt it almost tangibly she could sense the polish the civilized sheen that was so much a part of him melt away it was what she wanted there was little sanity left as she roamed over him the need became more primitive more primal he wanted more endlessly more but the blood was drumming in his head she was so agile so relentless he experienced a wave of pure helplessness for the first time in his life her hands were clever so clever he couldnt hear the quick unsteadiness of her breathing he could feel her tormenting him exquisitely but he couldnt see the flickers of passion or depth of desire in her eyes he was blind and deaf to everything then her mouth was devouring his and everything savage that civilized men restrain tore from him he was mad for her in his mind were dark swirling colors in his ears was a wild rushing like a sea crazed by a storm her name ripped from him like an oath as he gripped her rolling her to her back enclosing her possessing her and there was nothing but her to take to drown in to ravage and to worship until passion spun from its peak and emptied him chapter contents prev next im starving it was full dark with no moon to shed any trickle of light into the room the darkness itself was comfortable and easy they were still naked and tangled on summers bed but the piano had been silent for an hour there were no more supper smells in the air blake drew her a bit closer and kept his eyes shut though it wasnt sleep he sought somehow in the silence in the darkness he felt closer to her im starving summer repeated a bit sulkily this time youre the chef oh no not this time rising on her elbow summer glared at him she could see the silhouette of his profile the long line of chin the straight nose the sweep of brow she wanted to kiss all of them again but knew it was time to make a stand its definitely your turn to cook my turn he opened one eye cautiously i could send out for pizza takes too long she rolled on top of him to give him a smacking kiss and a quick jab in the ribs i said i was starving thats an immediate problem he folded his arms behind his head he too could see only a silhouette the drape of her hair slope of her shoulder the curve of her breasts it was enough i dont cook everyone cooks something she insisted scrambled eggs he said hoping it would discourage her thats about it thatll do before he could think of anything to change her mind she was off the bed and switching on the bedside lamp summer he tossed his arm over his eyes to shield them and tried a halfhearted moan she grinned at that before she turned to the closet to find a robe i have eggs and a skillet i make very bad eggs thats okay she found his slacks shook them out briefly then tossed them on top of him real hunger makes allowances resigned blake put his feet on the floor then i dont expect a critique afterward while she waited he slipped into a pair of brief jockey shorts they were dark blue cut low at the waist high at the thigh very sexy she mused and very discreet strange how such an incidental thing could reflect a personality cooks like to be cooked for she told him as he drew on his slacks he shrugged into his shirt leaving it unbuttoned then dont interfere wouldnt dream of it hooking her arm through his summer led him to the kitchen again she switched on lights and made him wince make yourself at home she invited arent you going to assist no indeed summer took the top off the cookie jar and plucked out the familiar sandwich cookie i dont work overtime and i never assist union rules my rules youre going to eat cookies he asked as he rummaged for a bowl and eggs this is just the appetizer she said with her mouth full want one ill pass sticking his head in the refrigerator he found a carton of eggs and a quart of milk you might want to grate a bit of cheese summer began then shrugged when he sent her an arch look sorry carry on blake broke four eggs into the bowl then added a dollop of milk one should measure you know one shouldnt talk with ones mouth full he said mildly and began to beat the eggs overbeating them she thought but managed to restrain herself but when it came to cooking willpower wasnt her strong suit you havent heated up the pan either undaunted by being totally ignored she took another cookie i can see youre going to need lessons if you want something to do make some toast obligingly she took a loaf of bread from the bin and popped two pieces in the toaster its characteristic of cooks to get a bit testy when theyre watched but a good chef has to overcome that and distractions she waited until hed poured the egg mixture into a skillet before going to him wrapping her arms around his waist she pressed her lips to the back of his neck all manner of distraction and youve got the flame up too high do you like your eggs singed or burned clear through with a laugh she ran her hands up his bare chest singed is fine i have a nice little white bordeaux you mightve put in the eggs but since you didnt ill just pour some into glasses she left him to cook and by the time blake had finished the eggs she had buttered toast on a plate and chilled wine in glasses impressive summer decided as she sat at the dinette and aromatic but its the eyes that tell you first he remembered attractive he watched as she spooned eggs on her plate very and she took a first testing bite yes and quite good all in all i might consider putting you on the breakfast shift on a trial basis i might consider the job if cold cereal were the basic menu youll have to expand your horizons she continued to eat enjoying the hot simple food on an empty stomach i believe you could be quite good at this with a few rudimentary lessons from you she lifted her wine and her eyes laughed over the rim if you like you certainly couldnt have a better teacher her hair was still rumpled around her face his hands had done that her cheeks were flushed her eyes bright and flecked with gold the robe threatened to slip off one shoulder and left a teasing hint of skin exposed as passion had stripped away his control now emotions stripped away all logic i love you summer she stared at him while the smile faded slowly what went through her she didnt recognize it didnt seem to be any one sensation but a cornucopia of fears excitement disbelief and longings oddly no one of them seemed dominant at first but were so mixed and muddled she tried to grip any one of them and hold on to it not knowing what else to do she set the glass down precisely then stared at the wine shimmering inside that wasnt a threat he took her hand holding it until she looked up at him again i dont see how it could come as that much of a surprise to you but it had she expected affection that was something she could deal with she understood respect but love that was such a fragile word such an easily broken word and something inside her begged for it to be taken from him cherished protected summer struggled against it blake i dont need to hear that sort of thing the way other women do please maybe you dont he hadnt started the way hed intended to but now that he had hed finish but i need to say it ive needed to for a long time now she drew her hand from his and nervously picked up her glass again ive always thought that words are the first thing that can damage a relationship when theyre not said blake countered its a lack of words a lack of meaning that damages a relationship this one isnt a word i use casually no she could believe that it might have been the belief that had the fear growing stronger love when it was given demanded some kind of return she wasnt ready she was sure she wasnt ready i think its best if we want things to go on as they are that we i dont want things to go on as they are he interrupted hed rather have felt annoyance than this panic that was sneaking in he took a moment trying to alleviate both i want you to marry me no summers own panic became fullblown she stood quickly as if that would erase the words put back the distance no thats impossible its very possible he rose too unwilling to have her draw away from him i want you to share my life my name i want to share children with you and all the years it takes to watch them grow stop she threw up her hand desperate to halt the words they were moving her and she knew it would be too easy to say yes and make that ultimate mistake why before she could prevent it hed taken her face in his hands the touch was gentle though there was steel beneath because youre afraid to admit its something you want too no its not something i want its not something i believe in marriage its a license that costs a few dollars a piece of paper for a few thousand dollars more you can get a divorce decree another piece of paper he could feel her trembling and cursed himself for not knowing how to get through you know better than that marriage is two people who make promises to each other and who make the effort to keep them a divorce is giving up im not interested in promises desperate she pushed his hands from her face and stepped back i dont want any made to me and i dont want to make any im happy with my life just as it is i have my career to think of thats not enough for you and we both know it you cant tell me you dont feel for me i can see it every time im with you it shows in your eyes more each time he was handling it badly but saw no other course open but straight ahead the closer he came the further away she drew damn it summer ive waited long enough if my timings not as perfect as i wanted it to be it cant be helped timing she dragged a hand through her hair what are you talking about youve waited dropping her hands she began to pace the room has this been one of your longterm plans all neatly thought out all meticulously outlined oh i can see it she let out a trembling breath and whirled back to him it no longer made any difference to her if she were unreasonable did you sit in your office and go over your strategy point by point was this the setting up the looking for flaws the following through dont be ridiculous ridiculous she tossed back no i think not youd play the game well disarming confusing charming supportive patience youd have a lot of that did you wait until you thought i was at my most vulnerable her breath was heaving now and the words were tumbling out on each one let me tell you something blake im not a hotel chain you can acquire by waiting until the markets ripe in a slanted way shed been killingly accurate and the accuracy put him on the defensive damn it summer i want to marry you not acquire you the words are often one and the same to my way of thinking your plans a little off the mark this time blake no deal now i want you to leave me alone we have a hell of a lot of talking to do no we have no talking to do not about this i work for you for the term of the contract thats all damn the contract he took her by the shoulders shaking her once in frustration and damn you for being so stubborn i love you thats not something you can brush aside as if it doesnt exist to their mutual surprise her eyes filled abruptly poignantly leave me alone she managed as the first tears spilled out leave me completely alone the tears undermined him as her temper never would have done i cant do that but he released her when he wanted to hold her ill give you some time maybe we both need time but well have to come back to this just go away she never allowed tears in front of anyone though she tried to dash them away others fell quickly go away on the repetition she turned from him holding herself stiff until she heard the click of the door she looked around and though he was gone he was everywhere dropping to the couch she let herself weep and wished she were anywhere else she hadnt come to rome for the cathedrals or the fountains or the art nor had she come for culture or history as summer took a wicked cab ride from the airport into the city she was more grateful for the crowded streets and noise than the antiquity perhaps shed stayed in america too long this time europe was fast cars crumbling ruins and palaces she needed europe again summer told herself as she zipped past the trevi fountain she thought of philadelphia a few days away she thought just a few days away doing what she was best at and everything would fall back into perspective again shed made a mistake with blake shed known from the beginning it had been a mistake to get involved now it was up to her to break it off quickly completely before long hed be grateful to her for preventing him from making an even larger mistake marriage to her yes she imagined hed be vastly relieved within even a few weeks summer sat in the back of the cab watching rome skim by and was more miserable than shed ever been in her life when the cab squealed to a halt at the curb she climbed out she stood for a moment a slender woman in white fedora and jacket with a snakeskin bag slung carelessly over one shoulder she was dressed like a woman of confidence and experience in her eyes was a child who was lost mechanically she paid off the driver accepted her bag and his bow then turned away it was only just past am in rome and already hot under a spectacular sky she remembered shed left philadelphia in a thunderstorm walking up the steps to an old distinguished building she knocked sharply five times after a reasonable wait she knocked again harder when the door opened she looked at the man in the short silk robe it was embroidered she noticed with peacocks on anyone else it wouldve looked absurd his hair was tousled his eyes halfclosed a nights growth of beard shadowed his chin hello carlo wake you up summer he swallowed the string of italian abuse that had been on his tongue and grabbed her a surprise si he kissed her soundly twice then drew her away but why do you bring me a surprise at dawn its after ten ten is dawn when you dont begin to sleep until five but come in come in i dont forget you come for gravantis birthday outside carlos home was distinguished inside it was opulent dominated by marble and gold the entrance hall only demonstrated the beginning of his penchant for the luxurious they walked through and under arches into a living area crowded with treasures small and large most of them had been given to him by pleased clients or women carlo had a talent for picking lovers who remained amiable even when they were no longer lovers there was a brocade at the windows oriental carpets on the floor and a tintoretto on the wall two sofas were piled with cushions deep enough to swim in an alabaster lion nearly two feet in height sat beside one a threetiered chandelier shot out splinters of refracted light from its crystals she ran her finger down a porcelain ewer in delicate chinese blue and white new si medici but of course a gift from a friend your friends are always remarkably generous he grinned but then so am i carlo the husky impatient voice came from up the curving marble stairs carlo glanced up then looked back at summer and grinned again summer removed her white fedora a friend i take it youll give me a moment cara he was heading for the steps as he spoke perhaps you could go into the kitchen make coffee and stay out of the way summer finished as carlo disappeared upstairs she started toward the kitchen then went back to take her suitcase with her there wasnt any use leaving carlo with something like luggage to explain to his friend the kitchen was as spectacular as the rest of the house and as large as the average hotel room summer knew it as well as she knew her own it was all in ebonies and ivories with what appeared to be acres of counter space it boasted two ovens a restaurantsized refrigerator two sinks and a dishwasher that could handle the aftermath of an embassy dinner carlo franconi had never been one to do anything in a small way summer opened a cabinet for the coffee beans and grinder on impulse she decided to make crepes carlo she mused might be just a little while when he did come she was just finishing up at the stove ah bella you cook for me im honored i had a twinge of guilt about disrupting your morning besides she slipped crepes pregnant with warm apples and cinnamon onto plates im hungry summer set them on a scrubbed worktable while carlo pulled up chairs i should apologize for coming like this without warning was your friend annoyed he flashed a grin as he sat you dont give me enough credit scusi she passed the small pitcher of cream so well be working together for enricos birthday my veal with spaghetti enrico has a weakness for my spaghetti every friday he is in my restaurant eating carlo started immediately on the crepe and you make the dessert a birthday cake summer drank coffee while her crepe cooled untouched suddenly she had no appetite for it enrico requested something special created just for him knowing his vanity and his fondness for chocolate and whipped cream it was easy to come up with it but the dinner isnt for two more days you come early she shrugged and toyed with her coffee i wanted to spend some time in europe i see and he thought he did she was looking a bit hollow around the eyes a sign of romantic trouble everything goes well in philadelphia the remodelings done the new menus printed i think the kitchen staff is going to do very well i hired maurice from chicago you remember oh yes pressed duck its an exciting menu she went on just the sort id have if i ever decided to have a place of my own i suppose i developed a bit of respect for you carlo when i started to deal with the paperwork paperwork he finished off his crepes and eyed hers ugly but necessary you arent eating summer hmm no i guess its a touch of jet lag she waved at her plate go ahead taking her at her word he switched plates you solved the problem of max absently she touched her arm the stitches thank god were a thing of the past were managing mother came to visit for a while she always makes an impression monique so how is she married again summer said simply and lifted her coffee a director this time another american shes happy naturally the coffee was strong stronger than shed grown used to in america she thought in frustration that nothing was as it once was for her theyre starting a film together in another few weeks perhaps her wisest choice someone who would understand her artistic temperament her needs he lingered over the perfect melding of spices and fruit and how is your american summer set down her coffee and stared at carlo he wants to marry me carlo choked on a bite of crepe and grabbed for his cup so congratulations dont be silly unable to sit she rose sticking her hands in the pockets of her long loose jacket im not going to no going to the stove carlo poured them both more coffee why not you find him unattractive maybe bad tempered stupid of course not impatient she curled and uncurled her fingers inside the jacket pockets that has nothing to do with it what has ive no intention of getting married to anyone thats one merrygoround i can do without you dont choose to grab for the brass ring maybe because youre afraid youd miss she lifted her chin be careful carlo he shrugged at the icy tone you know i say what i think if youd wanted to hear something else you wouldnt have come here i came here because i wanted a few days with a friend not to discuss marriage youre losing sleep over it shed picked up her cup and now slammed it down again coffee spilled over the sides it was a long flight and ive been working hard and yes maybe im upset over the whole thing she continued before carlo could speak i hadnt expected this from him hadnt wanted it hes an honest man and i know when he says he loves me and wants to marry me he means it for the moment that doesnt make it any easier to say no her fury didnt unnerve him carlo was well used to passionate emotions from women he preferred them and you how do you feel about him she hesitated then walked to the window she could look out on carlos garden from there a quiet isolated spot that served as a border between the house and the busy streets of rome i have feelings for him summer murmured stronger feelings than are wise if anything they only make it more important that i break things off now i dont want to hurt him carlo any more than i want to be hurt myself youre so sure love and marriage would hurt he put his hands on her shoulders and kneaded them lightly when you look so hard at the whatifs in life cara mia you miss much living you have someone who loves you and though you wont say the words i think you love him back why do you deny yourself marriage carlo she turned her eyes earnest its not for people like us is it people like us were so wrapped up in what it is we do were used to coming and going as we please when we please we have no one to answer to no one to consider but ourselves isnt that why youve never married i could say im a generous man and feel it would be too selfish to limit my gifts to only one woman she smiled fully the way hed wanted to see her smile gently he brushed the hair away from her face but to you the truth is ive never found anyone who could make my heart tremble ive looked if i found her id run for a license and a priest quickly with a sigh she turned back to the window the flowers were a tapestry of color in the strong sun marriage is a fairy tale carlo full of princes and peasants and toads ive seen too many of those fairy tales fade we write our own stories summer a woman like you knows that because youve always done so maybe but this time i just dont know if i have the courage to turn the next page take your time theres no better place to think about life and love than roma no better man to think about them with than franconi tonight i cook for you linguini he kissed the tips of his fingers to die for you can make me one of your babas just like when we were students si turning back to him summer wrapped her arms around his neck you know carlo if i were the marrying kind id take you for your pasta alone he grinned carissima even my pasta is nothing compared to my im sure she interrupted dryly why dont you get dressed and take me shopping i need to buy something fantastic while im in rome i havent given my mother a wedding present yet how could he have been so stupid blake flicked on his lighter and watched the flame cut through the darkness it wouldnt be dawn for an hour yet but hed given up on sleep hed given up on trying to imagine what summer was doing in rome while he sat wakeful in an empty suite of rooms and thought of her if he went to rome no hed promised himself hed give her some room especially since hed handled everything so badly hed given them both some room more strategy he thought derisively and drew hard on the cigarette was that what the whole thing was about hed always enjoyed challenges problems summer was certainly both was that the reason he wanted her if shed agreed to marry him he could have congratulated himself on a plan well thought out and perfectly executed another cocharan acquisition damn it he rose he paced smoke curled from the cigarette between his fingers then disappeared into the halflight he knew better than that even if she didnt if it were true that hed treated the whole affair like a problem to be carefully solved it was only because that was his makeup but he loved her and if he were sure of anything it was that she loved him too how was he going to get over that wall shed erected go back to the way things were impossible he looked out at the city as the darkness began to soften in the east the sky was just beginning to lighten with the first hints of pink suddenly he realized hed watched too many sunrises alone too much had changed between them now blake mused too much had been said you couldnt take love back and lock it away for convenience sake hed stayed away from her for a full week before shed gone to rome it had been much harder than hed imagined it would be but her tears that night had pushed him to it now he wondered if that had been yet another mistake perhaps if hed gone to her the next day shaking his head he moved away from the window again all along his mistake had been trying to treat the situation with logic there wasnt any logic in loving someone only feelings without logic he lost all advantage madly in love yes he thought the term very apt it was all madness an incurable madness if shed been with him he could have shown her somehow when she came back he thought violently hed take that damn wall down piece by piece until she was forced to face the madness too when the phone rang he stared at it summer hello blake the voice was a little too sulky a little too french yes monique im sorry to disturb you but i always forget how much time is different between west and east i was just going to bed you were up yes the sun was slowly rising the room was pale with light most of the city wasnt yet awake but he was did you have a good trip back to california i slept almost the whole way thank god because there have been so many parties so little changes in hollywood some of the names some of the faces now to be chic one must wear sunglasses on a string my mother did this but only to keep from losing them he smiled because monique demanded smiles you dont need trends to be chic how flattering her voice was very young and very pleased what can i do for you monique oh so sweet first i must tell you how lovely it was to stay in your hotel again always the service is impeccable and summers arm its better no apparently shes in rome oh yes my memory well she was never one to sit too long in one space my summer i saw her only briefly before i left she seemed preoccupied he felt his stomach muscles knotting his jaw tightening deliberately he relaxed both shes been working very hard on the kitchen moniques lips curved he gives away nothing this one she thought with approval yes well i may see her again for a short time i must ask you a favor blake you were so kind during my visit whatever i can do the suite where i stayed i found it so restful so agreable i wonder if you could reserve it for me again in two days time two days his brow creased but he automatically reached for a pen to jot it down youre coming back east im so foolish so what is it absentminded oui i have business to take care of there and with summers accident it all went out of my head i must come back and tie up the ends that are loose and the suite of course ill see to it merci and perhaps i could ask one more thing of you i will have a small party on saturday evening just a few old friends and some wine id be very grateful if you could stop by for a few minutes around eight there was nothing he wanted less at the moment than a party but manners upbringing and business left him only one answer again he automatically noted down the date and time id be happy to marvelous till saturday then au revoir after hanging up the phone monique gave a tinkle of laughter true she was an actress not a screenwriter but she thought her little scenario was brilliant yes absolutely brilliant picking up the phone she prepared to send a cablegram to rome chapter contents prev next cherie must return to philadelphia for some unfinished business before filming begins will be at cocharan house in my suite over the weekend having a little soiree saturday evening do come a bientôt mother and just what was she up to summer glanced over the cable again as she cruised above the atlantic unfinished business summer could think of no business monique would have in philadelphia unless it involved husband number two but that was ancient history and monique always had someone else handle her business dealings shed always claimed a good actress was a child at heart and had no head for business it was another one of her diabolically helpless ways that made it possible for her to do only exactly as she wanted what summer couldnt figure out was why monique would want to come back east with a shrug summer slipped the cable back into her bag she didnt feel like hassling with people and cocktail talk in just over five hours the day before shed outdone herself with the creation of a birthday cake shaped like enricos palatial home outside rome and filled with a wickedly wonderful combination of chocolate and cream it had taken her twelve hours and for once at the hosts insistence shed remained and joined the party for champagne and dessert shed thought it would be good for her the people the elegance the celebratory atmosphere it had done no more than show her that she didnt want to be in rome exchanging small talk and drinking wine she wanted to be home home though it surprised her was philadelphia she didnt long for paris and her odd little flat on the left bank she wanted her fourthfloor apartment in philadelphia where there were memories of blake in every corner however foolish it made her however unwise or impractical it was she wanted blake now flying home she found that hadnt changed it was blake she wanted to go to when she was on the ground again it was to blake she wanted to tell all the foolish stories shed heard in enricos dining room it was blake she wanted to hear laugh it was blake she wanted to curl up next to now that the nervous energy of the past few days was draining sighing she tilted her seat back and closed her eyes but she would do her duty and go to her mothers suite perhaps moniques little party was the perfect diversion it would give summer just a bit more time before she faced blake again blake and the decision she had thought was already made bc ran a finger around the inside of the snug collar of his shirt and hoped he didnt look as nervous as he felt seeing monique again after all these years having to introduce lillian to her monique my wife lillian lillian monique dubois a former lover small world isnt it though he was a man who appreciated a good joke this one eluded him it seemed there was no statute of limitations on marital transgressions it was true that hed only strayed once and then during an unofficial separation from his wife that had left him angry bitter and frightened a crime committed once was still a crime committed he loved lillian had always loved her but hed never be able to deny that the brief affair with monique had happened and he couldnt deny that it had been exciting passionate and memorable theyd never contacted each other again though once or twice hed seen her when he was still actively working in the business even that had been so long ago so why had she called him now twenty years later insisting that he come with his wife to her suite at the philadelphia cocharan house he ran his finger around his collar once again something was choking him moniques only explanation had been that it concerned the happiness of his son and her daughter that had left him with the problem of fabricating a reason for coming into town and insisting that lillian accompany him that hadnt been a piece of cake because hed married a sharpminded independent woman but it was nothing compared with the next ordeal are you going to fuss with that tie all day bc jumped as his wife came up behind him easy with a laugh she brushed the back of his jacket smoothing it over his shoulders in a habit that took him back to their honeymoon youd think youd never spent an evening with a celebrity before or is it just french actresses that make you nervous this one french actress bc thought and turned to his wife shed always been lovely not the breathcatching beauty monique had been but lovely with the kind of quiet looks that remain lovely through the years her pure rich brunette hair was liberally streaked with gray but styled in such a way that the contrasting colors enhanced her looks lillian had always had style shed been his partner always had stood up to him stood by him a strong woman hed needed a strong woman she was the best damn first mate a man could ask for he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her quite tenderly i love you lily when she touched his cheek and smiled he took her hand feeling like the condemned man walking his last mile wed better go well be late blake hung up the phone in disgust he was certain summer would be back that evening but though hed called her apartment off and on for over an hour thered been no answer he was out of patience and in no mood to go down and be sociable in moniques suite much like his father had done he tugged on his tie when all this was over when she was back he was going to find a way to convince her to go away with him hed find that damn island in the pacific if thats what it took hed buy the damn island and set up housekeeping build a chain of pizza parlors or fastfood restaurants maybe that would satisfy the woman feeling unreasonable and just a little mean he strode out of the apartment monique surveyed the suite and nodded the flowers were a nice touch not too many just a few buds here and there to give the rooms a whiff of a garden a touch only a touch of romance the wine was chilling the glasses sparkling in the subdued lighting and max had outdone himself with the hors douvres she decided a little caviar a little pate some miniature quiches very elegant she must remember to pay a visit to the kitchen as for herself monique touched a hand to the chignon at the base of her neck not her usual style but she wanted to add the air of dignity she felt the evening might call for it but the black silk pants and offtheshoulder blouse were sexy and chic she simply couldnt resist the urge to dress with a bit of flair for the part the scene was set she decided now it was only a matter for the players the knock came with a slow smile monique went toward the door act one was about to begin bc her smile was brilliant her hands thrown out to him how wonderful to see you again after all this time her beauty was as stunning as ever there was no resisting that smile though hed been determined to be very aloof and very polite his voice warmed monique you dont look a minute older always the charmer she laughed then kissed his cheek before she turned to the woman beside him and you are lillian how lovely that we meet at last bc has told me so much of you i feel were old friends lillian measured the woman across the threshold and lifted a brow oh no fool this one monique decided instantly and liked her of course that was all so long ago so we must get to know each other all over again now please come in bc youd be kind enough to open a bottle of champagne a bundle of nerves bc crossed the room to comply a drink would be an excellent idea hed have preferred bourbon straight up of course ive seen you many times lillian began im sure you havent made a movie ive missed ms dubois monique please in a simple gracious gesture she plucked a rosebud from a vase and handed it to lillian and im flattered from time to time i would retire this last occasion has been the longest but always going back to the film is like going back to an old lover the cork blew out of the bottle like a missile and bounced off the ceiling calmly monique slipped an arm through lillians inside she was giggling like a girl such an exciting sound is it not it always makes me happy to hear champagne being opened we must have a toast nestce pas she lifted a glass with a flourish and looked to lillians thinking just like the character shed played in yesterdays dream to fate i think monique decided and the strange way it twists us all together she clinked her glass against bcs then his wifes before drinking so tell me you are still enchanted with sailing bc he cleared his throat no longer certain if he should watch his wife or monique both of them were definitely watching him ah yes as a matter of fact lillian and i just got back from tahiti how charming a perfect place for lovers oui lillian sipped her wine perfect et voila monique said when the knock sounded the next guest please help yourself it was now act two having the time of her life monique went to answer blake so kind of you to come and how charming you look monique he took the hand she extended and brought it to his lips even as he calculated just how long it would be before he could make his escape welcome back i must be certain not to wear out the welcome youll be surprised by my other guests i think with this she gestured inside the last two people hed expected to see in moniques suite were his parents he crossed the room and bent to kiss his mother very surprised i didnt know you were in town we only got in a little while ago lillian handed her son a glass of champagne we did call your suite but the phone was busy just what stage is this woman setting lillian wondered as monique joined them families she said grandly helping herself to some caviar i have a great fondness for them i must tell you both how i admire your son the young cocharan carries on the tradition is it not so for an instant only an instant lillians eyes narrowed she wanted to know just what tradition the french actress referred to were both very proud of blake bc said with some relief hes not only maintained the cocharan standard but expanded it the hamilton chain was an excellent move he toasted his son excellent hows the turnover in the kitchen going very smoothly and it was the last thing he wanted to discuss we start serving from the new menu tomorrow then we timed our visit well lillian put in well have a chance to test it firsthand do you know the coincidence monique asked lillian as she offered the tray of quiches coincidence but it is amusing it is my daughter who now manages your sons kitchen your daughter lillian glanced at her husband no it wasnt mentioned to me she is a superb chef you would agree blake she often cooks for him she added with a deliberate smile before he could make any comment lillian held the rosebud under her nose interesting really a charming girl bc put in she has your looks monique though i could hardly credit that you had a grown daughter and i was just as surprised when i first met your son she smiled at him isnt it strange where the years go bc cleared his throat and poured more wine weeks before blake had wondered what messages had passed between summer and his father now he had no trouble recognizing what wasnt being said between bc and monique he looked at his mother first and saw her calmly drinking champagne his father and summers mother when he wondered as he tried to digest it for as long as he could remember his parents had been devoted almost inseparable no abruptly he remembered a short turbulent time during his early teens the house had been full of tension arguments in undertones then bc had been gone for two weeks three a business trip his mother had told him but even then hed known better but it had been over so quickly hed rarely thought of it since now now he had a definite idea where his father had spent at least some of that time away from home and with whom he caught his fathers eye the uncomfortable halfdefiant look the man blake mused was certainly paying for a slip in fidelity that was two decades old he saw monique smile slowly just what the hell was she trying to stir up almost before the anger could fully form she laid a hand on his arm it was a gesture that asked him to wait to be patient then came another knock ah excuse me you would pour another glass monique asked bc we have one more guest tonight when she opened the door monique couldnt have been more pleased with her daughter the simple jade silk dress was soft narrow and subtly sexy it made her slight pallor very romantic cherie so good of you not to disappoint me i cant stay long mother i have to get some sleep she held out a pinkribboned box but i wanted to bring you a wedding gift so sweet monique brushed her lips over summers cheek and i have something for you something i hope youll always treasure stepping aside she drew summer in not like this summer thought desperately when the first shock of seeing blake again rippled through her shed wanted to be prepared rested confident she didnt want to see him here now and his parents one look at the woman beside blake and she knew she had to be bcs wife nothing else made sense moniques kind of sense your game isnt amusing mother she murmured in french on the contrary it might be the most important thing ive ever done bc she said in gay tones youve met my daughter oui yes indeed with a smile he handed summer a glass of champagne nice to see you again and blakes mother monique continued lillian may i present my only child summer im very pleased to meet you lillian took her hand warmly she wasnt blind and had seen the stunned look that had passed between her son and the actresss daughter thered been surprise longing and uncertainty if monique had set the stage for this lilian would do her best to help ive just been hearing that youre a chef and responsible for the new menu well be boasting of tomorrow yes she searched for something to say did you enjoy your sailing tahiti wasnt it we had a marvelous time even though bc tends to become captain bligh if you dont watch him nonsense he slipped his arm around his wifes shoulders this is the only woman id ever trust at the wheel of one of my ships they adore each other summer realized it and found it surprised her their marriage was nearing its fortieth year and obviously hadnt been without storms yet they adored each other its rather beautiful is it not when a husband and wife can share an interest and yet be separate people monique beamed at them then looked at blake you would agree that such things keep a man and woman together even when they have to struggle through hard times and misunderstandings i would he looked directly at summer its a matter of love and of respect and perhaps of optimism optimism monique clearly found the word perfect yes this i like i of course am always so perhaps too much ive had four husbands clearly too optimistic she laughed at herself but then i think i looked always first and perhaps only for romance would you say lillian that its a mistake not to look beyond that we all look for romance love passion she touched her husbands arm lightly in a gesture so natural neither of them noticed it then of course respect i suppose id have to add two things to that she looked up at her husband tolerance and tenacity marriage needs them all she knew as bc saw the look in his wifes eyes he realized shed always known for twenty years shed known excellent rather pleased with herself monique set her gift on the table this is the perfect time then to open a gift celebrating my marriage this time i intend to put all those things into it she wanted to leave summer told herself it was only a matter of turning around and walking to the door she stood rooted with her eyes locked on blakes oh but its beautiful reverently monique lifted the tiny handcrafted merrygoround from the bed of tissue the horses were ivory trimmed in gilt each one perfect each one unique at the turn of the base it played a romantic chopin prelude but darling how perfect a carousel to celebrate a marriage the horses should be named romance love tenacity and so forth i shall treasure it i summer looked at her mother and suddenly none of the practicalities none of the mistakes mattered be happy ma mere monique touched her cheek with a fingertip then brushed it with her lips and you mignonne bc leaned down to whisper in his wifes ear you know dont you amused she lifted her glass of course she answered in an undertone youve never been able to keep secrets from me but i knew then and hated you for almost a day do you remember whose fault it was i dont anymore god lily if youd known how guilty i was tonight i was nearly suffocating with good she said simply now you old fool lets get out of here so these children can iron things out monique she held out her hand and as hands met eyes met things passed between them that would never have to be said thank you for a lovely evening and my best wishes to you and your husband and mine to you with a smile reminiscent of the past she held out her arms to bc au revoir mon ami he accepted the embrace feeling like a man whod just been granted amnesty he wanted nothing more than to go up to his own suite and show his wife how much he loved her perhaps well have lunch tomorrow he said absently to the room at large good night monique began to giggle as the door shut behind him love it will always make me laugh so briskly she began to rewrap her gift and box it my bags are being held for me downstairs and my plane leaves in one hour an hour summer began but my business is done tucking the box under her arm she rose on her toes to kiss blake you have the good fortune of possessing excellent parents then she kissed summer and so my sweet do you though they werent suited to remain husband and wife the suite is paid for through the night the champagnes still cold she glided for the door leaving a trail of paris in her wake pausing in the doorway she looked back bon appetit mes enfants monique considered it one of her very finest exits when the door closed summer stood where she was unsure if she wanted to applaud or throw something quite a performance blake commented more wine she could be as urbane and casual as he all right and how was rome hot and your cake magnificent lifting her freshly filled glass she took two steps away it was always better to talk of the unimportant when so many urgent needs were pressing things running smoothly here amazingly so though i think everyonell be relieved that youre here for the first run tomorrow tell me he sipped his own wine approving it when did you first know that my father and your mother had had an affair that was blunt enough she thought well she would be equally blunt when it was happening i was only a child but children are astute you could say i suspected it then i was sure of it when i first mentioned my mothers name to your father he nodded remembering the meeting in his office just how much have you let that bother you it was awkward restlessly she moved her shoulders and you were determined not to let history repeat itself his perception was too often killingly accurate perhaps but then in a matter of speaking it did with another attempt at casualness she spread some caviar on a cracker but then neither of us was married as if it were only general cocktail talk blake chose a quiche you know why your mother did this tonight summer shook her head when he offered the tray monique could never resist a scene of any kind she set the stage brought in the players to show me i think that while marriage might not be perfect it can be durable was she successful when she didnt speak blake set down his glass it was time they stopped hedging time they stopped speaking in generalities there hasnt been an hour since the last time i saw you that i havent thought of you her eyes met his helplessly she shook her head blake i dont think you should damn it youre going to hear me out were good for each other you cant tell me you dont believe that maybe you were right before about the way i planned out my courtship he decided for a lack of a better word maybe i was too smug about it too sure that if i waited for just the right moment id have exactly what i wanted with the least amount of trouble i had to be sure or idve gone insane trying to give you enough time to see just what we could have together i was too hard that night she wrapped her arms around herself then dropped them to her sides i said things because you frightened me i didnt mean them not all of them summer he touched her cheek i meant everything i said that night i want you now as much as i wanted you the first time im here she stepped closer were alone the need twisted inside him i want to make love with you but not until i know what it is you want from me do you want only a few nights a few memories like our parents had together she turned away then i dont know how to explain tell me how you feel she took a moment to steady herself all right when i cook i take this ingredient and that i have my own hands my own skill and putting these together i make something perfect if i dont find it perfect i toss it out theres little patience in me she paused a moment wondering if he could possibly understand this kind of analogy ive thought that if i ever decided to become involved in a relationship there would be this ingredient and that and again id put them together but i knew it would never be perfect so she let out a long breath i wondered if that too would be something to toss out a relationship isnt something that has to be created in a day or perfected in a day part of the game is to keep working on it fifty years still isnt long enough a long time to work on something thatll always be just a little flawed too much of a challenge she whirled then stopped you know me too well she murmured too well for my own good maybe too well for your own youre wrong he said quietly you are my own good her mouth trembled open then closed please she managed i want to finish this when i was in rome i tried to tell myself that this was what i wanted to go back to flying here there without anyone to worry about but myself and the next dish i would create when i was in rome she added with a sigh i was more miserable than ive ever been in my life he couldnt prevent the grin sorry to hear it no i think youre not turning away she ran her fingertip around and around the rim of a champagne glass since she would only explain once she wanted to be certain she explained well on the plane i told myself that when i came back we would talk reasonably logically wed work the situation out in the best manner in my head i thought that would be a continuation of our relationship as it was intimacy without strings which is perhaps not intimacy at all she lifted the glass and sipped some of the cold frothy wine when i walked in here tonight and saw you i knew that would be impossible we cant see each other as we have been in the end that would damage us both youre not walking out of my life turning back she stood toetotoe with him i would if i could and damn it youre not the one whos stopping me its me none of your planning none of your logic couldve changed what was inside me only i could change it only what i feel could change it she took his hands she took a deep breath i want to ride that merrygoround with you and i want my shot at the brass ring his hands slid up her arms into her hair why just tell me why because sometime between the moment you walked in my front door and now i fell in love with you no matter how foolish it is i want to take a chance on that were going to win his mouth sought hers and when she trembled he knew it was as much from nerves as passion soon theyd face the passion now he would soothe the nerves if you like well take a trial period he began to roam her face with kisses we can even put it in contract form more practical trial she started to draw away from him but he held her close yes and if during the trial period either of us wants a divorce they simply have to wait until the end of the contract term her brows came together could he speak of business now would he dare her chin tilted challengingly how long is the contract term fifty years laughing she threw her arms around his neck deal i want it drawn up tomorrow in triplicate but tonight she began to nibble on his lips as she ran her hands beneath his jacket tonight were only lovers truly lovers now and the suite is ours till morning the kiss was long it was slow it was lingering remind me to send monique a case of champagne blake said as he lifted summer into his arms speaking of it leaning over a bit precariously she lifted the two halffull glasses from the table we shouldnt let it get flat and later she continued as he carried her toward the bedroom much later perhaps we can send out for pizza lessons learned chapter contents prev next so he was gorgeous and rich and talented and sexy you shouldnt forget that he was outrageously sexy it hardly mattered to juliet she was a professional and to a professional a job was a job in this case great looks and personality were bound to help but that was business strictly business no personally it didnt matter a bit after all shed met a few gorgeous men in her life shed met a few rich ones too and so forth though she had to admit shed never met a man with all those elusive qualities rolled up in one shed certainly never had the opportunity to work with one now she did the fact was carlo franconis looks charm reputation and skill were going to make her job a pleasure so she was told still with her office door closed juliet scowled down at the eightbyten glossy blackandwhite publicity photo it looked to her as though hed be more trouble than pleasure carlo grinned cockily up at her dark almondshaped eyes amused and appreciative she wondered if the photographer had been a woman his full thick hair was appealingly disheveled with a bit of curl along the nape of his neck and over his ears not too much just enough to disarm the strong facial bones jauntily curved mouth straight nose and expressive brows combined to create a face destined to sabotage any womans common sense gift or cultivated talent juliet wasnt certain but shed have to use it to her advantage author tours could be murder a cookbook juliet tried and failed not to sigh carlo franconis the italian way was whether she liked it or not her biggest assignment to date business was business she loved her job as publicist and was content for the moment with trinity press the publisher she currently worked for after a halfdozen job changes and upward jumps since the start of her career at twentyeight the ambition shed started with as a receptionist nearly ten years before had eased very little shed worked studied hustled and sweated for her own office and position she had them but she wasnt ready to relax in two years by her calculations shed be ready to make the next jump her own public relations firm naturally shed have to start out small but it was building the business that was exciting the contacts and experience she gained in her twenties would help her solidify her ambitions in her thirties juliet was content with that one of the first things shed learned in public relations was that an account was an account whether it was a big blockbuster bestseller already slated to be a big blockbuster film or a slim volume of poetry that would barely earn out its advance part of the challenge and the fun was finding the right promotional hook now she had a cookbook and a slick italian chef franconi she thought wryly had a track record with women and in publishing the first was a matter of hot interest to the society and gossip sections of the international press it wasnt necessary to cook to be aware of franconis name the second was the reason he was being pampered on the road with a publicist his first two cookbooks had been solid bestsellers for good reason juliet admitted it was true she couldnt fry an egg without creating a gooey inedible glob but she recognized quality and style franconi could make linguini sound like a dish to be prepared while wearing black lace he turned a simple spaghetti dish into an erotic event sex juliet tipped back in her chair and wiggled her stockinged toes thats what he had thats just what theyd use before the twentyoneday author tour was finished shell have made carlo franconi the worlds sexiest cook any redblooded american woman would fantasize about him preparing an intimate dinner for two candlelight pasta and romance one last study of his publicity shot and the charmingly crooked grin assured her he could handle it in the meantime there was a bit more groundwork to cover creating a schedule was a pleasure adhering to one a challenge she thrived on both juliet lifted the phone noticed with resignation that shed broken another nail then buzzed her assistant terry get me diane maxwell shes program coordinator on the simpson show in la going for the big guns juliet gave a quick unprofessional grin yeah she replaced the phone and started making hurried notes no reason not to start at the top she told herself that way if you fell on your face at least the trip would be worth it as she waited she looked around her office not the top but a good ways from the bottom at least she had a window juliet could still shudder thinking of some of the walledin cubicles shed worked in now twenty stories below new york rushed bumped pushed and shoved its way through another day juliet trent had learned how to do the same thing after moving from the relatively easygoing suburb of harrisburg pennsylvania she mightve grown up in a polite little neighborhood where only a stranger drove over twentyfive miles per hour and everyone kept the grass clipped close to their side of the chainlink fences but juliet had acclimated easily the truth was she liked the pace the energy and the i dare you tone of new york shed never go back to the beehumming hedgeclipping quiet of suburbia where everyone knew who you were what you did and how you did it she preferred the anonymity and the individuality of crowds perhaps her mother had molded herself into the perfect suburban wife but not juliet she was an eighties woman independent selfsufficient and moving up there was an apartment in the west seventies that shed furnished slowly meticulously and most important personally juliet had enough patience to move step by step as long as the result was perfect she had a career she could be proud of and an office she was gradually altering to suit her own tastes leaving her mark wasnt something she took lightly it had taken her four months to choose the right plants for her work space from the fourfoot splitleaf philodendron to the delicate whiteblossomed african violet shed had to make do with the beige carpet but the sixfoot dali print on the wall opposite her window added life and energy the narrowbeveled mirror gave an illusion of space and a touch of elegance she had her eye on a big gaudy oriental urn that would be perfect for a spray of equally gaudy peacock feathers if she waited a bit longer the price might come down from exorbitant to ridiculous then shed buy it juliet might put on a very practical front to everyone including herself but she couldnt resist a sale as a result her bank balance wasnt as hefty as her bedroom closet she wasnt frivolous no she would have been appalled to hear the word applied to her her wardrobe was organized well tended and suitable perhaps twenty pairs of shoes could be considered excessive but juliet rationalized that she was often on her feet ten hours a day and deserved the luxury in any case shed earned them from the sturdy sneakers the practical black pumps to the strappy evening sandals shed earned them with innumerable long meetings countless waits in airports and endless hours on the phone shed earned them on author tours where the luck of the draw could have you dealing with the brilliant the funny the inept the boring or the rude whatever she had to deal with the results had to be the same media media and more media shed learned how to deal with the press from the new york times reporter to the stringer on the smalltown weekly she knew how to charm the staff of talk shows from the accepted masters to the nervous imitators learning had been an adventure and since shed allowed herself very few in her personal life professional success was all the sweeter when the intercom buzzed she caught her tongue between her teeth now she was going to apply everything shed learned and land franconi on the toprated talk show in the states once she did she thought as she pressed the button hed better make the most of it or shed slit his sexy throat with his own chefs knife ah mi amore squisito carlos voice was a low purr designed to accelerate the blood pressure the bedroom voice wasnt something hed had to develop but something hed been born with carlo had always thought a man who didnt use godgiven gifts was less than a fool bellisimo he murmured and his eyes were dark and dreamy with anticipation it was hot almost steamy but he preferred the heat cold slowed down the blood the sun coming through the window had taken on the subtle gold texture with tints of red that spoke of the end of the day and hinted at the pleasures of night the room was rich with scent so he breathed it in a man was missing a great deal of life if he didnt use and appreciate all of his senses carlo believed in missing nothing he watched his love of the moment with a connoisseurs eye hed caress whisper to flatter it never mattered to him if it took moments or hours to get what he wanted as long as he got what he wanted to carlo the process the anticipation the moves themselves were equally as satisfying as the result like a dance hed always thought like a song an aria from the marriage of figaro played in the background while he seduced carlo believed in setting the scene because life was a play not simply to be enjoyed but to be relished bellisimo he whispered and bent nearer what he adored the clam sauce simmered erotically as he stirred it slowly savoring the moment carlo lifted the spoon to his lips and with his eyes halfclosed tasted the sound of pleasure came from low in his throat squisito he moved from the sauce to give the same loving attention to his zabaglione he believed there wasnt a woman alive who could resist the taste of that rich creamy custard with the zing of wine as usual it was a woman he was expecting the kitchen was as much a den of pleasure to him as the bedroom it wasnt an accident that he was one of the most respected and admired chefs in the world or that he was one of the most engaging lovers carlo considered it a matter of destiny his kitchen was cleverly arranged as meticulously laid out for the seduction of sauces and spices as his bedroom was for the seduction of women yes carlo franconi believed life was to be relished every drop of it when the knock on the front door reverberated through the highceilinged rooms of his home he murmured to his pasta before he removed his apron as he went to answer he rolled down the silk sleeves of his shirt but didnt stop for adjustments in any of the antique mirrors that lined the walls he wasnt so much vain as confident he opened the door to a tall stately woman with honeytoned skin and dark glossy eyes carlos heart moved as it did whenever he saw her mi amore taking her hand he pressed his mouth to the palm while his eyes smiled into hers bella molto bella she stood in the evening light for a moment dark lovely with a smile only for him only a fool wouldnt have known hed welcomed dozens of women in just this way she wasnt a fool but she loved him youre a scoundrel carlo the woman reached out to touch his hair it was dark and thick and difficult to resist is this the way you greet your mother this is the way he kissed her hand again i greet a beautiful woman then he wrapped both arms around her and kissed her cheeks this is the way i greet my mother its a fortunate man who can do both gina franconi laughed as she returned her sons hug to you all women are beautiful but only one is my mother with his arm around her waist he led her inside gina approved as always the fact that his home was spotless if a bit too exotic for her taste she often wondered how the poor maid managed to keep the ornately carved archways dusted and polished and the hundreds of windowpanes unstreaked because she was a woman whod spent fifteen years of her life cleaning other peoples homes and forty cleaning her own she thought of such things she studied one of his new acquisitions a threefoot ivory owl with a small rodent captured in one claw a good wife gina mused would guide her sons tastes toward less eccentric paths an aperitif mama carlo walked over to a tall smokedglass cabinet and drew out a slim black bottle you should try this he told her as he chose two small glasses and poured a friend sent it to me gina set aside her red snakeskin bag and accepted the glass the first sip was hot potent smooth as a lovers kiss and just as intoxicating she lifted a brow as she took the second sip excellent yes it is anna has excellent taste anna she thought with more amusement than exasperation shed learned years before that it didnt do any good to be exasperated with a man especially if you loved him are all your friends women carlo no he held his glass up twirling it but this one was she sent me this as a wedding present a her wedding carlo said with a grin she wanted a husband and though i couldnt accommodate her we parted friends he held up the bottle as proof did you have it analyzed before you drank any gina asked dryly he touched the rim of his glass to hers a clever man turns all former lovers into friends mama youve always been clever with a small movement of her shoulders she sipped again and sat down i hear youre seeing the french actress as always your hearings excellent as if it interested her gina studied the hue of the liqueur in her glass she is of course beautiful of course i dont think shell give me grandchildren carlo laughed and sat beside her you have six grandchildren and another coming mama dont be greedy but none from my son my only son she reminded him with a tap of her finger on his shoulder still i havent given you up yet perhaps if i could find a woman like you she shot him back arrogant look for arrogant look impossible caro his feeling exactly carlo thought as he guided her into talk about his four sisters and their families when he looked at this sleek lovely woman it was difficult to think of her as the mother whod raised him almost singlehandedly shed worked and though shed been known to storm and rage shed never complained her clothes had been carefully mended her floors meticulously scrubbed while his father had spent endless months at sea when he concentrated and he rarely did carlo could recall an impression of a dark wiry man with a black mustache and an easy grin the impression didnt bring on resentment or even regret his father had been a seaman before his parents had married and a seaman hed remained carlos belief in meeting your destiny was unwavering but while his feelings for his father were ambivalent his feelings for his mother were set and strong shed supported each of her childrens ambitions and when carlo had earned a scholarship to the sorbonne in paris and the opportunity to pursue his interest in haute cuisine shed let him go ultimately shed supplemented the meager income he could earn between studies with part of the insurance money shed received when her husband had been lost in the sea hed loved six years before carlo had been able to pay her back in his own way the dress shop hed bought for her birthday had been a lifelong dream for both of them for him it was a way of seeing his mother happy at last for gina it was a way to begin again hed grown up in a big boisterous emotional family it gave him pleasure to look back and remember a man who grows up in a family of women learns to understand them appreciate them admire them carlo knew about womens dreams their vanities their insecurities he never took a lover he didnt have affection for as well as desire if there was only desire he knew thered be no friendship at the end only resentment even now the comfortable affair he was having with the french actress was ending shed be starting a film in a few weeks and hed be going on tour in america that carlo thought with some regret would be that carlo you go to america soon hmm yes he wondered if shed read his mind knowing women were capable of doing so two weeks youll do me a favor of course then notice for me what the professional american woman is wearing im thinking of adding some things to the shop the americans are so clever and practical not too practical i hope he swirled his drink my publicist is a ms trent tipping back his glass he accepted the heat and the punch ill promise you to study every aspect of her wardrobe she gave his quick grin a steady look youre so good to me carlo but of course mama now im going to feed you like a queen carlo had no idea what juliet trent looked like but put himself in the hands of fate what he did know from the letters hed received from her was that juliet trent was the type of american his mother had described practical and clever excellent qualities in a publicist physically was another matter but again as his mother had said carlo could always find beauty in a woman perhaps he did prefer in his personal life a woman with a lovely shell but he knew how to dig beneath to find inner beauty it was something that made life interesting as well as aesthetically pleasing still as he stepped off the plane into the terminal in la he had his hand on the elbow of a stunning redhead juliet did know what he looked like and she first saw him shoulder to shoulder with a luxuriously built woman in pencilthin heels though he carried a bulky leather case in one hand and a flight bag over his shoulder he escorted the redhead through the gate as though they were walking into a ballroom or a bedroom juliet took a quick assessment of the welltailored slacks the unstructured jacket and opencollared shirt the wellheeled traveler there was a chunk of gold and diamond on his finger that shouldve looked ostentatious and vulgar somehow it looked as casual and breezy as the rest of him she felt formal and sticky shed been in la since the evening before giving herself time to see personally to all the tiny details carlo franconi would have nothing to do but be charming answer questions and sign his cookbook as she watched him kiss the redheads knuckles juliet thought hed be signing plenty of them after all didnt women do the majority of cookbook buying carefully smoothing away a sarcastic smirk juliet rose the redhead was sending one last wistful look over her shoulder as she walked away mr franconi carlo turned away from the woman whod proven to be a pleasant traveling companion on the long flight from new york his first look at juliet brought a quick flutter of interest and a subtle tug of desire he often felt with a woman it was a tug he could either control or let loose as was appropriate this time he savored it she didnt have merely a lovely face but an interesting one her skin was very pale which should have made her seem fragile but the wide strong cheekbones undid the air of fragility and gave her face an intriguing diamond shape her eyes were large heavily lashed and artfully accented with a smoky shadow that only made the cool green shade of the irises seem cooler her mouth was only lightly touched with a peachcolored gloss it had a full eyedrawing shape that needed no artifice he gathered she was wise enough to know it her hair was caught somewhere between brown and blond so that its shade was soft natural and subtle she wore it long enough in the back to be pinned up in a chignon when she wished and short enough on the top and sides so that she could style it from fussy to practical as the occasion and her whim demanded at the moment it was loose and casual but not windblown shed stopped in the ladies room for a quick check just after the incoming flight had been announced im juliet trent she told him when she felt hed stared long enough welcome to california as he took the hand she offered she realized she shouldve expected him to kiss it rather than shake still she stiffened hardly more than an instant but she saw by the lift of brow hed felt it a beautiful woman makes a man welcome anywhere his voice was incredible the cream that rose to the top and then flowed over something rich she told herself it only pleased her because it would record well and took his statement literally thinking of the redhead she gave him an easy not entirely friendly smile then you must have had a pleasant flight his native language might have been italian but carlo understood nuances in any tongue he grinned at her very pleasant and tiring she said remembering her position your luggage should be in by now again she glanced at the large case he carried can i take that for you his brow lifted at the idea of a man dumping his burden on a woman equality to carlo never crossed the border into manners no this is something i always carry myself indicating the way she fell into step beside him its a halfhour ride to the beverly wilshire but after youve settled in you can rest all afternoon id like to go over tomorrows schedule with you this evening he liked the way she walked though she wasnt tall she moved in long unhurried strides that made the red sidepleated skirt she wore shift over her hips over dinner she sent him a quick sidelong look if you like shed be at his disposal juliet reminded herself for the next three weeks without appearing to think about it she skirted around a barrelchested man hefting a bulging garment bag and a briefcase yes he liked the way she walked carlo thought again she was a woman who could take care of herself without a great deal of fuss at seven you have a talk show in the morning that starts at seventhirty so wed best make it an early evening seventhirty am carlo thought only briefly about jet lag and time changes so you put me to work quickly thats what im here for mr franconi juliet said it cheerfully as she stepped up to the slowly moving baggage belt you have your stubs an organized woman he thought as he reached into the inside pocket of his loosefitting buffcolored jacket in silence he handed them to her then hefted a pullman and a garment bag from the belt himself gucci she observed so he had taste as well as money juliet handed the stubs to a skycap and waited while carlos luggage was loaded onto the pushcart i think youll be pleased with what we have for you mr franconi she walked through the automatic doors and signaled for her limo i know youve always worked with jim collins in the past on your tours in the states he sends his best does jim like his executive position apparently though carlo expected her to climb into the limo first she stepped back with a bow to women professionals carlo ducked inside and took his seat do you like yours ms trent she took the seat across from him then sent him a straightshooting level look juliet could have no idea how much he admired it yes i do carlo stretched out his legs legs his mother had once said that had refused to stop growing long after it was necessary hed have preferred driving himself particularly after the long long flight from rome where someone else had been at the controls but if he couldnt the plush laziness of the limo was the next best thing reaching over he switched on the stereo so that mozart poured out quiet but vibrant if hed been driving it wouldve been rock loud and rambunctious youve read my book ms trent yes of course i couldnt set up publicity and promotion for an unknown product she sat back it was easy to do her job when she could speak the simple truth i was impressed with the attention to detail and the clear directions it seemed a very friendly book rather than simply a kitchen tool hmm he noticed her stockings were very pale pink and had a tiny line of dots up one side it would interest his mother that the practical american businesswoman could enjoy the frivolous it interested him that juliet trent could have you tried any of the recipes no i dont cook you dont his lazy interest came to attention at all she had to smile he looked so sincerely shocked as he watched the perfect mouth curve he had to put the next tug of desire in check when youre a failure at something mr franconi you leave it to someone else i could teach you the idea intrigued him he never offered his expertise lightly to cook she laughed relaxing enough to let her heel slip out of her shoe as she swung her foot i dont think so im an excellent teacher he said with a slow smile again she gave him the calm gunslinger look i dont doubt it i on the other hand am a poor student your age when her look narrowed he smiled charmingly a rude question when a womans reached a certain stage you havent twentyeight she said so coolly his smile became a grin you look younger but your eyes are older id find it a pleasure to give you a few lessons ms trent she believed him she too understood nuances a pity our schedule wont permit it he shrugged easily and glanced out the window but the la freeway didnt interest him you put philadelphia in the schedule as i requested well have a full day there before we fly up to boston then well finish up in new york good i have a friend there i havent seen her in nearly a year juliet was certain he had friends everywhere youve been to los angeles before he asked her yes several times on business ive yet to come here for pleasure myself what do you think of it as he had she glanced out the window without interest i prefer new york why more grit less gloss he liked her answer and her phrasing because of it he studied her more closely have you ever been to rome no he thought he heard just a trace of wistfulness in her voice i havent been to europe at all when you do come to rome it was built on grit her mind drifted a bit as she thought of it and her smile remained i think of fountains and marble and cathedrals youll find them and more she had a face exquisite enough to be carved in marble he thought a voice quiet and smooth enough for cathedrals rome rose and fell and clawed its way back up again an intelligent woman understands such things a romantic woman understands the fountains she glanced out again as the limo pulled up in front of the hotel im afraid im not very romantic a woman named juliet hasnt a choice my mothers selection she pointed out not mine you dont look for romeo juliet gathered her briefcase no mr franconi i dont he stepped out ahead of her and offered his hand when juliet stood on the curb he didnt move back to give her room instead he experimented with the sensation of bodies brushing lightly even politely on a public street her gaze came up to his not wary but direct he felt it the pull not the tug that was impersonal and for any woman but the pull that went straight to the gut and was for one woman so hed have to taste her mouth after all he was a man compelled to judge a great deal by taste but he could also bide his time some creations took a long time and had complicated preparations to perfect like juliet he insisted on perfection some women he murmured never need to look only to evade and avoid and select some women she said just as quietly choose not to select at all deliberately she turned her back on him to pay off the driver ive already checked you in mr franconi she said over her shoulder as she handed his key to the waiting bellboy im just across the hall from your suite without looking at him juliet followed the bellboy into the hotel and to the elevators if it suits you ill make reservations here in the hotel for dinner at seven you can just tap on my door when youre ready with a quick check of her watch she calculated the time difference and figured she could make three calls to new york and one to dallas before office hours were over farther east if you need anything youve only to order it and charge it to the room she stepped from the elevator unzipping her purse and pulling out her own room key as she walked im sure youll find your suite suitable he watched her brisk economic movements im sure i will seven oclock then she was already pushing her key into the lock as the bellboy opened the first door to the suite across the hall as she did her mind was already on the calls shed make the moment shed shed her jacket and shoes juliet she paused her hair swinging back as she looked over her shoulder at carlo he held her there a moment longer in silence dont change your scent he murmured sex without flowers femininity without vulnerability it suits you while she continued to stare over her shoulder he disappeared inside the suite the bellboy began his polite introductions to the accommodations of the suite something carlo said caused him to break off and laugh juliet turned her key with more strength than necessary pushed open her door then closed it again with the length of her body for a minute she just leaned there waiting for her system to level professional training had prevented her from stammering and fumbling and making a fool of herself professional training had helped her to keep her nerves just at the border where they could be controlled and concealed still under the training there was a woman control had cost her juliet was dead certain there wasnt a woman alive who would be totally unaffected by carlo franconi it wasnt balm for her ego to admit she was simply part of a large varied group hed never know it she told herself but her pulse had been behaving badly since hed first taken her hand it was still behaving badly stupid she told herself and threw her bag down on a chair then she thought it best if she followed it her legs werent steady yet juliet let out a long deep breath shed just have to wait until they were so he was gorgeous and rich and talented and outrageously sexy shed already known that hadnt she the trouble was she wasnt sure how to handle him not nearly as sure as she had to be chapter contents prev next she was a woman who thrived on tight scheduling minute details and small crises these were the things that kept you alert sharp and interested if her job had been simple there wouldnt have been much fun to it she was also a woman who liked long lazy baths in mountains of bubbles and big big beds these were the things that kept you sane juliet felt shed earned the second after shed dealt with the first while carlo amused himself in his own way juliet spent an hour and a half on the phone then another hour revising and finetuning the next days itinerary a print interview had come through and had to be shuffled in she shuffled another paper was sending a reporter and photographer to the book signing their names had to be noted and remembered juliet noted circled and committed to memory the way things were shaping up theyd be lucky to manage a twohour breather the next day nothing couldve pleased her more by the time shed closed her thick leatherbound notebook she was more than ready for the tub the bed unfortunately would have to wait ten oclock she promised herself by ten shed be in bed snuggled in curled up and unconscious she soaked designating precisely fortyfive minutes for her personal time in the bath she didnt plot or plan or estimate she clicked off the busy business end of her brain and enjoyed relaxing it took the first ten minutes to accomplish that completely dreaming she could pretend the white standardsize tub was luxurious large and lush black marble perhaps and big enough for two it was a secret ambition of juliets to own one like it eventually the symbol she felt of ultimate success shed have bristled if anyone had called her goal romantic practical shed insist when you worked hard you needed a place to unwind this was hers her robe hung on the back of the door jade green teasingly brief and silk not a luxury as far as she was concerned but a necessity when you often had only short snatches to relax you needed all the help you could get she considered the robe as much an aid in keeping pace as the bottles of vitamins that lined the counter by the sink when she traveled she always took them after shed relaxed and dreamed a bit she could appreciate soft hot water against her skin silky bubbles hissing steam rising rich with scent hed told her not to change her scent juliet scowled as she felt the muscles in her shoulders tense oh no deliberately she picked up the tiny cake of hotel soap and rubbed it up and down her arms oh no she wouldnt let carlo franconi intrude on her personal time that was rule number one hed purposely tried to unravel her hed succeeded yes he had succeeded juliet admitted with a stubborn nod but that was over now she wouldnt let it happen again her job was to promote his book not his ego to promote shed go above and beyond the call of duty with her time her energy and her skill but not with her emotions franconi wasnt flying back to rome in three weeks with a smug smile on his face unless it was professionally generated that instant knifesharp attraction would be dealt with priorities juliet mused were the order of the day he could add all the american conquests to his list he chose as long as she wasnt among them in any case he didnt seriously interest her it was simply that basic primal urge certainly there wasnt any intellect involved she preferred a different kind of man steady rather than flashy sincere rather than charming that was the kind of man a woman of common sense looked for when the time was right juliet judged the time would be right in about three years by then shed have established the structure for her own firm shed be financially independent and creatively content yes in three years shed be ready to think about a serious relationship that would fit her schedule nicely settled she decided and closed her eyes it was a nice comfortable word but the hot water bubbles and steam didnt relax her any longer a bit resentful she released the plug and stood up to let the water drain off her the wide mirror above the counter and sink was fogged but only lightly through the mist she could see juliet trent odd she thought how pale and soft and vulnerable a naked woman could look in her mind she was strong practical even tough but she could see in the damp misty mirror the fragility even the wistfulness erotic juliet frowned a bit as she told herself she shouldnt be disappointed that her body had been built on slim practical lines rather than round and lush ones she should be grateful that her long legs got her where she was going and her narrow hips helped keep her silhouette in a business suit trim and efficient erotic would never be a career plus without makeup her face looked too young too trusting without careful grooming her hair looked too wild too passionate fragile young passionate juliet shook her head not qualities for a professional woman it was fortunate that clothes and cosmetics could play down or play up certain aspects grabbing a towel she wrapped it around herself then taking another she wiped the steam from the mirror no more mists she thought to succeed you had to see clearly with a glance at the tubes and bottles on the counter she began to create the professional ms trent because she hated quiet hotel rooms juliet switched on the television as she started to dress the old bogartbacall movie pleased her and was more relaxing than a dozen bubble baths she listened to the wellknown dialogue while she drew on her smokecolored stockings she watched the shimmering restrained passion as she adjusted the straps of a sheer black teddy while the plot twisted and turned she zipped on the narrow black dress and knotted the long strand of pearls under her breasts caught up she sat on the edge of the bed running a brush through her hair as she watched she was smiling absorbed distracted but it wouldve shocked her if anyone had said she was romantic when the knock sounded at her door she glanced at her watch shed lost fifteen minutes dawdling to make up for it juliet had her shoes on her earrings clipped and her bag and notebook at hand in twelve seconds flat she went to the door ready with a greeting and an apology a rose just one the color of a young girls blush when carlo handed it to her she didnt have anything to say at all carlo however had no problem bella he had her hand to his lips before shed thought to counter the move some women look severe or cold in black others his survey was long and male but his smile made it gallant rather than calculating in others it simply enhances their femininity im disturbing you no no of course not i was just ah i know this movie without waiting for an invitation he breezed past her into the room the standard single hotel room didnt seem so impersonal any longer how could it he brought life energy passion into the air as if it were his mission yes ive seen it many times the two strong faces dominated the screen bogarts creased heavyeyed weary bacalls smooth steamy and challenging passione he murmured and made the word seem like honey to be tasted incredibly juliet found herself swallowing a man and a woman can bring many things to each other but without passion everything else is tame si juliet recovered herself franconi wasnt a man to discuss passion with the subject wouldnt remain academic for long perhaps she adjusted her evening bag and her notebook but she didnt put the rose down weve a lot to discuss over dinner mr franconi wed best get started with his thumbs still hooked in the pockets of his taupe slacks he turned his head juliet figured hundreds of women had trusted that smile she wouldnt with a careless flick he turned off the television yes its time we started what did he think of her carlo asked himself the question and let the answer come in snatches twined through the evening lovely he didnt consider his affection for beautiful women a weakness he was grateful that juliet didnt find the need to play down or turn her natural beauty into severity nor did she exploit it until it was artificial shed found a pleasing balance he could admire that she was ambitious but he admired that as well beautiful women without ambition lost his interest quickly she didnt trust him that amused him as he drank his second glass of beaujolais he decided her wariness was a compliment in his estimation a woman like juliet would only be wary of a man if she were attracted in some way if he were honest and he was hed admit that most women were attracted to him it seemed only fair as he was attracted to them short tall plump thin old or young he found women a fascination a delight an amusement he respected them perhaps only as a man who had grown up surrounded by women could do but respect didnt mean he couldnt enjoy he was going to enjoy juliet hello la is on first tomorrow juliet ran down her notes while carlo nibbled on pate its the toprated morning talk show on the coast not just in la liz marks hosts shes very personable not too bubbly los angeles doesnt want bubbly at am thank god in any case she has a copy of the book its important that you get the title in a couple of times if she doesnt you have the full twenty minutes so it shouldnt be a problem youll be autographing at books incorporated on wilshire boulevard between one and three hastily she made herself a note to contact the store in the morning for a last check youll want to plug that but ill remind you just before airtime of course youll want to mention that youre beginning a twentyoneday tour of the country here in california mmmhmm the pate is quite passable would you like some no thanks just go ahead she checked off her list and reached for her wine without looking at him the restaurant was quiet and elegant but it didnt matter if theyd been in a loud crowded bar on the strip shed still have gone on with her notes right after the morning show we go to a radio spot then well have brunch with a reporter from the times youve already had an article in the trib ive got a clipping for you youd want to mention your other two books but concentrate on the new one it wouldnt hurt to bring up some of the major cities well hit denver dallas chicago new york then theres the autographing a spot on the evening news and dinner with two book reps the next day one day at a time he said easily ill be less likely to snarl at you all right she closed her notebook and sipped at her wine again after all its my job to see to the details yours to sign books and be charming he touched his glass to hers then neither of us should have a problem being charming is my life was he laughing at himself she wondered or at her from what ive seen you excel at it a gift cara those dark deepset eyes were amused and exciting unlike a skill thats developed and trained so he was laughing at both of them she realized it would be both difficult and wise not to like him for it when her steak was served juliet glanced at it carlo however studied his veal as though it were a fine old painting no juliet realized after a moment he studied it as though it were a young beautiful woman appearances he told her in food as in people are essential he was smiling at her when he cut into the veal and as in people they can be deceiving juliet watched him sample the first bite slowly his eyes halfclosed she felt an odd chill at the base of her spine hed sample a woman the same way she was certain slowly pleasant he said after a moment no more no less she couldnt prevent the quick smirk as she cut into her steak yours is better of course he moved his shoulders a statement of arrogance of course like comparing a pretty young girl with a beautiful woman when she glanced up he was holding out his fork over it his eyes studied her taste he invited and the simple word made her blood shiver nothing should ever go untasted juliet she shrugged letting him feed her the tiny bite of veal it was spicy just bordering on rich and hot on her tongue its good good si nothing franconi prepares is ever merely good good id pour into the garbage feed to the dogs in the alley she laughed delighting him if something isnt special then its ordinary true enough without realizing it she slipped out of her shoes but then i suppose ive always looked at food as a basic necessity necessity carlo shook his head though hed heard such sentiment before he still considered it a sacrilege oh madonna you have much to learn when one knows how to eat how to appreciate its second only to making love scents textures tastes to eat only to fill your stomach barbaric sorry juliet took another bite of steak it was tender and cooked well but it was only a piece of meat shed never have considered it sensual or romantic but simply filling is that why you became a cook because you think foods sexy he winced chef cara mia she grinned showing him for the first time a streak of humor and mischief whats the difference whats the difference between a plow horse and a thoroughbred plaster and porcelain enjoying herself she touched her tongue to the rim of her glass some might say dollar signs no no no my love money is only a result not a cause a cook makes hamburgers in a greasy kitchen that smells of onions behind a counter where people squeeze plastic bottles of ketchup a chef creates he gestured a circle of a hand an experience she lifted her glass and swept her lashes down but she didnt hide the smile i see though he could be offended by a look when he chose and be ruthless with the offender carlo liked her style youre amused but you havent tasted franconi he waited until her eyes both wry and wary lifted to him yet he had a talent for turning the simplest statement into something erotic she observed it would be a challenge to skirt around him without giving way but you havent told me why you became a chef i cant paint or sculpt i havent the patience or the talent to compose sonnets there are other ways to create to embrace art she saw with surprise mixed with respect that he was quite serious but paintings sculpture and poetry remain centuries after theyve been created if you make a soufflé its here then its gone then the challenge is to make it again and again art neednt be put behind glass or bronzed juliet merely appreciated i have a friend he thought of summer lyndon no summer cocharan now she makes pastries like an angel when you eat one youre a king then is cooking magic or art both like love and i think you juliet trent eat much too little she met his look as hed hoped she would i dont believe in overindulgence mr franconi it leads to carelessness to indulgence then he lifted his glass the smile was back charming and dangerous carefully anything and everything could go wrong you had to expect it anticipate it and avoid it juliet knew just how much could be botched in a twentyminute live interview at am on a monday you hoped for the best and made do with the not too bad even she didnt expect perfection on the first day of a tour it wasnt easy to explain why she was annoyed when she got it the morning spot went beautifully there was no other way to describe it juliet decided as she watched liz marks talk and laugh with carlo after the camera stopped taping if a shrewd operator could be called a natural carlo was indeed a natural during the interview hed subtly and completely dominated the show while charmingly blinding his host to it twice hed made the tenyear veteran of morning talk shows giggle like a girl once once juliet remembered with astonishment shed seen the woman blush yeah she shifted the strap of her heavy briefcase on her arm franconi was a natural it was bound to make her job easier she yawned and cursed him juliet always slept well in hotel rooms always except for last night she mightve been able to convince someone else that too much coffee and firstday jitters had kept her awake but she knew better she could drink a pot of coffee at ten and fall asleep on command at eleven her system was very disciplined except for last night shed nearly dreamed of him if she hadnt shaken herself awake at am she would have dreamed of him that was no way to begin a very important very long author tour she told herself now if she had to choose between some silly fantasies and honest fatigue shed take the fatigue stifling another yawn juliet checked her watch liz had her arm tucked through carlos and looked as though shed keep it there unless someone pried her loose with a sigh juliet decided shed have to be the crowbar ms marks it was a wonderful show as she crossed over juliet deliberately held out her hand with obvious reluctance liz disengaged herself from carlo and accepted it thank you miss trent juliet supplied without a waver juliet is my publicist carlo told liz though the two women had been introduced less than an hour earlier she guards my schedule yes and im afraid ill have to rush mr franconi along he has a radio spot in a halfhour if you must juliet was easily dismissed as liz turned back to carlo you have a delightful way of starting the morning a pity you wont be in town longer a pity carlo agreed and kissed lizs fingers like an old movie juliet thought impatiently all they needed were violins thank you again ms marks juliet used her most diplomatic smile as she took carlos arm and began to lead him out of the studio after all shed very likely need liz marks again were in a bit of a hurry she muttered as they worked their way back to the reception area the taping was over and she had other fish to fry this radio shows one of the toprated in the city since it leans heavily on top forties and classic rock its audience at this time of day falls mainly in the eighteen to thirtyfive range excellent buying power that gives us a nice mix with the audience from this mornings show which is generally in the twentyfive to fifty primarily female category listening with all apparent respect carlo reached the waiting limo first and opened the door himself you consider this important of course because she was distracted by what she thought was a foolish question juliet climbed into the limo ahead of him weve a solid schedule in la and she didnt see the point in mentioning there were some cities on the tour where they wouldnt be quite so busy a morning talk show with a good reputation a popular radio show two print interviews two quick spots on the evening news and the simpson show she said the last with a hint of relish the simpson show offset what she was doing to the budget with limos so youre pleased yes of course digging into her briefcase she took out her folder to recheck the name of her contact at the radio station then why do you look so annoyed i dont know what youre talking about you get a line right here he said as he ran a fingertip between her eyebrows at the touch juliet jerked back before she could stop herself carlo only cocked his head watching her you may smile and speak in a quiet polite voice but that line gives you away i was very pleased with the taping she said again but all right she thought he was asking for it perhaps it annoys me to see a woman making a fool of herself juliet stuffed the folder back into her briefcase liz marks is married you know wedding rings are things i try to be immediately aware of he said with a shrug your instructions were to be charming werent they perhaps charm has a different meaning in italy as i said you must come to rome i suppose you enjoy having women drooling all over you he smiled at her easy attractive innocent but of course a gurgle of laughter bubbled in her throat but she swallowed it she wouldnt be charmed youll have to deal with some men on this tour as well i promise not to kiss simpsons fingers this time the laughter escaped for a moment she relaxed with it let it come carlo saw too briefly the youth and energy beneath the discipline hed like to have kept her like that longer laughing at ease with him and with herself it would be a challenge he mused to find the right sequence of buttons to push to bring laughter to her eyes more often he liked challenges particularly when there was a woman connected to them juliet her name flowed off his tongue in a way only the european male had mastered you mustnt worry your tidily married liz only enjoyed a mild flirtation with a man shell more than likely never see again harmless perhaps because of it shell find more romance with her husband tonight juliet eyed him a moment in her straighton nononsense manner you think quite of lot of yourself dont you he grinned not sure if he was relieved or if he regretted the fact that hed never met anyone like her before no more than is warranted cam anyone who has character leaves a mark on another would you like to leave the world without making a ripple no no that was one thing she was determined not to do she sat back determined to hold her own i suppose some of us insist on leaving more ripples than others he nodded i dont like to do anything in a small way be careful mr franconi or youll begin to believe your own image the limo had stopped but before juliet could scoot toward the door carlo had her hand when she looked at him this time she didnt see the affable amorous italian chef but a man of power a man she realized who was well aware of how far it could take him she didnt move but wondered how many other women had seen the steel beneath the silk i dont need imagery juliet his voice was soft charming beautiful she heard the razorblade cut beneath it franconi is franconi take me for what you see or go to the devil smoothly he climbed from the limo ahead of her turned and took her hand drawing her out with him it was a move that was polite respectful even ordinary it was a move juliet realized that expressed their positions man to woman the moment she stood on the curb she removed her hand with two shows and a business brunch under their belts juliet left carlo in the bookstore already swamped with women crowded in line for a glimpse at and a few words with carlo franconi theyd handled the reporter and photographer already and a man like franconi wouldnt need her help with a crowd of women armed with change and her credit card she went to find a pay phone for the first fortyfive minutes she spoke with her assistant in new york filling her pad with times dates and names while la traffic whisked by outside the phone booth as a bead of sweat trickled down her back she wondered if shed chosen the hottest corner in the city denver still didnt look as promising as shed hoped but dallas juliet caught her bottom lip between her teeth as she wrote dallas was going to be fabulous she might need to double her daily dose of vitamins to get through that twentyfourhour stretch but it would be fabulous after breaking her connection with new york juliet dialed her first contact in san francisco ten minutes later she was clenching her teeth no her contact at the department store couldnt help coming down with a virus she was sorry genuinely sorry he was ill but did he have to get sick without leaving someone behind with a couple of working brain cells the young girl with the squeaky voice knew about the cooking demonstration yes she knew all about it and wasnt it going to be fun extension cords oh my she really didnt know a thing about that maybe she could ask someone in maintenance a table chairs well golly she supposed she could get something if it was really necessary juliet was reaching in her bag for her pursesize container of aspirin before it was over the way it looked now shed have to get to the department store at least two hours before the demonstration to make sure everything was taken care of that meant juggling the schedule after completing her calls juliet left the corner phone booth aspirin in hand and headed back to the bookstore hoping they could give her a glass of water and a quiet corner no one noticed her if shed just crawled in from the desert on her belly no one would have noticed her the small rather elegant bookstore was choked with laughter no bookseller stood behind the counter there was a magnet in the lefthand corner of the room its name was franconi it wasnt just women this time juliet noticed with interest there were men sprinkled in the crowd some of them might have been dragged along by their wives but they were having a time of it now it looked like a cocktail party minus the cigarette smoke and empty glasses she couldnt even see him juliet realized as she worked her way toward the back of the store he was surrounded enveloped jingling the aspirin in her hand she was glad she could find a little corner by herself perhaps he got all the glory she mused but she wouldnt trade places with him glancing at her watch she noted he had another hour and wondered whether he could dwindle the crowd down in the amount of time she wished vaguely for a stool dropped the aspirin in the pocket of her skirt and began to browse fabulous isnt he juliet heard someone murmur on the other side of a book rack god yes im so glad you talked me into coming whatre friends for i thought id be bored to death i feel like a kid at a rock concert hes got such style the other voice supplied if a man like that ever walked into my life he wouldnt walk out again curious juliet walked around the stacks she wasnt sure what she expected young housewives college students what she saw were two attractive women in their thirties both dressed in sleek professional suits ive got to get back to the office one woman checked a trim little rolex watch ive got a meeting at three ive got to get back to the courthouse both women tucked their autographed books into leather briefcases how come none of the men i date can kiss my hand without making it seem like a staged move in a oneact play style it all has to do with style with this observation or complaint the two women disappeared into the crowd at threefifteen he was still signing but the crowd had thinned enough that juliet could see him style she was forced to agree he had no one who came up to his table book in hand was given a quick signature practiced smile and brushoff he talked to them enjoyed them juliet corrected whether it was a grandmother who smelled of lavender or a young woman with a toddler on her hip how did he know the right thing to say to each one of them she wondered that made them leave the table with a laugh or a smile or a sigh first day of the tour she reminded herself she wondered if he could manage to keep himself up to this level for three weeks time would tell she decided and calculated she could give him another fifteen minutes before she began to ease him out the door even with the halfhour extension it wasnt easy juliet began to see the pattern she was certain would set the pace of the tour carlo would charm and delight and she would play the less attractive role of drill sergeant thats what she was paid for juliet reminded herself as she began to smile chat and urge people toward the door by four there were only a handful of stragglers with apologies and an iron grip juliet disengaged carlo that went very well she began nudging him onto the street one of the booksellers told me theyd nearly sold out makes you wonder how much pastas going to be cooked in la tonight consider this just one more triumph today grazie prego however we wont always have the leeway to run an hour over she told him as the door of the limo shut behind her it would help if you try to keep an eye on the time and pick up the pace say half an hour before finishing time youve got an hour and fifteen minutes before airtime fine pushing a button carlo instructed the driver to cruise but even i need to unwind he told her then opened up a small builtin cabinet to reveal the bar cognac he decided and poured two glasses without asking youve had two hours to windowshop and browse leaning back he stretched out his legs juliet thought of the hour and a half shed spent on the phone then the time involved in easing customers along shed been on her feet for two and a half hours straight but she said nothing the cognac went down smooth and warm the spot on the news should run four four and a half minutes it doesnt seem like much time but youd be surprised how much you can cram in be sure to mention the book title and the autographing and demonstration at the college tomorrow afternoon the sensual aspect of food cooking and eatings a great angle if youll would you care to do the interview for me he asked so politely she glanced up so he could be cranky she mused you handle interviews beautifully mr franconi but carlo before she could open her notebook he had his hand on her wrist its carlo and put the damn notes away for ten minutes tell me my very organized juliet trent why are we here together she started to move her hand but his grip was firmer than shed thought for the second time she got the full impression of power strength and determination to publicize your book today went well si yes so far today went well he said again and began to annoy her with the frequency of his interruptions ill go on this local news show talk for a few minutes then have this necessary business dinner when i would much rather have a bottle of wine and a steak in my room with you alone then i could see you without your proper little business suit and your proper little business manner she wouldnt permit herself to shudder she wouldnt permit herself to react in any way business is what were here for its all im interested in that may be his agreement was much too easy in direct contrast he moved his hand to the back of her neck gently but not so gently she could move aside but we have an hour before business begins again dont lecture me on timetables the limo smelled of leather she realized all at once of leather and wealth and carlo as casually as possible she sipped from her glass timetables as you pointed out yourself this morning are part of my job you have an hour off he told her lifting a brow before she could speak so relax your feet hurt so take your shoes off and drink your cognac he set down his own drink then moved her briefcase to the floor so there was nothing between them relax he said again but wasnt displeased that shed stiffened i dont intend to make love with you in the back of a car this time he smiled as temper flared in her eyes because hed seen doubt and excitement as well one day one day soon ill find the proper moment for that the proper place the proper mood he leaned closer so that he could just feel her breath flutter on his lips shed swipe at him now he knew if he took the next step he might enjoy the battle the color that ran along her cheekbones hadnt come from a tube or pot but from passion the look in her eyes was very close to a dare she expected him to move an inch closer to press her back against the seat with his mouth firm on hers she was waiting for him poised ready he smiled while his lips did no more than hover until he knew the tension in her had built to match the tension in him he let his gaze shift down to her mouth so that he could imagine the taste the texture the sweetness her chin stayed lifted even as he brushed a thumb over it he didnt care to do the expected in a long easy move he leaned back crossed his feet at the ankles and closed his eyes take off your shoes he said again my schedule and yours should merge very well then to her astonishment he was asleep not feigning it she realized but sound asleep as if hed just flicked a switch with a click she set her halffull glass down and folded her arms angry she thought damn right she was angry because he hadnt kissed her not because she wanted him to she told herself as she stared out the tinted window but because hed denied her the opportunity to show her claws she was beginning to think shed love drawing some italian blood chapter contents prev next their bags were packed and in the limo as a precaution juliet had given carlos room a quick lastminute goingover to make sure he hadnt left anything behind she still remembered being on the road with a mystery writer whod forgotten his toothbrush eight times on an eightcity tour a quick look was simpler than a latenight search for a drugstore checkout at the hotel had gone quickly and without any lastminute hitches to her relief the charges on carlos room bill had been light and reasonable her road budget might just hold with a minimum of confusion theyd left the wilshire juliet could only hope checkin at the airport then at the hotel in san francisco would go as well she didnt want to think about the simpson show a list of demographics wasnt necessary here she knew carlo had spent enough time in the states off and on to know how important his brief demonstration on the proper way to prepare biscuit tortoni and his ten minutes on the air would be it was the toprated nighttime show in the country and had been for fifteen years bob simpson was an american institution a few minutes on his show could boost the sale of books even in the most remote areas or it could kill it and boy oh boy she thought with a fresh gurgle of excitement did it look impressive to have the simpson show listed on her itinerary she offered a lastminute prayer that carlo wouldnt blow it she checked the little freezer backstage to be certain the dessert carlo had prepared that afternoon was in place and ready the concoction had to freeze for four hours so theyd play the beforeandafter game for the viewers hed make it up on the air then voila theyd produce the completed frozen dessert within minutes though carlo had already gone over the procedure the tools and ingredients with the production manager and the director juliet went over them all again the whipped cream was chilling and so far none of the crew had pilfered any macaroons the brand of dry sherry carlo had insisted on was stored and ready no one had broken the seal for a quick sample juliet nearly believed she could whip up the fancy frozen dessert herself if necessary and only thanked god she wouldnt have to give a live culinary demonstration in front of millions of television viewers he didnt seem to be feeling any pressure she thought as they settled in the green room no hed already given the little halfdressed blonde on the sofa a big smile and offered her a cup of coffee from the available machine coffee even for hollywood it took a wild imagination to consider the contents of the pot coffee juliet had taken one sip of what tasted like lukewarm mud and set the cup aside the little blonde was apparently a new love interest on one of the popular nighttime soaps and she was jittery with nerves carlo sat down on the sofa beside her and began chatting away as though they were old friends by the time the green room door opened again she was giggling the green room itself was beige pale unattractive beige and cramped the airconditioning worked but miserably still juliet knew how many of the famous and nearfamous had sat in that dull little room chewing their nails or taking quick sips from a flask carlo had exchanged the dubious coffee for plain water and was sprawled on the sofa with one arm tossed over the back he looked as easy as a man entertaining in his own home juliet wondered why she hadnt tossed any antacids in her bag she made a pretense of rechecking the schedule while carlo charmed the rising star and the simpson show murmured away on the twentyfiveinch color console across the room then the monkey walked in juliet glanced up and saw the longarmed tuxedoed chimpanzee waddle in with his hand caught in that of a tall thin man with harassed eyes and a nervous grin feeling a bit nervous herself juliet looked over at carlo he nodded to both newcomers then went back to the blonde without missing a beat even as juliet told herself to relax the chimp grinned threw back his head and let out a long loud announcement the blonde giggled but looked as though shed cut and run if the chimp came one step closer tux or no tux behave butch the thin man cleared his throat as he swept his gaze around the room butch just finished a picture last week he explained to the room in general hes feeling a little restless with a jiggle of the sequins that covered her the blonde walked to the door when her name was announced with some satisfaction carlo noted that she wasnt nearly as edgy as shed been when hed sat down she turned and gave him a toothy smile wish me luck darling the best to juliets disgust the blonde blew him a kiss as she sailed out the thin man seemed to relax visibly thats a relief blondes make butch overexcited i see juliet thought of her own hair that could be considered blond or brown depending on the whim hopefully butch would consider it brown and unstimulating but wheres the lemonade the mans nerves came back in full force they know butch wants lemonade before he goes on the air calms him down juliet bit the tip of her tongue to hold back a snicker carlo and butch were eyeing each other with a kind of tolerant understanding he seems calm enough carlo ventured bundle of nerves the man disagreed ill never be able to get him on camera im sure its just an oversight because she was used to soothing panic juliet smiled maybe you should ask one of the pages ill do that the man patted butch on the head and went back through the door but juliet half rose then sat again the chimp stood in the middle of the room resting his knuckles on the floor im not sure he shouldve left cheetah butch carlo corrected i think hes harmless enough he sent the chimp a quick grin he certainly has an excellent tailor juliet looked over to see the chimp grinning and winking is he twitching she asked carlo or is he flirting with me flirting if hes a male of any taste he mused and as i said his tailoring is quite good what do you say butch you find my juliet attractive butch threw back his head and let out a series of sounds juliet felt could be taken either way see he appreciates a beautiful woman appreciating the ridiculous juliet laughed whether he was attracted to the sound or simply felt it was time he made his move butch bowlegged his way over to her still grinning he put his hand on juliets bare knee this time she was certain he winked i never make so obvious a move on first acquaintance carlo observed some women prefer the direct approach deciding he was harmless juliet smiled down at butch he reminds me of someone she sent carlo a mild look it must be that ingratiating grin before shed finished speaking butch climbed into her lap and wrapped one of his long arms around her hes kind of sweet with another laugh she looked down into the chimps face i think he has your eyes carlo ah juliet i think you should though his might be more intelligent oh i think hes smart all right carlo coughed into his hand as he watched the chimps busy fingers juliet if youd of course hes smart hes in movies enjoying herself juliet watched the chimp grin up at her have i seen any of your films butch i wouldnt be surprised if theyre blue she tickled butch under the chin really carlo how crude just a guess he let his gaze run over her tell me juliet do you feel a draft no id say its entirely too warm in here this poor thing is all wrapped up in a tux she clucked at butch and he clacked his teeth at her juliet do you believe people can reveal their personalities by the clothes they wear send signals if you understand what i mean hmm distracted she shrugged and helped butch straighten his tie i suppose so i find it interesting that you wear pink silk under such a prim blouse i beg your pardon an observation mi amore he let his gaze wander down again just an observation sitting very still juliet moved only her head in a moment her mouth was as open as her blouse the monkey with the cute face and excellent tailor had nimbly undone every one of the buttons carlo gave butch a look of admiration i must ask him how he perfected that technique why you son of a not me carlo put a hand to his heart im an innocent bystander juliet rose abruptly dumping the chimp onto the floor as she ducked into the adjoining rest room she heard the laughter of two males one a chimp the other a rat juliet took the ride to the airport where they would leave for san diego in excruciatingly polite silence come now cam the show went well not only was the title mentioned three times but there was that nice closeup of the book my tortoni was a triumph and they liked my anecdote on cooking the long sensual italian meal youre a real prince with anecdotes she murmured amore it was the monkey who tried to undress you not i he gave a long selfsatisfied sigh he couldnt remember when hed enjoyed a demonstration quite so much if i had wed have missed the show altogether you just had to tell that story on the air didnt you she sent him a cool killing look do you know how many millions of people watch that show it was a good story in the dim light of the limo she saw the gleam in his eyes most millions of people like good stories everyone i work with will have seen that show she found her jaw was clenched and deliberately relaxed it not only did you just just sit there and let that happyfingered little creature half strip me but then you broadcast it on national television madonna youll remember i did try to warn you i remember nothing of the kind but you were so enchanted with butch he continued i confess it was difficult not to be enchanted myself he let his gaze roam down to her tidily buttoned blouse youve lovely skin juliet perhaps i was momentarily distracted i throw myself a simple weak man on your mercy oh shut up she folded her arms and stared straight ahead not speaking again until the driver pulled to the curb at their airline juliet pulled her carryon bag out of the trunk she knew the chance was always there that the bags could be lost sent to san jose while she went to san diego so she always carried her absolute essentials with her she handed over both her ticket and carlos so the checkin could get underway while she paid off the driver it made her think of her budget shed managed to justify limo service in la but it would be cabs and rented cars from here on goodbye glamour she thought as she pocketed her receipt hello reality no this ill carry she turned to see carlo indicate his leatherbound box of about two feet in length eight inches in width youre better off checking something that bulky i never check my tools he slung a flight bag over his shoulder and picked up the box by its handle suit yourself she said with a shrug and moved through the automatic doors with him fatigue was creeping in she realized and she hadnt had to prepare any intricate desserts if he were human hed be every bit as weary as she he might annoy her in a dozen ways but he didnt gripe juliet bit back a sigh weve a half hour before theyll begin boarding would you like a drink he gave her an easy smile a truce she returned it despite herself no a drink okay they found a dark crowded lounge and worked their way through to a table she watched carlo maneuver his box with some difficulty around people over chairs and ultimately under their table whats in there tools he said again knives properly weighted stainless steel spatulas of the correct size and balance my own cooking oil and vinegar other essentials youre going to lug oil and vinegar through airport terminals from coast to coast with a shake of her head she glanced up at a waitress vodka and grapefruit juice brandy yes he said giving his attention back to juliet after hed dazzled the waitress with a quick smile because theres no brand on the american market to compare with my own he picked up a peanut from the bowl on the table theres no brand on any market to compare with my own you could still check it she pointed out after all you check your shirts and ties i dont trust my tools to the hands of baggage carriers he popped the peanut into his mouth a tie is a simple thing to replace even a thing to become bored with but an excellent whisk is entirely different once i teach you to cook youll understand youve got as much chance teaching me to cook as you do flying to san diego without the plane now you know youll be giving a demonstration of preparing linguini and clam sauce on am san diego the show airs at eight so well have to be at the studio at six to get things started as far as he could see the only civilized cooking to be done at that hour would be a champagne breakfast for two why do americans insist on rising at dawn to watch television ill take a poll and find out she said absently in the meantime youll make up one dish that well set aside exactly as we did tonight on the air youll be going through each stage of preparation but of course we dont have enough time to finish thats why we need the first dish now for the good news she sent a quick smile to the waitress as their drinks were served theres been a bit of a mixup at the studio so well have to bring the ingredients along ourselves i need you to give me a list of what youll need once see you settled into the hotel ill run out and pick them up theres bound to be an allnight market in his head he went over the ingredients for his linguini con vongole biance true the american market would have some of the necessities but he considered himself fortunate that he had a few of his own in the case at his feet the clam sauce was his specialty not to be taken lightly is shopping for groceries at midnight part of a publicists job she smiled at him carlo thought it was not only lovely but perhaps the first time shed smiled at him and meant it on the road anything that needs to be done is the publicists job so if youll run through the ingredients ill write them down not necessary he swirled and sipped his brandy ill go with you you need your sleep she was already rummaging for a pencil even with a quick nap on the plane youre only going to get about five hours so are you he pointed out when she started to speak again he lifted his brow in that strange silent way he had of interrupting perhaps i dont trust an amateur to pick out my clams juliet watched him as she drank or perhaps he was a gentleman she mused despite his reputation with women and a healthy dose of vanity he was one of that rare breed of men who knew how to be considerate of women without patronizing them she decided to forgive him for butch after all drink up franconi and she toasted him perhaps in friendship weve a plane to catch salute he lifted his glass to her they didnt argue again until they were on the plane grumbling only a little juliet helped him stow his fancy box of tools under the seat its a short flight she checked her watch and calculated the shopping would indeed go beyond midnight shed have to take some of the vile tasting brewers yeast in the morning ill see you when we land he took her wrist when she would have gone past him where are you going to my seat you dont sit here he pointed to the seat beside him no im in coach impatient she had to shift to let another oncoming passenger by why carlo im blocking the aisle why are you in coach she let out a sigh of a parent instructing a stubborn child because the publisher is more than happy to spring for a firstclass ticket for a bestselling author and celebrity theres a different style for publicists its called coach someone bumped a briefcase against her hip damn if she wouldnt have a bruise now if youd let me go i could stop being battered and go sit down first class is almost empty he pointed out its a simple matter to upgrade your ticket she managed to pull her arm away dont buck the system franconi i always buck the system he told her as she walked down the aisle to her seat yes he did like the way she moved mr franconi a flight attendant beamed at him may i get you a drink after takeoff whats your white wine when she told him he settled into his seat a bit pedestrian he thought but not entirely revolting you noticed the young woman i was speaking with the honeycolored hair and the stubborn chin her smile remained bright and helpful though she thought it was a shame that he had his mind on another woman of course mr franconi shell have a glass of wine with my compliments juliet would have considered herself fortunate to have an aisle seat if the man beside her hadnt already been sprawled out and snoring travel was so glamorous she thought wryly as she slipped her toes out of her shoes wasnt she lucky to have another flight to look forward to the very next night dont complain juliet she warned herself when you have your own agency you can send someone else on the downanddirty tours the man beside her snored through takeoff on the other side of the aisle a woman held a cigarette in one hand and a lighter in the other in anticipation of the no smoking sign blinking off juliet took out her pad and began to work miss stifling a yawn juliet glanced up at the flight attendant im sorry i didnt order a drink with mr franconis compliments juliet accepted the wine as she looked up toward first class he was sneaky she told herself trying to get under her defenses by being nice she let her notebook close as she sighed and sat back it was working she barely finished the wine before touchdown but it had relaxed her relaxed her enough she realized that all she wanted to do was find a soft bed and a dark room in an hour or two she promised herself and gathered up her flight bag and briefcase she found carlo was waiting for her in first class with a very young very attractive flight attendant neither of them seemed the least bit travel weary ah juliet deborah knows of a marvelous twentyfourhour market where we can find everything we need juliet looked at the willowy brunette and managed a smile how convenient he took the flight attendants hand and inevitably juliet thought kissed it arrivederci dont waste time do you juliet commented the moment they deplaned every moment lived is a moment to be enjoyed what a quaint little sentiment she shifted her bag and aimed for baggage claim you should have it tattooed where she didnt bother to look at his grin where it would be most attractive naturally they had to wait longer than she liked for their luggage and by then the relaxing effects of the wine had worn off there was business to be seen to because he enjoyed watching her in action carlo let her see to it she secured a cab tipped the skycap and gave the driver the name of the hotel scooting in beside carlo she caught his grin something funny youre so efficient juliet is that a compliment or an insult i never insult women he said it so simply she was absolutely certain it was true unlike juliet he was completely relaxed and not particularly sleepy if this was rome wed go to a dark little cafe drink heavy red wine and listen to american music she closed her window because the air was damp and chilly the tour interfering with your night life so far i find myself enjoying the stimulating company tomorrow youre going to find yourself worked to a frazzle carlo thought of his background and smiled at nine hed spent the hours between school and supper washing dishes and mopping up kitchens at fifteen hed waited tables and spent his free time learning of spices and sauces in paris hed combined long hard study with work as an assistant chef even now his restaurant and clients had him keeping twelvehour days not all of his background was in the neatly typed bio juliet had in her briefcase i dont mind work as long as it interests me i think youre the same i have to work she corrected but its easier when you enjoy it youre more successful when you enjoy it it shows with you ambition juliet without a certain joy is cold and when achieved leaves a flat taste but i am ambitious oh yes he turned to look at her starting off flutters shed thought herself too wise to experience but youre not cold for a moment she thought shed be better off if he were wrong heres the hotel she turned from him relieved to deal with details we need you to wait she instructed the driver well be going out again as soon as we check in the hotel has a lovely view of the bay im told she walked into the lobby with carlo as the bellboy dealt with their luggage its a shame we wont have time to enjoy it franconi and trent she told the desk clerk the lobby was quiet and empty oh the lucky people who were sleeping in their beds she thought and pushed at a strand of hair that had come loose well be checking out first thing tomorrow and we wont be able to come back so be sure you dont leave anything behind in your room but of course youll check anyway she sent him a sidelong look as she signed the form just part of the service she pocketed her key the luggage can be taken straight up discreetly she handed the bellboy a folded bill mr franconi and i have an errand yes maam i like that about you to juliets surprise carlo linked arms with her as they walked back outside what your generosity many people wouldve slipped out without tipping the bellboy she shrugged maybe its easier to be generous when its not your money juliet he opened the door to the waiting cab and gestured her in youre intelligent enough couldnt you how is it stiff the bellboy then write the tip down on your expense account five dollars isnt worth being dishonest nothings worth being dishonest he gave the driver the name of the market and settled back instinct tells me if you tried to tell a lie a true lie your tongue would fall out mr franconi she planted the tongue in question in her cheek you forget im in public relations if i didnt lie id be out of a job a true lie he corrected isnt that a contradiction in terms perhaps youre too young to know the variety of truths and lies ah you see this is why im so fond of your country carlo leaned out the window as they approached the big lighted allnight market in america you want cookies at midnight you can buy cookies at midnight such practicality glad to oblige wait here she instructed the driver then climbed out opposite carlo i hope you know what you need id hate to get into the studio at dawn and find i had to run out and buy whole peppercorns or something franconi knows linguini he swung an arm around her shoulder and drew her close as they walked inside your first lesson my love he led her first to the seafood section where he clucked and muttered and rejected and chose until he had the proper number of clams for two dishes shed seen women give as much time and attention to choosing an engagement ring juliet obliged him by pushing the cart as he walked along beside her looking at everything and touching cans boxes bottles she waited as he picked up examined and ran his long artists fingers over the labels as he read every ingredient somewhat amused she watched his diamond wink in the fluorescent light amazing what they put in this prepackaged garbage he commented as he dropped a box back on the shelf careful franconi youre talking about my staple diet you should be sick prepackaged foods freed the american woman from the kitchen and destroyed a generation of taste buds he chose his spices carefully and without haste he opened three brands of oregano and sniffed before he settled on one i tell you juliet i admire your american convenience its practicality but i would rather shop in rome where i can walk along the stalls and choose vegetables just out of the ground fish fresh from the sea everything isnt in a can like the music he didnt miss an aisle but juliet forgot her fatigue in fascination shed never seen anyone shop like carlo franconi it was like strolling through a museum with an art student he breezed by the flour scowling at each sack she was afraid for a moment hed rip one open and test the contents this is a good brand juliet figured she bought a twopound bag of flour about once a year well my mother always used this but good always trust a mother shes a dreadful cook carlo set the flour firmly in the basket shes a mother an odd sentiment from a man no mother can trust for mothers i have the greatest respect i have one myself now we need garlic mushrooms peppers fresh carlo walked along the stalls of vegetables touching squeezing and sniffing cautious juliet looked around for clerks grateful theyd come at midnight rather than midday carlo you really arent supposed to handle everything quite so much if i dont handle how do i know whats good and whats just pretty he sent her a quick grin over his shoulder i told you food was much like a woman they put mushrooms in this box with wrap over it disgusted he tore the wrapping off before juliet could stop him carlo you cant open it i want only what i want you can see some are too small too skimpy patiently he began to pick out the mushrooms that didnt suit him then well throw out what you dont want when we get back to the hotel keeping an eye out for the night manager she began to put the discarded mushrooms back in the box buy two boxes if you need them its a waste youd waste your money the publishers money she said quickly as she put the broken box into the basket hes glad to waste it thrilled he paused for a moment then shook his head no no i cant do it but when he started to reach into the basket juliet moved and blocked his way carlo if you break open another package were going to be arrested better to go to jail than to buy mushrooms that will do me no good in the morning she grinned at him and stood firm no its not he ran a fingertip over her lips before she could react for you then but against my better judgment grazie do you have everything now his gaze followed the path his finger had traced just as slowly no well what next he stepped closer and because she hadnt expected it she found herself trapped between him and the grocery cart tonight is for first lessons he murmured then ran his hands along either side of her face she should laugh juliet told herself it was ludicrous that hed make a pass at her under the bright lights of the vegetable section of an allnight market carlo franconi a man whod made seduction as much an art as his cooking wouldnt choose such a foolish setting but she saw what was in his eyes and she didnt laugh some women he thought as he felt her skin soft and warm under his hands were made to be taught slowly very slowly some women were born knowing others were born wondering with juliet he would take time and care because he understood or thought he did she didnt resist but her lips had parted in surprise he touched his to hers gently not in question but with patience her eyes had already given him the answer he didnt hurry it didnt matter to him where they were that the lights were bright and the music manufactured it only mattered that he explore the tastes that waited for him so he tasted again without pressure and again she found she was bracing herself against the cart with her fingers wrapped around the metal why didnt she walk away why didnt she just brush him aside and stalk out of the store he wasnt holding her there on her face his hands were light clever but not insistent she could move she could go she should she didnt his thumbs trailed under her chin tracing there he felt the pulse rapid and jerky and kept his hold easy he meant to keep it so but even he hadnt guessed her taste would be so unique neither of them knew who took the next step perhaps they took it together his mouth wasnt so light on hers any longer nor was hers so passive they met triumphantly and clung her fingers werent wrapped around the cart now but gripping his shoulders holding him closer their bodies fit perfectly it should have warned her giving without thought was something she never did until now in giving she took but she never thought to balance the ledger his mouth was warm full his hands never left her face but they were firm now she couldnt have walked away so easily she wouldnt have walked away at all hed thought he had known everything there was to expect from a woman fire ice temptation but a lesson was being taught to both had he ever felt this warmth before this kind of sweetness no because if he had hed remember no tastes no sensations ever experienced were forgotten he knew what it was to desire a woman many women but he hadnt known what it was to crave for a moment he filled himself with the sensation he wouldnt forget but he knew that a cautious man takes a step back and a second breath before he steps off a cliff with a murmur in his own language he did shaken juliet gripped the cart again for balance cursing herself for an idiot she waited for her breath to even out very nice carlo said quietly and ran a finger along her cheek very nice juliet an eighties woman she reminded herself as her heart thudded strong independent sophisticated im so glad you approve he took her hand before she could slam the cart down the aisle her skin was still warm he noted her pulse still unsteady if theyd been alone perhaps it was best this way for now it isnt a matter of approval cara mia but of appreciation from now on just appreciate me for my work okay a jerk and she freed herself of him and shoved the cart away without regard for the care hed taken in selecting them juliet began to drop the contents of the cart on the conveyor belt at checkout you didnt object he reminded her hed needed to find his balance as well he realized now he leaned against the cart and gave her a cocky grin i didnt want a scene he took the peppers from the basket himself before she could wound them ah youre learning about lies when her head came up he was surprised her eyes didnt bore right through him you wouldnt know truth if you fell into it darling mind the mushrooms he warned her as she swung the package onto the belt we dont want them bruised ive a special affection for them now she swore at him loudly enough that the checkers eyes widened carlo continued to grin and thought about lesson two he thought they should have it soon very soon chapter contents prev next there were times when you knew everything could go wrong should go wrong and probably would go wrong but somehow it didnt then there were the other times perhaps juliet was grouchy because shed spent another restless night when she couldnt afford to lose any sleep that little annoyance she could lay smack at carlos door even though it didnt bring any satisfaction but even if shed been rested and cheerful the ordeal at galleghers department store would have had her steaming with a good eight hours sleep she might have kept things from boiling over first carlo insisted on coming with her two hours before he was needed or wanted juliet didnt care to spend the first two hours of what was bound to be a long hectic day with a smug selfassured egocentric chef who looked as though hed just come back from two sunwashed weeks on the riviera obviously he didnt need any sleep she mused as they took the quick damp cab ride from hotel to mall whatever the tourist bureau had to say about sunny california it was raining big steady drops of it that immediately made the few minutes shed taken to fuss with her hair worthless prepared to enjoy the ride carlo looked out the window he liked the way the rain plopped in puddles it didnt matter to him that hed heard it start that morning just past four its a nice sound he decided it makes things more quiet more subtle dont you think breaking away from her own gloomy view of the rain juliet turned to him what the rain carlo noted she looked a bit holloweyed good she hadnt been unaffected rain changes the look of things normally she would have agreed juliet never minded dashing for the subway in a storm or strolling along fifth avenue in a drizzle today she considered it her right to look on the dark side this one might lower the attendance in your little demonstration by ten percent so he gave an easy shrug as the driver swung into the parking lot of the mall what she didnt need at that moment was careless acceptance carlo the purpose of all this is exposure he patted her hand youre only thinking of numbers you should think instead of my pasta con pesto in a few hours everyone else will i dont think about food the way you do she muttered it still amazed her that hed lovingly prepared the first linguini at am then the second two hours later for the camera both dishes had been an exquisite example of italian cooking at its finest hed looked more like a film star on holiday than a working chef which was precisely the image juliet had wanted to project his spot on the morning show had been perfect that only made juliet more pessimistic about the rest of the day its hard to think about food at all on this kind of a schedule thats because you didnt eat anything this morning linguini for breakfast doesnt suit me my linguini is always suitable juliet gave a mild snort as she stepped from the cab into the rain though she made a dash for the doors carlo was there ahead of her opening one thanks inside she ran a hand through her hair and wondered how soon she could come by another cup of coffee you dont need to do anything for another two hours and hed definitely be in the way while things were being set up on the third floor so ill wander with his hands in his pockets he looked around as luck would have it theyd entered straight into the lingerie department i find your american malls fascinating im sure her voice was dry as he fingered the border of lace on a slinky camisole you can come upstairs with me first if you like no no a saleswoman with a face that demanded a second look adjusted two negligees and beamed at him i think ill just roam around and see what your shops have to offer he beamed back so far im charmed she watched the exchange and tried not to clench her teeth all right then if youll just be sure to be in special events on the third floor at elevenfortyfive he finished in his friendly casual way he kissed her forehead she wondered why he could touch her like a cousin and make her think of a lover believe me juliet nothing you say to me is forgotten he took her hand running his thumb over her knuckles that was definitely not the touch of a cousin ill buy you a present it isnt necessary a pleasure things that are necessary are rarely a pleasure juliet disengaged her hand while trying not to dwell on the pleasure he could offer please dont be later than elevenfortyfive carlo timing mi amore is something i excel in ill bet she thought as she started toward the escalator shed have bet a weeks pay he was already flirting with the lingerie clerk it only took ten minutes in special events for juliet to forget carlos penchant for romancing anything feminine the little assistant with the squeaky voice was still in charge as her boss continued his battle with the flu she was young cheerleader pretty and just as pert she was also in completely over her head elise juliet began because it was still early on enough for her to have some optimism mr franconis going to need a working area in the kitchen department is everything set oh yes elise gave juliet a toothy amiable grin im getting a nice folding table from sporting goods diplomacy juliet reminded herself was one of the primary rules of pr im afraid well need something a bit sturdier perhaps one of the islands where mr franconi could prepare the dish and still face the audience your supervisor and i had discussed it oh is that what he meant elise looked blank for a moment then brightened juliet began to think dark thoughts about mellow california well why not why not juliet agreed weve kept the dish mr franconi is to prepare as simple as possible you do have all the ingredients listed oh yes it sounds just delicious im a vegetarian you know of course she was juliet thought yogurt was probably the high point of her day elise im sorry if it seems im rushing you along but i really need to work out the setup as soon as possible oh sure all cooperation elise flashed her straighttoothed smile what do you want to know juliet offered up a prayer how sick is mr francis she asked thinking of the levelheaded businesslike man she had dealt with before just miserable elise swung back her straight californiablond hair hell be out the rest of the week no help there accepting the inevitable juliet gave elise her straight nononsense look all right what have you got so far well weve taken a new blender and some really lovely bowls from housewares juliet nearly relaxed thats fine and the range elise smiled range the range mr franconi needs to cook the spaghetti for this dish its on the list oh wed need electricity for that wouldnt we yes juliet folded her hands to keep them from clenching we would for the blender too i guess id better check with maintenance i guess youd better diplomacy tact juliet reminded herself as her fingers itched for elises neck maybe ill just go over to the kitchen layouts and see which one would suit mr franconi best terrific he might want to do his interview right there juliet had taken two steps before she stopped and turned back interview with the food editor of the sun shell be here at eleventhirty calm controlled juliet pulled out her itinerary of the san diego stop she skimmed it though she knew every word by heart i dont seem to have anything listed here it came up at the last minute i called your hotel at nine but youd already checked out i see should she have expected elise to phone the television studio and leave a message juliet looked into the personalityplus smile no she supposed not resigned she checked her watch the setup could be dealt with in time if she started immediately carlo would just have to be paged how do i call mall management oh you can call from my office can i do anything juliet thought of and rejected several things none of which were kind id like some coffee two sugars she rolled up her sleeves and went to work by eleven juliet had the range the island and the ingredients carlo had specified neatly arranged it had taken only one call and some finesse to acquire two vivid flower arrangements from a shop in the mall she was on her third coffee and considering a fourth when carlo wandered over thank god she drained the last from the styrofoam cup i thought i was going to have to send out a search party search party idly he began looking around the kitchen set i came when i heard the page youve been paged five times in the last hour yes he smiled as he looked back at her her hair was beginning to stray out of her neat bun he might have stepped off the cover of gentlemens quarterly i only just heard but then i spent some time in the most fantastic record store such speakers quadraphonic thats nice juliet dragged a hand through her already frazzled hair theres a problem her names elise ive come very close to murdering her half a dozen times if she smiles at me again i just might juliet gestured with her hand to brush it off this was no time for fantasies no matter how satisfying it seems things were a bit disorganized here but youve seen to that he bent over to examine the range as a driver might a car before le mans excellent you can be glad youve got electricity rather than your imagination she muttered you have an interview at eleventhirty with a food editor marjorie ballister from the sun he only moved his shoulders and examined the blender all right if id known it was coming up id have bought a paper so we could have seen her column and gauged her style as it is non importante you worry too much juliet she could have kissed him strictly in gratitude but she could have kissed him considering that unwise she smiled instead i appreciate your attitude carlo after the last hour of dealing with the inept the insane and the unbearable its a relief to have someone take things in stride franconi always takes things in stride juliet started to sink into a chair for a fiveminute break dio what joke is this she was standing again and looking down at the little can he held in his hand who would sabotage my pasta sabotage had he found a bomb in the can what are you talking about this he shook the can at her what do you call this its basil she began a bit unsteady when she lifted her gaze and caught the dark furious look in his eyes its on your list basil he went off in a stream of italian you dare call this basil soothe juliet reminded herself it was part of the job carlo it says basil right on the can on the can he said something short and rude as he dropped it into her hand where in your clever notes does it say franconi uses basil from a can it just says basil she said between clenched teeth basil fresh on your famous list youll see fresh accidenti only a philistine uses basil from a can for pasta con pesto do i look like a philistine she wouldnt tell him what he looked like later she might privately admit that temper was spectacular on him dark and unreasonable but spectacular carlo i realize things arent quite as perfect here as both of us would like but i dont need perfect he tossed at her i can cook in a sewer if i have to but not without the proper ingredients she swallowed though it went down hard pride temper and opinion she only had fifteen minutes left until the interview im sorry carlo if we could just compromise on this compromise when the word came out like an obscenity she knew shed lost the battle would you ask picasso to compromise on a painting juliet stuck the can into her pocket how much fresh basil do you need three ounces youll have it anything else a mortar and pestle marble juliet checked her watch she had fortyfive minutes to handle it okay if youll do the interview right here ill take care of this and well be ready for the demonstration at noon she sent up a quick prayer that there was a gourmet shop within ten miles remember to get in the book title and the next stop on the tour well be hitting another galleghers in portland so its a good tiein here digging into her bag she brought out an eightbyten glossy take the extra publicity shot for her in case i dont get back elise didnt mention a photographer youd like to chop and dice that bouncy little woman carlo observed noting that juliet was swearing very unprofessionally under her breath you bet i would she dug in again take a copy of the book the reporter can keep it if necessary i can handle the reporter he told her calmly enough you handle the basil it seemed luck was with her when juliet only had to make three calls before she found a shop that carried what she needed the frenzied trip in the rain didnt improve her disposition nor did the price of a marble pestle another glance at her watch reminded her she didnt have time for temperament carrying what she considered carlos eccentricities she ran back to the waiting cab at exactly ten minutes to twelve dripping wet juliet rode up to the third floor of galleghers the first thing she saw was carlo leaning back in a cozy wicker dinette chair laughing with a plump pretty middleaged woman with a pad and pencil he looked dashing amiable and most of all dry she wondered how it would feel to grind the pestle into his ear ah juliet all good humor carlo rose as she walked up to the table you must meet marjorie she tells me shes eaten my pasta in my restaurant in rome loved every sinful bite how do you do you must be the juliet trent carlo bragged about bragged about no she wouldnt be pleased but juliet set her bag on the table and offered her hand its nice to meet you i hope you can stay for the demonstration wouldnt miss it she twinkled at carlo or a sample of franconis pasta juliet felt a little wave of relief something would be salvaged out of the disaster unless she was way off the mark carlo was about to be given a glowing writeup carlo was already taking the little sack of basil out of the bag perfect he said after one sniff yes yes this is excellent he tested the pestle weight and size youll see over at our little stage a crowd is gathering he said easily to juliet so we moved here to talk knowing youd see us as soon as you stepped off the escalator very good theyd both handled things well she decided it was best to take satisfaction from that a quick glance showed her that elise was busy chatting away with a small group of people not a worry in the world juliet thought nastily well shed already resigned herself to that five minutes in the rest room for some quick repairs she calculated and she could keep everything on schedule you have everything you need now carlo he caught the edge of annoyance and her hand smiling brilliantly grazie cara mia youre wonderful perhaps shed rather have snarled but she returned the smile just doing my job you have a few more minutes before we should begin if youll excuse me ill just take care of some things and be right back juliet kept up a brisk dignified walk until she was out of sight then made a mad dash for the rest room pulling out her brush as she went in what did i tell you carlo held the bag of basil in his palm to judge the weight shes fantastic and quite lovely marjorie agreed even when shes damp and annoyed with a laugh carlo leaned forward to grasp both of marjories hands he was a man who touched always a woman of perception i knew i liked you she gave a quick dry chuckle and for a moment felt twenty years younger and twenty pounds lighter it was a talent of his that he was generous with one last question carlo before your fantastic ms trent rushes you off are you still likely to fly off to cairo or cannes to prepare one of your dishes for an appreciative client and a stunning fee there was a time this was routine he was silent a moment thinking of the early years of his success thered been mad glamorous trips to this country and to that preparing fettuccine for a prince or cannelloni for a tycoon it had been a heady spectacular time then hed opened his restaurant and had learned that the solid continuity of his own place was so much more fulfilling than the flash of the single dish from time to time i would still make such trips two months ago there was count lequines birthday hes an old client an old friend and hes fond of my spaghetti but my restaurant is more rewarding to me he gave her a quizzical look as a thought occurred to him perhaps im settling down a pity you didnt decide to settle in the states she closed her pad i guarantee if you opened a franconis right here in san diego youd have clientele flying in from all over the country he took the idea weighed it in much the same way he had the basil and put it in a corner of his mind an interesting thought and a fascinating interview thank you it pleased her that he rose as she did and took her hand she was a tough outspoken feminist who appreciated genuine manners and genuine charm im looking forward to a taste of your pasta ill just ease over and try to get a good seat here comes your ms trent marjorie had never considered herself particularly romantic but shed always believed where there was smoke there was fire she watched the way carlo turned his head saw the change in his eyes and the slight tilt of his mouth there was fire all right she mused you only had to be within five feet to feel the heat between the hand dryer and her brush juliet had managed to do something with her hair a touch here a dab there and her makeup was back in shape carrying her raincoat over her arm she looked competent and collected she was ready to admit shed had one too many cups of coffee your interview went well yes he noticed and approved that shed taken the time to dab on her scent perfectly good you can fill me in later wed better get started in a moment he reached in his pocket i told you id buy you a present there was a flutter of surprised pleasure she tried to ignore just wired from the coffee she told herself carlo i told you not to we dont have time theres always time he opened the little box himself and drew out a small gold heart with an arrow of diamonds running through it shed been expecting something along the line of a box of chocolates oh i words were her business but shed lost them carlo really you cant never say cant to franconi he murmured and began to fasten the pin to her lapel he did so smoothly with no fumbling after all he was a man accustomed to such feminine habits its very delicate i thought very elegant so it suits you narrowing his eyes he stood back then nodded yes i was sure it would it wasnt possible to remember her crazed search for fresh basil when he was smiling at her in just that way it was barely possible to remember how furious she was over the lackadaisical setup for the demonstration instinctively she put up her hand and ran a finger over the pin its lovely her lips curved easily sweetly as he thought they didnt do often enough thank you he couldnt count or even remember the number of presents hed given or the different styles of gratitude hed received somehow he was already sure this would be one he wouldnt forget prego ah ms trent juliet glanced over to see elise watching her present or no present it tightened her jaw yes elise you havent met mr franconi yet elise directed me from the office to you when i answered the page carlo said easily more than appreciating juliets aggravation yes she flashed her touchdown smile i thought your cookbook looked just super mr franconi everyones dying to watch you cook something she opened a little pad of paper with daisies on the cover i thought you could spell what it is so i could tell them when i announce you elise i have everything juliet managed charm and diplomacy to cover a firm nudge out the door why dont i just announce mr franconi great she beamed juliet could think of no other word for it thatll be a lot easier well get started now carlo if youd just step over there behind those counters ill go give the announcements without waiting for an assent she gathered up the basil mortar and pestle and walked over to the area that shed prepared in the most natural of moves she set everything down and turned to the audience three hundred she judged maybe even over not bad for a rainy day in a department store good afternoon her voice was pleasant and well pitched thered be no need for a microphone in the relatively small space thank god because elise had botched that minor detail as well i want to thank you all for coming here today and to thank galleghers for providing such a lovely setting for the demonstration from a few feet away carlo leaned on a counter and watched her she was as hed told the reporter fantastic no one would guess shed been up and on her feet since dawn we all like to eat this drew the murmured laughter shed expected but ive been told by an expert that eating is more than a basic necessity its an experience not all of us like to cook but the same expert told me that cooking is both art and magic this afternoon the expert carlo franconi will share with you the art the magic and the experience with his own pasta con pesto juliet started the applause herself but it was picked up instantly as carlo stepped out she melted back center stage was his the moment he stepped on it its a fortunate man he began who has the opportunity to cook for so many beautiful women some of you have husbands at the question there was a smarter of chuckles and the lifting of hands ah well he gave a very european shrug then i must be content to cook she knew carlo had chosen that particular dish because it took little time in preparation after the first five minutes juliet was certain not one member of the audience would have budged if hed chosen something that took hours she wasnt yet convinced cooking was magic but she was certain he was his hands were as skilled and certain as a surgeons his tongue as glib as a politicians she watched him measure grate chop and blend and found herself just as entertained as she might have been with a well produced oneact play one woman was bold enough to ask a question it opened the door and dozens of others followed juliet neednt have worried that the noise and conversations would disturb him obviously he thrived on the interaction he wasnt she decided simply doing his job or fulfilling an obligation he was enjoying himself calling one woman up with him carlo joked about all truly great chefs requiring both inspiration and assistance he told her to stir the spaghetti made a fuss out of showing her the proper way to stir by putting his hand over hers and undoubtedly sold another ten books then and there juliet had to grin hed done it for fun not for sales he was fun juliet realized even if he did take his basil too seriously he was sweet unconsciously she began to toy with the gold and diamonds on her lapel uncommonly considerate and uncommonly demanding simply uncommon as she watched him laugh with his audience something began to melt inside of her she sighed with it dreaming there were certain men that prompted a woman even a practical woman to dream one of the women seated closer to her leaned toward a companion good god hes the sexiest man ive ever seen he could keep a dozen lovers patiently waiting juliet caught herself and dropped her hand yes he could keep a dozen lovers patiently waiting she was sure he did deliberately she tucked her hands in the pockets of her skirt shed be better off remembering she was encouraging this public image even exploiting it shed be better off remembering that carlo himself had told her he needed no imagery if she started believing half the things he said to her she might just find herself patiently waiting the thought of that was enough to stop the melting waiting didnt fit into her schedule when every last bite of pasta had been consumed and every last fan had been spoken with carlo allowed himself to think of the pleasures of sitting down with a cool glass of wine juliet already had his jacket well done carlo as she spoke she began to help him into it you can leave california with the satisfaction of knowing you were a smashing success he took her raincoat from her when she wouldve shrugged into it herself the airport she smiled at his tone understanding well pick up our bags in the holding room at the hotel on the way look at it this way you can sit back and sleep all the way to portland if you like because the thought had a certain appeal he cooperated they rode down to the first floor and went out the west entrance where juliet had told the cab to wait she let out a quick sigh of relief when it was actually there we get into portland early seven rain splattered against the cabs windshield juliet told herself to relax planes took off safely in the rain every day you have a spot on people of interest but not until ninethirty that means we can have breakfast at a civilized hour and go over the scheduling quickly efficiently she checked off her san diego list and noted everything had been accomplished she had time for a quick preliminary glance at her portland schedule before the cab pulled up to the hotel just wait here she ordered both the driver and carlo she was up and out of the cab and because they were running it close managed to have the bags installed in the trunk within seven minutes carlo knew because it amused him to time her you too can sleep all the way to portland she settled in beside him again no ive got some work to do the nice thing about planes is that i can pretend im in my office and forget im thousands of feet off the ground i didnt realize flying bothered you only when im in the air juliet sat back and closed her eyes thinking to relax for a moment the next thing she knew she was being kissed awake disoriented she sighed and wrapped her arms around carlos neck it was soothing so sweet and then the heat began to rise cam shed surprised him but that had brought its own kind of pleasure such a pity to wake you hmm when she opened her eyes his face was close her mouth still warm her heart still thudding she jerked back and fumbled with the door handle that was uncalled for true enough leisurely carlo stepped out into the rain but it was illuminating ive already paid the driver juliet he continued when she started to dig into her purse the baggage is checked we board from gate five taking her arm and his big leather case he led her into the terminal you didnt have to take care of all that shed have pulled her arm away if shed had the energy or so she told herself the reason im here is to promote my book he finished easily if it makes you feel better ive been known to do the same when i traveled with your predecessor the very fact that it did made her feel foolish as well i appreciate it carlo its not that i mind you lending a hand its that im not used to it youd be surprised how many authors are either helpless or careless on the road youd be surprised how many chefs are temperamental and rude she thought of the basil and grinned no oh yes and though hed read her thoughts perfectly his tone remained grave always flying off the handle swearing throwing things it leads to a bad reputation for all of us here theyre boarding if only they have a decent bordeaux juliet stifled a yawn as she followed him through ill need my boarding pass carlo i have it he flashed them both for the flight attendant and nudged juliet ahead do you want the window or the aisle i need my pass to see which ive got we have a and b take your pick someone pushed past her and bumped her solidly it brought a sinking sensation of deja vu carlo im in coach so no your tickets are changed take the window before she could object hed maneuvered her over and slipped in beside her what do you mean my tickets been changed carlo i have to get in the back before i cause a scene your seats here after handing juliet her boarding pass he stretched out his legs dio what a relief frowning juliet studied her stub a i dont know how they couldve made a mistake like this id better see to it right away theres no mistake you should fasten your belt he advised then did so himself i changed your tickets for the remaining flights on the tour juliet reached to undo the clasp hed just secured you but you cant i told you dont say cant to franconi satisfied with her belt he dealt with his own you work as hard as i do why should you travel in tourist because im paid to work carlo let me out so i can fix this before we take off no for the first time his voice was blunt and final i prefer your company to that of a stranger or an empty seat when he turned his head his eyes were like his voice i want you here leave it juliet opened her mouth and closed it again professionally she was on shaky ground either direction she went she was supposed to see to his needs and wants within reason personally shed counted on the distance at least during flight time to keep her balanced with carlo even a little distance could help he was being kind she knew considerate but he was also being stubborn there was always a diplomatic way to handle such things she gave him a patient smile carlo he stopped her by simply closing his mouth over hers quietly completely and irresistibly he held her there a moment one hand on her cheek the other over the fingers which had frozen in her lap juliet felt the floor tilt and her head go light were taking off she thought dimly but knew the plane hadnt left the ground his tongue touched hers briefly teasingly then it was only his lips again after brushing a hand through her hair he leaned back now go back to sleep awhile he advised this isnt the place id choose to seduce you sometimes juliet decided silence was the best diplomacy without another word she closed her eyes and slept chapter contents prev next colorado the rockies pikes peak indian ruins aspens and fastrunning streams it sounded beautiful exciting but a hotel room was a hotel room after all theyd been busy in washington state for most of their threeday stay juliet had had to work and think on her feet but the media had been outstanding their schedule had been so full her boss back in new york had probably done handstands her report on their run on the coast would be a publicists dream then there was denver what coverage shed managed to hustle there would barely justify the plane fare one talk show at the ungodly hour of am and one miserly article in the food section of a local paper no network or local news coverage of the autographing no print reporter whod confirm an appearance lousy it was am when juliet dragged herself out of the shower and began to search through her unpacked garment bag for a suit and a fresh blouse the cleaners was definitely a priority the minute they moved on to dallas at least carlo wasnt cooking this morning she didnt think she could bear to look at food in any form for at least two hours with any luck she could come back to the hotel after the show catch another hours sleep and then have breakfast in her room while she made her morning calls the autographing wasnt until noon and their flight out wasnt until early the next morning that was something to hold on to juliet told herself as she looked for the right shade of stockings for the first time in a week they had an evening free with no one to entertain no one to be entertained by a nice quiet meal somewhere close by and a full nights sleep with that at the end of the tunnel she could get through the morning with a grimace she gulped down her daily dose of brewers yeast it wasnt until she was fully dressed that she woke up enough to remember she hadnt dealt with her makeup with a shrug juliet slipped out of her little green jacket and headed for the bathroom she stared at the front door with a combination of suspicion and bad temper when she heard the knock peeking through the peephole she focused on carlo he grinned at her then crossed his eyes she only swore a little as she pulled open the door youre early she began then caught the stirring aroma of coffee looking down she saw that he carried a tray with a small pot cups and spoons coffee she murmured almost like a prayer yes he nodded as he stepped into the room i thought youd be ready though room service isnt he walked over to a table saw that her room could fit into one section of his suite and set down the tray so we deliver bless you it was so sincere he grinned again as she crossed the room how did you manage it room service doesnt open for half an hour theres a small kitchen in my suite a bit primitive but adequate to brew coffee she took the first sip black and hot and she closed her eyes its wonderful really wonderful of course i fixed it she opened her eyes again no she decided she wouldnt spoil gratitude with sarcasm after all theyd very nearly gotten along for three days running with the help of her shower the yeast and the coffee she was feeling almost human again relax she suggested ill finish getting ready expecting him to sit juliet took her cup and went into the bathroom to deal with her face and hair she was dotting on foundation when carlo leaned on the doorjamb mi amore doesnt this arrangement strike you as impractical she tried not to feel selfconscious as she smoothed on the thin translucent base which arrangement is that you have this broom closet he decided as he gestured toward her room yes it was small enough that the subtle feminine scent from her shower reached all the corners while i have a big suite with two baths a bed big enough for three friends and one of those sofas that unfold youre the star she murmured as she brushed color over the slant of her cheeks it would save the publisher money if we shared the suite she shifted her eyes in the mirror until they met his shed have sworn absolutely sworn he meant no more than that that is if she hadnt known him he can afford it she said lightly it just thrills the accounting department at tax time carlo moved his shoulders then sipped from his cup again hed known what her answer would be of course hed enjoy sharing his rooms with her for the obvious reason but neither did it sit well with him that her accommodations were so far inferior to his you need a touch more blusher on your left cheek he said idly not noticing her surprised look what hed noticed was the green silk robe that reflected in the mirror from the back of the door just how would she look in that carlo wondered how would she look out of it after a narrowedeyed study juliet discovered hed been right she picked up her brush again and evened the color youre a very observant man hmm he was looking at her again but mentally hed changed her neat highcollared blouse and slim skirt for the provocative little robe most men wouldnt notice unbalanced blusher she picked up a grease pencil to shadow her eyes i notice everything when it comes to a woman there was still a light fog near the top of the mirror from the steam of her shower seeing it gave carlo other rather pleasant mental images what youre doing now gives you a much different look relaxed again she laughed thats the idea but no he stepped in closer so he could watch over her shoulder the small casual intimacy was as natural for him as it was uncomfortable for her without the pots of paint your face is younger more vulnerable but no less attractive than it is with them different easily he picked up her brush and ran it through her hair its not more not less simply different i like both of your looks it wasnt easy to keep her hand steady juliet set down the eyeshadow and tried the coffee instead better to be cynical than be moved she reminded herself and gave him a cool smile you seem right at home in the bathroom with a woman fixing her face he liked the way her hair flowed as he brushed it ive done it so often her smile became cooler im sure he caught the tone but continued to brush as he met her eyes in the glass take it as you like cara but remember i grew up in a house with five women your powders and bottles hold no secrets from me shed forgotten that perhaps because shed chosen to forget anything about him that didnt connect directly with the book yet now it made her wonder just what sort of insight did a man get into women when hed been surrounded by them since childhood frowning a bit she picked up her mascara were you a close family we are a close family he corrected my mothers a widow who runs a successful dress shop in rome it was typical of him not to mention that hed bought it for her my four sisters all live within thirty kilometers perhaps i no longer share the bathroom with them but little else changes she thought about it it sounded cozy and easy and rather sweet juliet didnt believe she could relate at all your mother must be proud of you shed be prouder if i added to her growing horde of grandchildren she smiled at that it sounded more familiar i know what you mean you should leave your hair just like this he told her as he set down the brush you have a family my parents live in pennsylvania he struggled with geography a moment ah then youll visit them when we go to philadelphia no the word was flat as she recapped the tube of mascara there wont be time for that i see and he thought he was beginning to you have brothers sisters a sister because he was right about her hair juliet let it be and slipped out for her jacket she married a doctor and produced two children one of each gender before she was twentyfive oh yes he was beginning to see well enough though the words had been easy the muscles in her shoulders had been tight she makes an excellent doctors wife carrie makes a perfect doctors wife not all of us are meant for the same things i wasnt she picked up her briefcase and her purse wed better get going they said it would take about fifteen minutes to drive to the studio strange he thought how people always believed their tender spots could go undetected for now hed leave her with the illusion that hers had because the directions were good and the traffic was light juliet drove the late model chevy shed rented with confidence carlo obliged by navigating because he enjoyed the poised skilled way she handled the wheel you havent lectured me on todays schedule he pointed out turn right here at this light juliet glanced in the mirror switched lanes then made the turn she wasnt yet sure what his reaction would be to the fact that there barely was one ive decided to give you a break she said brightly knowing how some authors snarled and ranted when they had a dip in exposure you have this morning spot then the autographing at world of books downtown he waited expecting the list to go on when he turned to her his brow was lifted and thats all she heard the apology in her voice as she stopped at a red light it happens sometimes carlo things just dont come through i knew it was going to be light here but as it happens theyve just started shooting a major film using denver locations every reporter every news team every camera crew is covering it this afternoon the bottom line is we got bumped bumped do you mean there is no radio show no lunch with a reporter no dinner engagement no im sorry its just fantastico grabbing her face with both hands he kissed her hard ill find out the name of this movie and go to its premiere the little knot of tension and guilt vanished dont take it so hard carlo he felt as though hed just been paroled juliet did you think id be upset dio for a week its been nothing but go here rush there she spotted the tv tower and turned left youve been wonderful she told him the best time to admit it she decided was when they only had two minutes to spare not everyone ive toured with has been as considerate she surprised him he preferred it when a woman could do so he twined a lock of the hair hed brushed around his finger so youve forgiven me for the basil she smiled and had to stop herself from reaching up to touch the heart on her lapel id forgotten all about it he kissed her cheek in a move so casual and friendly she didnt object i believe you have youve a kind heart juliet such things are beauty in themselves he could soften her so effortlessly she felt it fought it and for the moment surrendered to it in an impulsive uncharacteristic move she brushed the hair on his forehead lets go in youve got to wake up denver professionally juliet shouldve been cranky at the lack of obligations and exposure in denver it was going to leave a few very obvious blanks on her overall report personally she was thrilled according to schedule she was back in her room by eight by shed stripped out of her suit and had crawled naked and happy into her stillrumpled bed for exactly an hour she slept deeply and without any dreams she could remember by tenthirty shed gone through her list of phone calls and an enormous breakfast after freshening her makeup she dressed in her suit then went downstairs to meet carlo in the lobby it shouldnt have surprised her that he was huddled in one of the cozy lounging areas with three women it shouldnt have irked her pretending it did neither juliet strolled over it was then she noticed that all three women were built stupendously that shouldnt have surprised her either ah juliet he smiled all grace all charm she didnt stop to wonder why shed like to deck him always prompt ladies he turned to bow to all three of them its been a pleasure byebye carlo one of them sent him a look that could have melted lead remember if youre ever in tucson how could i forget hooking his arm with juliets he strolled outside juliet he murmured where is tucson dont you ever quit she demanded quit what collecting women he lifted a brow as he pulled open the door on the drivers side juliet one collects matchbooks not women it would seem there are some who consider them on the same level he blocked her way before she could slip inside any who do are too stupid to matter he walked around the side of the car and opened his own door before she spoke again who were they anyhow soberly carlo adjusted the brim of the buffcolored fedora he wore female bodybuilders it seems theyre having a convention a muffled laugh escaped before she could prevent it figures indeed yes but such muscular ones his expression was still grave as he lowered himself into the car juliet remained quiet a moment then gave up and laughed out loud damn shed never had as much fun on tour with anyone she might as well accept it tucsons in arizona she told him with another laugh and its not on the itinerary they would have been on time for the autographing if they hadnt run into the detour traffic was clogged rerouted and bad tempered as roads were blocked off for the film being shot juliet spent twenty minutes weaving negotiating and cursing until she found shed done no more than make a nice big circle weve been here before carlo said idly and received a glowering look oh really her sweet tone had an undertone of arsenic he merely shifted his legs into a less cramped position its an interesting city he commented i think perhaps if you turn right at the next corner then left two corners beyond well find ourselves on the right track juliet meticulously smoothed her carefully written directions when shed have preferred to crumple them into a ball the book clerk specifically said im sure shes a lovely woman but things seem a bit confused today it didnt particularly bother him the blast of a horn made her jolt amused carlo merely looked over as someone from new york city you should be used to such things juliet set her teeth i never drive in the city i do trust me innamorata not on your life juliet thought but turned right it took nearly ten minutes in the crawling traffic to manage the next two blocks but when she turned left she found herself as carlo had said on the right track she waited resigned for him to gloat rome moves faster was all he said how could she anticipate him she wondered he didnt rage when you expected didnt gloat when it was natural with a sigh she gave up anything moves faster she found herself in the right block but parking space was at a premium weighing the ins and outs juliet swung over beside a car at the curb look carlo im going to have to drop you off were already running behind ill find a place to park and be back as soon as i can youre the boss he said still cheerful after fortyfive minutes of teethgrinding traffic if im not there in an hour send up a flare my moneys on you still cautious she waited until she saw him swing into the bookstore before she fought her way into traffic again twenty frustrating minutes later juliet walked into the dignified little bookstore herself it was she noted with a sinking stomach too quiet and too empty a clerk with a thinstriped tie and shined shoes greeted her good morning may i help you im juliet trent mr franconis publicist ah yes right this way he glided across the carpet to a set of wide steps mr franconis on the second level its unfortunate that the traffic and confusion have discouraged people from coming out of course we rarely do these things he gave her a smile and brushed a piece of lint from the sleeve of his dark blue jacket the last time was let me see in the fall j jonathan cooper was on tour im sure youve heard of him he wrote metaphysical force and you juliet bit back a sigh when you hit dry ground you just had to wait for the tide she spotted carlo in a lovely little alcove on a curvy love seat beside him was a woman of about forty with a neat suit and pretty legs such things didnt warrant even a raised brow but to juliets surprise carlo wasnt busy charming her instead he was listening intently to a young boy who sat across from him ive worked in the kitchens there for the last three summers im not allowed to actually prepare anything but i can watch at home i cook whenever can but with school and the job its mostly on weekends why the boy stopped in midstream and looked blank why why do you cook carlo asked he acknowledged juliet with a nod then gave his attention back to the boy because the boy looked at his mother then back at carlo well its important i like to take things and put them together you have to concentrate you know and be careful but you can make something really terrific it looks good and it smells good its i dont know his voice lowered in embarrassment satisfying i guess yes pleased carlo smiled at him thats a good answer i have both your other books the boy blurted out ive tried all your recipes i even made your pasta al tre formaggi for this dinner party at my aunts and they liked it the boy grinned i mean they really liked it you want to study oh yeah but the boy dropped his gaze to where his hands rubbed nervously over his knees thing is we cant really afford college right now so im hoping to get some restaurant work in denver any place where i could start cooking instead of wiping up weve taken up enough of mr franconis time the boys mother rose noting there was now a handful of people milling around on the second level with carlos books in hand i want to thank you she offered her hand to carlo as he rose with her it meant a great deal to steven to talk with you my pleasure though he was gracious as always he turned back to the boy perhaps youd give me your address i know of some restaurant owners here in the states perhaps one of them needs an apprentice chef stunned steven could do nothing but stare youre very kind his mother took out a small pad and wrote on it her hand was steady but when she handed the paper to carlo and looked at him he saw the emotion he thought of his own mother he took the paper then her hand you have a fortunate son mrs hardesty thoughtful juliet watched them walk away noting that steven looked over his shoulder with the same blank baffled expression so he has a heart juliet decided touched a heart that wasnt altogether reserved for amore but she saw carlo slip the paper into his pocket and wondered if that would be the end of it the autographing wasnt a smashing success six books by juliets count that had been bad enough but then thered been the incident looking at the all but empty store juliet had considered hitting the streets with a sign on her back then the homey little woman had come along bearing all three of carlos books good for the ego juliet thought that was before the woman had said something that caused carlos eyes to chill and his voice to freeze all juliet heard was the name labare i beg your pardon madame carlo said in a tone juliet had never heard from him it couldve sliced through steel i said i keep all your books on a shelf in my kitchen right next to andre labares i love to cook labare carlo put his hand over his stack of books as a protective parent might over a threatened child you would dare put my work next to that that peasants thinking fast juliet stepped up and broke into the conversation if ever shed seen a man ready to murder it was carlo oh i see you have all of mr franconis books you must love to cook well yes i wait until you try some of his new recipes i had the pasta con pesto myself its wonderful juliet started to take the womans books from under carlos hand and met with resistance and a stubborn look she gave him one of her own and jerked the books away your familys going to be just thrilled when you serve it juliet went on keeping her voice pleasant as she led the woman out of the line of fire and the fettuccine labare is a swine carlos voice was very clear and reached the stairs the woman glanced back nervously men juliet made her voice a conspiratorial whisper such egos yes gathering up her books the woman hurried down the stairs and out of the store juliet waited until she was out of earshot before she pounced on carlo how could you how could i he rose and though he skimmed just under six feet he looked enormous she would dare speak that name to me she would dare associate the work of an artist with the work of a jackass labare at the moment i dont give a damn who or what this labare is juliet put a hand on his shoulder and shoved him back onto the love seat what i do care about is you scaring off the few customers we have now behave yourself he sat where he was only because he admired the way shed ordered him to fascinating woman carlo decided finding it wiser to think of her than labare it was wiser to think of flood and famine than of labare the afternoon had dragged on and on except for the young boy carlo thought and touched the paper in his pocket hed call summer in philadelphia about young steven hardesty but other than steven and the woman who upped his blood pressure by speaking of labare carlo had found himself perilously close to boredom something he considered worse than illness he needed some activity a challenge even a small one he glanced over at juliet as she spoke with a clerk that was no small challenge the one thing hed yet to be in juliets company was bored she kept him interested sexually yes that went without saying intellectually that was a plus a big one he understood women it wasnt a matter of pride but to carlos thinking a matter of circumstance he enjoyed women as lovers of course but he also enjoyed them as companions as friends as associates it was a rare thing when a man could find a woman to be all of those things thats what he wanted from juliet he hadnt resolved it yet only felt it convincing her to be his friend would be as challenging and as rewarding as it would be to convince her to be his lover no he realized as he studied her profile with this woman a lover would come easier than a friend he had two weeks left to accomplish both with a smile he decided to start the campaign in earnest half an hour later they were walking the three blocks to the parking garage juliet had found this time i drive he told juliet as they stepped inside the echoing gray building when she started to object he held out his hand for the keys come my love ive just survived two hours of boredom why should you have all the fun since you put it that way she dropped the keys in his hand relieved that whatever had set him off before was forgotten so now we have a free evening thats right with a sigh she leaned back in her seat and waited for him to start the engine well have dinner at seven tonight i make the arrangements a hamburger in her room an old movie and bed juliet let the wish come and go her job was to pamper and entertain as much as possible whatever you like carlo pulled out of the parking space with a squeal of tires that had juliet bolting up ill hold you to that cam he zoomed out of the garage and turned right with hardly a pause carlo we should have champagne to celebrate the end of our first week you like champagne yes i carlo the lights changing he breezed through the amber light skimmed by the bumper of a battered compact and kept going italian food you have no objection no she gripped the door handle until her knuckles turned white that truck yes i see it he swerved around it zipped through another light and cut a sharp right you have plans for the afternoon juliet pressed a hand to her throat thinking she might be able to push out her voice i was thinking of making use of the hotel spa if i live good me i think ill go shopping juliets teeth snapped together as he changed lanes in bumpertobumper traffic how do i notify next of kin with a laugh carlo swung in front of their hotel dont worry juliet have your whirlpool and your sauna knock on my door at seven she looked back toward the street pamper and entertain she remembered did that include risking your life her supervisor would think so maybe i should go with you no i insist he leaned over cupping her neck before shed recovered enough to evade enjoy he murmured lightly against her lips and think of me as your skin grows warm and your muscles grow lax in selfdefense juliet hurried out of the car before she could tell him to drive carefully he was barreling back out into the street she offered a prayer for italian maniacs then went inside by seven she felt reborn shed sweated out fatigue in the sauna shocked herself awake in the pool and splurged on a massage life she thought as she splashed on her scent had its good points after all tomorrows flight to dallas would be soon enough to draft her denver report such as it was tonight all she had to worry about was eating after pressing a hand to her stomach juliet admitted she was more than ready for that with a quick check she approved the simple ivory dress with the high collar and tiny pearly buttons unless carlo had picked a hot dog stand it would suit grabbing her evening bag she slipped across the hall to knock on carlos door she only hoped hed chosen some place close by the last thing she wanted to do was fight denvers downtown traffic again the first thing she noticed when carlo opened his door were the rolled up sleeves of his shirt it was cotton oversized and chic but her eyes were drawn to the surprising cord of muscles in his forearms the man did more than lift spoons and spatulas the next thing she noticed was the erotic scents of spices and sauce lovely carlo took both hands and drew her inside she pleased him the smooth creamy skin the light subtle scent but more the confused hesitation in her eyes as she glanced over to where the aroma of food was strongest an interesting cologne she managed after a moment but dont you think youve gotten a bit carried away innamorata you dont wear franconis spaghetti sauce you absorb it he kissed the back of her hand anticipate it then the other savor it this time her palm a smart woman wasnt aroused by a man who used such flamboyant tactics juliet told herself that as the chills raced up her arms and down again spaghetti sauce slipping her hands from his she linked them behind her back i found a wonderful shop the spices pleased me very much the burgundy was excellent italian of course of course cautious she stepped farther into the suite you spent the day cooking yes though you should remind me to speak to the hotel owner about the quality of this stove all in all it went quite well she told herself it wasnt wise to encourage him when she had no intention of eating alone with him in his suite perhaps if shed been made out of rock she could have resisted wandering toward the little kitchenette her mouth watered oh god delighted carlo slipped an arm around her waist and led her to the stove the little kitchen itself was in shambles shed never seen so many pots and bowls and spoons jammed into a sink before counters were splattered and streaked but the smells it was heaven pure and simple the senses juliet theres not one of us who isnt ruled by them first you smell and you begin to imagine his fingers moved lightly over her waist imagine you can almost taste it on your tongue from that alone hmm knowing she was making a mistake she watched him take the lid off the pot on the stove the tang made her close her eyes and just breathe oh carlo then we look and the imagination goes one step further his fingers squeezed lightly at her waist until she opened her eyes and looked into the pot thick red simmering the sauce was chunky with meat peppers and spice her stomach growled beautiful yes yes she wasnt aware that her tongue slid out over her lips in anticipation he was and we hear beside the sauce a pot of water began to boil in an expert move he measured pasta by sight and slid it in some things are destined to be mated with a slotted spoon he stirred gently without each other they are incomplete but when merged he adjusted the flame a treasure pasta and the sauce a man and a woman come youll have some burgundy the champagnes for later it was time to take a stand even though she took it by the stove carlo i had no idea this was what you intended i think i like surprises he handed her a glass half filled with dark red wine and i wanted to cook for you she wished he hadnt put it quite that way she wished his voice wasnt so warm so deep like his eyes like the feelings he could urge out of her i appreciate that carlo its just that you had your sauna yes i did now it relaxed you it shows she sighed sipping at the wine without thinking yes this relaxes me we eat together tonight he tapped his glass to hers men and women have done so for centuries it has become civilized her chin tilted youre making fun of me yes ducking into the refrigerator he pulled out a small tray first youll try my antipasto your palate should be prepared juliet chose a little chunk of zucchini id think youd prefer being served in a restaurant now and then there are times i prefer privacy he set down the tray as he did she took a small step back interested he lifted a brow juliet do i make you nervous she swallowed zucchini dont be absurd am i on impulse he set his wine down as well and took another step toward her juliet found her back pressed into the refrigerator carlo no shh we experiment gently watching her he brushed his lips over one cheek then the other he heard her breath catch then shudder out nerves these he accepted when a man and woman were attracted and close there had to be nerves without them passion was bland like a sauce without spice but fear wasnt that what he saw in her eyes just a trace of it only briefly nerves hed use play on exploit fear was something different it disturbed him blocked him and at the same time moved him i wont hurt you juliet her eyes were direct again level though her hand was balled into a fist wont you he took her hand slowly working it open no in that moment he promised both of them i wont now well eat juliet held off the shudder until hed turned around to stir and drain his pasta perhaps he wouldnt hurt her she thought and recklessly tossed back her wine but she might hurt herself he didnt fuss he merely perfected it occurred to juliet as she watched him put the last touches on the meal that he was no different here in the little hotel kitchen than hed been before the camera juliet added her help in the only way shed have dared she set the table yes it was a mistake she told herself as she arranged plates but no one but a fool would walk away from anything that smelled like that sauce she wasnt a fool she could handle herself the moment of weak fear shed felt in the kitchen was past shed enjoy a takeyourshoesoff meal drink two glasses of really excellent burgundy then go across the hall and catch eight hours sleep the merrygoround would continue the next day she selected a marinated mushroom as carlo brought in the platter of spaghetti better he said when she smiled at him youre ready to enjoy yourself with a shrug juliet sat if one of the top chefs in the world wants to cook me dinner why should i complain the top he corrected and gestured for her to serve herself she did barely conquering greed does it really relax you to stand in a kitchen it depends sometimes it relaxes sometimes it excites always it pleases no dont cut with a shake of his head he reached over americans you roll it onto the fork it falls off when i do like this with his hands on her wrists he guided her her pulse was steady he noted but not slow now still holding her hand he lifted the fork toward her mouth taste as she did he had the satisfaction of watching her face spices exploded on her tongue heat seeped through mellowing to warmth she savored it even as she thought of the next bite oh this is no little sin nothing could have delighted him more with a laugh he sat back and started on his own plate small sins are only small pleasures when franconi cooks for you food is not a basic necessity she was already rolling the next forkful you win that one why arent you fat prego if i could cook like this she tasted again and sighed id look like one of your meatballs with a chuckle he watched her dig in it pleased him to see someone he cared for enjoying what hed created after years of cooking hed never tired of it so your mother didnt teach you to cook she tried juliet accepted a piece of the crusty bread he offered but set it aside as she rolled more spaghetti first things first i never seemed to be very good at the things she wanted me to be good at my sister plays the piano beautifully i can barely remember the scales so what did you want to do instead of taking piano lessons play third base it came out so easily it stunned her juliet had thought shed buried that along with a dozen other childhood frustrations it just wasnt done she said with a shrug my mother was determined to raise two well rounded ladies who would become two well rounded successful wives win some lose some you think shes not proud of you the question hit a target she hadnt known was exposed juliet reached for her wine its not a matter of pride but of disappointment i suppose i disappointed her i confused my father they still wonder what they did wrong what they did wrong was not to accept what you are maybe she murmured or maybe i was determined to be something they couldnt accept ive never worked it out are you unhappy with your life surprised she glanced up unhappy sometimes frustrated harassed and pressured but unhappy no no im not then perhaps thats your answer juliet took a moment to study him he was more than gorgeous more than sexy more than all those qualities shed once cynically attributed to him carlo for the first time she reached out to touch him just his hand but he thought it a giant step youre a very nice man but of course i am his fingers curled over hers because he couldnt resist i could give you references with a laugh juliet backed off im sure you could with concentration dedication and just plain greed she cleared off her plate time for dessert carlo moaning juliet pressed a hand to her stomach please dont be cruel youll like it he was up and in the kitchen before she found the strength to refuse again its an old old italian tradition back to the empire american cheesecake is sometimes excellent but this he brought out a small lovely cake with cherries dripping lavishly over it carlo ill die just a taste with the champagne he popped the cork with an expert twist and poured two fresh glasses go sit on the sofa be comfortable as she did juliet realized why the romans traditionally slept after a meal she couldve curled up in a happy little ball and been unconscious in moments but the champagne was lively insistent here he brought over one plate with a small slice well share one bite she told him prepared to stand firm then she tasted creamy smooth not quite sweet more nutty exquisite with a sigh of surrender juliet took another carlo youre a magician artist he corrected whatever you want using all the will power she had left juliet exchanged the cake for champagne i really cant eat another bite yes i remember you dont believe in overindulgence but he filled her glass again maybe not she sipped enjoying that rich luxurious aura only champagne could give but now ive gotten a different perspective on indulgence slipping out of her shoes she laughed over the rim of her glass im converted youre lovely the lights were low the music soft the scents lingering and rich he thought of resisting the fear that had been in her eyes demanded he think of it but just now she was relaxed smiling the desire hed felt tug the moment hed seen her had never completely gone away senses were aroused heightened by a meal that was something he understood perfectly he also understood that a man and a woman should never ignore whatever pleasure they could give to each other so he didnt resist but took her face in his hands there he could watch her eyes feel her skin nearly taste her this time he saw desire not fear but wariness perhaps she was ready for lesson two she could have refused the need to do so went through her mind but his hands were so strong so gentle on her skin shed never been touched like that before she knew how hed kiss her and the sense of anticipation mixed with nerves she knew and wanted wasnt she a woman who knew her own mind she took her hands to his wrists but didnt push away her fingers curled around and held as she touched her mouth to his for a moment they stayed just so allowing themselves to savor that first taste that first sensation then slowly mutually they asked for more she seemed so small when he held her that a man could forget how strong and competent she was he found himself wanting to treasure desire might burn but when she was so pliant so vulnerable he found himself compelled to show only gentleness had any man ever shown her such care juliets head began to swim as his hands moved into her hair was there another man so patient his heart was pounding against hers she could feel it like something wild and desperate but his mouth was so soft his hands so gentle as though theyd been lovers for years she thought dimly and had all the time left in the world to continue to love no hurry no rush no frenzy just pleasure her heart opened reluctantly but it opened he began to pour through when the phone shrilled he swore and she sighed theyd both been prepared to take all the chances only a moment he murmured still dreaming she touched his cheek all right as he went to answer she leaned back determined not to think cara the enthusiasm in his voice and the endearment had her opening her eyes again with a warm laugh carlo went into a stream of italian juliet had no choice but to think affection yes it was in his voice she didnt have to understand the words she looked around to see him smiling as he spoke to the woman on the other end resigned juliet picked up her champagne it wasnt easy for her to admit shed been a fool or for her to admit shed been hurt she knew who he was what he was she knew how many women hed seduced perhaps she was a woman who knew her own mind and perhaps she wanted him but she would never be eased into a long line of others setting down the champagne she rose si si i love you juliet turned away at the phrase i love you how well it slid off his tongue in any language how little it meant in any language interruptions im sorry juliet turned back and gave him her uncompromising look dont be the dinner was marvelous carlo thank you you should be ready to check out by eight a moment he murmured crossing over he took her by the arms whats this youre angry of course not she tried to back away and failed it was easy to forget just how strong he was why should i be reasons arent always necessary for a woman though hed said it in a simple tone that offered no insult her eyes narrowed the expert well let me tell you something about this woman franconi she doesnt think much of a man who makes love to her one minute then pushes another lover in her face the next he held up his hand as he struggled to follow her drift im not following you maybe my english is failing your english is perfect she spit at him from what i just heard sos your italian my his grin broke out the phone yes the phone now if youll excuse me he let her get as far as the door juliet i admit im hopelessly enamored of the woman i was speaking to shes beautiful intelligent interesting and ive never met anyone quite like her furious juliet whirled around how marvelous i think so it was my mother she walked back to snatch up the purse shed nearly forgotten id think a man of your experience and imagination could do better so i could he held her again not so gently not so patiently if it was necessary i dont make a habit to explain myself and when i do i dont lie she took a deep breath because she was abruptly certain she was hearing the truth either way shed been a fool im sorry its none of my business in any case no its not he took her chin in his hand and held it i saw fear in your eyes before it concerned me now i think it wasnt me you were afraid of but yourself thats none of your business no its not he said again you appeal to me juliet in many ways and i intend to take you to bed but well wait until you arent afraid she wanted to rage at him she wanted to weep he saw both things clearly we have an early flight in the morning carlo he let her go but stood where he was for a long time after hed heard her door shut across the hall chapter contents prev next dallas was different dallas was dallas without apology texas rich texas big and texas arrogant if it was the city that epitomized the state then it did so with flair futuristic architecture and mindtwisting freeways abounded in a strange kind of harmony with the more sedate buildings downtown the air was hot and carried the scents of oil expensive perfumes and prairie dust dallas was dallas but it had never forgotten its roots dallas held the excitement of a boomtown that was determined not to stop booming it was full of downhome american energy that wasnt about to lag as far as juliet was concerned they could have been in downtown timbuktu he acted as though nothing had happened no intimate dinner no arousal no surrender no cross words juliet wondered if he did it to drive her crazy carlo was amiable cooperative and charming she knew better now under the amiability was a shaft of steel that wouldnt bend an inch shed seen it one could say shed felt it it would have been a lie to say she didnt admire it cooperative sure in his favor juliet had to admit that shed never been on tour with anyone as willing to work without complaint and touring was hard work no matter how glamorous it looked on paper once you were into your second full week it became difficult to smile unless you were cued carlo never broke his rhythm but he expected perfection spelled his way and wouldnt budge an inch until he got it charming no one could enchant a group of people with more style than franconi that alone made her job easier no one would deny his charm unless theyd seen how cold his eyes could become she had he had flaws like any other man juliet thought remembering that might help her keep an emotional distance it always helped her to list the pros and cons of a situation even if the situation was a man the trouble was though flawed he was damn near irresistible and he knew it that was something else she had to remind herself of his ego was no small matter that was something shed be wise to balance against his unrestricted generosity vanity about himself and his work went over the border into arrogance it didnt hurt her sense of perspective to weigh that against his innate consideration for others but then there was the way he smiled the way he said her name even the practical professional juliet trent had a difficult time finding a flaw to balance those little details the two days in dallas were busy enough to keep her driving along on six hours sleep plenty of vitamins and oceans of coffee they were making up for denver all right she had the leg cramps to prove it four minutes on the national news an interview with one of the top magazines in the country three writeups in the dallas press and two autograph sessions that sold clean out there was more but those headed up her report when she went back to new york shed go back in triumph she didnt want to think of the dinners with department store executives that started at pm and lasted until she was falling asleep in her bananas flambé she couldnt bear to count the lunches of poached salmon or shrimp salad shed had to refill her pocket aspirin bottles and stock up on antacids but it was worth it she should have been thrilled she was miserable she was driving him mad polite carlo thought as they prepared to sit through another luncheon interview yes she was polite her mother had taught her perfect manners even if she hadnt taught her to cook competent as far as he was concerned hed never known anyone male or female who was as scrupulously competent as juliet trent hed always admired that particular quality in a companion insisted on it in an associate of course juliet was both precise prompt cool in a crisis and unflaggingly energetic admirable qualities all for the first time in his life he gave serious thought to strangling a woman indifferent thats what he couldnt abide she acted as though there was nothing more between them than the next interview the next television spot the next plane she acted as though thered been no flare of need of passion of understanding between them one would think she didnt want him with the same intensity that he wanted her he knew better didnt he he could remember her ripe unhesitating response to him mouth to mouth body to body thered been no indifference in the way her arms had held him no thered been strength pliancy need demand but no indifference yet now theyd spent nearly two days exclusively in each others company but hed seen nothing in her eyes heard nothing in her voice that indicated more than a polite business association they ate together drove together worked together they did everything but sleep together hed had his fill of polite but he hadnt had his fill of juliet he thought of her it didnt bruise carlos pride to admit he thought of her a great deal he often thought of women and why not when a man didnt think of a woman he was better off dead he wanted her it didnt worry him to admit that he wanted her more every time he thought of her hed wanted many women hed never believed in selfdenial when a man didnt want a woman he was dead but carlo found it odd that buts so often followed any thoughts he had on juliet but he found himself dwelling on her more often than hed have once considered healthy though he didnt mind wanting a woman until he ached he found juliet could make him ache more than hed have once considered comfortable he might have been able to rationalize the threat to his health and comfort but she was so damn indifferent if he did nothing else in the short time they had left in dallas he was going to change that lunch was white linen heavy silver flatware and thin crystal the room was done in tones of dusty rose and pastel greens the murmur of conversation was just as quiet carlo thought it a pity they couldnt have met the reporter at one of the little texmex restaurants over mexican beer with chili and nachos briefly he promised himself hed rectify that in houston he barely noticed the reporter was young and running on nerves as they took their seats hed decided no matter what it took hed break through juliets inflexible shield of politeness before they stood up again even if he had to play dirty im so happy you included dallas on your tour mr franconi the reporter began already reaching for her water glass to clear her throat mr van ness sends his apologies he was looking forward to meeting you carlo smiled at her but his mind was on juliet yes mr van ness is the food editor for the tribune juliet spread her napkin over her lap as she gave carlo information shed related less than fifteen minutes before she sent him the friendliest of smiles and hoped he felt the barbs in it ms tribly is filling in for him of course carlo smoothed over the gap of attention charmingly im sure as a woman she wasnt immune to that topcream voice as a reporter she was well aware of the importance of her assignment its all pretty confused ms tribly wiped damp hands on her napkin mr van ness is having a baby that is what i mean is his wife went into labor just a couple of hours ago so we should drink to them carlo signaled a waiter margaritas he phrased the question as a statement earned a cool nod from juliet and a grateful smile from the reporter determined to pull off her first really big assignment ms tribly balanced a pad discreetly on her lap have you been enjoying your tour through america mr franconi i always enjoy america lightly he ran a finger over the back of juliets hand before she could move it out of reach especially in the company of a beautiful woman she started to slide her hand away then felt it pinned under his for a man who could whip up the most delicate of soufflés his hands were as strong as a boxers wills sparked clashed and fumed carlos voice remained mild soft and romantic i must tell you ms tribly juliet is an extraordinary woman i couldnt manage without her mr franconis very kind though juliets voice was as mild and quiet as his the nudge she gave him under the table wasnt i handle the details mr franconis the artist we make an admirable team wouldnt you say ms tribly yes not quite sure how to handle that particular line she veered off to safer ground mr franconi besides writing cookbooks you own and run a successful restaurant in rome and occasionally travel to prepare a special dish a few months ago you flew to a yacht in the aegean to cook minestrone for dimitri azares the shipping magnate his birthday carlo recalled his daughter arranged a surprise again his gaze skimmed over the woman whose hand he held juliet will tell you im fond of surprises yes well ms tribly reached for her water glass again your schedules so full and exciting i wonder if you still enjoy the basics as far as cooking most people think of cooking as anything from a chore to a hobby but as ive told juliet his fingers twined possessively with hers food is a basic need like making love it should appeal to all the senses it should excite arouse satisfy he slipped his thumb around to skim over her palm you remember juliet shed tried to forget had told herself she could now with that light insistent brush of thumb he was bringing it all back mr franconi is a strong believer in the sensuality of food his unusual flair for bringing this out has made him one of the top chefs in the world grazie mi amore he murmured and brought her stiff hand to his lips she pressed her shoe down on the soft leather of his loafers and hoped she ground bones i think you and your readers will find that mr franconis book the italian way is a really stunning example of his technique his style and his opinions written in such a way that the average person following one of his recipes stepbystep can create something very special when their drinks were served juliet gave another tug on her hand thinking she might catch him off guard she should have known better to the new baby he smiled over at juliet its always a pleasure to drink to life in all its stages ms tribly sipped lightly at her margarita in a glass the size of a small birdbath mr franconi have you actually cooked and tasted every recipe thats in your book of course carlo enjoyed the quick tang of his drink there was a time for the sweet and a time for the tart his laugh came low and smooth as he looked at juliet when somethings mine theres nothing i dont learn about it a meal ms tribly is like a love affair she broke the tip of her pencil and hurriedly dug out another a love affair yes it begins slowly almost experimentally just a taste to whet the appetite to stir the anticipation then the flavor changes perhaps something light something cool to keep the senses stirred but not overwhelmed then theres the spice the meat the variety the senses are aroused the mind is focused on the pleasure it should be lingered over but finally theres dessert the time of indulgence when he smiled at juliet there was no mistaking his meaning it should be enjoyed slowly savored until the palate is satisfied and the body sated ms tribly swallowed im going to buy a copy of your book for myself with a laugh carlo picked up his menu suddenly i have a huge appetite juliet ordered a small fruit salad and picked at it for thirty minutes ive really got to get back after polishing off her meal and an apricot tart ms tribly gathered up her pad i cant tell you how much ive enjoyed this mr franconi im never going to sit down to pot roast with the same attitude again amused carlo rose it was a pleasure ill be glad to send a clipping of the article to your office ms trent id appreciate that juliet offered her hand surprised when the reporter held it an extra moment youre a lucky woman enjoy the rest of your tour mr franconi arrivederci he was still smiling when he sat down to finish his coffee you put on a hell of a show franconi hed been expecting the storm anticipating it yes i think i did my what was it you called it ah yes my spiel very well it was more like a threeact play with calm deliberate movements she signed the check but the next time dont cast me unless you ask first cast you his innocence was calculated to infuriate he never missed his mark you gave that woman the very clear impression that we were lovers juliet i merely gave her the very correct impression that i respect and admire you what she takes from that isnt my responsibility juliet rose placed her napkin very carefully on the table and picked up her briefcase swine carlo watched her walk out of the restaurant no endearment could have pleased him more when a woman called a man a swine she wasnt indifferent he was whistling when he walked out to join her it pleased him even more to see her fumbling with the keys of the rented car parked at the curb when a woman was indifferent she didnt swear at inanimate objects would you like me to drive to the airport no swearing again she jabbed the key into the lock shed control her temper she would control it like hell slamming both hands down on the roof of the car she stared at him just what was the point of that little charade squisito he thought briefly her eyes were a dangerous bladesharp green hed discovered he preferred a woman with temper charade all that handholding those intimate looks you were giving me its not a charade that i enjoy holding your hand and that i find it impossible not to look at you she refused to argue with the car between them in a few quick steps she was around the hood and toetotoe with him it was completely unprofessional yes it was completely personal it was going to be difficult to argue at all if he turned everything she said to his own advantage dont ever do it again madonna his voice was very mild his move very calculated juliet found herself boxed in between him and the car orders ill take from you when they have to do with schedules and plane flights when it comes to more personal things i do as i choose it wasnt something shed expected thats why she lost her advantage juliet would tell herself that again and again later he had her by both shoulders and his eyes never left hers as he gave her a quick jerk it wasnt the smooth calculated seduction shed have anticipated from him it was rough impulsive and enervating his mouth was on hers all demand his hands held her still all power she had no time to stiffen to struggle or to think he took her with him quickly through a journey of heat and light she didnt resist later when she would tell herself she had it would be a lie there were people on the sidewalk cars in the street juliet and carlo were unaware of everything the heat of a dallas afternoon soaked into the concrete beneath them it blasted the air until it hummed they were concerned with a fire of their own her hands were at his waist holding on letting go a car streaked by country rock blasting through open windows she never heard it though shed refused wine at lunch she tasted it on his tongue and was intoxicated later much later hed take time to think about what was happening it wasnt the same part of him already knew and feared because it wasnt the same touching her was different than touching other women tasting her lightly deeply teasingly just tasting her was different than tasting other women the feelings were new though hed have sworn hed experienced all the feelings that any man was capable of he knew about sensations he incorporated them in his work and in his life but theyd never had this depth before a man who found more and didnt reach for it was a fool he knew about intimacy he expected demanded it in everything he did but it had never had this strength before new experiences were not to be refused but explored and exploited if he felt a small nagging fear he could ignore it for now later they clung to each other and told themselves theyd think later time was unimportant after all now held all the meaning necessary he took his mouth from hers but his hands held her still it shocked him to realize they werent quite steady women had made him ache women had made him burn but no woman had ever made him tremble we need a place he murmured quiet private its time to stop pretending this isnt real she wanted to nod to simply put herself completely in his hands wasnt that the first step in losing control over your own life no carlo her voice wasnt as strong as she would have liked but she didnt back away weve got to stop mixing personal feelings with business weve got just under two weeks to go on the road i dont give a damn if its two days or two years i want to spend it making love with you she brought herself back enough to remember they were standing on a public street in the middle of afternoon traffic carlo this isnt the time to discuss it now is always the time juliet he cupped her face in his hand its not me youre fighting he didnt have to finish the thought she was all too aware that the war was within herself what she wanted what was wise what she needed what was safe the tugofwar threatened to split her apart and the two halves put back together would never equal the whole she understood carlo we have a plane to catch he said something soft and pungent in italian youll talk to me no she lifted her hands to grip his forearms not about this then well stay right here until you change your mind they could both be stubborn and with stubbornness they could both get nowhere we have a schedule we have a great deal more than that no we dont his brow lifted all right then we cant we have a plane to catch well catch your plane juliet but well talk in houston carlo dont push me into a corner who pushes he murmured me or you she didnt have an easy answer what ill do is arrange for someone else to come out and finish the tour with you he only shook his head no you wont youre too ambitious leaving a tour in the middle wouldnt look good for you she set her teeth he knew her too well already ill get sick this time he smiled youre too proud running away isnt possible for you its not a matter of running but of survival she thought and quickly changed the phrase its a matter of priorities he kissed her again lightly whose carlo we have business yes of different sorts one has nothing to do with the other to me they do unlike you i dont go to bed with everyone im attracted to unoffended he grinned you flatter me cara she could have sighed how like him to make her want to laugh while she was still furious purely unintentional i like you when you bare your teeth then youre going to enjoy the next couple of weeks she pushed his hands away its a long ride to the airport carlo lets get going amiable as ever he pulled his door open youre the boss a foolish woman mightve thought shed won a victory chapter contents prev next juliet was an expert on budgeting time it was her business every bit as much as promotion so if she could budget time she could just as easily overbudget it when the circumstances warranted if she did her job well enough hustled fast enough she could create a schedule so tight that there could be no time for talk that didnt directly deal with business she counted on houston to cooperate juliet had worked with big bill bowers before he was a brash warmhearted braggart who handled special events for books etc one of the biggest chains in the country big bill had texas sewed up and wasnt ashamed to say so he was partial to long exaggerated stories ornate boots and cold beer juliet liked him because he was sharp and tough and invariably made her job easier on this trip she blessed him because he was also longwinded and gregarious he wouldnt give her or carlo many private moments from the minute they arrived at houston international the sixfootfive twohundredandsixtypound texan made it his business to entertain there was a crowd of people waiting at the end of the breezeway some already packed together and chatting but there was no overlooking big bill you only had to look for a brahma bull in a stetson well now theres little juliet pretty as ever juliet found herself caught in a goodnatured ribcracking bear hug bill she tested her lungs gingerly as she drew away its always good to be back in houston you look great just clean living honey he let out a boom of a laugh that turned heads juliet found her mood lifting automatically carlo franconi bill bowers be nice to him she added with a grin hes not only big hes the man wholl promote your books for the largest chain in the state then ill be very nice carlo offered his hand and met an enormous meaty paw glad you could make it the same meaty hand gave carlo a friendly pat on the back that could have felled a goodsized sapling juliet gave carlo points for not taking a nosedive its good to be here was all he said never been to italy myself but im partial to eyetalian cooking the wife makes a hell of a pot of spaghetti let me take that for you before carlo could object bill had hefted his big leather case juliet couldnt prevent the smirk when carlo glanced down at the case as though it were a small child boarding a school bus for the first time cars outside well just pick up your bags and get going airports and hospitals cant stand em bill started toward the terminal in his big yardlong strides hotels all ready for you i checked this morning juliet managed to keep up though she still wore threeinch heels i knew i could depend on you bill hows betty mean as ever he said proudly of his wife with the kids up and gone shes only got me to order around but youre still crazy about her a man gets used to mean after a while he grinned showing one prominent gold tooth no need to go by the hotel straight off well show carlo here what houstons all about as he walked he swung carlos case at his side id like that diplomatically carlo moved closer to his side i could take that case no need for that what you got in here boy weighs like a steer tools juliet put in with an innocent smile carlos very temperamental man cant be too temperamental about his tools bill said with a nod he tipped his hat at a young woman with a short skirt and lots of leg ive still got the same hammer my old man gave me when i was eight im just as sentimental about my spatulas carlo murmured but he hadnt juliet noted missed the legs either you got a right a look passed between the two men that was essential male and pleased juliet decided it had more to do with long smooth thighs than tools now i figured you two mustve had your fill of fancy restaurants and creamed chicken by now having a little barbecue over at my place you can take off your shoes let down your hair and eat real food juliet had been to one of bills little barbecues before it meant grilling a whole steer along with several chickens and the better part of a pig then washing it all down with a couple hundred gallons of beer it also meant she wouldnt see her hotel room for a good five hours sounds great carlo you havent lived until youve tasted one of bills steaks grilled over mesquite carlo slipped a hand over her elbow then we should live first the tone made her turn her head and meet the look before we attend to business thats the ticket bill stopped in front of the conveyor belt just point em out and well haul em in they lived mingling at bills little barbecue with another hundred guests music came from a sevenpiece band that never seemed to tire laughter and splashing rose up from a pool separated from the patio by a spread of red flowering bushes that smelled of spice and heat above all was the scent of grilled meat sauce and smoke juliet ate twice as much as she would normally have considered because her host filled her plate then kept an eagle eye on her it should have pleased her that carlo was surrounded by a dozen or so texas ladies in bathing suits and sundresses who had suddenly developed an avid interest in cooking but she thought nastily most of them wouldnt know a stove from a can opener it should have pleased her that she had several men dancing attendance on her she was barely able to keep the names and faces separate as she watched carlo laugh with a sixfoot brunette in two minuscule ribbons of cloth the music was loud the air heavy and warm giving into necessity juliet had dug a pair of pleated shorts and a crop top out of her bag and changed it occurred to her that it was the first time since the start of the tour that shed been able to sit out in the sun soak up rays and not have a pad and pencil in her hand though the blonde beside her with the gleaming biceps was in danger of becoming both a bore and a nuisance she willed herself to enjoy the moment it was the first time carlo had seen her in anything other than her very proper suits hed already concluded by the way she walked that her legs were longer than one might think from her height he hadnt been wrong they seemed to start at her waist and continued down smooth slim and new york pale the statuesque brunette beside him might not have existed for all the attention he paid her it wasnt like him to focus on a woman yards away when there was one right beside him carlo knew it but not what to do about it the woman beside him smelled of heat and musk heavy and seductive it made him think that juliets scent was lighter but held just as much punch she had no trouble relaxing with other men carlo tipped back a beer as he watched her fold those long legs under her and laugh with the two men sitting on either side of her she didnt stiffen when the young musclebound hunk on her left put his hand on her shoulder and leaned closer it wasnt like him to be jealous as emotional as he was carlo had never experienced that particular sensation hed also felt that a woman had just as much right to flirt and experiment as he did he found that particular rule didnt apply to juliet if she let that slickskinned weightlifting buffone put his hand on her again he didnt have time to finish the thought juliet laughed again set aside her plate and rose carlo couldnt hear whatever shed said to the man beside her but she strolled into the sprawling ranch house moments later the burnished barechested man rose and followed her maledetto what the brunette stopped in the middle of what shed thought was an intimate conversation carlo barely spared her a glance scusi muttering he strode off in the direction juliet had taken there was murder in his eye fed up with fending off the attentions of big bills hotshot young neighbor juliet slipped into the house through the kitchen her mood might have been foul but she congratulated herself on keeping her head she hadnt taken a chunk out of the freehanded selfappointed adonis she hadnt snarled out loud even once in carlos direction attending to business always helped steady her temper with a check of her watch juliet decided she could get one collect call through to her assistant at home shed no more than picked up the receiver from the kitchen wall phone than she was lifted off her feet aint much to you but it sure is a pleasure to look at what there is she barely suppressed the urge to come back with her elbow tim she managed to keep her voice pleasant while she thought how unfortunate it was that most of his muscle was from the neck up youre going to have to put me down so i can make my call its a party sweetheart shifting her around with a flex of muscle he set her on the counter no need to go calling anybody when youve got me around you know what i think juliet gauged that she could give him a quick kick below the belt but tapped his shoulder instead after all he was bills neighbor i think you should get back out to the party before all the ladies miss you got a better idea he leaned forward boxing her in with a hand on each side his teeth gleamed in the style of the best toothpaste ads why dont you and i go have a little party of our own i imagine you new york ladies know how to have fun if she hadnt considered him such a jerk shed have been insulted for women in general and new york in particular patiently juliet considered the source we new york ladies she said calmly know how to say no now back off tim come on juliet he hooked a finger in the neck of her top ive got a nice big water bed down the street she put a hand on his wrist neighbor or not she was going to belt him why dont you go take a dive he only grinned as his hand slid up her leg just what i had in mind excuse me carlos voice was soft as a snake from the doorway if you dont find something else to do with your hands quickly you might lose the use of them carlo her voice was sharp but not with relief she wasnt in the mood for a knightinarmor rescue the lady and ire having a private conversation tim flexed his pectorals take off with his thumbs hooked in his pockets carlo strolled over juliet noted he looked as furious as he had over the canned basil in that mood there was no telling what hed do she swore let out a breath and tried to avoid a scene why dont we all go outside excellent carlo held out a hand to help her down before she could reach for it tim blocked her way you go outside buddy juliet and i havent finished talking carlo inclined his head then shifted his gaze to juliet have you finished talking yes shed have slid off the counter but that would have put her on top of tims shoulders frustrated she sat where she was apparently juliet is finished carlos smile was all amiability but his eyes were flat and cold you seem to be blocking her way i told you to take off big and annoyed he grabbed carlo by the lapels cut it out both of you with a vivid picture of carlo bleeding from the nose and mouth juliet grabbed a cookie jar shaped like a tengallon hat before she could use it tim grunted and bent over from the waist as he gasped clutching his stomach juliet only stared you can put that down now carlo said mildly its time we left when she didnt move he took the jar himself set it aside then lifted her from the counter youll excuse us he said pleasantly to the groaning tim then led juliet outside what did you do what was necessary juliet looked back toward the kitchen door if she hadnt seen it for herself you hit him not very hard carlo nodded to a group of sunbathers all his muscle is in his chest and his brain but she looked down at carlos hands they were leanfingered and elegant with the flash of a diamond on the pinky not hands one associated with selfdefense he was awfully big carlo lifted a brow as he took his sunglasses back out of his pocket big isnt always an advantage the neighborhood where i grew up was an education are you ready to leave no his voice wasnt pleasant she realized it was cold ice cold instinctively hers mirrored it i suppose i should thank you unless of course you enjoyed being pawed perhaps tim was just acting on the signals you were sending out juliet stopped in her tracks what signals the ones women send out when they want to be pursued thinking she could bring her temper to order she gave herself a moment it didnt work he might have been bigger than you she said between her teeth but i think youre just as much of an ass youre very much alike the lenses of his glasses were smoky but she saw his eyes narrow you compare whats between us with what happened in there im saying some men dont take no for an answer graciously you might have a smoother style carlo but youre after the same thing whether its a roll in the hay or a cruise on a water bed he dropped his hand from her arm then very deliberately tucked both in his pockets if ive mistaken your feelings juliet i apologize im not a man who finds it necessary or pleasurable to pressure a woman do you wish to leave or stay she felt a great deal of pressure in her throat behind her eyes she couldnt afford the luxury of giving into it id like to get to the hotel i still have some work to do tonight fine he left her there to find their host three hours later juliet admitted working was impossible shed tried all the tricks she knew to relax a half hour in a hot tub quiet music on the radio while she watched the sun set from her hotel window when relaxing failed she went over the houston schedule twice theyd be running from am to pm almost nonstop their flight to chicago took off at thered be no time to discuss think or worry about anything that had happened within the last twentyfour hours thats what she wanted yet when she tried to work on the twoday chicago stand she couldnt all she could do was think about the man a few steps across the hall she hadnt realized he could be so cold he was always so full of warmth of life true he was often infuriating but he infuriated with verve now hed left her in a vacuum no tossing her notebook aside juliet dropped her chin in her hand no shed put herself there maybe she could have stood it if shed been right shed been dead wrong she hadnt sent any signals to the idiot tim and carlos opinion on that still made her steam but but she hadnt even thanked him for helping her when whether she liked to admit it or not shed needed help it didnt sit well with her to be in debt with a shrug she rose from the table and began to pace the room it might be better all around if they finished off the tour with him cold and distant thered certainly be fewer personal problems that way because thered be nothing personal between them thered be no edge to their relationship because they wouldnt have a relationship logically this little incident was probably the best thing that could have happened it hardly mattered if shed been right or wrong as long as the result was workable she took a glimpse around the small tidy impersonal room where shed spend little more than eight hours most of it asleep no she couldnt stand it giving in juliet stuck her room key in the pocket of her robe women had made him furious before carlo counted on it to keep life from becoming too tame women had frustrated him before without frustrations how could you fully appreciate success but hurt that was something no woman had ever done to him before hed never considered the possibility frustration fury passion laughter shouting no man whod known so many women mother sisters lovers expected a relationship without them pain was a different matter pain was an intimate emotion more personal than passion more elemental than anger when it went deep it found places inside you that should have been left alone it had never mattered to him to be considered a rogue a rake a playboy whatever term was being used for a man who appreciated women affairs came and went as affairs were supposed to they lasted no longer than the passion that conceived them he was a careful man a caring man a lover became a friend as desire waned there might be spats and hard words during the storm of an affair but hed never ended one that way it occurred to him that hed had more spats more hard words with juliet than with any other woman yet theyd never been lovers nor would they be after pouring a glass of wine he sat back in a deep chair and closed his eyes he wanted no woman who compared him with a musclebound idiot who confused passion for lust he wanted no woman who compared the beauty of lovemaking to what was it a cruise on a water bed dio he wanted no woman who could make him ache so in the middle of the night in the middle of the day he wanted no woman who could bring him pain with a few harsh words god he wanted juliet he heard the knock on the door and frowned by the time hed set his glass aside and stood it came again if juliet hadnt been so nervous she might have thought of something witty to say about the short black robe carlo wore with two pink flamingos twining up one side as it was she stood in her own robe and bare feet with her fingers linked together im sorry she said when he opened the door he stepped back come in juliet i had to apologize she let out a deep breath as she walked into the room i was awful to you this afternoon and youd helped me out of a very tricky situation with a minimum of fuss i was angry when you insinuated that id led that that idiot on in some way i had a right to be she folded her arms under her chest and paced the room it was an uncalled for remark and insulting even if by the remotest possibility it had been true you had no right to talk after all you were basking in your own harem harem carlo poured another glass of wine and offered it with that amazon of a brunette leading the pack she sipped gestured with the glass and sipped again everywhere we go youve got half a dozen women nipping at your ankles but do i say a word well you and once just once i have a problem with some creep with an overactive libido and you assume i asked for it i thought that kind of double standard was outdated even in italy had he ever known a woman who could change his moods so quickly thinking it over and finding it to his taste carlo studied his wine juliet did you come here to apologize or demand that i do so she scowled at him i dont know why i came but obviously it was a mistake wait he held up a hand before she could storm out again perhaps it would be wise if i simply accepted the apology you came in with juliet sent him a killing look you can take the apology i came in with and and offer you one of my own he finished then well be even i didnt encourage him she murmured and pouted hed never seen that sulky utterly feminine look on her face before it did several interesting things to his system and im not looking for the same thing he was he came to her then close enough to touch but very much more maybe i know that she whispered but took a step away maybe id like to believe it i dont understand affairs carlo with a little laugh she dragged her hand through her hair and turned away i should my father had plenty of them discreet she added with a lingering taste of bitterness my mother could always turn a blind eye as long as they were discreet he understood such things had seen them among both friends and relatives so he understood the scars and disillusionments that could be left juliet youre not your mother no she turned back head up no ive worked long and hard to be certain im not shes a lovely intelligent woman who gave up her career her selfesteem her independence to be no more than a glorified housekeeper because my father wanted it he didnt want a wife of his to work a wife of his she repeated what a phrase her job was to take care of him that meant having dinner on the table at six oclock every night and his shirts folded in his drawer he damn hes a good father attentive considerate he simply doesnt believe a man should shout at a woman or a girl as a husband hed never forget a birthday an anniversary hes always seen to it that she was provided for in the best material fashion but he dictated my mothers lifestyle while he was about it he enjoyed a very discreet string of women why does your mother stay his wife i asked her that a few years ago before i moved away to new york she loves him juliet stared into her wine thats reason enough for her would you rather shed have left him id rather shed have been what she could be what she mightve been the choice was hers juliet just as your life is yours i dont want to ever be bound to anyone anyone who could humiliate me that way she lifted her head again i wont put myself in my mothers position not for anyone do you see all relationships as being so unbalanced with a shrug she drank again i suppose i havent seen so many of them for a moment he was silent carlo understood fidelity the need for it and the lack of it perhaps we have something in common i dont remember my father well i saw him little he too was unfaithful to my mother she looked over at him but he didnt see any surprise in her face it was as though she expected such things but he committed his adultery with the sea for months hed be gone while she raised us worked waited when hed come home shed welcome him then hed go again unable to resist when he died she mourned she loved him and made her choice its not fair is it no did you think love was its not something i want he remembered once another woman a friend telling him the same thing when she was in turmoil we all want love juliet no she shook her head with the confidence born of desperation no affection respect admiration but not love it steals something from you he looked at her as she stood in the path of the lamplight perhaps it does he murmured but until we love we cant be sure we needed what was lost maybe its easier for you to say that to think that youve had many lovers it should have amused him instead it seemed to accent a void he hadnt been aware of yes but ive never been in love i have a friend again he thought of summer once she told me love was a merrygoround maybe she knew best juliet pressed her lips together and an affair something in her voice had him looking over for the second time he went to her but slowly perhaps its just one ride on the carousel because her fingers werent steady juliet set down the glass we understand each other in some ways carlo she hesitated then admitted the decision had already been made before she crossed the hall carlo ive never taken much time for carousels but i do want you how should he handle her odd hed never had to think things through so carefully before with some women hed have been flamboyant sweeping her up carrying her off with another he might have been impulsive tumbling with her to the carpet but nothing hed ever done seemed as important as the first time with juliet words for a woman had always come easily to him the right phrase the right tone had always come as naturally as breathing he could think of nothing even a murmur might spoil the simplicity of what shed said to him and how shed said it so he didnt speak he kissed her where they stood not with the raging passion he knew she could draw from him not with the hesitation she sometimes made him feel he kissed her with the truth and the knowledge that longtime lovers often experience they came to each other with separate needs separate attitudes but with this they locked out the past tonight was for the new and for renewing shed expected the words the flash and style that seemed so much a part of him perhaps shed even expected something of triumph again he gave her the different and the fresh with no more than the touch of mouth to mouth the thought came to her then was discounted that he was no more certain of his ground than she then he held out his hand juliet put hers in it together they walked to the bedroom if hed set the scene for a night of romance carlo wouldve added flowers with a touch of spice music with the throb of passion hed have given her the warmth of candlelight and the fun of champagne tonight with juliet there was only silence and moonlight the maid had turned down the bed and left the drapes wide white light filtered through shadows and onto white sheets standing by the bed he kissed her palms one by one they were cool and carried a hint of her scent at her wrist her pulse throbbed slowly watching her he loosened the tie of her robe with his eyes still on hers he brought his hands to her shoulders and slipped the material aside it fell silently to pool at her feet he didnt touch her nor did he yet look at anything but her face through nerves through needs something like comfort began to move through her her lips curved just slightly as she reached for the tie of his robe and drew the knot with her hands light and sure on his shoulders she pushed the silk aside they were both vulnerable to their needs to each other the light was thin and white and washed with shadows no other illumination was needed this first time that they looked at each other he was lean but not thin she was slender but soft her skin seemed only more pale when he touched her her hand seemed only more delicate when she touched him they came together slowly there was no need to rush the mattress gave the sheets rustled quietly side by side they lay giving themselves time all the time needed to discover what pleasures could come from the taste of mouth to mouth the touch of flesh to flesh should she have known it would be like this so easy inevitable her skin was warm so warm wherever he brushed it his lips demanded they took but with such patience he loved her gently slowly as though it were her first time as she drifted deeper juliet thought dimly that perhaps it was innocence he felt it from her not physical but emotional somehow incredibly he discovered it was the same for himself no matter how many had come before for either of them they came to each other now in innocence her hands didnt hesitate as they moved over him but stroked as though she were blind and could only gain her own picture through other senses he smelled of a shower water and soap but he tasted richer of wine then he spoke for the first time only her name it was to her more moving more poetic than any endearment her body moved with his in rhythm keeping pace she seemed to know somehow where he would touch her just before she felt his fingers trace his palms press then his lips began a long luxurious journey she hoped would never end she was so small why had he never noticed before how small she was it was easy to forget her strength her control her stamina he could give her tenderness and wait for the passion the line of her neck was slender and so white in the moonlight her scent was trapped there at her throat intensified arousing he could linger there while blood heated his and hers he slid his tongue over the subtle curve of her breast to find the peak when he drew it into his mouth she moaned his name giving them both a long slow nudge to the edge but there was more to taste more to touch passion when heated makes a mockery of control sounds slipped into the room a catch of breath a sigh a moan all pleasure their scents began to mix together a lovers fragrance in the moonlight they were one form the sheets were hot twisted when with tongue and fingertips he drove her over the first peak juliet gripped the tousled sheets as her body arched and shuddered with a torrent of sensations while she was still weak still gasping he slipped into her his head was spinning a deliciously foreign sensation to him he wanted to bury himself in her but he wanted to see her her eyes were shut her lips just parted as the breath hurried in and out she moved with him slowly then faster still faster until her fingers dug into his shoulders on a cry of pleasure her eyes flew open looking into them he saw the dark astonished excitement hed wanted to give her at last giving in to the rushing need of his own body he closed his mouth over hers and let himself go chapter contents prev next were there others who understood true passion wrapped in carlo absorbing and absorbed by carlo juliet knew she hadnt until moments ago should it make you weak she felt weak but not empty should she feel regret yes logically she should shed given more of herself than shed intended shared more than shed imagined risked more than she should have dared but she had no regrets perhaps later shed make her list of the whys and why nots for now she wanted only to enjoy the soft afterglow of loving youre quiet his breath whispered across her temple followed by his lips she smiled a little content to let her eyes close so are you nuzzling his cheek against her hair he looked over to the slant of moonlight through the window he wasnt sure which words to use hed never felt quite like this before with any woman hed never expected to how could he tell her that and expect to be believed he was having a hard time believing it himself and yet perhaps truth was the hardest thing to put into words you feel very small when i hold you like this he murmured it makes me want to hold you like this for a long long time i like having you hold me the admission was much easier to make than shed thought with a little laugh she turned her head so that she could see his face i like it very much then you wont object if i go on holding you for the next few hours she kissed his chin the next few minutes she corrected i have to get back to my room you dont like my bed she stretched and cuddled and thought how wonderful it would be never to move from that one spot i think im crazy about it but ive got a little work to do before i call it a night then i have to be up by sixthirty and you work too much he cut her off then leaned over her to pick up the phone you can get up in the morning just as easily from my bed as yours finding she liked the way his body pressed into hers she prepared to be convinced maybe whatre you doing shh yes this is franconi in id like a wakeup call for six he replaced the phone and rolled pulling her on top of him there now everything is taken care of the phone will ring at dawn and wake us up it certainly will juliet folded her hands over his chest and rested her chin on them but you told them to call at six we dont have to get up until sixthirty yes he slid his hands down low over her back so we have a halfhour to ah wake up with a laugh she pressed her lips to his shoulder this once she told herself just this once shed let someone else do the planning very practical do you think we might take a half hour or so to ah go to sleep my thoughts exactly when the phone did ring juliet merely groaned and slid down under the sheets for the second time she found herself buried under carlo as he rolled over to answer it without complaint she lay still hoping the ringing of the phone had been part of a dream come now juliet shifting most of his weight from her carlo began to nibble on her shoulder youre playing mole she murmured in drowsy excitement as he slid his hand down to her hip mole i dont have a mole playing mole she was so warm and soft and pliant hed known she would be mornings were made for lazy delights and waking her was a pleasure just begun juliet stretched under the stroke and caress of his hands mornings were for a quick shower and a hasty cup of coffee shed never known they could be luxurious playing mole an american expression the skin over her rib cage was soft as butter he thought there was no better time to taste it you pretend to be dead because her mind was clouded with sleep her system already churning with passion it took a moment possum prego playing possum she repeated and guided by his hands shifted a moles different so theyre both little animals she opened one eye his hair was rumpled around his face his chin darkened with a nights growth of beard but when he smiled he looked as though hed been awake for hours he looked she admitted absolutely wonderful you want an animal with a sudden burst of energy she rolled on top of him her hands were quick her mouth avid in seconds shed taken his breath away shed never been aggressive but found the low surprised moan and the fast pump of his heart to her liking her body reacted like lightning she didnt mind that his hands werent as gentle as patient as theyd been the night before this new desperation thrilled her he was franconi known for his wide range of expertise in the kitchen and the bedroom but she was making him wild and helpless at the same time with a laugh she pressed her mouth to his letting her tongue find all the dark lavish tastes when he tried to shift her to take her because the need had grown too quickly to control she evaded his breathless curse whispered into her mouth he never lost finesse with a woman passion his passion had always been melded with style now as she took her frenzied journey over him he had no style only needs hed never been a man to rush when he cooked he went slowly stepbystep enjoy experience experiment he made love the same way such things were meant to be savored to be appreciated by each of the five senses it wasnt possible to savor when you were driven beyond the civilized when your senses were whirling and tangled it wasnt possible to separate them being driven was something new for him something intoxicating no he wouldnt fight it but pull her with him rough and urgent he grabbed her hips within moments they were both beyond thought beyond reason his breath was still unsteady but he held her close and tight whatever shed done or was doing to him he didnt want to lose it the thought flickered briefly that he didnt want to lose her carlo pushed it aside it was a dangerous thought they had now it was much wiser to concentrate on that i have to go though she wanted nothing more than to curl up against him juliet made herself shift away we have to be downstairs at checkout in forty minutes to meet big bill thats right juliet reached onto the floor for her robe slipping it onto her arms before she stood up carlos lips trembled at the way she turned her back to him to tie it it was rather endearing to see the unconscious modesty from a woman whod just exploited every inch of his body you dont know how grateful i am that bill volunteered to play chauffeur the last thing i want to do is fight the freeway system in this town ive had to do it before and its not a pretty sight i could drive he murmured enjoying the way the rich green silk reached the top of her thighs staying alive is another reason im grateful for bill ill call and have a bellman come up for the bags in thirtyfive minutes be sure you check everything because we wont be coming back he finished juliet havent i proven my competency yet just a friendly reminder she checked her watch before she remembered she wasnt wearing it the tv spot should be a breeze jacky torrence hosts its a jovial sort of show that goes after the fast funny story rather than nuts and bolts hmm he rose stretching the publicist was back he noted with a half smile but as he reached down for his own robe he noticed that shed broken off lifting his head he looked up at her good god he was beautiful it was all she could think schedules planning points of information all went out of her head in the early morning sun his skin was more gold than brown smooth and tight over his rib cage nipped in at the waist to a narrow line of hip letting out a shaky breath she took a step back id better go she managed we can run through todays schedule on the way to the studio it pleased him enormously to understand what had broken her concentration he held the robe loosely in one hand as he took a step closer perhaps well get bumped bite your tongue aiming for a light tone she succeeded with a whisper thats an interesting robe the tone of her voice was a springboard to an arousal already begun you like the flamingos my mother has a sense of humor but he didnt put it on as he stepped closer carlo stay right where you are i mean it she held up a hand as she walked backward to the doorway he grinned and kept on grinning after he heard the click of the hallway door between juliet cracking the whip and bill piloting their houston business went like clockwork tv radio and print the media was responsive and energetic the midafternoon autograph party turned out to be a party in the true sense of the word and was a smashing success juliet found herself a spot in a storeroom and ripped open the oversized envelope from her office that had been delivered to the hotel settling back she began to go through the clippings her assistant had air expressed la was excellent as shed expected upbeat and enthusiastic san diego mightve tried for a little more depth but theyd given him page one of the food section in one spread and a belowthefold in the style section in another no complaints portland and seattle listed a recipe apiece and raved shamelessly juliet couldve rubbed her hands together with glee if she hadnt been drinking coffee then she hit denver coffee sloshed out of the cup and onto her hand damn fumbling in her briefcase she found three crumpled tissues and began to mop up a gossip column whod have thought it she gave herself a moment to think then relaxed publicity was publicity after all and the truth of the matter was franconi was gossip looking at it logically the more times his name was in print the more successful the tour resolved juliet began to read she nodded absently as she skimmed the first paragraph chatty shallow but certainly not offensive a lot of people who might not glance at the food or cooking sections would give the gossip columns a working over all in all it was probably an excellent break then she read the second paragraph juliet was up out of her folding chair this time the coffee that dripped onto the floor went unnoticed her expression changed from surprised astonishment to fury in a matter of seconds in the same amount of time she stuffed the clippings back into their envelope it wasnt easy but she gave herself five minutes for control before she walked back into the main store the schedule called for another fifteen minutes but carlo had more than twenty people in line and that many again just milling around fifteen minutes would have to be stretched to thirty grinding her teeth juliet stalked over to bill there you are friendly as always he threw his arm over her shoulder and squeezed going great guns out here old carlo knows how to twinkle to the ladies without setting the men off damn clever sonofabitch i couldnt have said it better myself her knuckles were white on the strap of her briefcase bill is there a phone i can use i have to call the office no problem at all yall just come on back with me he led her through psychology into westerns and around romances to a door marked private you just help yourself he invited and showed her into a room with a cluttered metal desk a goosenecked lamp and stacks upon stacks of books juliet headed straight for the phone thanks bill she didnt even wait until the door closed before she started dialing deborah mortimor please she said to the answering switchboard tapping her foot juliet waited ms mortimor deb its juliet hi ive been waiting for you to call in looks like weve got a strong nibble with the times when you come back to new york i just later juliet reached into her briefcase for a roll of antacids i got the clippings today great arent they oh sure theyre just dandy uhhuh deb waited only a beat its the little number in denver isnt it she gave the rolling chair a quick kick of course it is sit down juliet deb didnt have to see to know her boss was pacing sit down im tempted to fly back to denver and ring chatty cathys neck killing columnists isnt good for pr juliet it was garbage no no it wasnt that bad trash maybe but not garbage she struggled for control and managed to get a very slippery rein on her temper popping the first antacid into her mouth she crunched down dont be cute deb i didnt like the insinuations about carlo and me carlo franconis lovely american traveling companion she quoted between her teeth traveling companion it makes me sound as though im just along for the ride and then i read it deb interrupted so did hal she added referring to the head of publicity juliet closed her eyes a moment and well he went through about six different reactions in the end he decided a few comments like that were bound to come up and only added to franconis well mystique might be the best term i see her jaw clenched her fingers tight around the little roll of stomach pills thats fine then isnt it im just thrilled to add to a clients mystique now juliet look just tell dear old hal that houston went perfectly she was definitely going to need two pills juliet popped another out of the roll with her thumb i dont even want you to mention to him that i called about this this tripe in denver whatever you say taking a pen she sat down and made space on the desk now give me what you have with the times a half hour later juliet was just finishing up her last call when carlo poked his head in the office seeing she was on the phone he rolled his eyes closed the door and leaned against it his brow lifted when he spotted the halfeaten roll of antacids yes thank you ed mr franconi will bring all the necessary ingredients and be in the studio at yes she laughed though her foot was tapping out a rhythm on the floor its absolutely delicious guaranteed see you in two days when she hung up the receiver carlo stepped forward you didnt come to save me she gave him a long slow look you seemed to be handling the situation without me he knew the tone and the expression now all he had to do was find the reason for them strolling over he picked up the roll of pills youre much too young to need these ive never heard that ulcers had an age barrier his brows drew together as he sat on the edge of the desk juliet if i believed you had an ulcer id pack you off to my home in rome and keep you in bed on bland foods for the next month now he slipped the roll into his pocket what problem is there several she said briskly as she began to gather up her notes but theyre fairly well smoothed out now well need to go shopping again in chicago for that chicken dish youd planned to cook so if youve finished up here we can just no he put a hand on her shoulder and held her in the chair were not finished shopping for chicken in chicago isnt what had you reaching for pills what the best defense was always ice her voice chilled carlo ive been very busy you think after two weeks i dont know you impatient he gave her a little shake you dig in that briefcase for your aspirin or your little mints only when you feel too much pressure i dont like to see it it comes with the territory she tried to shrug off his hand and failed carlo weve got to get to the airport we have more than enough time tell me whats wrong all right then in two sharp moves she pulled the clipping out of her case and pushed it into his hands whats this he skimmed it first without really reading it one of those little columns about who is seen with whom and what they wear while theyre seen more or less ah as he began to read from the top he nodded and you were seen with me closing her notebook she slipped it neatly into her briefcase twice she reminded herself that losing her temper would accomplish nothing as your publicist that could hardly be avoided because hed come to expect logic from her he only nodded again but you feel this intimates something else it says something else she tossed back something that isnt true it calls you my traveling companion he glanced up knowing that wouldnt sit well with her its perhaps not the full story but not untrue does it upset you to be known as my companion she didnt want him to be reasonable she had no intention of emulating him when companion takes on this shade of meaning it isnt professional or innocent im not here to have my name linked with you this way carlo in what way juliet it gives my name and goes on to say that im never out of arms length that i guard you as though you were my own personal property and that you that i kiss your hand in public restaurants as though i couldnt wait for privacy carlo read at a glance so what difference does it make what it says here she dragged both hands through her hair carlo im here with you to do a job this clipping came through my office through my supervisor dont you know something like this could ruin my credibility no he said simply enough this is no more than gossip your supervisor hes upset by this she laughed but it had little to do with humor no actually it seems hes decided its just fine good for your image well then i dont want to be good for your image she threw back with such passion it shocked both of them i wont be one of the dozens of names and faces linked with you so he murmured now we push away to the truth youre angry with me for this he set the clipping down youre angry because theres more truth in it now than there was when it was written i dont want to be on anyones list carlo her voice had lowered calmed she dug balled fists into the pockets of her skirt not yours not anyones i havent come this far in my life to let that happen now he stood wondering if she understood how insulting her words were no shed see them as facts not as darts i havent put you on a list if you have one in your own mind it has nothing to do with me a few weeks ago it was the french actress a month before that a widowed countess he didnt shout but it was only force of will that kept his voice even i never pretended you were the first woman in my bed i never expected i was the first man in yours thats entirely different ah now you find the double standard convenient he picked up the clipping balled it in his fist then dropped it into the wastebasket ive no patience for this juliet he was to the door again before she spoke carlo wait with a polite veneer stretched thinly over fury he turned damn hands still in her pockets she paced from one stack of books to the other i never intended to take this out on you its totally out of line and im sorry really you might guess im not thinking very clearly right now so it would seem juliet let out a sigh knowing she observed the cutting edge of his voice i dont know how to explain except to say that my careers very important to me i understand that but its no more important to me than my privacy i dont want my personal life discussed around the office water cooler people talk juliet its natural and its meaningless i cant brush it off the way you do she picked up her briefcase by the strap then set it down again im used to staying in the background i set things up handle the details do the legwork and someone elses picture gets in the paper thats the way i want it you dont always get what you want with his thumbs hooked in his pockets he leaned back against the door and watched her your anger goes deeper than a few lines in a paper people will have forgotten tomorrow she closed her eyes a moment then turned back to him all right yes but its not a matter of being angry carlo ive put myself in a delicate position with you carefully he weighed the phrase tested it judged it delicate position please dont misunderstand im here with you because of my job its very important to me that thats handled in the best the most professional manner i can manage whats happened between us what has happened between us he prompted when she trailed off dont make it difficult all right well make it easy were lovers she let out a long unsteady breath wondering if he really believed that was easy for him it might be just another stroll through the moonlight for her it was a race through a hurricane i want to keep that aspect of our relationship completely separate from the professional area it surprised him he could find such a statement endearing perhaps the fact that she was half romanticist and half businesswoman was part of her appeal to him juliet my love you sound as though youre negotiating a contract maybe i do nerves were beginning to run through her too quickly again maybe i am in a way his own anger had disappeared her eyes werent nearly as certain as her voice her hands he noted were twisting together slowly he walked toward her pleased that though she didnt back away the wariness was back juliet he lifted a hand to brush through her hair you can negotiate terms and times but not emotion you can regulate it he took both her hands kissing them no carlo please you like me to touch you he murmured whether we stand here alone or we stand in a group of strangers if i touch your hand like this you know whats in my mind its not always passion there are times i see you i touch you and i think only of being with you talking or sitting silently will you negotiate now how i am to touch your hand how many times a day its permitted dont make me sound like a fool his fingers tightened on hers dont make what i feel for you sound foolish i no she couldnt touch that she didnt dare carlo i just want to keep things simple impossible no its not then tell me is this simple with just his fingertips on her shoulder he leaned down to kiss her so softly so lightly it was hardly a kiss at all she felt her legs dissolve from the knees down carlo were not staying on the point he slipped his arms around her i like this point much better when we get to chicago his fingers slipped up and down her spine as he began to brush his lips over her face i want to spend the evening alone with you we have an appointment for drinks at ten with cancel it carlo you know i cant very well he caught the lobe of her ear between his teeth ill plead fatigue and make certain we have a very quick very early evening then ill spend the rest of the night doing little things like this his tongue darted inside her ear then retreated to the vulnerable spot just below the shudder that went through her was enough to arouse both of them carlo you dont understand i understand that i want you in a swift mood swing he had her by the shoulders if i told you now that i want you more than ive wanted any other woman you wouldnt believe me she backed away from that but was caught close again no i wouldnt it isnt necessary to say so youre afraid to hear it afraid to believe it you wont get simple with me juliet but youll get a lover youll never forget she steadied a bit meeting his look levelly ive already resigned myself to that carlo i dont apologize to myself and i dont pretend to have any regrets about coming to you last night then resign yourself to this the temper was back in his eyes hot and volatile i dont care whats written in the paper whats whispered about in offices in new york you this moment are all i care about something shattered quietly inside her a defense built instinctively through years she knew she shouldnt take him literally he was franconi after all if he cared about her it was only in his way and in his time but something had shattered and she couldnt rebuild it so quickly instead she chose to be blunt carlo i dont know how to handle you i havent the experience then dont handle me again he took her by the shoulders trust me she put her hands on his held them a moment then drew them away its too soon and too much there were times in his work where he had to be very very patient as a man it happened much more rarely yet he knew if he pushed now as for some inexplicable reason he wanted to hed only create more distance between them then for now we just enjoy each other thats what she wanted juliet told herself that was exactly what she wanted no more no less but she felt like weeping well enjoy each other she agreed letting out a sigh she framed his face with her hands as he so often did with her very much he wondered when he lowered his brow to hers why it didnt quite satisfy chapter contents prev next burned out from traveling ready for a drink and elevated feet juliet walked up to the front desk of their chicago hotel taking a quick glimpse around the lobby she was pleased with the marble floors sculpture and elegant potted palms such places usually lent themselves to big stylish bathrooms she intended to spend her first hour in chicago with everything from the neck down submerged may i help you you have a reservation for franconi and trent with a few punches on the keyboard the clerk brought up their reservations on the screen youll both be staying for two nights miss trent yes thats right its direct bill everythings set if you and mr franconi will just fill out these forms ill ring for a bellman as he scrawled the information on the form carlo glanced over from the profile she looked lovely though perhaps a bit tired her hair was pinned up in the back fluffed out on the sides and barely mussed from traveling she looked as though she could head a threehour business meeting without a whimper but then she arched her back closing her eyes briefly as she stretched her shoulders he wanted to take care of her juliet theres no need for two rooms she shifted her shoulder bag and signed her name carlo dont start arrangements have already been made but its absurd youll be staying in my suite so the extra room is simply extra the desk clerk stood at a discreet distance and listened to every word juliet pulled her credit card out of her wallet and set it down on the counter with a snap carlo noted with some amusement that she no longer looked the least bit tired he wanted to make love with her for hours youll need the imprint on this for my incidentals she told the clerk calmly enough all mr franconis charges will be picked up carlo pushed his form toward the clerk then leaned on the counter juliet wont you feel foolish running back and forth across the hall its ridiculous even for a publisher to pay for a bed that wont be slept in with her jaw clenched she picked up her credit card again ill tell you whats ridiculous she said under her breath its ridiculous for you to be standing here deliberately embarrassing me you have rooms and the clerk pushed the keys toward them im afraid theyre just down the hall from each other rather than across thats fine juliet turned to find the bellman had their luggage packed on the cart and his ears open without a word she strode toward the bank of elevators strolling along beside her carlo noted that the cashier had a stunning smile juliet i find it odd that youd be embarrassed over something so simple i dont think its simple she jabbed the up button on the elevator forgive me carlo put his tongue in his cheek its only that i recall you specifically saying you wanted our relationship to be simple dont tell me what i said what i said has nothing to do with what i meant of course not he murmured and waited for her to step inside the car seeing the look on juliets face the bellman began to worry about his tip he put on a hospitalityplus smile so you in chicago long two days carlo said genially enough you can see a lot in a couple of days youll want to get down to the lake were here on business juliet interrupted only business yes maam with a smile the bellman pushed his cart into the hall s the first stop thats mine juliet dug out her wallet again and pulled out bills as the bellman unlocked her door those two bags she pointed out then turned to carlo well meet dave lockwell in the bar for drinks at you can do as you like until then i have some ideas on that he began but juliet moved past him after stuffing the bills in the bellmans hand she shut the door with a quick click thirty minutes to carlos thinking was long enough for anyone to cool down juliets stiffbacked attitude toward their room situation had caused him more exasperation than annoyance but then he expected to be exasperated by women on one hand he found her reaction rather sweet and naive did she really think the fact that they were lovers would make the desk clerk or a bellman blink twice the fact that she did and probably always would was just another aspect of her nature that appealed to him in whatever she did juliet trent would always remain proper simmering passion beneath a tidy cleanlined business suit carlo found her irresistible hed known so many kinds of women the bright young ingenue greedy to her fingertips the wealthy aristocrat bored both by wealth and tradition the successful career woman who both looked for and was wary of marriage hed known so many the happy the secure the desperate and seeking the fulfilled and the grasping juliet trent with the cool green eyes and quiet voice left him uncertain as to what pigeonhole shed fit into it seemed she had all and none of the feminine qualities he understood the only thing he was certain of was that he wanted her to fit somehow into his life the best way the only way he knew to accomplish that was to distract her with charm until she was already caught after that theyd negotiate the next step carlo lifted the rose hed had sent up from the hotel florist out of its bud vase sniffed its petals once then walked down the hall to juliets room she was just drying off from a hot steamy bath if shed heard the knock five minutes before shed have growled as it was she pulled on her robe and went to answer shed been expecting him juliet wasnt foolish enough to believe a man like carlo would take a door in the face as final it had given her satisfaction to close it just as it gave her satisfaction to open it again when she was ready she hadnt been expecting the rose though she knew it wasnt wise to be moved by a single longstemmed flower with a bud the color of sunshine she was moved nonetheless her plans to have a calm serious discussion with him faltered you look rested rather than giving her the rose he took her hand before she could decide whether or not to let him in he was there a stand juliet reminded herself even as she closed the door behind him if she didnt take a stand now shed never find her footing since youre here well talk we have an hour of course as was his habit he took a survey of her room her suitcase sat on a stand still packed but with its top thrown open it wasnt practical to unpack and repack when you were bouncing around from city to city though they were starting their third week on the road the contents of the case were still neat and organized hed have expected no less from her her notebook and two pens were already beside the phone the only things remotely out of place in the tidy impersonal room were the italian heels that sat in the middle of the rug where shed stepped out of them the inconsistency suited her perfectly i can discuss things better she began if you werent wandering around yes all cooperation carlo sat and waved the rose under his nose you want to talk about our schedule here in chicago no yes she had at least a dozen things to go over with him for once she let business take a back seat later deciding to take any advantage juliet remained standing first i want to talk about that business down at the desk ah the sound was distinctly european and as friendly as a smile she could have murdered him it was totally uncalled for was it hed learned that strategy was best plotted with friendly questions or simple agreement that way you could swing the final result to your own ends without too much blood being shed of course it was forgetting her own strategy juliet dropped down on the edge of the bed carlo you had no right discussing our personal business in public youre quite right i his calm agreement threw her off the firm moderately angry speech shed prepared in the tub went out the window i must apologize he continued before she could balance herself it was thoughtless of me well no as hed planned she came to his defense it wasnt thoughtless just inappropriate with the rose he waved her defense away youre too kind juliet you see i was thinking only of how practical you are its one of the things i most admire about you in getting his way carlo had always felt it best to use as much truth as possible you see besides my own family ive known very few truly practical women this trait in you appeals to me as much as the color of your eyes the texture of your skin because she sensed she was losing ground juliet sat up straighter you dont have to flatter me carlo its simply a matter of establishing ground rules you see as if shed made his point he sat forward to touch her fingertips youre too practical to expect flattery or to be swayed by it is it any wonder im enchanted by you carlo i havent made my point he retreated just enough to keep his attack in full gear you see knowing you i thought you would agree that it was foolish and impractical to book separate rooms when we want to be together you do want to be with me dont you juliet frustrated she stared at him he was turning the entire situation around certain of it juliet groped for a handhold carlo it has nothing to do with my wanting to be with you his brow lifted no no it has to do with the line that separates our business and our personal lives a line thats difficult to draw perhaps impossible for me the truth came out again though this time unplanned i want to be with you juliet every moment we have i find myself resenting even the hour mat youre here and im there a few hours at night isnt enough for me i want more much more for us saying it left him stunned it hadnt been one of his clever moves one of his easy catchphrases that little jewel had come from somewhere inside where it had quietly hidden until it could take him by surprise he rose and to give himself a moment stood by the window to watch a stream of chicago traffic it rushed then came to fitful stops wound and swung then sped on again life was like this he realized you could speed right along but you never knew when something was going to stop you dead in your tracks juliet was silent behind him torn between what hed said what hed meant and what she felt about it from the very beginning shed kept carlos definition of an affair in the front of her mind just one ride on the carousel when the music stopped you got off and knew youd gotten your moneys worth now with a few words he was changing the scope she wondered if either of them was ready carlo since you say i am ill be practical drawing together her resources she rose we have a week left on tour during that time weve got chicago and four other cities to deal with to be honest id rather if our only business right now was with each other he turned and though she thought the smile was a bit odd at least he smiled thats the nicest thing youve said to me in all these days and all these cities juliet she took a step toward him it seemed foolish to think about risks when they had such little time being with you isnt something ill ever forget no matter how much i might want to in years to come juliet no wait i want to be with you and part of me hates the time we lose with other people in separate rooms in all the demands that brought us to each other in the first place but another part of me knows that all of those things are completely necessary those things will still be around after were each back in our separate places no dont think about that now she warned herself if she did her voice wouldnt be steady no matter how much time i spend with you in your suite i need a room of my own if for no other reason than to know its there maybe thats the practical side of me carlo or the vulnerable one he mused but hadnt he just discovered he had a vulnerability of his own her name was juliet so it will be as you want in this and for the best perhaps he might just need a bit of time to himself to think things through no arguing do we argue ever cam her lips curved never giving in to herself as much as him she stepped forward and linked her arms around his neck did i ever tell you that when i first started setting up this tour i looked at your publicity shot and thought you were gorgeous no he brushed his lips over hers why dont you tell me now and sexy she murmured as she drew him closer to the bed very very sexy is that so he allowed himself to be persuaded onto the bed so you decided in your office in new york that wed be lovers i decided in my office in new york that wed never be lovers slowly she began to unbutton his shirt i decided that the last thing i wanted was to be romanced and seduced by some gorgeous sexy italian chef who had a string of women longer than a trail of his own pasta but yes he nuzzled at her neck i think ill prefer the but but it seems to me that you cant make definitive decisions without all the facts being in have i ever told you that your practicality arouses me to the point of madness she sighed as he slipped undone the knot in her robe have i ever told you that im a sucker for a man who brings me flowers flowers he lifted his head then picked up the rosebud hed dropped on the pillow beside them darling did you want one too with a laugh she pulled him back to her juliet decided shed seen more of chicago in the flight into ohare than during the day and a half shed been there cab drives from hotel to television station from television station to department store from department store to bookstore and back to the hotel again werent exactly leisurely sightseeing tours then and there she decided that when she took her vacation at the end of the month shed go somewhere steamy with sun and do nothing more energetic than laze by a pool from dawn to dusk the only hour remotely resembling fun was another shopping expedition where she watched carlo select a plump threepound chicken for his cacciatore he was to prepare his pollastro alla cacciatora from simmer to serve during a live broadcast of one of the countrys toprated morning shows next to the simpson show in la juliet considered this her biggest coup for the tour lets discuss it was the hottest hour on daytime tv and remained both popular and controversial after five consecutive seasons despite the fact that she knew carlos showmanship abilities juliet was nervous as a cat the show would air live in new york she had no doubt that everyone in her department would be watching if carlo was a smash it would be his triumph if he bombed the bomb was all hers such was the rationale in public relations it never occurred to carlo to be nervous he could make cacciatore in the dark from memory with the use of only one hand after watching juliet pace the little green room for the fifth time he shook his head relax my love its only chicken dont forget to bring up the dates well be in the rest of the cities this show reaches all of them youve already told me and the title of the book i wont forget you should remember to mention you prepared this dish for the president when he visited rome last year ill try to keep it in mind juliet wouldnt you like some coffee she shook her head and kept pacing what else i could use some he decided on the spot she glanced toward the pot on a hot plate help yourself he knew if she had something to do shed stop worrying even for a few moments and shed stop pacing up and down in front of him juliet no one with a heart would ask a man to drink that poison thats been simmering since dawn oh without hesitation she assumed the role of pamperer ill see about it grazie at the door she hesitated the reporter for the sun might drop back before the show yes you told me ill be charming muttering to herself she went to find a page carlo leaned back and stretched his legs hed have to drink the coffee when she brought it back though he didnt want any he didnt want to board the plane for detroit that afternoon but such things were inevitable in any case he and juliet would have the evening free in detroit what american state was that in they wouldnt be there long enough to worry about it in any case he would soon be in philadelphia and there see summer he needed to though hed always had friends and was close to many of them hed never needed one as he felt he needed one now he could talk to summer and know what he said would be listened to carefully and not be repeated gossip had never bothered him in the past but when it came to juliet when it came to juliet nothing was as it had been in the past none of his previous relationships with women had ever become a habit waking up in the morning beside a woman had always been pleasant but never necessary every day juliet was changing that he couldnt imagine his bedroom back in rome without her yet shed never been there hed long since stopped imagining other women in his bed rising he began to pace as juliet had when the door opened he turned expecting her the tall willowy blonde who entered wasnt juliet but she was familiar carlo how wonderful to see you again lydia he smiled cursing himself for not putting the name of the suns reporter with the face of the woman hed spent two interesting days in chicago with only eighteen months before you look lovely of course she did lydia dickerson refused to look anything less she was sharp sexy and uninhibited she was also in his memory an excellent cook and critic of gourmet foods carlo i was just thrilled when i heard you were coming into town well do the interview after the show but i just had to drop back and see you she swirled toward him with the scent of spring lilacs and the swish of a wideflared skirt you dont mind of course not smiling he took her outstretched hand its always good to see an old friend with a laugh she put her hands on his shoulders i should be angry with you caro you do have my number and my phone didnt ring last night ah he put his hands to her wrists wondering just how to untangle himself youll have to forgive us lydia the schedule is brutal and theres a complication he winced thinking how juliet would take being labeled a complication carlo she edged closer you cant tell me you havent got a few free hours for an old friend ive a tremendous recipe for vitello tonnato she murmured the words and made the dish sound like something to be eaten in the moonlight who else should i cook it for but the best chef in italy im honored he put his hands on her hips hoping to draw her away with the least amount of insult it wouldnt occur to him until later that hed felt none absolutely none of the casual desire he should have i havent forgotten what a superb cook you are lydia her laugh was low and full of memories i hope you havent forgotten more than that no he let out a breath and opted to be blunt but you see im before he could finish being honest the door opened again with a cup of coffee in her hand juliet walked in then came to a dead stop she looked at the blonde wound around carlo like an exotic vine her brow lifted as she took her gaze to carlos face if only she had a camera her voice was as cool and dry as her eyes i see youve met juliet i ill give you a few moments for the preinterview she said blandly try to wrap it up by eightfifty carlo youll want to check the kitchen set without another word she shut the door behind her though her arms were still around carlos neck lydia looked toward the closed door oops she said lightly carlo let out a long breath as they separated you couldnt have put it better at nine oclock juliet had a comfortable seat midway back in the audience when lydia slipped into the seat beside her she gave the reporter an easy nod then looked back to the set as far as she could tell and shed gone over every inch of it it was perfect when carlo was introduced to cheerful applause she began to relax just a little but when he began preparations on the chicken moving like a surgeon and talking to his host his studio and television audience like a seasoned performer her relaxation was complete he was going to be fantastic hes really something isnt he lydia murmured during the first break something juliet agreed carlo and i met the last time he was in chicago yes i gathered im glad you could make it by this morning you did get the press kit i sent in shes a cool one lydia thought and shifted in her seat yes the feature should be out by the end of the week ill send you a clipping id appreciate it miss trent juliet please for the first time juliet turned and smiled at her fully no need for formality all right juliet i feel like a fool im sorry you shouldnt im very fond of carlo but i dont poach lydia im sure there isnt a woman alive who wouldnt be fond of carlo she crossed her legs as the countdown for taping began again if i thought youd even consider poaching you wouldnt be able to pick up your pencil lydia sat still for a moment then leaned back with a laugh carlo had picked himself quite a handful served him right is it all right to wish you luck juliet shot her another smile id appreciate it the two women mightve come to amicable terms but it wasnt easy for carlo to concentrate on his job while they sat cozily together in the audience his experience with lydia had been a quick and energetic two days he knew little more of her than her preference for peanut oil for cooking and blue bed linen he understood how easy it was for a man to be executed without trial he thought he could almost feel the prickle of the noose around his throat but he was innocent carlo poured the mixture of tomatoes sauce and spices over the browned chicken and set the cover if he had to bind and gag her juliet would listen to him he cooked his dish with the finesse of an artist completing a royal portrait he performed for the audience like a veteran thespian he thought the dark thoughts of a man already at the dock when the show was over he spent a few obligatory moments with his host then left the crew to devour one of his best cacciatores but when he went back to the green room juliet was nowhere in sight lydia was waiting he had no choice but to deal with her and the interview first she didnt make it easy for him but then to his knowledge women seldom did lydia chatted away as though nothing had happened she asked her questions noted down his answers all the while with mischief gleaming in her eyes at length hed had enough all right lydia what did you say to her to whom all innocence lydia blinked at him oh your publicist a lovely woman but then id hardly be one to fault your taste darling he rose swore and wondered what a desperate man should do with his hands lydia we had a few enjoyable hours together no more i know something in her tone made him pause and glance back i dont imagine either of us could count the number of few enjoyable hours weve had with a shrug she rose perhaps she understood him even envied what she thought shed read in his eyes but it wasnt any reason to let him off the hook your juliet and i just chatted darling she dropped her pad and pencil in her bag girl talk you know just girl talk thanks for the interview carlo at the door she paused and turned back if youre ever back in town without a complication give me a ring ciao when she left he considered breaking something before he could decide what would be the most satisfying and destructive juliet bustled in lets get moving carlo the cabs waiting it looks like well have enough time to get back to the hotel check out and catch the earlier plane i want to speak with you yes fine well talk in the cab because she was already heading down the winding corridor he had no choice but to follow when you told me the name of the reporter i simply didnt put it together put what together juliet pulled open the heavy metal door and stepped out on the back lot if it had been much hotter she noted carlo couldve browned his chicken on the asphalt oh that youd known her well its so hard to remember everyone weve met isnt it she slipped into the cab and gave the driver the name of the hotel weve come halfway across the country annoyed he climbed in beside her things begin to blur they certainly do sympathetic she patted his hand detroit and bostonll be down and dirty youll be lucky to remember your own name she pulled out her compact to give her makeup a quick check but then i can help out in philadelphia youve already told me you have a friend there summers different he took the compact from her ive known her for years we were students together we never friends were only friends he ended on a mutter i dont enjoy explaining myself i can see that she pulled out bills and calculated the tip as the cab drew up to the hotel as she started to slide out she gave carlo a long look no one asked you to ridiculous he had her by the arm before shed reached the revolving doors you ask it isnt necessary to ask with words to ask guilt makes you imagine all sorts of things she swung through the doors and into the lobby guilt incensed he caught up with her at the elevators ive nothing to be guilty for a man has to commit some crime some sin for guilt she listened calmly as she stepped into the elevator car and pushed the button for their floor thats true carlo you seem to me to be a man bent on making a confession he went off on a fiery stream of italian that had the other two occupants of the car edging into the corners juliet folded her hands serenely and decided shed never enjoyed herself more the other passengers gave carlo a wide berth as the elevator stopped on their floor did you want to grab something quick to eat at the airport or wait until we land im not interested in food an odd statement from a chef she breezed into the hall take ten minutes to pack and ill call for a bellman the key was in her hand and into the lock before his fingers circled her wrist when she looked up at him she thought shed never seen him truly frustrated before good it was about time i pack nothing until this is settled until whats settled she countered when i commit a crime or a sin i do so with complete honesty it was the closest hed come to an explosion juliet lifted a brow and listened attentively it was lydia who had her arms around me juliet smiled yes i saw quite clearly how you were struggling a woman should be locked up for taking advantage of a man that way his eyes already dark went nearly black youre sarcastic but you dont understand the circumstances on the contrary she leaned against the door carlo i believe i understood the circumstances perfectly i dont believe ive asked you to explain anything now youd better pack if were going to catch that early plane for the second time she shut the door in his face he stood where he was for a moment torn a man expected a certain amount of jealousy from a woman he was involved with he even well enjoyed it to a point what he didnt expect was a smile a pat on the head and breezy understanding when hed been caught in another womans arms however innocently no he didnt expect it carlo decided he wouldnt tolerate it when the sharp knock came on the door juliet was still standing with a hand on the knob wisely she counted to ten before she opened it did you need something carefully he studied her face for a trap youre not angry she lifted her brows no why lydias very beautiful she certainly is he stepped inside youre not jealous dont be absurd she brushed a speck of lint from her sleeve if you found me with another man under similar circumstances youd understand im sure no he closed the door behind him id break his face oh rather pleased she turned away to gather a few things from her dresser thats the italian temperament i suppose most of my ancestors were rather staid hand me that brush will you carlo picked it up and dropped it into her hand staid this means calm and sturdy i suppose though there was one my greatgreatgrandmother i think she found her husband tickling the scullery maid in her staid sort of way she knocked him flat with a castiron skillet i dont think he ever tickled any of the other servants securing the brush in a plastic case she arranged it in the bag im said to take after her taking her by the shoulders he turned her to face him there were no skillets available true enough but im inventive carlo still smiling she slipped her arms around his neck if i hadnt understood exactly what was going on the coffee id fetched for you wouldve been dumped over your head capice si he grinned as he rubbed his nose against hers but he didnt really understand her perhaps that was why he was enchanted by her lowering his mouth to hers he let the enchantment grow juliet he murmured theres a later plane for detroit yes she had wondered if he would ever think of it yes this afternoon did you know its unhealthy for the system to rush as he spoke he slipped the jacket from her arms so that it slid to the floor ive heard something about that very true its much better medically speaking to take ones time to keep a steady pace but not a fast one and of course to give the system time to relax at regular intervals it could be very unhealthy for us to pack now and race to the airport he unhooked her skirt so that it followed her jacket youre probably right of course im right he murmured in her ear it would never do for either of us to be ill on the tour disastrous she agreed in fact it might be best if we both just lay down for a little while the very best one must guard ones health i couldnt agree more she told him as his shirt joined her skirt and jacket she was laughing as they tumbled onto the bed he liked her this way free easy enthusiastic just as he liked her cooler more enigmatic moods he could enjoy her in a hundred different ways because she wasnt always the same woman yet she was always the same soft as she was now warm wherever he touched luxurious wherever he tasted she might be submissive one moment aggressive the next and he never tired of the swings they made love in laughter now something he knew more than most was precious and rare even when the passion began to dominate there was an underlying sense of enjoyment that didnt cloud the fire she gave him more in a moment than hed thought hed ever find with a woman in a lifetime shed never known she could be this way laughing churning happy desperate there were so many things she hadnt known every time he touched her it was something new though it was somehow as if his touch was all shed ever known he made her feel fresh and desirable wild and weepy all at once in the space of minutes he could bring her a sense of contentment and a frantic range of excitements the more he brought the more he gave and the easier it became for her to give she wasnt aware yet nor was he that every time they made love the intimacy grew and spread it was gaining a strength and weight that wouldnt break with simply walking away perhaps if theyd known they would have fought it instead they loved each other through the morning with the verve of youth and the depth of familiarity chapter contents prev next juliet hung up the phone dragged a hand through her hair and swore rising she swore again then moved toward the wide spread of window in carlos suite for a few moments she muttered at nothing and no one in particular across the room carlo lay sprawled on the sofa wisely he waited until shed lapsed into silence problems were fogged in swearing again she stared out the window she could see the mist thick and still hanging outside the glass detroit was obliterated all flights are cancelled the only way were going to get to boston is to stick out our thumbs thumbs never mind she turned and paced around the suite detroit had been a solid round of media and events and the renaissance center a beautiful place to stay but now it was time to move on boston was just a hop away by air so that the evening could be devoted to drafting out reports and a good nights sleep except for the fact that fog had driven in from the lake and put the whole city under wraps stuck juliet thought as she glared out the window again stuck when they had an am live demonstration on a wellestablished morning show in boston he shifted a bit but didnt sit up if it hadnt been too much trouble he couldve counted off the number of times hed been grounded for one reason or another one he recalled had been a flamenco dancer in madrid whod distracted him into missing the last flight out better not to mention it still when such things happened carlo reflected it was best to relax and enjoy the moment he knew juliet better youre worried about the tv in the morning of course i am as she paced she went over every possibility rent a car and drive no even in clear weather it was simply too far they could charter a plane and hope the fog cleared by dawn she took another glance outside they were sixtyfive floors up but they might as well have been sixtyfive feet under no she decided no television spot was worth the risk theyd have to cancel that was that she dropped down on a chair and stuck her stockinged feet up by carlos im sorry carlo theres no way around it well have to scrub boston scrub boston lazily he folded his arms behind his head juliet franconi scrubs nothing cook yes scrub no it took her a moment to realize he was serious i mean cancel you didnt say cancel she heaved out a long breath im saying it now she wiggled her toes finding them a bit stiff after a tenhour day theres no way we can make the television spot and thats the biggest thing we have going in boston therere a couple of print interviews and an autographing we didnt expect much to move there and we were depending on the tv spot for that without it she shrugged and resigned herself its a wash letting his eyes half close carlo decided the sofa was an excellent place to spend an hour or so i dont wash she shot him a level look youre not going to have to do anything but lie on your back she decided after a moment for the next twentyfour hours nothing nothing he grinned moving faster than he looked capable of he sat up grabbed her by the arms and pulled her down with him good you lie with me two backs madonna are better than one carlo she couldnt avoid the first kiss or perhaps she didnt put her best effort into it but she knew it was essential to avoid the second wait a minute only twentyfour hours he reminded her as he moved to her ear no time to waste ive got to stop that she ordered when her thoughts started to cloud therere arrangements to be made what arrangements she made a quick mental sketch true shed already checked out of her room theyd only kept the suite for convenience and until six she could book another separate room for the night but she might as well admit in this case it was foolish moving her shoulders she gave in to innate practicality like keeping the suite overnight thats important he lifted his head a moment her face was already flushed her eyes already soft almost as if shed spoken aloud he followed the train of thought he couldnt help but admire the way her mind worked from one point to the next in such straight lines i have to call new york and let them know our status i have to call boston and cancel then the airport and change our flight then i i think you have a love affair with the phone its difficult for a man to be jealous of an inanimate object phones are my life she tried to slip out from under him but got nowhere carlo i like it when you say my name with just a touch of exasperation its going to be more than a touch in a minute hed thought hed enjoy that as well but you havent told me yet how fantastic i was today you were fantastic it was so easy to relax when he held her like this the phone calls could wait just a bit after all they werent going anywhere you mesmerized them with your linguini my linguini is hypnotic he agreed i charmed the reporter from the free press you left him stupefied detroitll never be the same thats true he kissed her nose boston wont know what its missing dont remind me she began then broke off carlo could almost hear the wheels turning an idea resigned he rolled her on top of him and watched her think it might work she murmured if everyone cooperates it might work very well in fact it might just be terrific what you claim to be a magician as well as an artist modesty prevents me from save it she scrambled up until she stradled him you told me once you could cook in a sewer frowning he toyed with the little gold hoop she wore in her ear yes perhaps i did but this is only an expression how about cooking by remote control his brows drew together but he ran his hand idly to the hem of her skirt that had ridden high on her thigh you have extraordinary legs he said in passing then gave her his attention what do you mean by remote control just that wound up with the idea juliet rose and grabbed her pad and pencil you give me all the ingredients its linguini again tomorrow right yes my specialty good i have all that in the file anyway we can set up a phone session between detroit and the studio in boston you can be on the air there while were here juliet you ask for a lot of magic no its just basic electronics the host of the show paul ohara can put the dish together on the air while you talk him through it its like talking a plane in you know forty degrees to the left a cup of flour no carlo taking his time he pried off his shoes you want him this ohara who smiles for the camera to cook my linguini dont get temperamental on me she warned while her mind leaped ahead to possibilities look you write cookbooks so the average person can cook one of your dishes cook them yes he examined his nails not like franconi she opened her mouth then closed it again tread softly on the ego juliet reminded herself at least until you get your way of course not carlo no one expects that but we could turn this inconvenience into a real event using your cookbook on the air and some personal coaching from you via phone ohara can prepare the linguini hes not a chef or a gourmet but an average person therefore hell be giving the audience the average persons reactions hell make the average persons mistakes that you can correct if we pull it off the sales of your cookbook are going to soar you know you can do it she smiled winningly why you even said you could teach me to cook and im helpless in the kitchen certainly you can talk ohara through one dish of course i can folding his arms again he stared up at the ceiling her logic was infallible her idea creative to be truthful he liked it almost as much as he liked the idea of not having to fly to boston still it hardly seemed fair to give without getting ill do it on one condition which is tomorrow morning i talk this ohara through linguini tonight and he smiled at her we have a dress rehearsal i talk you through it juliet stopped tapping the end of her pencil on the pad you want me to cook linguini with my guidance cara mia you could cook anything juliet thought it over and decided it didnt matter the suite didnt have a kitchen this time so hed be counting on using the hotels that may or may not work if it did once shed botched it they could order room service the bottom line was saving what she could of boston id love to now ive got to make those calls carlo closed his eyes and opted for a nap if he was going to teach two amateurs the secrets of linguini within twelve hours hed need his strength wake me when youve finished he told her we have to inspect the kitchen of the hotel it took her the best part of two hours and when she hung up for the last time juliets neck was stiff and her fingers numb but she had what she wanted hal told her she was a genius and ohara said it sounded like fun arrangements were already in the works this time juliet grinned at the stubborn fog swirling outside the window neither rain nor storm nor dark of night she thought pleased with herself nothing was going to stop juliet trent then she looked over at carlo something tilted inside her that had both her confidence and selfsatisfaction wavering emotion she reflected it was something she hadnt written into the itinerary well maybe there was one catastrophe that wasnt in the books maybe it was one she couldnt work her way through with a creative idea and hustle she simply had to take her feelings for carlo one step at a time four more days she mused and the ride would be over the music would stop and it would be time to get off the carousel it wasnt any use trying to see beyond that yet it was all blank pages she had to hold on to the belief that life was built one day at a time carlo would go then she would pick up the pieces and begin her life again from that point she wasnt fool enough to tell herself she wouldnt cry tears would be shed over him but theyd be shed quietly and privately schedule in a day for mourning she thought then tossed her pad away it wasnt healthy to think of it now there were only four days left for a moment she looked down at her empty hands and wondered if shed have taken the steps shed taken if shed known where they would lead her then she looked over at him and simply watched him sleep even with his eyes closed and that irrepressible inner life he had on hold he could draw her it wasnt simply a matter of his looks she realized she wasnt a woman whod turn her life sideways for simple physical attraction it was a matter of style smiling she rose and walked closer to him as he slept no matter how practical she was how much common sense she possessed she couldnt have resisted his style thered be no regrets she reaffirmed not now nor in five days time when an ocean and priorities separated them as years passed and their lives flowed and altered shed remember a handful of days when shed had something special no time to waste hed said catching her tongue in her teeth juliet decided she couldnt agree more reaching up she began to unbutton her blouse as a matter of habit she draped it carefully over the back of a chair before she unhooked her skirt when that fell she lifted it smoothed it out and folded it the pins were drawn out of her hair one by one then set aside dressed in a very impractical lace camisole and string bikini she moved closer carlo awoke with his blood pumping and his head whirling he could smell her scent lightly in her hair more heady on her skin as her mouth took command of his her body was already heated as she lay full length on him before he could draw his first thoughts together his own body followed suit she was all lace and flesh and passion there wasnt time to steady his control or polish his style urgent and desperate he reached for her and found silk and delicacy strength and demand wherever he touched she unbuttoned his shirt and drew it aside so that their skin could meet and arouse beneath hers she felt his heartbeat race and pound until power made her dizzy capturing his lips once again she thought only of driving him to madness she could feel it spread through him growing building so that it would dominate both of them when he rolled so that she was trapped between the back of the sofa and his body she was ready to relinquish control with a moan dark and liquid she let herself enjoy what shed begun no woman had ever done this to him he understood that as his only thoughts were to devour everything she had his fingers so clever so skilled so gentle pulled at the lace until the thin strap tore with hardly a sound he found her small soft breasts that fit so perfectly in his hands the strong narrow rib cage and slender waist his the word nearly drove him mad she was his now as shed been in the dream shed woken him from perhaps he was still dreaming she smelled of secrets small feminine secrets no man ever fully understood she tasted of passion ripe shivering passion every man craved with his tongue he tasted that sweet subtle valley between her breasts and felt her tremble she was strong hed never doubted it in her strength she was surrendering completely to him for the pleasure of each the lace smelled of her he could have wallowed in it but her skin was irresistible he drew the camisole down to her waist and feasted on her with her hands tangled in his hair her body on fire she thought only of him no tomorrows no yesterdays however much she might deny it in an hour theyd become a single unit one depended on the other for pleasure for comfort for excitement for so much more she didnt dare think of it she yearned for him nothing would ever stop it but now he was taking her fast and furious through doors theyd opened together neither of them had gone there before with another nor would again juliet gave herself over to the dark the heat and to carlo he drew the thin strings riding on her hips craving the essence of her when hed driven her over the first peak he knew and reveled in it with endless waves of desire he whipped her up again and yet again until they were both trembling she called out his name as he ran his lips down her leg all of her was the thought paramount in his mind hed have all of her until she was willing ready to have all of him juliet i want you his face was above hers again his breath straining look at me she was staggering on that razors edge between reason and madness when she opened her eyes his face filled her vision it was all she wanted i want you he repeated while the blood raged in his head only you she was wrapped around him her head arched back for an instant their eyes met and held what coursed through them wasnt something they could try to explain it was both danger and security only she murmured and took him into her they were both stunned both shaken both content naked damp and warm they lay tangled together in silence words had been spoken juliet thought words that were part of the madness of the moment she would have to take care not to repeat them when passion was spent they didnt need words they had four days yet she ached to hear them again to say them again she could set the tone between them she thought she had only to begin now and continue no pressure she kept her eyes closed a moment longer no regrets the extra moment she took to draw back her strength went unnoticed i could stay just like this for a week she murmured though she meant it the words were said lazily turning her head she looked at him smiled are you ready for another nap there was so much he wanted to say so much he thought she didnt want to hear theyd set the rules he had only to follow them nothing was as easy as it shouldve been no he kissed her forehead though ive never found waking from a nap more delightful now i think its time for your next lesson really she caught her bottom lip between her teeth i thought id graduated cooking he told her giving her a quick pinch where italian males were prone to juliet tossed back her hair and pinched him back i thought youd forget about that franconi never forgets a quick shower a change of clothes and down to the kitchen agreeable juliet shrugged she didnt think for one minute the management would allow him to give a cooking lesson in their kitchen thirty minutes later she was proven wrong carlo merely bypassed management he saw no reason to go through a chain of command with very little fuss he steered her through the hotels elegant dining room and into the big lofty kitchen it smelled exotic and sounded like a subway station theyd stop him here juliet decided still certain theyd be dining outside or through room service within the hour though shed changed into comfortable jeans she had no plans to cook after one look at the big room with its oversized appliances and acres of counter she was positive she wouldnt it shouldnt have surprised her to be proven wrong again franconi the name boomed out and echoed off the walls juliet jumped back three inches carlo i think we should but as she spoke she looked up at his face he was grinning from ear to ear pierre as she looked on carlo was enveloped by a wide whiteaproned man with a drooping moustache and a face as big and round as a frying pan his skin glistened with sweat but he smelt inoffensively of tomatoes you italian lecher what do you do in my kitchen honor it carlo said as they drew apart i thought you were in montreal poisoning the tourists they beg me to take the kitchen here the big man with the heavy french accent shrugged tanklike shoulders i feel sorry for them americans have so little finesse in the kitchen they offered to pay you by the pound carlo said dryly your pounds pierre held both hands to his abundant middle and laughed we understand each other old friend still i find america to my liking you why arent you in rome pinching ladies im finishing up a tour for my book but yes you and your cookbooks a noise behind him had him glancing around and bellowing in french juliet was certain the walls trembled with a smile he adjusted his hat and turned back to them that goes well well enough carlo drew juliet up this is juliet trent my publicist so it goes very well pierre murmured as he took juliets hand and brushed his lips over it perhaps i will write a cookbook welcome to my kitchen mademoiselle im at your service charmed juliet smiled thank you pierre dont let this one fool you carlo warned he has a daughter your age bah pierre gave him a lowered brow look shes but sixteen if she were a day older id call my wife and tell her to lock the doors while franconi is in town carlo grinned such flattery pierre with his hands hooked in his back pockets he looked around the room very nice he mused lifting his head he scented the air duck is that duck i smell pierre preened the specialty canard au pierre fantastico carlo swung an arm around juliet as he led her closer to the scent no one absolutely no one does to duck what pierre can do the black eyes in the fryingpan face gleamed no you flatter me mon ami theres no flattery in truth carlo looked on while an assistant carved pierres duck with the ease of experience he took a small sliver and popped it into juliets mouth it dissolved there leaving behind an elusive flavor that begged for more carlo merely laid his tongue on his thumb to test exquisite as always do you remember pierre when we prepared the shahs engagement feast five six years ago seven pierre corrected and sighed your duck and my cannelloni magnificent not so much paprika on that fish he boomed out we are not in budapest those were the days he continued easily but the shrug was essentially gallic when a man has his third child he has to settle down oui carlo gave another look at the kitchen and with an experts eye approved youve picked an excellent spot perhaps youd let me have a corner of it for a short time a corner a favor carlo said with a smile that would have charmed the pearls from oysters ive promised my juliet to teach her how to prepare linguini linguini con vongole biance pierres eyes glittered naturally it is my specialty you can have a corner of my kitchen mon ami in exchange for a plate carlo laughed and patted pierres stomach for you amico two plates pierre clasped him by the shoulders and kissed both cheeks i feel my youth coming back to me tell me what you need in no time at all juliet found herself covered in a white apron with her hair tucked into a chefs hat she might have felt ridiculous if shed been given the chance first you mince the clams juliet looked at carlo then down at the mess of clams on the cutting board mince them like so carlo took the knife and with a few quick moves had half of the clams in small perfect pieces try feeling a bit like an executioner juliet brought the knife down theyre not well alive are they madonna any clam considers himself honored to be part of franconis linguini a bit smaller there yes satisfied he passed her an onion chopped not too fine again he demonstrated but this time juliet felt more at home accepting the knife she hacked again until the onion was in pieces and her eyes were streaming i hate to cook she muttered but carlo only pushed a clove of garlic at her this is chopped very fine its essence is what we need not so much texture he stood over her shoulder watching until he approved youve good hands juliet now here melt the butter following instructions she cooked the onion and garlic in the simmering butter stirring until carlo pronounced it ready now its tender you see we add just a bit of flour he held her hand to direct it as she stirred it in so it thickens we add the clams gently he warned before she could dump them in we dont want them bruised ah he nodded with approval spice he told her its the secret and the strength bending over her he showed her how to take a pinch of this a touch of that and create as the scent became more pleasing her confidence grew shed never remember the amounts or the ingredients but found it didnt matter how about that she asked pointing to a few sprigs of parsley no that comes just at the end we dont want to drown it turn the heat down just a little more there satisfied he nodded the cover goes on snug then you let it simmer while the spices wake up juliet wiped the back of her hand over her damp brow carlo you talk about the sauce as though it lived and breathed my sauces do he said simply while this simmers you grate the cheese he picked up a hunk and with his eyes closed sniffed squisito he had her grate and stir while the rest of the kitchen staff worked around them juliet thought of her mothers kitchen with its tidy counters and homey smells shed never seen anything like this it certainly wasnt quiet pans were dropped people and dishes were cursed and fast was the order of the day busboys hustled in and out weighed down with trays waiters and waitresses breezed through demanding their orders while she watched wideeyed carlo ignored it was time to create his pasta unless it was already cooked and in a meal juliet thought of pasta as something you got off the shelf in a cardboard box she learned differently after her hands were white to the wrists with flour he had her measure and knead and roll and spread until her elbows creaked it was nothing like the fiveminute throwittogether kind she was used to as she worked she began to realize why he had such stamina he had to in cooking for a living the way franconi cooked for a living he used as much energy as any athlete did by the time the pasta had passed his inspection her shoulder muscles ached the way they did after a brisk set of tennis blowing the hair out of her eyes and mopping away sweat juliet turned to him what now now you cook the pasta she tried not to grumble as she poured water into a dutch oven and set it on to boil one tablespoon salt carlo instructed one tablespoon salt she muttered and poured it in when she turned around he handed her a glass of wine until it boils you relax can i turn down the heat he laughed and kissed her then decided it was only right to kiss her again she smelled like heaven i like you in white he dusted flour from her nose youre a messy cook my love but a stunning one it was easy to forget the noisy bustling kitchen cook a bit primly she adjusted her hat isnt it chef he kissed her again dont get cocky one linguini doesnt make a chef she barely finished her wine when he put her back to work put one end of the linguini in the water yes just so now as it softens coil them in careful yes yes you have a nice touch a bit more patience and i might take you on in my restaurant no thanks juliet said definitely as the steam rose in her face she was almost certain she felt each separate pore opening stir easily seven minutes only not a moment more he refilled her glass and kissed her cheek she stirred and drained measured parsley poured and sprinkled cheese by the time she was finished juliet didnt think she could eat a thing nerves she discovered with astonishment she was as nervous as a new bride on her first day in the kitchen with her hands clasped together she watched carlo take a fork and dip in eyes closed he breathed in the aroma she swallowed his eyes remained closed as he took the first sample juliet bit her lip until then she hadnt noticed that the kitchen had become as quiet as a cathedral a quick glimpse around showed her all activity had stopped and all eyes were on carlo she felt as though she were waiting to be sentenced or acquitted well she demanded when she couldnt stand it any longer patience carlo reminded her without opening his eyes a busboy rushed in and was immediately shushed carlo opened his eyes and carefully set down the fork fantastico he took juliet by the shoulders and gave her the ceremonial kiss on each cheek as applause broke out laughing she pulled off her hat with a flourish i feel like i won a gold medal in the decathlon youve created as pierre boomed orders for plates carlo took both her hands we make a good team juliet trent she felt something creeping too close to the heart it just didnt seem possible to stop it yes we make a good team franconi chapter contents prev next by twelve the next day there was absolutely nothing left to be done carlos remote control demonstration on the proper way to prepare linguini had gone far beyond juliets hopes for success shed stayed glued to the television listening to carlos voice beside her and through the speakers when her supervisor called personally to congratulate her juliet knew she had a winner relaxed and satisfied she lay back on the bed wonderful she folded her arms crossed her ankles and grinned absolutely wonderful did you ever doubt it still grinning she shot a look at carlo as he finished off the last of both shares of the late breakfast theyd ordered lets just say im glad its over you worry too much mi amore but he hadnt seen her dig for her little roll of pills in three days it pleased him enormously to know that he relaxed her so that she didnt need them when it comes to franconis linguini you have always a success after this ill never doubt it now we have five hours before flight time five full completely unscheduled hours rising he sat on the end of the bed and ran his fingers along the arch of her foot she looked so lovely when she smiled so lovely when she let her mind rest such a bonus he murmured its like a vacation with a sigh she let herself enjoy the little tingles of pleasure what would you like to do with our vacation of five full unscheduled hours she lifted a brow at him you really want to know slowly he kissed each one of her toes of course the day is yours he brushed his lips over her ankle im at your service springing up she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him hard lets go shopping fifteen minutes later juliet strolled with carlo through the first tower of the enormous circular shopping center attached to the hotel people huddled around the maps of the complex but she breezed around the curve and bypassed one no maps no schedules no routes today it didnt matter where they went do you know she began with all the department stores malls and cities weve been through i havent had a chance to shop you dont give yourself time same thing oh look she stopped at a window display and studied a long evening dress covered with tiny silver bangles very dashing carlo decided dashing juliet agreed if i were six inches taller it might not make me look like a scaleddown pillar shoes she pulled him along to the next shop in short order carlo discovered juliets biggest weakness the way to her heart wasnt through food nor was it paved with furs and diamonds jewelry displays barely earned her glance evening clothes brought a brief survey while day wear and sports clothes won mild interest but shoes were something different within an hour shed studied fondled and critiqued at least fifty pairs she found a pair of sneakers at percent off and bought them to add to an already substantial collection then with a careful maneuver to pick and choose she weeded her selection down to three pair of heels all italian you show excellent taste with the patience of a man accustomed to shopping expeditions carlo lounged in a chair and watched her vacillate between one pair then the other idly he picked up one shoe and glanced at the signature inside he makes an elegant shoe and prefers my lasagna wideeyed juliet pivoted on the thin heels you know him of course once a week he eats in franconis hes my hero when carlo gave her his lifted brow look she laughed i know i can put on a pair of his shoes and go eight hours without needing emergency surgery ill take all three she said on impulse then sat down to exchange the heels for her newly bought sneakers you make me surprised he commented so many shoes when you have only two feet this is not my practical juliet im entitled to a vice juliet pushed the velcro closed besides ive always known italians make the best shoes she leaned closer to kiss his cheek now i know they make the best pasta without a blink at the total she charged the shoes and pocketed the receipt swinging the bag between them they wandered from tower to tower a group of women strolled by earning carlos appreciation shopping during lunch hour he gauged as he tossed an extra look over his shoulder one had to admire the american workforce youll strain your neck that way juliet commented easily she couldnt help but be amused by his blatant pleasure in anything female he merely grinned its simply a matter of knowing just how far to go comfortable juliet enjoyed the feel of his fingers laced with hers id never argue with the expert carlo stopped once intrigued by a choker in amethysts and diamonds this is lovely he decided my sister teresa always preferred purple juliet leaned closer to the glass the small delicate jewels glimmered hot and cold who wouldnt its fabulous she has a baby in a few weeks he murmured then nodded to the discreetly anxious clerk ill see this of course a lovely piece isnt it after taking it out of the locked case he placed it reverently in carlos hand the diamonds are all superior grade naturally and consist of one point three carat the amethyst ill have it thrown off in the middle of his pitch the clerk blinked yes sir an excellent choice trying not to show surprise he took the credit card carlo handed him along with the choker and moved farther down the counter carlo juliet edged closer and lowered her voice you didnt even ask the price he merely patted her hand as he skimmed the other contents in the case my sisters about to make me an uncle again he said simply the choker suits her now emeralds he began would be your stone she glanced down at a pair of earrings with stones the color of dark wet summer grass the momentary longing was purely feminine and easily controlled shoes she could justify emeralds no she shook her head and laughed at him ill just stick with pampering my feet when carlo had his present nicely boxed and his receipt in hand they wandered back out i love to shop juliet confessed sometimes ill spend an entire saturday just roaming its one of the things i like best about new york then youd love rome hed like to see her there he discovered by the fountains laughing strolling through the markets and cathedrals dancing in the clubs that smelled of wine and humanity he wanted to have her there with him going back alone was going back to nothing he brought her hand to his lips as he thought of it holding it there until she paused uncertain carlo people brushed by them and as his look became more intense she swallowed and repeated his name this wasnt the mild masculine appreciation shed seen him send passing women but something deep and dangerous when a man looked at a woman this way the woman was wise to run but juliet didnt know if it were toward him or away he shook off the mood warning himself to tread carefully with her and himself if you came he said lightly i could introduce you to your hero enough of my lasagna and youd have your shoes at cost relieved she tucked her arm through his again you tempt me to start saving for the airfare immediately oh carlo look at this delighted she stopped in front of a window and pointed in the midst of the ornate display was a threefoot indian elephant done in highgloss ceramic its blanket was a kaleidoscope of gilt and glitter and color opulent and regal its head was lifted its trunk curled high juliet fell in love its wonderful so unnecessarily ornate and totally useless he could see it easily in his living room along with the other ornate and useless pieces hed collected over the years but hed never have imagined juliets taste running along the same path you surprise me again a bit embarrassed she moved her shoulders oh i know its awful really but i love things that dont belong anywhere at all then you must come to rome and see my house at her puzzled look he laughed the last piece i acquired is an owl this high he demonstrated by holding out a palm its caught a small unfortunate rodent in its talons dreadful with something close to a giggle she kissed him im sure id love it perhaps you would at that he murmured in any case i believe the elephant should have a good home youre going to buy it thrilled she clasped his hand as they went inside the shop smelled of sandalwood and carried the tinkle of glass from wind chimes set swaying by a fan she left him to make arrangements for shipping while she poked around toying with long strings of brass bells alabaster lions and ornamental tea services all in all juliet mused it had been the easiest most relaxing day shed had in weeks maybe longer shed remember it that she promised herself when she was alone again and life wound down to schedules and the next demand turning she looked at carlo as he said something to make the clerk laugh she hadnt thought there were men like him secure utterly masculine and yet sensitive to female moods and needs arrogant he was certainly that but generous as well passionate but gentle vain but intelligent if she could have conjured up a man to fall in love with oh no juliet warned herself with something like desperation it wouldnt be carlo franconi couldnt be he wasnt a man for one woman and she wasnt a woman for any man they both needed their freedom to forget that would be to forget the plans shed made and had been working toward for ten years it was best to remember that carlo was a ride on a carousel and that the music only played so long she took a deep breath and waited for her own advice to sink in it took longer than it should have determined she smiled and walked to him finished our friend will be home soon very soon after we are then well wish him bon voyage wed better start thinking airport ourselves with his arm around her shoulders they walked out youll give me our philadelphia schedule on the plane youre going to be a smash she told him though you might want to try my brewers yeast before its done i cant believe it at eight oclock juliet dropped down into a chair outside customer service behind her the conveyor belt of baggage was stopped the luggage went to atlanta not so hard to believe carlo returned hed lost his luggage more times than he cared to remember he gave his leather case a pat his spatulas were safe so when do we expect our underwear maybe by ten tomorrow morning disgusted juliet looked down at the jeans and tshirt shed worn on the flight she carried her toiletries and a few odds and ends in her shoulder bag but nothing remotely resembling a business suit no matter she decided shed be in the background then she took a look at carlo he wore a shortsleeved sweatshirt with the word sorbonne dashed across it jeans white at the stress points and a pair of sneakers that werent nearly as new as hers how the hell she wondered was he supposed to go on the air at am dressed like that carlo weve got to get you some clothes i have clothes he reminded her in my bags youre on hello philadelphia in the morning at eight from there we go directly to breakfast with reporters from the herald and the inquirer at ten when our bags may or may not be back youre on midmorning report after that youve already given me the schedule my love whats wrong with this when he gestured toward what he wore juliet stood up dont be cute carlo were heading for the closest department store department store carlo allowed himself to be pulled outside franconi doesnt wear department store this time you do no time to be choosey whats in philadelphia she muttered as she hailed a cab wannamakers holding the door open for him she checked her watch we might just make it they arrived a half hour before closing though he grumbled carlo let her drag him through the old respected philadelphia institution knowing time was against them juliet pushed through a rack of slacks what size thirtyone thirtythree he told her with his brow lifted do i choose my own clothes try this juliet held out a pair of duncolored pleated slacks i prefer the buff he began this is better for the camera now shirts leaving him holding the hanger she pounced on the next rack size what do i know from american sizes he grumbled this should be right she chose an elegant shade of salmon in a thin silk that carlo was forced to admit hed have looked twice at himself go put these on while i look at the jackets its like shopping with your mother he said under his breath as he headed for the dressing rooms she found a belt thin and supple with a fancy little buckle she knew he wouldnt object to after rejecting a half dozen jackets she came across one in linen with a casual unstructured fit in a shade between cream and brown when carlo stepped out she thrust them at him then stood back to take in the entire view its good she decided as he shrugged the jacket on yes its really good the color of the shirt keeps the rest from being drab and the jacket keeps it just casual enough without being careless the day franconi wears clothes off the rack only franconi could wear clothes off the rack and make them look customtailored he stopped meeting the laughter in her eyes you flatter me whatever it takes turning him around she gave him a quick push toward the dressing room strip it off franconi ill get you some shorts the look he sent her was cool with very little patience theres a limit juliet dont worry about a thing she said breezily the publisherll pick up the tab make it fast weve got just enough time to buy your shoes she signed the last receipt five minutes after the pa system announced closing youre set before he could do so himself she bundled up his packages now if we can just get a cab to the hotel were in business i wear your american shoes in protest i dont blame you she said sincerely emergency measures caro foolishly he was moved by the endearment shed never lowered her guard enough to use one before because of it carlo decided to be generous and forgive her for cracking the whip my mother would admire you oh distracted juliet stood at the curb and held out her hand for a cab why shes the only one whos ever poked and prodded me through a store and picked out my clothes she hasnt done so in twenty years all publicists are mothers she told him and switched to her other arm we have to be he leaned closer and caught her earlobe between his teeth i prefer you as a lover a cab screeched to a halt at the curb juliet wondered if it was that which had stolen her breath steadying she bundled carlo and the packages inside for the next few days ill be both it was nearly ten before they checked into the cocharan house carlo managed to say nothing about the separate rooms but he made up his mind on the spot that shed spend no time in her own they had three days and most of that time would be eaten up with business not a moment that was left would be wasted he said nothing as they got into the elevator ahead of the bellman as they rode up he hummed to himself as juliet chatted idly at the door of his suite he took her arm put all the bags in here please he instructed the bellman ms trent and i have some business to see to immediately well sort them out before she could say a word he took out several bills and tipped the bellman himself she remained silent only until they were alone again carlo just what do you think youre doing i told you before that you wanted a room of your own you still have it he pointed out two doors down but youre staying here with me now well order a bottle of wine and relax he took the packages she still carried out of her hands and tossed them on a long low sofa would you prefer something light id prefer not to be hustled around so would i with a grin he glanced over at his new clothes emergency measures hopeless she thought he was hopeless carlo if youd just try to understand the knock on the door stopped her she only muttered a little as he went to answer summer she heard the delight in his voice and turned to see him wrapped close with a stunning brunette carlo i thought youd be here an hour ago the voice was exotic hints of france a slight touch of british discipline as she stepped away from carlo juliet saw elegance flash and style all at once she saw carlo take the exquisite face in his hands as he had so often with hers and kiss the woman long and hard ah my little puff pastry youre as beautiful as ever and you franconi are as full of summer broke off as she spotted the woman standing in the center of the room she smiled and though it was friendly enough she didnt attempt to hide the survey hello you must be carlos publicist juliet trent odd carlo felt as nervous as a boy introducing his first heartthrob to his mother this is summer cocharan the finest pastry chef on either side of the atlantic summer held out a hand as she crossed into the room hes flattering me because he hopes ill fix him an éclair a dozen of them carlo corrected beautiful isnt she summer while juliet struggled for the proper thing to say summer smiled again shed heard something in carlos voice shed never expected to yes she is horrid to work with isnt he juliet juliet felt the laugh come easily yes he is but never dull angling her head she gave carlo a quick intimate look yes there was something here other than business about time too by the way carlo i should thank you for sending young steven to me interested carlo set down his leather case hes working out then wonderfully the young boy who wanted to be a chef juliet murmured and found herself incredibly moved he hadnt forgotten yes did you meet him hes very dedicated summer went on when juliet nodded i think your idea of sending him to paris for training will pay off hes going to be excellent good satisfied carlo patted her hand ill speak with his mother and make the arrangements brows knit juliet stared at him youre going to send him to paris its the only place to study cordon bleu properly carlo gave a shrug as though the matter were everyday then when hes fully trained ill simply steal him away from summer for my own restaurant perhaps you will summer smiled then again perhaps you wont he was going to pay for the education and training of a boy hed met only once juliet thought baffled what sort of a man was it who could fuss for twenty minutes over the knot of his tie and give with such total generosity to a stranger how foolish shed been to think even for a minute that she really knew him its very kind of you carlo she murmured after a moment he gave her an odd look then shrugged it off dues are meant to be paid juliet i was young once and had only a mother to provide for me speaking of mothers he went on smoothly changing the topic how is monique gloriously happy still summer told him and smiled thinking of her mother keil was obviously the man shed been looking for with a laugh she turned back to juliet im sorry carlo and i go back a long way dont be carlo tells me you and he were students together a hundred years ago in paris now summers married her big american wheres blake cam does he trust you with me not for long blake came through the open doorway still elegant after a twelvehour day he was taller than carlo broader but juliet thought she recognized a similarity power both sexual and intellectual this is juliet trent summer began shes keeping carlo in line on his american tour not an easy job a waiter rolled in a bucket of champagne and glasses blake dismissed him with a nod summer tells me your schedule in philadelphias very tight she holds the whip carlo told him with a gesture toward juliet but when his hand came down it brushed her shoulder in a gesture of casual and unmistakable intimacy i thought i might run over to the studio in the morning and watch your demonstration summer accepted the glass of champagne from her husband its been a long time since ive seen you cook good carlo relaxed with the first sip of frosty wine perhaps ill have time to give your kitchen an inspection summer came here to remodel and expand blakes kitchen then stayed on because shed grown attached to it quite right summer sent her husband an amused look in fact ive grown so attached ive decided to expand again yes interested carlo lifted his brow another cocharan house another cocharan summer corrected it took him a moment but juliet saw the moment the words had sunk in emotion shed always expected from him and it was there now in his eyes as he set down his glass youre having a child in the winter summer smiled and stretched out her hand i havent figured out how im going to reach the stove for christmas dinner he took her hand and kissed it then kissed her cheeks one by one weve come a long way cam mia a very long way do you remember the merrygoround she remembered well her desperate flight to rome to flee from blake and her feelings you told me i was afraid to grab the brass ring and so you made me try i wont forget it he murmured something in italian that made summers eyes fill and ive always loved you now make a toast or something before i disgrace myself a toast carlo picked up his glass and slipped his free arm around juliet to the carousel that doesnt end juliet lifted her glass and sipping let the champagne wash away the ache cooking before the camera was something summer understood well she spent several hours a year doing just that while handling the management of the kitchen in the philadelphia cocharan house satisfying her own select clients with a few trips a year if the price and the occasion were important enough and most important of all learning to enjoy her marriage though shed often cooked with carlo in the kitchen of a palace in the less expensive area of the flat she still kept in paris and dozens of other places she never tired of watching him in action while she was said to create with the intensity of a brain surgeon carlo had the flair of an artist shed always admired his expansiveness his ease of manner and especially his theatrics when hed put the finishing touches on the pasta dish hed named not immodestly after himself she applauded with the rest of the audience but shed hitched a ride to the studio with him and juliet for more reason than to feed an old friends ego if summer knew anyone in the world as well as she did herself it was carlo shed often thought in many ways theyd risen from the same dough bravo franconi as the crew began to serve his dish to the audience summer went up to give him a formal kiss on the cheek yes he kissed her back i was magnificent wheres juliet on the phone carlo rolled his eyes to the ceiling dio that woman spends more time on the phone than a new bride spends in bed summer checked her watch shed noted carlos schedule herself i dont imagine shell be long i know youre having a late breakfast at the hotel with reporters you promised to make crepes he reminded her thinking unapologetically of his own pleasure so i did in return do you think you could find a small quiet room for the two of us he grinned and wiggled his brows my love when franconi cant oblige a lady with a quiet room the world stops my thoughts exactly she hooked her arm through his and let him lead her down a corridor and into what turned out to be a storage room with an overhead light youve never lacked class caro so he made himself comfortable on a stack of boxes since i know you dont want my body superb as it is whats on your mind you of course chérie of course i love you carlo her abrupt seriousness made him smile and take her hands and i you always you remember not so long ago when you came through philadelphia on tour for another book you were wondering how to take the job redoing the americans kitchen when you were attracted to him and determined not to be in love with him and determined not to be she corrected you gave me some good advice here and when i visited you in rome i want to return the favor advice grab the brass ring carlo and hold on to it summer who knows you better she interrupted he moved his shoulders no one i saw you were in love with her the moment i stepped into the room the moment you said her name we understand each other too well to pretend he sat a moment saying nothing hed been skirting around the word and its consequences very carefully for days juliet is special he said slowly ive thought perhaps what i feel for her is different thought he let out a small sound and gave up known but the kind of love were speaking of leads to commitment marriage children instinctively summer touched a hand to her stomach carlo would understand that she still had small fears she didnt have to speak of them yes you told me once when i asked you why youd never married that no woman had made your heart tremble do you remember what you told me youd do if you met her run for a license and a priest rising he slipped his hands into the pockets of the slacks juliet had selected for him easy words before the heart trembles i dont want to lose her once said he sighed its never mattered before but now it matters too much to make the wrong move shes elusive summer there are times i hold her and feel part of her pull away i understand her independence her ambition and even admire them i have blake but i still have my independence and my ambition yes he smiled at her do you know shes so like you stubborn when summer lifted a brow he grinned hard in the head and so determined to be the best qualities ive always found strangely appealing in a beautiful woman merci mon cher ami summer said dryly then wheres your problem youd trust me she looked surprised then moved her shoulders as though hed said something foolish of course she cant wont carlo corrected juliet would find it easier to give me her body even part of her heart than her trust i need it summer as much as i need what shes already given me thoughtful summer leaned against a crate does she love you i dont know a difficult admission for a man whod always thought he understood women so well he smiled a little as he realized a man never fully understood the woman most important to him with any other woman hed have been confident he could guide and mold the emotions to his own preference with juliet he was confident of nothing there are times she seems very close and times she seems very detached until yesterday i hadnt fully begun to know my own mind which is i want her with me he said simply when im an old man sitting by the fountains watching the young girls ill still want her with me summer moved over to put her hands on his shoulders frightening isnt it terrifying yet somehow he thought easier now that hed admitted it id always thought it would be easy thered be love romance marriage and children how could i know the woman would be a stubborn american summer laughed and dropped her forehead to his no more than i could know the man would be a stubborn american but he was right for me your juliet is right for you so he kissed summers temple how do i convince her summer frowned a moment thinking with a quick smile she walked over to a corner picking up a broom she held it out to him sweep her off her feet juliet was close to panic when she spotted carlo strolling down the corridor with summer on his arm they mightve been taking in the afternoon sun on the left bank the first wave of relief evaporated into annoyance carlo ive turned this place upside down looking for you he merely smiled and touched a finger to her cheek you were on the phone telling herself not to swear she dragged a hand through her hair next time you wander off leave a trail of bread crumbs in the meantime ive got a very cranky cab driver waiting outside as she pulled him along she struggled to remember her manners did you enjoy the show she asked summer i always enjoy watching carlo cook i only wish the two of you had more time in town as it is your timings very wise yes carlo pushed open the door and held it for both women the french swine comes through next week the door shut with the punch of a bullet labare juliet turned back shed heard him snarl that name before carlo he held up a hand silencing any interruption what does the gallic slug do here precisely what youve done summer returned tossing back her hair she scowled at nothing hes written another book peasant hes fit to cook only for hyenas for rabid hyenas summer corrected seeing that both of her charges were firing up juliet took an arm of each i think we can talk in the cab he will not speak to you carlo announced ignoring juliet i will dice him into very small pieces though she relished the image summer shook her head dont worry i can handle him besides blake finds it amusing carlo made a sound like a snake juliet felt her nerves fraying americans perhaps ill come back to philadelphia and murder him trying her best juliet nudged him toward the cab come now carlo you know you dont want to murder blake labare he corrected with something close to an explosion who is labare juliet demanded in exasperation swine carlo answered pig summer confirmed but i have plans of my own for him hes going to stay at the cocharan house summer spread her hands and examined her nails im going to prepare his meals personally with a laugh carlo lifted her from the ground and kissed her revenge my love is sweeter than even your meringue satisfied he set her down again we were students with this slug carlo explained to juliet his crimes are too numerous to mention with a snap carlo adjusted his jacket i refuse to be on the same continent as he running out of patience juliet glanced at the scowling cab driver you wont be she reminded him youll be back in italy when hes here carlo brightened and nodded youre right summer youll call me and tell me how he fell on his face naturally then its settled his mood altered completely he smiled and picked up the conversation as it ended before the mention of the frenchmans name next time we come to philadelphia carlo promised you and i will make a meal for blake and juliet my veal your bombe you havent sinned juliet until youve tasted summers bombe there wouldnt be a next time juliet knew but she managed to smile ill look forward to it carlo paused as juliet opened the door of the cab but tonight we leave for new york summer smiled as she stepped inside dont forget to pack your broom juliet started to climb into the front seat broom carlo took summers hand in his and smiled an old french expression chapter contents prev new york hadnt changed perhaps it was hotter than when juliet had left it but the traffic still pushed the people still rushed and the noise still rang as she stood at her window at the harley she absorbed it no new york hadnt changed but she had three weeks before shed looked out her office window at not so different a view her primary thought then had been the tour to make a success of it for herself she admitted shed wanted the splash she realized shed gotten it at that moment carlo was in his suite giving an interview to a reporter for the times shed made a halfdozen excuses why she didnt have time to sit in on it hed accepted her usual list of phone calls and details but the truth had been shed needed to be alone later thered be another reporter and a photographer from one of the top magazines on the stands they had network coverage of his demonstration at bloomingdales the italian way had just climbed to number five on the bestsellers list her boss was ready to canonize her juliet tried to remember when shed ever been more miserable time was running out the next evening carlo would board a plane and shed take the short cab ride back to her apartment while she unpacked hed be thousands of miles above the atlantic shed be thinking of him while he flirted with a flight attendant or a pretty seat companion that was his way shed always known it it wasnt possible to bask in success to begin plans on her next assignment when she couldnt see beyond the next twentyfour hours wasnt this exactly what shed always promised herself wouldnt happen hadnt she always picked her way carefully through life so that she could keep everything in perfect focus shed made a career for herself from the ground up and everything she had shed earned shed never considered it ungenerous not to share it but simply practical after all juliet had what she considered the perfect example before her of what happened when you let go the reins long enough to let someone else pick them up her mother had blindly handed over control and had never guided her own life again her promising career in nursing had dwindled down to doctoring the scraped knees of her children shed sacrificed hunks of herself for a man whod cared for her but could never be faithful how close had she come to doing precisely the same thing if she was still certain of anything juliet was certain she couldnt live that way exist she thought but not live so whether she wanted to or not whether she thought she could or not she had to think beyond the next twentyfour hours picking up her pad she went to the phone there were always calls to be made before she could push the first button carlo strolled in i took your key he said before she could ask so i wouldnt disturb you if you were napping but i shouldve known he nodded toward the phone then dropped into a chair he looked so pleased with himself she had to smile howd the interview go perfectly with a sigh carlo stretched out his legs the reporter had prepared my ravioli only last night he thinks correctly that im a genius she checked her watch very good youve another reporter on the way if you can convince him youre a genius he has only to be perceptive she grinned then on impulse rose and went to kneel in front of him dont change carlo leaning down he caught her face in his hands what i am now ill be tomorrow tomorrow hed be gone but she wouldnt think of it juliet kissed him quickly then made herself draw away is that what youre wearing carlo glanced down at his casual linen shirt and trim black jeans of course its what im wearing if i wasnt wearing this id be wearing something else hmm she studied him trying to judge him with a cameras eye actually i think it might be just right for this article something informal and relaxed for a magazine thats generally starched collars and ties it should be a unique angle grazie he said dryly as he rose now when do we talk about something other than reporters after youve earned it youre a hard woman juliet solid steel but she couldnt resist putting her arms around him and proving otherwise after youve finished being a hit across the hall well head down to bloomingdales he nudged her closer until their bodies fit and then then you have drinks with your editor he ran the tip of his tongue down her neck then then you have the evening free a late supper in my suite their lips met clung then parted it could be arranged champagne youre the star whatever you want you she pressed her cheek against his tonight this last night thered be no restriction me it was ten before they walked down the hall to his suite again juliet had long since lost the urge to eat but her enthusiasm in the evening hadnt waned carlo it never ceases to amaze me how you perform if youd chosen show business youd have a wall full of oscars timing innamorata it all has to do with timing you had them eating your pasta out of your hand i found it difficult he confessed and stopped at the door to take her into his arms when i could think of nothing but coming back here tonight with you then you do deserve an oscar every woman in the audience was certain you were thinking only of her i did receive two interesting offers her brow lifted oh really hopeful he nuzzled her chin are you jealous she linked her fingers behind his neck im here and theyre not such arrogance i believe i still have one of the phone numbers in my pocket reach for it franconi and ill break your wrist he grinned at her he liked the flare of aggression in a woman with skin the texture of rose petals perhaps ill just get my key then a better idea amused juliet stood back as he opened the door she stepped inside and stared the room was filled with roses hundreds of them in every color shed ever imagined flowed out of baskets tangled out of vases spilled out of bowls the room smelled like an english garden on a summer afternoon carlo where did you get all these i ordered them she stopped as she leaned over to sniff at a bud ordered them for yourself he plucked the bud out of its vase and handed it to her for you overwhelmed she stared around the room for me you should always have flowers he kissed her wrist roses suit juliet best a single rose a hundred roses there was no in between with carlo again he moved her unbearably i dont know what to say you like them like them yes of course i love them but then you have to say nothing you promised to share a late supper and champagne taking her hand he led her across the room to the table already set by the wide uncurtained window a magnum of champagne was chilling in a silver bucket white tapers were waiting to be lit carlo lifted a cover to show delicately broiled lobster tails it was juliet thought the most beautiful spot in the world how did you manage to have all this here waiting i told room service to have it here at ten he pulled out her chair i too can keep a schedule my love when hed seated her carlo lit the candles then dimmed the lights so that the silver glinted at another touch music flowed out toward her juliet ran her fingertip down the slim white column of a candle then looked at him when he joined her he drew the cork on the champagne as it frothed to the lip he filled two glasses hed make their last night special she thought it was so like him sweet generous romantic when they parted ways theyd each have something memorable to take with them no regrets juliet thought again and smiled at him thank you to happiness juliet yours and mine she touched her glass to his watching him as she sipped you know some women might suspect a seduction when theyre dined with champagne and candlelight yes do you she laughed and sipped again im counting on it god she excited him just watching her laugh hearing her speak he wondered if such a thing would mellow and settle after years of being together how would it feel he wondered to wake comfortably every morning beside the woman you loved sometimes he thought you would come together at dawn with mutual need and sleepy passion other times you would simply lie together secure in the nights warmth hed always considered marriage sacred almost mysterious now he thought it would be an adventure one he intended to share with no one but juliet this is wonderful juliet let the buttery lobster dissolve on her tongue ive been completely spoiled carlo filled her glass again spoiled how this champagnes a far cry from the little reisling i splurge on from time to time and the food she took another bite of lobster and closed her eyes in three weeks my entire attitude toward food has changed im going to end up fat and penniless supporting my habit so youve learned to relax and enjoy is it so bad if i continue to relax and enjoy im going to have to learn how to cook i said id teach you i managed the linguini she reminded him as she drew out the last bite one lesson only it takes many years to learn properly then i guess ill have to make do with the little boxes that say complete meal inside sacrilege caro now that your palate is educated he touched her fingers across the table juliet i still want to teach you she felt her pulse skid and though she concentrated she couldnt level it she tried to smile youll have to write another cookbook next time you tour you can show me how to make spaghetti ramble she told herself when you rambled you couldnt think if you write one book a year i should be able to handle it when you come around this time next year i could manage the next lesson by then maybe ill have my own firm and you can hire me after three bestsellers you should think about a personal publicist a personal publicist his fingers tightened on hers then released perhaps youre right he reached in his pocket and drew out an envelope i have something for you juliet recognized the airline folder and took it with a frown is there trouble on your return flight i thought id she trailed off when she saw her own name on a departing flight for rome come with me juliet he waited until her gaze lifted to his come home with me more time she thought as she gripped the ticket he was offering her more time and more pain it was time she accepted thered be pain she waited until she was certain she could control her voice and her words i cant carlo we both knew the tour would end the tour yes but not us hed thought hed feel confident assured even cheerful he hadnt counted on desperation i want you with me juliet very carefully she set the ticket aside it hurt she discovered to take her hand from it its impossible nothings impossible we belong with each other she had to deflect the words somehow she had to pretend they didnt run deep inside her and swell until her heart was ready to burst carlo we both have obligations and theyre thousands of miles apart on monday well both be back at work that isnt something that must be he corrected its you and i who must be if you need a few days to tidy your business here in new york well wait next week the week after we fly to rome tidy my business she rose and found her knees were shaking do you hear what youre saying he did and didnt know what had happened to the words hed planned demands were coming from him where hed wanted to show her need and emotion he was stumbling over himself where hed always been surefooted even now cursing himself he couldnt find solid ground im saying i want you with me he stood and grabbed her arms the candlelight flickered over two confused faces schedules and plans mean nothing dont you see i love you she went stiff and cold as though hed slapped her a hundred aches a multitude of needs moved through her and with them the knowledge that hed said those words too many times to count to women he couldnt even remember you wont use that on me carlo her voice wasnt strong but he saw fury in her eyes ive stayed with you until now because you never insulted me with that insult astonished then enraged he shook her insult you by loving you by using a phrase that comes much too easily to a man like you and doesnt mean any more than the breath it takes to say it his fingers loosened slowly until hed dropped her arms after this after what weve had together youd throw yesterdays at me you didnt come to me untouched juliet we both know theres a difference i hadnt made my success as a lover a career she knew it was a filthy thing to say but thought only of defense i told you before how i felt about love carlo i wont have it churning up my life and pulling me away from every goal ive ever set you you hand me a ticket and say come to rome then expect me to run off with you for a fling leaving my work and my life behind until weve had our fill his eyes frosted i have knowledge of flings juliet of where they begin and where they end i was asking you to be my wife stunned she took a step back again as if hed struck her his wife she felt panic bubble hot in her throat no it came out in a whisper terrified juliet ran to the door and across the hall without looking back it took her three days before shed gathered enough strength to go back to her office it hadnt been difficult to convince her supervisor she was ill and needed a replacement for the last day of carlos tour as it was the first thing he told her when she returned to the office days later was that she belonged in bed she knew how she looked pale holloweyed but she was determined to do as shed once promised herself pick up the pieces and go on shed never do it huddled in her apartment staring at the walls deb i want to start cleaning up the schedule for lia barristers tour in august you look like hell juliet glanced up from her desk already cluttered with schedules to be photocopied thanks if you want my advice youll move your vacation by a few weeks and get out of town you need some sun juliet i need a list of approved hotels in albuquerque for the barrister tour with a shrug deb gave up youll have them in the meantime look over these clippings that just came in on franconi looking up she noted that juliet had knocked her container of paperclips on the floor coordinations the first thing to go lets have the clippings well theres one im not sure how to deal with deb slipped a clipping out of the folder and frowned at it its not one of ours actually but some french chef whos just starting a tour labare impressed deb looked up yeah howd you know just a sick feeling anyway franconis name was brought up in the interview because the reporter had done a feature on him this labare made some well unpleasant comments taking the clipping juliet read what her assistant had highlighted cooking for peasants by a peasant she read in a mumble oil starch and no substance there was more but juliet just lifted a brow she hoped summers plan of revenge went perfectly were better off ignoring this she decided and dropped the clipping in the trash if we passed it on to carlo he might challenge labare to a duel skewers at ten paces juliet merely sent her a cool look what else have you got there might be a problem with the dallas feature she said as she gave juliet a folder the reporter got carried away and listed ten of the recipes straight out of the book juliets head flew back did you say ten count em i imagine franconis going to blow when he sees them juliet flipped through the clippings until she came to it the feature was enthusiastic and flattering the timid ms tribly had used the angle of preparing an entire meal from antipasto to dessert carlos recipes from the italian way were quoted verbatim what was she thinking of juliet muttered she couldve used one or two without making a ripple but this think franconis going to kick up a storm i think our ms triblys lucky shes a few thousand miles away youd better get me legal if he wants to sue well be better off having all the facts after nearly two hours on the phone juliet felt almost normal if there was a hollowness she told herself it was a skipped lunch and breakfast if she tended to miss whole phrases that were recited to her she told herself it was hard to keep up with legalese they could sue or put ms triblys neck in a sling both of which would create a miserable mess when she had two other authors scheduled for dallas that summer carlo would have to be told she reflected as she hung up it wouldnt be possible or at least ethical to crumple up the clipping and pretend it didnt exist as she had with the one from labare the problem was whether to let legal inform him pass it off through his editor or bite the bullet and write him herself it wouldnt hurt to write him she told herself as she toyed with her pen shed made her decision said her piece and stepped off the carousel they were both adults both professionals dictating his name on a letter couldnt cause her any pain thinking his name caused her pain swearing juliet rose and paced to the window he hadnt meant it as she had consistently for days juliet went over and over their last evening together it was all romance to him just flowers and candlelight he could get carried away with the moment and not suffer any consequences i love you such a simple phrase careless and calculating he hadnt meant it the way it had to be meant marriage it was absurd hed slipped and slid his way out of marriage all of his adult life hed known exactly how shed felt about it thats why hed said it juliet decided hed known it was safe and shed never agree she couldnt even think about marriage for years there was her firm to think of her goals her obligations why couldnt she forget the way hed made her laugh the way hed made her burn memories sensations didnt fade even a little with the days that had passed somehow they gained in intensity haunted her taunted her sometimes too often shed remember just the way hed looked as hed taken her face in his hand she touched the little heart of gold and diamonds she hadnt been able to make herself put away more time she told herself she just needed more time perhaps shed have legal contact him after all juliet turning from the window juliet saw her assistant at the door yes i rang you twice im sorry theres a delivery for you do you want them to bring it in here an odd question juliet thought and returned to her desk of course deb opened the door wider in here a uniformed man wheeled a dolly into the room confused juliet stared at the wooden crate nearly as big as her desk where do you want this miss ah there theres fine with an expert move he drew the dolly free just sign here he held out a clipboard as juliet continued to stare at the crate have a nice day oh yes thank you she was still staring at it when deb came back in with a small crowbar whatd you order nothing come on open it impatient deb handed her the crowbar im dying i cant think what it might be slipping the crowbar under the lid juliet began to pry unless my mother sent on my grandmothers china like shes been threatening for the last couple of years this is big enough to hold a set for an army probably all packing juliet muttered as she put her back into it when the lid came off she began to push at the heaps of styrofoam does your grandmothers china have a trunk a what a trunk unable to wait deb shoved through the styrofoam herself good god juliet it looks like an elephant juliet saw the first foolish glitter and stopped thinking help me get it out between the two of them they managed to lift the big bulky piece of ceramic out of the crate and onto her desk thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever seen deb said when she caught her breath its ugly ostentatious and ridiculous yes juliet murmured i know what kind of madman would send you an elephant only one kind juliet said to herself and ran her hand lovingly down the trunk my twoyearold could ride on it deb commented and spotted the card that had come out with the packing here you are now youll know who to press charges against she wouldnt take the card juliet told herself she wouldnt look at it shed simply pack the elephant back up and ship it away no sensible woman became emotional about a useless piece of glass three feet high she took the card and ripped it open dont forget she started to laugh as the first tears fell deb stood beside her without a clue juliet are you all right no she pressed her cheek against the elephant and kept laughing ive just lost my mind when she arrived in rome juliet knew it was too late for sanity she carried one bag which shed packed in a frenzy if itd been lost en route she wouldnt have been able to identify the contents practicality shed left it behind in new york what happened next would determine whether she returned for it she gave the cab driver carlos address and settled back for her first whirlwind ride through rome perhaps shed see it all before she went home perhaps she was home decisions had to be made but she hoped she wouldnt make them alone she saw the fountains carlo had spoken of they rose and fell never ending and full of dreams on impulse she made the driver stop and wait while she dashed over to one she couldnt even name with a wish she flung in a coin she watched it hit and fall to join thousands of other wishes some came true she told herself that gave her hope when the driver barreled up to the curb and jerked to a halt she began to fumble with bills he took pity on her and counted out the fare himself because she was young and in love he added only a moderate tip not daring to let herself stop her forward progress juliet ran up to the door and knocked the dozens of things she wanted to say had planned to say jumbled in her mind until she knew shed never be able to guarantee what would come out first but when the door opened she was ready the woman was lovely dark curvy and young juliet felt the impetus slip away from her as she stared so soon was all she could think he already had another woman in his home for a moment she thought only to turn and walk away as quickly as she could then her shoulders straightened and she met the other womans eyes straight on ive come to see carlo the other woman hesitated only a moment then smiled beautifully youre english juliet inclined her head she hadnt come so far risked so much to turn tail and run american come in im angelina tuchina juliet trent the moment she offered her hand it was gripped ah yes carlo spoke of you juliet nearly laughed how like him but he never said you would visit come this way were just having some tea i missed him when he was in america you see so ive kept him home from the restaurant today to catch up it amazed her that she could find it amusing it ran through her mind that angelina and many others were going to be disappointed from now on the only woman who was going to catch up with carlo was herself when she stepped into the salon amusement became surprise carlo sat in a highbacked satin chair having an intense conversation with another female this one sat on his lap and was no more than five carlo you have company he glanced up and the smile hed used to charm the child on his lap vanished so did every coherent thought in his mind juliet here let me take this angelina slipped juliets bag from her hand while she gave carlo a speculative look shed never seen him dazed by a woman before rosa come say good morning to signorina trent rosa is my daughter rosa slipped off carlos lap and staring all the way came to juliet good morning signorina trent pleased with her english she turned to her mother with a spate of italian with a laugh angelina picked her up she says you have green eyes like the princess carlo told her of carlo arent you going to ask miss trent to sit down with a sigh angelina indicated a chair please be comfortable you must forgive my brother miss trent sometimes he loses himself in the stories he tells rosa brother juliet looked at angelina and saw carlos warm dark eyes over the quick elation she wondered how many different ways you could feel like a fool we must be on our way angelina walked over to kiss her still silent brothers cheek as she did she was already planning to drop by her mothers shop and relate the story of the american whod made carlo lose his voice i hope we meet again while youre in rome miss trent thank you juliet took her hand and met the smile and all its implications with an acknowledging nod im sure we will well let ourselves out carlo ciao he was still silent as juliet began to wander around the room stopping here to admire this there to study that art of every culture was represented at its most opulent it shouldve been overwhelming museumlike instead it was friendly and lighthearted just a bit vain and utterly suited to him you told me id like your home she said at length i do he managed to rise but not to go to her hed left part of himself back in new york but he still had his pride you said you wouldnt come she moved one shoulder and decided it was best not to throw herself at his feet as shed intended you know women franconi they change their minds you know me she turned then and managed to face him i like to keep business in order business grateful shed had the foresight juliet reached in her purse and drew out the dallas clipping this is something youll want to look over when she came no farther he was forced to go over and take it from her her scent was there as always it reminded him of too much too quickly his voice was flat and brisk as he looked at her you came to rome to bring me a piece of paper perhaps youd better look at it before we discuss anything else he kept his eyes on hers for a long silent minute before he lowered them to the paper so more clippings he began then stopped whats this she felt her lips curve at the change of tone what i thought youd want to see she thought she understood the names he called the unfortunate ms tribly though they were all in fast furious italian he said something about a knife in the back balled the clipping up and heaved it in a scrubbed hearth across the room juliet noted as a matter of interest that his aim was perfect what does she try to do he demanded her job a bit too enthusiastically job is it her job to quote all my recipes and wrong incensed he whirled around the room she has too much oregano in my veal im afraid i didnt notice juliet murmured in any case youre entitled to retribution retribution he relished the word and made a circle of his hands ill fly to dallas and squeeze my retribution from her skinny throat theres that of course juliet pressed her lips together to keep the laughter in how had she ever thought shed convince herself she could do without him or a legal suit ive given it a lot of thought however and feel the best way might be a very firm letter of disapproval disapproval he spun back to her do you simply disapprove of murder in your country she overspiced my veal after clearing her throat juliet managed to soothe i understand carlo but i believe it was an honest mistake all around if you remember the interview she was nervous and insecure it appears to be you just overwhelmed her muttering something nasty he stuck his hands in his pockets ill write to her myself that might be just the right touch if you let legal take a look at it first he scowled then looked at her carefully from head to foot she hadnt changed hed known she wouldnt somehow that fact comforted and distressed all at once you came to rome to discuss lawsuits with me she took her life in her hands i came to rome she said simply he wasnt sure he could go any closer without having to touch and touching take the hurt hadnt faded he wasnt certain it ever would why because i didnt forget since he wouldnt come to her she went to him because i couldnt forget carlo you asked me to come and i was afraid you said you loved me and i didnt believe you he curled his fingers to keep them still and now now im still afraid the moment i was alone the moment i knew youd gone i had to stop pretending even when i had to admit i was in love with you i thought i could work around it i thought i had to work around it juliet he reached for her but she stepped back quickly i think youd better wait until i finish please she added when he only came closer then finish quickly i need to hold you oh carlo she closed her eyes and tried to hang on i want to believe i can have a life with you without giving up what i am what i need to be but you see i love you so much im afraid id give up everything the moment you asked me dio what a woman because she wasnt certain if it was a compliment or an insult juliet remained silent as he took a quick turn around the room dont you understand that i love you too much to ask if you werent who you are i wouldnt be in love with you if i love juliet trent why would i want to change her into that juliet trent i dont know carlo i just i was clumsy when she lifted her hands he caught them in his to quiet her the night i asked you to marry me i was clumsy there were things i wanted to say ways id wanted to say them but it was too important what comes easily with every woman becomes impossible with the only woman i didnt think youd meant no before she could resist hed brought her hands to his lips ive thought back on what i said to you you thought i was asking you to give up your job your home and come to rome to live with me i was asking less and much more i should have said juliet youve become my life and without you im only half of what i was share with me carlo i want to she shook her head and went into his arms i want to i can start over learn italian there must be a publisher in rome who could use an american drawing her back by the shoulders he stared at her what are you talking about starting over youre starting your own firm you told me it doesnt matter i can no he took her more firmly it matters a great deal to both of us so youll have your own firm one day in new york who knows better than i how successful youll be i can have a wife to brag about as much as i brag about myself but you have your restaurant here yes i think perhaps youd consider having a branch of your public relations company in rome learning italian is an excellent decision ill teach you myself who better i dont understand you how can we share our lives if im in new york and youre in rome he kissed her because it had been much too long he drew her closer because she was willing to give something hed never have asked i never told you my plans that night ive been considering opening another restaurant franconis in rome is of course the best incomparable she found his mouth again dismissing any plans but that of course so a franconis in new york would be twice the best in new york she tilted her head back just enough to see him youre thinking of opening a restaurant in new york my lawyers are already looking for the right property you see juliet you wouldnt have escaped me for long you were coming back once i could be certain i wouldnt murder you we have our roots in two countries we have our business in two countries well have our lives in two countries things were so simple shed forgotten his unending generosity now she remembered everything theyd already shared thought of everything theyd yet to share she blinked at tears i shouldve trusted you and yourself juliet he framed her face until his fingers slid into her hair dio how ive missed you i want my ring on your finger and yours on mine how long does it take to get a license in rome grinning he whirled her in his arms i have connections by the end of the week youll be what is it stuck with me and you with me take me to bed carlo she pressed against him knowing she had to get still closer i want you to show me again what the rest of our lives will be like ive thought of you here with me he pressed his lips against her temple as he remembered the words shed hurled at him on that last night juliet troubled he drew away touching only her hands you know what i am how ive lived i cant take it back nor would i if i could thereve been other women in my bed carlo her fingers tightened on his perhaps i said foolish things once but im not a fool i dont want to be the first woman in your bed i want to be the last the only juliet mi amore from this moment there is only you she pressed his hand to her cheek can you hear it what the carousel smiling she held out her arms its never stopped
