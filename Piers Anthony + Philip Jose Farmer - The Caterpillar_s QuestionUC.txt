chapter they had told jack they thought it was psychosomatic she could talk if she wanted to and might even recover the sight of one eye but it had taken seven years to obtain the grant from the foundation and now she was thirteen he glanced at her sitting tight and stiff in the passenger bucket her dark hair was cut so short it was boyish but the gentle bulges in the heavy mans shirt she wore belied any boyhood or childhood one hand toyed indifferently with the buckle of the seat belt and under her cotton skirt the shiny length of a metal brace paralleled her left leg her sharp chin pointed forward but of course she was not watching anything the horn of the car behind him blared as the light changed jack shifted and edged out waiting for the string of late leftturners to clear he wasnt even certain which city this was the hours of silent driving had grown monotonous are you ready to stop tappy but she did not answer or make any sign he knew she heard and understoodbut he was still a stranger and she was afraid had they even bothered to tell her where she was going or why tappuah concord maimed at the age of six in the accident that killed her father she had never known her mother and the nearest of km that took her in had not been pleased very long with the burden jack had no doubt they had made this plain to the little girl many times he pulled into a roadside restaurant his job was to transport her safely to the clinic she couldnt cover a thousand miles without eating why hadnt they sent her by plane so that all this driving was unnecessary no the plane was out of the question tappy surely still remembered that last trip in her fathers little flier apparently piers anthony and philip jose farmer there had been a miscalculation and they had crashed jack had not inquired about the details for tappy had been there listening and he had never been one for pointless cruelty he got out opened her door unsnapped her seat belt slipped his hands under her arms and lifted her to her feet they had warned him about this too there was often no way to make her come except to make her come anywhere otherwise she might simply sit there indefinitely staring sightlessly ahead he felt awkward putting his hands on her but she did not seem to notice he guided her firmly by the elbow and stopped at the little sign pointing to the ladies room not certain whether the girl knew her way around public facilities and doubtful what hed do if she didnt he had to ask her rather awkwardly because of the people passing nearby and she shook her head no was it wisest to treat her as a child or as a woman the difference was important the moment they left the isolation of the car he decided on the latter at least in public places they took a comer table enduring the interminable wait for their order he was superconscious of the glances of others but tappy seemed oblivious to her surroundings she kept her hands in her lap eyes downcast and incurious and he saw too clearly the narrow white scar that crossed one eye and terminated at the mutilated ear what did his petty embarrassment mean compared to her problems lookit that girls ears gone exclaimed a younger boy at a neighboring table his voice startlingly loud there was a fierce shushing that was worse than the remark because it confirmed its accuracy heads turned first toward the boy then toward the object of the boys curiosity a slow tear started down tappys left cheek jack stood up so suddenly that his chair crashed backward and he stepped around the table and caught her arm and brought her out of that place it was as if he had tunnel vision all he saw was the escape route the room and people fuzzing out at the periphery they made it to the car strapped in and he drove arrowing down the highway at a dangerous velocity he was first numb then furiousbut he wasnt sure at what gradually he cooled and knew that the worst of the situation had been his own reaction it was too late to undo what damage he might have done but he could at least be guided more sensibly henceforth he schooled himself not to react like that no matter what happened next time the caterpillars question but first he had something more difficult to do tappy im sorry i shouldnt have done diat i just he faltered for she was not reacting at all im sorry she might as well have been a statue at dusk starving he drew up to a motel and left tappy in the seat while he registered for two rooms he took her to one of them and sat her on the bed he crossed the street and bought a sixpack of fruit drinks and two submarine sandwiches for their supper class fare jt was not but it was all he could think of at the moment he set things up precariously on the bed in her room and was glad to see that she had a good appetite she evidently was not used to this particular menu but was experienced with bedroom meals his pleasure became concern as he thought about it had they ever let her eat at the table family style he could see why they might not have but it bothered him anyway there was a human being inside that tortured shell his thoughts drifted to his own motives why had he taken this job a week before hed have laughed if someone had predicted hed be sitting on a motel bed eating supper with a blind girl almost ten years his junior but he hadnt realized how hard it would be for a budding artist with one year of college to get a decent summer job jack had kicked around for two three yearshe didnt know exactly where the time wentbefore running into donna then suddenly he had the need to make something of himself so he went to college and studied art did okay too he did have talent but by the time he got it together donna had drifted elsewhere he never even got to tell her of the effect she had on his motivation he grieved of course and considered giving it up but he discovered that life did go on and there might even be other girls on the horizon meanwhile he needed wherewithal to continue college that kept him busy around the edges he soon realized that he was not likely to make it by washing dishes at joints that had never heard of the minimum wage scale or changing tires for tips or taking any of the other menial positions for which one year of art seemed to qualify him the ad had offered a thousand dollars plus liberal expenses and the use of a good car for one weeks light work it had seemed too good to be true and he was amazed to learn that the job hadnt been taken no it didnt involve drugs or anything piers anthony and philip jose farmer illegal it was just chauffeuring if he had a valid license and a good record jack had little else but he did have those he valued his potential career as a worldfamous artist too much to mess it up with bad driving he liked to travel every new region was grist for his painting the job was to deliver tappy to the clinic across the country he assumed mat it was legal for him to transport this child or they would not have hired him he needed the money and didnt ask too many questions he had had no idea that jobs like this existed if he could find a couple more like this at similar pay scales his next year of college would be assured they had covered four hundred miles today at this rate hed have tappy at the clinic the day after tomorrow and could be back two days early the pay was for the job not the time so he had nothing to lose by being prompt if the girl didnt talk at least she wasnt much trouble after this hed get sandwiches and theyd eat in the car avoiding restaurants entirely jack cleaned up the mess of crumbs and told tappy hed check on her in the morning you can find your way around the room okay bathrooms in a straight line from the bed and theres a radio im in the next unit if you need me just yell he paused embarrassed remembering that she was mute or chose to be i mean you can bang on the wall or something that okay slowly she nodded and he was relieved she responded so little that he was never quite sure she understood him good now get some sleep ill knock before i come in so i wont catch you by surprise that was his concession to the woman aspect of her she had to have time to cover up if she happened to be changing it all seemed simple enough but in the morning he found her sitting there still shivering the moisture squeezing hopelessly out of one eye she might have moved about during the night but the dark patches under her eyes showed she had not slept why he demanded incredulously why didnt you summon me if you couldnt sleep she answered him only with that catatonic passivity and a tear evidently there was something he had missed he told her to go to the bathroom while he fetched breakfast and she did he told her to change her clothing while he faced the caterpillars question into a comer and she did he no longer trusted her to do things in his absence but he intended to treat her with propriety they ate and got back on the road jack pondered the event of the night as he drove deeply disturbed he had not mistreated tappy and there had been no trouble except for the business at the restaurant he had spoken to her and had supper with her and she had not been crying then she didnt seem to be afraid of him though he wouldnt have blamed her for that indifferent perhaps but not fearful so what was bothering her he was taking her to the clinic that might bring back her sight and make her talk she should be happy dont you want to see again he asked her i mean theres all kinds of scenery out here were in new york state now she turned suddenly toward him startling him into silence he glanced at her but her face showed no emotion after a moment she straightened out again there was something this was her first voluntary response to him she had reacted to something he had said was it his question about her sight you do want to see he repeated but this time there was no reaction apparently she had acted without thought but now she had clamped down again she couldnt want to stay blind maybe his question had deserved no answer yet she had reacted there had to be something else something she knew that he didnt was it really a clinic she was destined for or had that been something they told him to obtain his cooperation now that he thought about it there were a number of funny things about this whole arrangement if they had so much money for specialists and enough to pay him so generously for unskilled labor why hadnt they done something about her ear comparatively minor cosmetic surgery could have eliminated most of the scar tissue on her face too and there had to be something better than that ugly metal brace on her leg she wasnt paralytic the leg should have mended by now and why hadnt they hired a professional nurse for this trip nurses could drive this was a gearshift car but only because he had asked for it he preferred to do his own driving they could have gotten an automatic shift for a nurse why had they been so happy to trust him a male stranger they had hardly checked his credentials which were minimal the only virtue he piers anthony and philip jose farmer seemed to have was ignorance yet for three days tappy was in his hands anything could happen legally she was still a child but she was a womanchild he drove on no longer in a hurry the doubt kept spiraling through his mind growing uglier with every loop if not a clinic whatl tappy wouldnt talk to him so he talked to her just to keep his mind off whatever unthinkable thing it sought maybe it was to inhibit his own suspicions he read out the stupid billboards as they threaded their way through the complex of schenectady albany and troy he cussed out the other drivers he kept up a meaningless monologue anything to fill the air with sound and keep his mind at bay jack did not allow himself to wonder why he was deviating from the direct route marked on his map he just drove where the scenery looked best finally as evening came to the highway he felt a soft touch on his arm he looked and found her slumped like a straw doll sleeping this was the supreme compliment tappy would not speak but she now trusted him enough to sleep jack realized then coincidentally why she had reacted when he talked to her initially it had been the first time he had spoken to her without an imperative he had started to describe the scenery they were passing perhaps it had been a long time since anyone had talked to her about anything that might interest her however slightly he drove more carefully then winding around the curves as the mountain ridge loomed high ahead marking the physique of the state of vermont just before the road seemed fated to plunge suicidally into the sheer wall of mountain it spun aside and there was a pretty town he found a motel and stopped she was sleeping as he carried her into the unit and placed her on the bed he took off her shoes having a little trouble with the brace the metal passed all the way under the foot and was awkward to get around tappys feet and legs were well formed however and though she was light her skeletal structure was good she would have a handsome figure when she filled out if only something could be done about her injuries both physical and emotional jack left her and turned out the light as he closed the door the caterpillars question sleep was more important than food at the moment he hoped she would lie undisturbed until morning she did and she didnt in the night he woke hearing a voice someone was in tappys room he went there but there was no one tappy was lying on the bedand talking the words were slurred almost indistinguishable he paused realizing that she was not awake she was talking in her sleep that was the one time her emotional barrier was down and her voice was freed then out of that seeming gibberish some words appeared he listened fascinated empire of the stars she said if he understood correctly then reality is a dream but after that she turned over and there were no more words he withdrew excited so what if she was muttering about some television program she had overheard she could talk next day they toured the great green mountains the cars little engine laboring in a lower gear to manage the steep ascents that was all right he was no longer in a hurry and they could proceed as slowly as they wanted he continued to call out the view and though tappy did not turn her face to him again he could tell by her alertness that she was interested he spoke of the old elms and maples the mossy rocks the near and distant mountain slopes covered with green foliage like thickly woven rugs they passed a ski runa long bare swath running up the side of one of the higher peaks resembling a scar and she was crying again in her silent way the scarwhy hadnt he kept his brain connected enough to stifle that analogy before it was spoken his description lapsed he couldnt think of any apology that would not hurt her more he understood now that her passive attitude concealed an extremely sensitive nature yet perhaps there was a positive aspect for at least she was now showing her emotion he had spoken to her and gained her interest thereby making her vulnerable if he could hurt her could he not also help her if he found the right words they should have passed on through the green mountains and headed for new hampshire but tappy seemed to be coming alive her head turned to the north and her blind eyes became round what was she trying to see jack remembered her words of the night and decided to learn more of this if he could he brought the car about returned to the last intersection and turned north piers anthony and philip jose farmer tappys head now faced straight ahead there was no doubt she was orienting on something and it was independent of the motion of the car what could it be he followed the direction of her gaze until it turned to the side there was now no road where she looked but her excitement suggested that the thing was fairly close at noon he pulled into a motel consisting of a row of ramshackle cabins he thought it was deserted and he only intended to search for some fresh water for lunch and perhaps to see exactly where tappys fascination lay but presently a man ambled out he was dressed in highfronted jeans a style jack had thought only picturebook farmers affected they were in the hinterlands now dont get much business hereabout this time o year the man remarked amiably he spoke with a rich backwoods accent that also caught jack off guard m the caretaker but i can fix you up with a cabn if you like two if you please jack said after all he couldnt drive forever tomorrow was time enough to deliver tappy theres a girl with me ayuh the man said affirmatively saw her two cost you double you know dont have to spend it jack smiled at his candor it isnt my money he said as though that made everything all right he accepted the keys to the two cabins then a thought gave him pause do you have any books i mean simple ones to be read aloud like a childrens book or the man scratched his hairy head well now theres some things the tourists forgot evidently the two of them didnt rank as tourists which was probably for the best jack no longer detected much accent in the caretaker the man wandered into a back room while jack waited at the door and sounds of rummaging drifted out at length he emerged with a slim volume dont know about this one he admitted first i come to if it dont suit theres others jack read the title the little prince by one antoine de saintexupery he had never heard of the man ill give it a try what do i owe you the man declined money for the book to his surprise and he went to escort tappy to her cabin they had sandwiches on a wooden table outside the cabin tappy made them up with a certain finesse and he was reminded again that she was used to doing for herself it was a mistake the caterpillars question to think of her as clumsy of course the other senses had been stimulated to make up for her blindness touch and memory sound and smell these she possessed and feeling the day clouded over it wasnt really cold but he wrapped tappy in a voluminous quilt set her on the cabins sagging bunk and read to her from the little prince it was a curious story a mixture of childish fantasy and adult perception with appropriate illustrations there were hats and boa constrictors and elephants and confusions between them there were gigantic bottle trees growing on peasized planetoids jack didnt know what to make of it but tappy seemed interested and he continued to read all that afternoon he took time to describe all the illustrations as they appeared when he came to the part about taming the fox by following the foxs own instructions tappy smiled jack could not honestly claim it was like a ray of sunshine it was not poetic it did not erase the terrible scar across her face he was not about to use it as a model for a contemporary mona lisa portrait it was simply a faint frail rather human smile but it was the first and his heart jumped that moment when he read the soliloquy to the field of roses tappy cried but it was the tear of a woman at a wedding incomprehensible but not miserable the little prince had a cherished single rose then was confronted by an entire field of roses each as pretty as his own but he had learned a lesson from his taming of die fox no one has tamed you and you have tamed no one he said to those other roses much to their embarrassment you are beautiful but you are empty because it is she that i have watered she that i have listened to because she is my rose jack would not have thought that a girl of thirteen would comprehend the message there he wasnt sure he grasped it himself apparently he had stumbled across a book that was meaningful to her when it finished she took the volume from his hand and held it to her breast he left her sitting there swathed in the quilt tightly hugging the story she could not read herself she was there when he returned an hour later with a bag of groceries he let her keep the book that night and she slept this time he was alert and was there to listen the moment she began talking but the words made no more sense than before alien menace only chance is to use the radiator he thought mat was what it was evidently more of the television program piers anthony and philip jose farmer yet why should she be so intrigued with it that she repeated it in her sleep this child suffered so terribly how could a routine segment of a silly program affect her like this then she said something different with a peculiar intensity larva chrysalis imago quite clearly he knew what that was the several stages of the growth of an insect first it was a kind of worm then a kind of bug finally it metamorphosed into its moment of glory the flying form he had of course painted many butterflies but she could have picked this up in any class on natural life why was she repeating it in her sleep with such intensity unless she identified with it tappys present form was about as miserable as it could be was she dreaming of metamorphosing into something far better he could hardly blame her yet he had an eerie feeling that there was more to it than this she was up bright and clean the next morning wearing a new dress he hadnt realized she had a third one in her small suitcase her dark hair was freshly combed and seemed longer than before he saw that she was taller too now that she stood up straight and her figure was better developed than he had credited except for the scar she was not an unattractive girl something clicked and he ran to the car sure enough there were dark glasses in the glove compartment they were mens glasses and were too big for her but a little effort with the cars compact tool kit enabled him to bend die frames around to fit her face it was awkward to adjust for the damaged ear he had to use adhesive tape from the firstaid kit but when it was done both the scar and the vacant stare were inconspicuous he did not explain what he was doing but was sure she understood she raised her hand as he applied the finishing touches he thought she meant to remove the glasses but she brushed his face instead the cobweb caress of her delicate fingertips passed over his cheeks and nose and he realized that this was her way of seeing him my eyes are gray he told her helpfully then wondered if she had any conception of color yes of course she did she had been normal until the accident my hair is brown and i stand fiveseven in thick socks then abruptly she turned as if hearing something but there was nothing out of the ordinary what is it tappy he asked she only stared eyes round as she had in the car whatever it was it seemed closer now she was trembling with excitement the caterpillars question her face oriented on something beyond as it had before why dont we go somewhere where i can paint jack suggested she acceded gladly she wanted to go somewhere certainly the day outside was beautiful the bright sun sent shafts through the mountains and made the morning mists rise in perpendicular tails he hauled his portable easel from the car along with a couple of canvases and took tappy by the hand the caretaker came out as they passed the lead cabin going to do some painting jack called to him well be here a few days a few days what was he doing ayuh the man said knowledgeably and went about his business jack had not told him that tappy was blind tappy led the way there was definitely something she wanted to find his curiosity thoroughly aroused jack cooperated they climbed through field and forest heading for the top of the mountain that summit had looked very close from the cabins almost overhanging them two hours later it still looked close he had not meant to subject the lame girl to this much labor or himself burdened with his painting apparatus jack put his free arm around tappys waist to help her climb as she did not wish to turn back he discovered a hardness there in a moment he realized that she had the little prince with her tucked inside her blouse all this time this was foolish of the girl but it pleased him obscurely and he gave her a friendly squeeze there was a dip in the thickening forest for a mountain stream whose bed comprised little more than a collection of massive round rocks a driblet of water trickled between them very cold jack dipped his hand in it and splashed a few droplets on tappy she shook them off prettily and tugged him on why was she so eager to make this climb the stream originated in a sandy patch beneath a huge old maple tree ancient sugaring spigots ringed the giants gnarled trunk careless he thought these should have been removed the water percolated up from some subterranean reservoir as though this were the vanishing sap of the tree jack lay on his stomach and drank feeling the moist coolness of die leaves and twigs against his chest then he guided tappy to the same refreshment life appeared little tubular shells decorated the bottom of the streamlet and threadlike animalcules and an agile salamander skittered magically away a tiny gray and white bird watched piers anthony and philip jose farmer them from its perch on a neighboring trunkupside down it proceeded to spiral on down around and around the tree headfirst until it reached the ground it took wing for the next trees upper section then started down again he described it to tappy who listened attentively she raised her hand toward the bird and smiled for a moment he thought the nuthatch was coming to her then it was gone and they resumed the climb the ascent became ferociously steep near the end they had to scramble over jutting rocks and tangled roots and his painting paraphernalia neutralized a hand he needed tappy had no trouble now that touch was the most important guide and soon she was leading the way and indicating the best route for him he followed trying to avoid staring up inside her skirt as her legs moved above him feeling guilty for even being conscious of the impropriety her legs looked healthy did she need that brace at all they made it at last there was a brief clearing at the summit a disk of grass and bare rock tike the balding head of a friar tappy hurried to a big rock at the top seeming much taken with it yet somehow disappointed too she opened her blouse and brought out the book setting it on the rock he stood there and marveled at the ring of mountains row on row circle beyond circle extending as far as he could see the very world seemed to turn under his feet giving him a strange exhilaration and a sense of power there had been a time when he thought little of such displays when a pinnacle had been merely a distant high place but in his youth his father took him for a climb one unexpected day and when they rested on the height fatigued and perspiring from the hike he showed jack the land now jack relived that experience through the aeons of prehistory the earth itself crumpled and cracked wrinkling into the jaggedly fresh peaks of a stony range then came the rain and the ice of a glacier and the mightiest of mounts wore down with the burden of time the green mold of verdure pried at its grandeur die rivers spirited away its substance for deposit to the accounts of alluvial banks natural history lived in the decline of the mountains and it was written here all around him in the remnants of a range once greater than the rockies it was as if he could see all the way into the pastand into the future too the caterpillars question how was he to record any fragment of this language of eternity on his poor flat canvas yet it was a joy to try tappy sensed his mood and she stood on her toes beside him and kissed him lightly on the cheek without thinking he turned and took her in his arms and kissed her deeply on the lips she clung to him her slight eager body pressing tightly against his nothing seemed to matter but the indefinable emotion of the moment jack withdrew confused this was a thirteenyearold child with outsized glasses and a nebulous fate he had traveled with her only three days he had to deliver her to lets settle down awhile and paint he said setting aside a situation too complex to be understood at once he set up his easel and stood facing out onto the bowl of the world he glanced back to see tappy comfortable on her large rock the book on her lap she was smiling slightly her face made intriguing by the dark glasses she was really quite fetching framed by die backdrop of sky and cloud he toyed with the idea of painting her portrait but decided against this it would be best to put her out of his mind for a time jacks mind meandered as he painted perhaps the kiss had set his attention coursing along familiar channels or it could simply have been the mood of the mountain vista he thought of donna of the good times they had had together and would not have again that weekend they spent last spring at the cabin on the lake she was marvelous she was everything a man could ask for and she was gone he was trying to forget her but it was a slow process jack applied a gray edge to a distant peak humming a halfremembered folk song how did it go up on the mountain the other day the pretty little flowers grew never did i know till the other day what love oh love could do he paused what subliminal connotations had brought this song to his drifting mind he glanced again at tappy she was smiling and holding a goldenrod whose image showed darkly in her glasses his mountains were finished at least on canvas but his palette remained crowded with dabs and mixtures of american vermilion cadmium yellow ultramarine blue burnt umber and ivory black how could he casually throw away such exotic distillates he cast about for some suitable subject for the extra how about fetching me a spectacular tropical bird he asked piers anthony and philip jose farmer tappy she cocked her glasses at him there was a falsetto cry of some large bird in the distance jack jumped but it was only a crow nevertheless he gave up the notion of painting anything more it was time to begin the long trek down the mountain whatever imperative had brought tappy here seemed to have abated he didnt know whether to feel relieved or disappointed he had really gotten curious about the identity of the thing on which she had oriented apparently it was only that large rock it was late afternoon by the time they made it back to die cabins since they found descending almost as hard as ascending tappy was tired and he had his arm around her slim bookbraced midsection almost carrying her as they traversed the last few hundred yards the painting was taking a beating the caretaker looked up as they went by ayuh he said then it was evening and tappy was sitting up in bed in a flannel nightie brushing her hair why had he thought it was short it was long enough to cany a gentle wave now that she was giving it proper attention jack no longer felt awkward with her she never made a sound but her attitude called him friend and he was flattered he sat in the rickety chair and tried not to think of the judasmission that he feared was his that clinic he had given her a little human consideration that was all he had talked to her and read her a story and taken her on a hike and now she was able to smile had anyone at all spared her even this much kindness in the last seven years the shadows played across her face as she brushed highlighting her cheeks and hiding her eyes burnt umberthat was the color of her hair at the moment she was soft she was lovely in the halflight of the cabin something had animated her something she hadnt quite found on the mountain what could it be an imago a transformation then tappy was kneeling before him blind eyes staring into his face one hand rested on his the other hand held the little prince a corner of the book covering her mouth discovering that she had his attention she lowered the book and lifted his hand to her lips jack froze suddenly he realized what he should have seen coming she had a crush on him he had to deliver her to the clinic in a hurry god if this ever got out the caterpillars question tappy he began she raised her face quickly smiling as quickly she stiffened grasping his import her face became expressionless then he saw die tear that always gave her away he had been clumsy again he had been preoccupied with his own reaction to a suddenly awkward situation and had forgotten hers what could he say to her the tear coursed down her pale cheek and tucked into the corner of her mouth tappy the book dropped to the floor she scrambled to her feet and ran headlong to the bed she flung herself facedown her body heaving jack went to her and put his arm around her flannel shoulders tappy i didnt mean to hurt you i was only hired toim trying to trying to what build her up for a worse fall offer her a friendship less man she craveda friendship that was doomed anyway tomorrow he stroked her hair ashamed all he could feel was the vibration of her silent sobbing he opened his mouth but could not speak the situation was impossible finally he turned her over and kissed her he could taste the salt of her tears then her hunger broke through with a rush that swept away his own equilibrium and perhaps his conscience he kissed her lips her neck her hair and a soft fire ran through his body as her little hands pulled him down beside her so warm suddenly he held an angel in his arms and mere was nothing else on earth so wonderful how could he explain it he had thought he was experienced he could only repeat the words of that song on the mountain never did i know till the other day what love oh love could do yes she was blind and mute and only thirteen and he had known her so very briefly in that instant of excitement and rapture these considerations were less than nothing he loved her sanity returned quickly enough after his passion of the moment was sated she did not try to hold him now he got up put himself together and stumbled out to the car he drove cursing himself for missing the girl beside him for looking guiltily at the empty seat he scarcely noticed the teeming magnificence of the green mountains preternaturally brilliant in piers anthony and philip jose farmer the closing evening his brain was working now and it was not a pleasant experience what was he running from he knew he couldnt simply drive away and leave her there he certainly couldnt undo what had passed he was guilty of statutory rape he brought the car to an abrupt halt there was a lovely miniature waterfall barely visible beside the road splashing a column of water into a great wooden barrel for roadside use its artistic ingenuity was wasted on him tonight he had brought this calamity upon himself he had deviated from the route he had kept her with him instead of delivering her promptly to the clinic he had forced his unwitting attentions on her until she had to respond why was it because he suspected that he was taking her to no clinic but to some correctional institution for unwanted burdens where she would never receive any genuine kindness was he trying to shield her from that horror or had he secretly intended to seduce her what did a man want widi a woman beauty capability independence personality or did he really desire more than anything else total dependence jack thought about the ways that society crippled women keeping them out of business and sport and in the house bound by a pervasive economic and social double standard a wife had to be smaller than her husband weaker less intelligent take that to the logical extreme andtappuah no he couldnt believe it that was not his way he had only sought to help but he was not proud of his performance he did not know what to do but he did know he could not leave tappy unprotected at the motel whatever was to come of this they would see it through together one thing was sure he could not deliver her to the clinic for him there would be charges he could not deny for her there would be no freedom no joy at that place the moment they heard her talking in her sleep they would classify her as crazy and that would be the end of her was she crazy he could not accept that he returned to the motel and tumbled onto his bunk without undressing without checking on tappy maybe the night would offer some possible solution maybe some miracle he slept erratically his dreams a turmoiled rampage of mountains and scars and unutterable pleasure of a metal brace touching the caterpillars question his leg larva chrysalis imago rape he woke with a feeling of terrible remorse to the desolation of darkness now perhaps he could appreciate tappys state of sightlessness of hopelessness then he was being touched tappy was there her hand on his shoulder shaking him what is it he asked blearily she kept pulling at his shoulder urgently tappy what i did with you was wrong he said i should never have touched you and i deeply regret it certainly i shall not do it again yet there was a core of doubt but she ignored his protest she wanted him to get up she was not trying to repeat their liaison it seemed what could she be after he got up feeling grubby in his unchanged clothes the glow on his watch said am what do you want he asked half fearing the answer she tugged him to the door something out there let me turn on the lights but she pulled him imperiously on no lights tappy you know i cant see in the dark at least let me get a flashlight at that she paused he felt for the drawer where he had put the emergency flash and found it but it occurred to him that she might have reason to stay out of sight were there robbers near have it but ill leave it off if youll lead me where you want to go she reached and found his hand with the light and patted it you dont mind if i turn it on youre not hiding from anything she patted his hand again then resumed her motion toward the door baffled he turned on the flash and walked after her she opened the door and stepped out he saw that she had her shoes on and a jacket over her nightie she was definitely going out and she was in a hurry he followed her out tappy tell me where youre going ill take you there it will be faster that way she paused to gesture in the darkness he shone the light on her she was pointing with her right hand toward the mountain they had climbed while holding the little prince in her left up there now he asked incredulously tappy thats he broke off catching himself before saying crazy she nodded vigorously that was where she was going but why theres nothing up there not even a view at this lime of night you didnt find anything before piers anthony and philip jose farmer she headed off across the lawn he had to follow he could not let her go into the forest alone tappy if you would only tell me what this is all about if its because of what we did last night she turned then to face him momentarily her head shook no and she was smiling then she gestured him on and resumed her route she certainly didnt seem suicidal she was happy almost glowing with excitement yet she wasnt trying to vamp him either she obviously knew the significance of what they had done and was if anything pleased with herself not ashamed she wanted him with her but this was something else yet what could there possibly be atop the mountain at this hour he could think of nothing nothing they might want to encounter had tappy really gone over the edge had she convinced herself that there was some kind of salvation or atonement up there if she was crazy it was his fault all he could do now was go along and try to see that nothing else happened to her this way he said taking over we found a better route on the way down remember here he followed his light to the route he remembered then he remembered the book tappy that mountain gets steep youll need your hands and you cant tuck the book into your shirt you have no shirt here he checked the jacket she wore opened it wide and found a huge pocket in the inner lining the book just fit then he closed the jacket around her slight torso inadvertently brushing one of her breasts in the process and buttoned it up he suffered a pang of guilt condemning himself for even thinking about what he never should have done there ensued two hours of struggle what had seemed open in the daytime seemed impenetrable in the darkness branches loomed out of nodiingness to bar their passage and vines caught at their feet they were both tired from the prior days exertions but tappy was driven by some imperative he could not fathom and despite his misgivings some of it translated to him they scrambled together for the summit heedless of the bruises on their bodies and the tears in their clothing the night was chill but they were laboring so hard it didnt matter in fact it helped them keep going as they got closer to the top tappys urgency only increased she was desperate to get there faster and that communicated itself to him he found his heart beating with more than the considerable the caterpillars question exertion when they encountered the worst of the climb where a section was almost vertical he picked her up and virtually hurled her to the higher ledge dien scrambled up himself it was all moss and grass and dirt no sharp edges but at this point they didnt care about abrasions they had to get there at the ultimate speed the sky was thinking about brightening as they made it to the edge of the bald summit just as well he had turned off his flashlight whenever he could to conserve its waning power but it had almost expired by this time now tappy clambered up so quickly that he could hardly keep up they would be at the top to see the dawn come inyet what was that to her blind could it be that she was recovering her sight had she wanted to test it on the most wonderful thing she remembered the sunrise yet she had given no evidence of sight she had not flinched when his flashlight played across her face she charged panting toward the rock that had fascinated her by day gesturing to him to follow she oriented on it unerringly as though she could see it they came there and almost collapsed on the stone tappy was so excited she was virtually dancing her smudged face shone with expectancy she grasped his hand with her left and with her right reached out to touch the rock nothing happened of course he touched it with his free hand somehow feeling the need to verify its solidity it was cool and hard exactly as a rock should be but what brought you here he asked her she clung to his hand not responding not disappointed she stood by the rock expectantly tappy i want to understand he said you brought me here for a reason you can tell me if you want to i have heard you speak in your sleep please i want so much to know about you maybe if you talk you wont have to go to that clinic anything i can do she faced him her eyes not quite finding his she spread her hands in a gesture of incapacity she would not or could not speak to him in words he started to move away but instantly she grabbed him catching his shirt she would not let him leave all right ill wait he said just let me sit down he turned about to settle on the rock this time she almost tackled him she shoved him away from be rock but held his arm refusing to let him go either piers anthony and philip jose farmer he could not understand what she wanted but he waited with her there by the rock while the sky brightened gloriously in the east dawn was coming too bad he had not brought his paints every few seconds tappy touched the rock delicately as if afraid it would explode there was something about it that mesmerized her but this seemed to make no sense was she after all losing touch with such reality as she had known the sunrise swelled to its full wonder he was tired and battered but he loved it he stood there describing its colors to tappy as the phases of it manifested then the first beam of direct sunlight speared through and touched the rock he was remarking on that aloud when tappy grasped his hand again and reached for the rock once more this time her hand passed into it it was as if the stone were fog as he stared not quite believing his eyes she made an inchoate sound and half stepped half tumbled into the rock her body disappeared within it he opened his mouth to exclaim in amazementbut then her trailing hand hauled on his arm urgently drawing him after her jack understood none of this except for one thing tappy was not crazy she had somehow known mat this rock would change and that she could enter it as the first sunbeam touched it it had been some kind of a window a portalto what to imago her hand tugged again becoming desperate tappy was going there unafraid and she wanted him with her could he refuse what was there to hold him in his familiar world trial on a charge of rape no he had reason to go elsewhere far elsewhere he knew that if he took any time at all to think about it he would know better he had no business stepping into rocks but he could not let her go alone jack entered the rock its substance enveloped him passing across his body with a faint electrical tingle then his head followed and he was through later he wondered why he had entered the immense boulder if he had stopped to consider the outre dangers that might await them he would have yanked tappy from the boulder his will and his reason at that moment seemed to have stepped outside for a chat leaving his body without guidance he felt numb though something thrilled beneath the crystalline surface of his frozen brain still not believing that he would find the rock anything but impenetrable or that he could ignore its petrous imperative he stepped forward he did not know what to expect when his hand holding tappys went into the rock he found a soft resistance which forced him to lean against it and then he was in darkness he was unable to breathe his nostrils were covered with a semiliquid stuff silicon had become silicone her hand pulled on his and holding his breath and hoping that he would not have to do it for long he went two more steps air flowed around him light touched his shut eyelids he opened them and breamed deeply he looked around for a moment he felt like a preliterate confronted with his first photograph he could make no sense or order out of what he saw it was all just a snarl of lines with no meaning tappy was the only thing not unchaotic she was standing facing the sun her bluegray eyes open her head tilted back as if bathing in the light she looked happy then the landscape seemed to shift and to fall into an arrangement which was if not familiar at least terrestrial enough to be reassuring the boulder from which diey had emerged was about six feet higher than the one they had gone into the other side had een pinkishgray granite this looked like black basalt it was hear a shallow creek about two hundred feet broad at this point piers anthony and philip jose farmer and it was in a valley extending for half a mile on both sides the sky was blue and unclouded a gentle cool breeze flowed around him he judged that the sun was about a quarter of the way above the true horizon but he seemed to be in a valley in the floor of a crater immense walls circled die valley he did not of course know how far away they were certainly he was not on earth though some of the lowgrowing plants nearby looked like terrestrial bushes the tree on his right was he was sure not a thing that grew anywhere on his native planet its peagreen bark was as smooth as skin and it exuded a greasy and slightly reddish thick liquid the ground at the base of the tree and among high arched exposed roots was wet with me liquid its branches started about halfway up the fifty or sixtyfoot height but began a leftward twist not far from the trunk and spiraled up around the trunk the leaves were dark green disks covered with pale red spidersweb designs about a dozen flying animals were roosting on the branches or were on top of nests made of dried mud some were tiny the size of yellow finches some as large as ravens their batlike wings were covered with brightly colored fur their faces were batlike foxlike and monkeylike their cries were as varied and as melodious as those of birds tappy still smiling startled him by muttering in what sounded like a foreign language then made gestures which he interpreted as a request for him to describe their surroundings he told her in detail everything he could see she turned her hand still in his and tugged him toward the east if it was the east along the creekbank he walked beside her giving her directions when they came to a rock she might fall over or to a sudden dip or rise meanwhile his empty belly asked for food and he wondered how they were going to eat and how if they had to spend the night in this country they would survive if the air got cold and if there were any dangerous animals or snakes in this place a horn blared nearby startled he and tappy halted she moved her head from side to side as if she were listening he looked around from a distance ahead of them came another sound it was almost exactly like the chuffing of a steam locomotive the sound of which he knew from watching movies whatever originated it it had to be a long way off then the horn blared again nearer this time though it sounded much like that of an automobile jack did not think that there was any such nearby this terrain and the lack the caterpillars question of roads indicated that cars would be a rarity indeed though of course he really did not know what to expect here surely the sound had to be originated by an animal however he was wrong unless the honker was a twolegged animal that had arms hands legs and feet remarkably like a humans around a huge boulder eighty feet ahead of them near the creek strode a humanoid figure the face was not that of homo sapiens it looked more like the helmet of a medieval knight than anything else the eyes were dark slits in the brown skin below them a large noseless and sharply downwardangling bulge formed the upper jaw the froglike mouth had very thin dark lips the lower jaw chinless sloped abruptly below the lower lips toward the neck in all the face below the high forehead formed in profile an isosceles triangle its dark skin glistened with grease us penis was about eight inches long and two inches thick but it lacked testicles its mouth open issuing the blaring sound it marched straight toward tappy and jack its pace not the least broken when it saw them its right hand held a stonetipped spear and on its back was an animalskin pack behind it around the boulder came a parade of similar beings two males were first carrying bows in their hands and quivers full of arrows on their backs then came six obvious females and seven children behind mem were four adult males and two halfgrown males all armed with spears except for the honking leader all were silent tappy far from looking alarmed or questioning seemed to be at ease she was even smiling presently the parade passed them and after a while the honker and the honking were gone jack did not ask her any questions about the creatures he knew that she would not answer he went to the creek bent down and scooped up water in his cupped hands after he had drunk enough he told tappy to drink the water seemed to be pure another indication that he was not on earth thats great stuff jack said but my bellys kicking up a storm i wonder whats good to eat around here they resumed walking and came to a bush laden with large cherrylike fruit on which a family of tiny opossumlike animals were feeding these ran when the two approached them jack did not know if the fruit was fatal to humans but he would at this moment anyway rather die of poisoning than starvation piers anthony and philip jose farmer he picked and bit into a cherry and tasted something like a butterscotch liqueur he spat out the four small pits and said if youll wait awhile tappy well see if this kills me she shook her head and groped along a branch tore five of the fruit loose from their thick stems and popped them into her mouth they ate all the rest and then drank more creek water jack went behind a bush for a bowel movement though tappy could not see him of course not having toilet paper bothered him but the amenities of civilizationor was it convenienceswere not to be found here not so far anyway tappy went behind the same boulder to relieve herself after jack had told her where not to step he kept expecting to feel a sudden sharp or burning pain in his guts as time went on without any discomfort he forgot about his apprehensions he knew now that they had arrived in the morning of this planet and were going northward the sun had risen higher not descended also the numbness he had felt after going through the rock had dissolved though he still was uneasy he could think clearly what that led to was a strong desire to be back on earth especially when just as tappy began climbing up the rocky but bushgrown slope toward the top of the valley he saw a group of tawny lionsized animals come out of the forest across from die creek when one of them roared it exposed large sharp teeth to live big predators had to prey on big herbivores but jack had not seen any of the latter he hoped that the large meateaters were on their way to a place where large grasseaters abounded he also hoped that these predators would not consider him and tappy as food he breathed easier when the group after drinking from the creek walked back into the forest tappy had not halted when the beast roared she was feeling her way up die slope grabbing a bush when the footing was insecure and pulling herself on up he followed her by the time they reached the top his hands were bleeding from sharp rocks and thorns a knee of his trousers was torn and he was sweating and thirsty again he forgot about that when panting he looked around and up the floor of the crater angled downward from the bases of the wallsenabling him to see much of the area most of it seemed to be covered with green and scarlet plants the branches of which surely extended over the many streams that must run down from the walls there had to be a lot of rainfall to keep all this vegetation alive the caterpillars question now he could see more clearly what had seemed to be just splotches on the crater walls when he had been in the valley the entire circle of crater wall was covered with gigantic figures and symbols the walls had to be at least thirty miles away perhaps fifty he had been in arizona once and knew how deceiving distances could be in very clear air that meant mat the figures might be a thousand feet tall he could not estimate accurately since he did not know how far away they were the symbols scattered among the figures were of many bright colors and none was like any he had ever seen before some of the figures were of machines or vessels most were of bipeds some of whom looked human enough they were doing all sorts of things and were in various postures some of the paintings looked like spaceships but he could not be sure damn it tappy wait for me she was heading toward the woods he caught up with her and said we have to stay together so i can see the dangers remember im the one who isnt blind tappy made a gesture with her right hand which he interpreted as apologetic if he had hurt her by reminding her of her blindness he could not see it on her face she looked eager to get going to where did she know or was she being drawn by some undefined but powerful feeling like the instinct of a lemming that was he told himself not a reassuring analogy lemmings were pulled toward destruction however it might be the right comparison after all he was thinking too much too concerned about what they might be walking into if he allowed himself to be sucked into the maelstrom of his thoughts and apprehensions he would not be able to go on he would just sit down and refuse to go a step farther he would die either he would starve or a predator would get him that was enough incentive to make him drive onward though another was the crater panorama he was a painter and his curiosity about the gigantic figures burned in him that must be the biggest mural in the world who could have done it how why they entered the shade of interlocking branches the lowest of which radiated from the trunks about ten feet above them through the infrequent spaces among the leaves sunlight speared this illuminated the groundmat of purple plants one inch high piers anthony and philip jose farmer growing closely together which seemed to spread everywhere his feet crushed the plants and a thin liquid exuding from them spread a faint peppermint odor most of the trees had a deeply corrugated pale orange bark the heartshaped green leaves covered with purple rosettes were about six inches long the branches were populated by a variety of small furry creatures winged and wingless they were as noisy as birds and some of the fliers were as beautiful and varied in their markings as terrestrial birds there were here and there bushes and plenty of dead wood fallen from the trees but the walking was almost as easy as if they had been in a wellkept park after an hours walk jack said lets rest i dont know where youre going tappy i hope you do but whatever is there isnt going to go away that might not be true maybe it was going to go away and somehow tappy knew it he brought out a few of the butterscotch cherries from his jacket pocket and handed them to her from another pocket he took a half dozen he had saved for himself we have to find something solid to eat protein and carbohydrates or well start having diarrhea soon after resuming their journey they came across a broad and shallow stream while handcupping its water to drink jack saw some footlong salamanderoids in pursuit of tiny fishlike creatures he stuck a hand in the water and waited still as a fishing bear until a salamander came close he grasped the thing and lifted it though its wrigglings and greasy skin made it hard to hold and hurled it against a tree trunk he ran after it just in time to seize it again as it crawled painfully back to the creek he knocked its head against the trunk once more it still tried to creep away but he took his jackknife from his jacket pocket opened it and cut the things head off its blood was red after catching another jack took off its head and gutted both of them he collected dead wood made shavings from it and used his cigarette lighter to start a fire then he skewered a salamander on a pointed stick and held it over the fire though the flesh was undercooked inside and burned on the outside it was more than satisfactory tastes like greasy frog legs jack said as he started cooking the second animal the caterpillars question after washing their hands and faces in the creek they started to go on jack however called a halt so that they could check their possessions some of them might be useful tappy had nothing except the nightgown socks and shoes she wore that she had not automatically taken her handbag along showed how urgent her desire had been to get to the gaterock he had his wristwatch and his pants and jacket pockets held a comb a handkerchief the jackknife the cigarette lighter car keys a leather holder with four pencils and a pen a small notebook with unlined pages and his wallet this contained four hundred dollars mostly large bills credit cards a drivers license and photographs of his parents sister and of some of his better paintings there were also three quarters two dimes a nickel and five pennies except for the knife and the lighter the items seemed to be useless but he decided not to discard them they pushed on and did not stop until the halftwilight of the forest began darkening toward night he told tappy to wait while he climbed a particularly tall tree fortunately there was a big boulder under it from which he could leap upward and grab the lowest limb while he was climbing flying mammals fled before him he went by several nests with young in them but did not touch them the parents flew chittering at him swooping around his head he also had to brush off hundreds of longlegged insects which however did not bite him when he had gotten up as far as he could go he looked westward though the sun had dropped below the crater wall the sky was still bright and a pale light lay over the upwardsloping land he gasped and he clung to die bending treetop to keep from falling the brobdingnagian figures on the wall were moving he watched while they and the symbols around them marched along the wall as if in a slowmotion film he stayed there for at least thirty minutes shouting down now and then to reassure tappy that he was all right finally the figures and the symbols stopped moving he did not know how far they had gone in their travel perhaps a few miles he wondered if they moved during every twilight and would eventually complete a circuit as he started down cautiously he saw a pale round object with a dark crescent on its northeastern part slide up from above the eastern wall he waited until it revealed itself as a moon slightly piers anthony and philip jose farmer smaller than earths luna he was just about to tell tappy about it when something huge and dark shot across the silvery face it seemed to be circular and to be topped by a structure of some sort through which the moon gleamed here and there then the object was gone diough he had the impression that it had flown into the crater if it could be seen from here it must be enormous and it must have a staggering power to be able to keep its bulk aloft when he got down he waited until he had recovered his wind before he told her what he had seen surprisingly tappy nodded as if she understood what the titanic vessel was he said well explain but she did not of course answer i know you cant help it tappy or you appear not to be able to speak though sometimes i wonder but you really frustrate me she put out her hand as if to tell him that she was sorry or perhaps to get comfort from him he took it and stroked the back of her hand then pulled her to him and held her close for i a little while well get through this somehow he hoped that he sounded convincing the dying light sifting down through the leafy canopy was presently replaced by a pale gloom shed by the moon by now the cries of the small animals everpresent through the day had died with the light they were succeeded by a booming from far off its direction undetectable and now and then a roaring he shivered from more than the cooling air he and tappy had to find some relatively safe place to sleep and that could only be up in a tree he explained this to her before he climbed into several nearby trees finally he gave up theres just no way we couid sleep up there without falling off the minute we went to sleep they passed a chilly and fretful night often awakening sud denly and most of the time dozing for warmth and courage they held each other in their arms but their arms became numb and every time one moved the other was startled out of sleep during the night jack wished several times that tappy was a big and fat girl that diought gave him the only smiles of the night the booming faded away though the roaring filtered through the woods now and then it did not come nearer that was not so i comforting though it seemed to jack that a predator would quit roaring as soon as it smelled a prey and would then approach it very quietly the caterpillars question once he heard a new sound a hooting it quit after a while but he stayed awake for a long time after that he thought of the silence of the forest during the day it was not really silent the noises were just different from those of the city and much less loud but he could become used to them there were no radios blaring rock or countrywestern that could be heard two blocks away from the cars or ghetto blasters of youths who would tell you very sincerely that they were very concerned about peoples rights and the need for protection from invasion of privacy there were no vehicle horns blaring no sirens wailing no thunderous jets overhead no flickering icons or voices and music from the tv sets at that moment jack wished to hell that he could be back among the earscratching screeches and unmelodious clashings when the darkness began paling he and tappy got up they were tired and cross though they tried not to show it after squatting behind the bushes they pushed on until the sun came up above the crater wall jack caught two salamanders made a fire and cooked them these with more berries and fruit filled their stomachs they took their clothes off tappy removed her leg brace too and they rolled gasping and crying out in the cold creek water just as jack stood up to go ashore he saw the leading edge of a wave of red liquid coming from upstream by the time he got tappy out of the creek the water was bright red from bank to bank it looked like blood but he could not imagine that any one animal could bleed that much was there a largescale butchery going on up there if so what was being slaughtered and who were the killers after a few minutes however the water cleared jack considered going east for a while to avoid whatever had reddened the creek when he decided he would he told tappy they should make a detour she shook her head and walked north he shrugged and he followed her maybe she knew what she was doing they did not come across the carcasses or corpses that jack expected except that of a rabbitsized mammal lying half in the creek insects rose from it in a cloud as the two passed its stinking body though it was bipedal and looked mammalian it had a long beak resembling a woodpeckers later they heard a hammering and saw back in the forest a similar animal knocking its beak against a tree trunk so the animal was in a sense a woodpecker piers anthony and philip jose farmer when the sun was straight above their heads as seen through a break in the leafy ceiling tappy halted she turned slowly her nostrils twitching as if she were trying to catch some odor then she turned east they walked for perhaps a mile before coming to another creek or for all jack knew the same creek after drinking again they walked to the other bank the water up to their knees in the middle and they went up the bank steeper on this side she stopped again turning her head from side to side her right hand extended and going back and forth across a vertical plane as if she were feeling an invisible wall after a minute of this she turned north stopping only when jack called out to her that she was heading for an immense and conical anthilllike structure when he followed tappy around it he was confronted by a big hole on the opposite side within it sat crosslegged one of the creatures with a face like a knights helmet he was holding a large piece of cooked meat which he stuck at intervals into his mouth his lower jaw did not move but very sharp and tiny yellow teeth moved inside the mouth they seemed to be in several rows one behind the other and to be moved by some biological mechanism inside the visor as jack thought of it jack looked around for some evidence of the fire that had cooked the meat but he could see nothing a stone axe was by the honker and so was a pile of different kinds of fruits and vegetables there was also a liquidfilled gourd by the heap of steaks the honker did not seem to be startled or alarmed at the sudden appearance of the two humans its dark eyes which were at least a quarter inch inside the bony face looked steadfastly at them jack described the honker to tappy though he had the feeling that she had known that he was in the structure jack was the one startled when she gave vent to a series of soft honkings the creature did not respond until its teedi had ceased moving and the meat had been swallowed then it responded just as softly jack could see now that something white projected from the tip of its tongue something as slim and as sharp as a thorn tappy looked disappointed what in hell is going on jack said you can talk to this thing tappy shrugged then she felt along him dipped her hand in his pants pockets and drew out a coin a quarter she turned to the caterpillars question the honker and held the quarter out to him whiie she honked more dots and dashes by then jack had figured out that the creature spoke in a sort of morse code the honker extended its hand without directions from jack tappy walked up to the honker he took the quarter from her looked closely at both sides of it rubbed it between his thumb and finger then said something tappy held out both hands which the honker filled with two large steaks and a pile of pancakeshaped and sized green and purple vegetables she honked something the honker replied and she turned and held out the barter to jack he stuffed the meat in one of his jacket pockets the vegetables in the other the honker stuck its tongue far out enabling jack to see more clearly the white thorny projection at its end tappy stuck her tongue out turned and walked away following her jack said damn it tappy if you can speak their lingo why cant you speak english to me she did not reply angered and bewildered he walked closely behind her he had to break his surly silence to warn her of a housesized boulder ahead of her as if she already knew that it was there she walked up to it and began feeling its rough reddish side shaking her head she went around it and walked on northward an hour before dusk they stopped he made another fire and recooked the meat which was too rare for him its blood and grease had coated the inside of his jacket pocket and drawn a bloom of pesky flying midges that he had to keep brushing off these also bit savagely making him even more angry after they had eaten howeverthe pancakesized vegetables were raw but delicious tasting like a mixture of cheese and asparagushe began reproaching himself he should not have bad feelings toward her he could have refused to go into that gatewayboulder with her and she must be under some kind of obsession or compulsion or both under a spell so to speak he continued on the same path of thought while climbing trees to search for a place to bed down when he found one he kept only half his mind on the task of finding dead branches on the ground and getting them up into the tree and placing them with their ends across two limbs the auxiliary branches and the knobs and sharp points were removed smoothed off with his jackknife his knife was getting duller he noted the time would come when it would be useless and the lighter would be empty that thought piers anthony and philip jose farmer made him feel panicky however perhaps he could trade more coins with a honker for a flint knife or an axe shortly after the moon had risen they were lying on their platform of hard branches these were far from comfortable and they could get warmth and softness only in each other and the little protection their clothes gave tappy was in his arms his jacket spread over their upper parts she hummed a tune he had never heard before then fell asleep the leg brace which she had taken off lay between her legs though he was very tired he could not sink as swiftly as she into merciful unconsciousness he could not stop trying to make sense of what had happened to find a pattern in the events that would give them an order and a goal just how were tappys relativesthe two who had reluctantly given her a homeinvolved had they really been so eager to get rid of her was that eagerness an act could they have known somehow that tappy was far more than she appeared to be mr melvin e daw and his wife michaela uppermiddleclass people affluent had seemed pleasant enough though they had not been able to hide their dislike of tappy their instructions on how he was to take tappy to the clinic had been specific but they had certainly not volunteered any information to answer his unspoken questions they had given him a map of the route he was to take to new hampshire and had stressed that he should not deviate from it why there were other roads he could have taken could they possibly have directed him to that road by which was the rural motel he and tappy had stayed in could they have estimated his traveling time so that he would take lodging there overnight there were as far as he knew no other motels in that area how could the daws have known that he and tappy would go up that hill and find that boulder reviewing the conversation with the daws and their gestures and expressions he thought that what had seemed innocent enough then was now sinister that interpretation however could be shaped by his suspicions which had been shaped by the bizarre events occurring after they had stopped at the motel and how could a blind thirteenyearold know consciously or unconsciously that the gatewayboulder was there how could she even know about gates to other worlds somethingwhen and how he could not guesshad been implanted in her it was driving her toward a goal that she could the caterpillars question not explain or would not explain because something was keeping her from doing so empire of the stars a sciencefiction cliche essence of corn reality is a dream first said by some ancient chinese philosopher larva chrysalis imago entomological but he did not think that these words applied to insects alien menace only chance is to use the radiator that radiator certainly was not part of an automobile alien menace he shivered he had been conditioned by too many movies with horrible and evil monsters from outer space but that did not mean that such things did not exist he was in a situation which needed a superhero to deal with it and he was far from being a flash gordon or luke skywalker he was not even a good imitation he had never shot a gun and knew nothing of fencing or the martial arts beyond what he had seen in films he awoke from a nightmare he had been in his studio a studio that had never existed in reality but one he had imagined he would have some day bright sunlight fell through the enormous skylight like the shower of gold that had impregnated danae bathing a nude tappy in the center of the room not the tappy he knew but an older and fully developed young woman he was before his easel and had the portrait almost done all he needed were a few more strokes of the brush to get her face just right to give it a hint of the ethereal no of the unearthly the light darkened looking up he saw that black clouds had slid under the sun though the sky had been a moment ago without a trace of the nebulous then the clouds lowered greengray tendrilstentaclesand somehow they came through skylight glass and began misting the room he could see tappy only vaguely now the horror did not begin at once it was hidden behind the swirling fingers of the cloud as they reached out for him they touched him at the same time that he saw that tappys skin had become greasy the glistening fatty exudation dripped from her as if she were a burning candle and pooled around her feet the shiny and greasy stuff began to rise before her very quickly tappy became gaunt and then she was skin wrapped piers anthony and philip jose farmer around bones now she was walking toward him her arms held out the figure forming from the grease had been left behind but it was sliding along behind her on the trail he could see through tappys skin and bones despite the weak light and he could see that the figure was a rapidly swelling replica of her he wanted to scream but could not his throat was plugged with semiliquid fat rising from deep within himself tappy s hand almost touched him the figure behind her reached around her slid her arm along tappys outstretched arm and shot her hand toward his mouth he came out of the nightmare to find himself groaning though the moon did not relieve the darkness much he could see tappys eyes staring at him but she could not see him at all of course or could she she muttered something he said its all right go back to sleep she closed her eyes and began snoring softly larva chrysalis imago he thought was she going to change from what she was now into something as different as a larva was from an imago or did those words apply to someone else then one of those sudden and unexplainable shifts of mind happened and he began worrying that he might have made her pregnant after a while he dismissed the worry with a rueful grin they were in a situation so serious that the chance that she might have a baby was a slight problem as of now anyway nine months from now it might be very grave if they lived that long he fell asleep again and he was making love to mullins blanchflower if what he was doing could be called making love he awoke at the tail end of a wet dream wondering why his unconscious would choose mullins for his dream partner she was a rather plain and chubby girl he had known in high school though not in the biblical sense he had never consciously wished to make her but copulation with undesirable girls had happened occasionally in his night fantasies the unconscious was a tricky and unpredictable bastard he thought now ill have to wash out my shorts and i thought i was too tired hungry and miserable even to contemplate screwing if id known how things were going to be id have tried it with tappy but then shed have been too tired hungry and wretched or would have thought she was anyway for gods the caterpillars question sake i was just worrying about her maybe being pregnant of course there are other ways to get off but she might not be ready for those what a jerk i am he was lying on his side and somethingit must be tappys legwas next to his chest and stomach he opened his eyes and saw her profile though dimly he also saw something dark astride her legs and leaning far forward her body was bare to just above her breasts the nightgown had been pulled up above diem he tried to shout and at the same time to rise and grab the thing sitting on tappy he could only tremble his throat and tongue seemed numb his body had no more muscles than a log he hurled his will at his body screaming at it to move but he was as lax as if he had been bitten by a poisonous snake now he was able to see the figure on her a little better than when he had awakened though it was not raping tappy as he had first thought he did not lose any of his sickening fright it was bending far over her its face against her breasts or between them then it sat upright pulled its legs up and got to its feet jack rolled his eyes sidewise to keep its head in sight he could make out dimly the knightshelmet face of a honker and its male organ ithebent over to look down at jack his tongue moved far out and then back in faint as the light was it showed the white thorny tip at the end of die honkers tongue the honker patted jack on the forehead as if it were reassuring or comforting him it turned away still bending over and placed something between tappys breasts then it climbed slowly down from the platform and faded into the blackness jack sweating despite the chill wondered if he was to stay paralyzed until he starved to death or more likely was eaten alive by beasts or insects then he felt ashamed because he had considered his own plight before thinking of tappys he did not know how much time had passed when he began to be able to move his fingers and toes after a little while he could turn his head some time later he could utter some slurred words and lift his arms and legs meanwhile tappy was also making sounds and moving her head and limbs presently both he and she sat up something fell from her chest and between her legs onto the platform she lifted it up and put it close to her eyes though why she would do that when she was blind jack did not know she handed it to him as soon as he had it in his hand he knew that it was the quarter he had given the honker in exchange for the food piers anthony and philip jose farmer he did not have time to think about the implications of its return thinking would have done no good anyway tappy weeping was in his arms jack stroked her bare back and told her that everything was okay she shook her head rubbing her face against his chest then she pulled away took his right hand and placed it between her breasts he said my god a hard swelling the size of a marble was under her skin it felt very warm she touched the side of her neck and put the tip of her finger on the side of his neck the pressure made him aware that where she had touched was very tender he felt sicker the honker must have stuck the thorny tip on its tongue into their necks and injected a temporarily paralyzing poison when dawn came they climbed down and washed their hands and faces to refresh themselves jack decided that he would wash out his shorts and bathe when the air became much warmer he told tappy to lift her nightgown so that he could examine the swelling between her breasts it had grown no bigger and the skin over it did not seem as warm as far as he could determine there was no break in the skin however when full sunlight came he looked closely at it and saw a very small reddish dot in the center the honker had stuck the thorny excrescencemaybe it was an organinto her chest the thorn must be both a poison injector and an ovipositor though he did not know if an egg had been shot through the thorns hollow shaft into her whatever it was that had been planted just under the skin it had grown very fast or was there some other explanation for gods sake tappy he said if you have any idea of whats going on you must tell me if you can talk please talk tappy looking distressed shook her head her index finger felt the round lump he mastered the impulse to grab her by the throat and force words out of her that would not do it he knew or thought he knew but he felt that he had to do something to get answers to his questions if he did not soon get at least a little explanation of what had been happening he would go crazy amok completely out of his mind at that moment a deep thrumming came from above he seized her hand and pulled her along until he came to one of the narrow the caterpillars question breaks in the forest ceiling above him far up was something enormous it was descending slowly and the sound it was making becoming ever louder its got to be that ship i saw outlined by the moon he muttered though the size of the vessel was awesome and its mission was unknown and thus possibly dangerous for him and tappy he almost felt relief whatever happened he might be able to get some answers though it was probable that he would not like them he told tappy to stay where she was while he climbed a treeshe looked frightened but nodded when he got to the top of the tree he could see the bottom of a truly titanic ring it had to be at least a mile in diameter and two hundred feet thick the purplishgray sides went up for an indeterminate distance and from its upper edge curved many gigantic metal beams of the same color as the circular base the curving beams or ribs met at the center to form an open cap or cage here and there boxhke structures clung to the circle at the bottom and along the sides of the ribs there were no rocket exhausts no obvious means of propulsion as the vessel dropped closer the thrumming became a roar that was so loud he thought he would scream standing on a branch with one arm wrapped around the thin trunktop he put his fingertips into his ears that did not help much the circular structure was now about two hundred feet above but a quarter of a mile away at that moment the coins his wristwatch his jackknife everything metallic in his pockets became hot he tried to get rid of them before they burned him but he was slowed down because he had to cling to the trunk with one hand his fingers were scorched before he had thrown the hot objects down through the branches he climbed down to find that tappy had removed her leg brace they clung tightly to each other while the bellowing around them became so loud that it seemed solid suddenly there was silence he looked up through the break and saw far up some of the curving ribs the weight of the machine must have crushed trees beneath it and its lower edge must have sunk deep into the ground he released tappy and she sat down pale and shaking an animal resembling a furless anteater ran past them jack could not fully hear its whining and its claws slapping the ground but at least his hearing was beginning to return piers anthony and philip jose farmer tappy groped around until she found her leg brace she touched it gingerly then picked it up it had cooled off by now jack not knowing what else to do wanting to do sometiiing began looking for the items he had discarded but he stopped tappy was holding the brace up with one hand and feeling along its inner side that had been covered with a soft thick fabric to prevent skinchafing hut it had been partially melted away at one end of die inner side was a long and narrow opening it had been hidden by a panel that had for some reason slid into a recess in the brace he said hold it tappy wait he took the brace from her and examined the opening there were six tiny orangecolored buttons inside two rows of three with a somewhat larger scarlet button at the head of the rows what the hell he seemed to have been saying that a lot lately only a babys fingers could have pushed one button without pushing another next to it he said we got something here tappy just what i dont know he took one of the pencils from die leather holder in his jacket pocket holding the pencil in his right hand he gripped the brace in the middle and he pointed one end at a nearby tree but away from his body he made sure that the other end did not point at tappy maybe i shouldnt he said do i know what im doing no but ill do it anyway using the eraser end of the pencil he pressed on the larger scarlet button nothing happened had he really thought that it would he paused to tell tappy what he was doing she looked surprised but not as much as he had expected he said it cant be a weapon tappy itd be too awkward to use as such unless perhaps it was a weapon but the designer had been forced to camouflage it as a leg brace and hence could not avoid cumbersomeness in its handling he placed die pencil end on one of the orange buttons nearest to die scarlet button the tree the brace was aimed at split soundlessly though the crash of the upper part on the ground certainly was noisy enough the tree had been neatly sheared off the caterpillars question shouts filtered through the forest human voices the blaring of honkers also came through he paid them no attention where the upper part of die tree had been extending from the stump was a shadowy but clearly visible replica of the part that had fallen off it was the ghost of the shearedoff part chapter tappys touch on his arm jogged him back to their immediate predicament the sounds of pursuit if that was what they were were drawing erratically closer jack did not know what was going on but he was pretty sure they did not want to fall into the hands of whatever might be after them tappys urgency indicated that she felt the same but the great ring of the base of the ship surrounded them the thing had come down on them like a monstrous cagewhich was what it probably was somehow it had known where they were approximately and enclosed them so that its personnel could canvass the limited region and make them captive exactly as he would have done to capture a moving bug he did not want to squish set a jar over it first so how could the bug get free before the end tunnel under the rim of thf jar fly up into the center surely not he looked again at the brace in his hand the scarlet button was faintly glowing he had not noticed that before that could be the onoff switchand the device was still on ready to fire again that notion made him freeze he pointed it upward and used his pencil to touch the largest button again the glow faded right now it was off he resumed breathing tappy was tugging at his arm again he looked the way she was facing but thats toward the rim he protested keeping his voice low you havent seen it but take my word that thing is two hundred feet thick no way we can get by it without mountainclimbing gear wed be better off dodging them in the center and using this thing if we have to it just sheared off a tree she knew she had heard the tree crash down she pointed toward the rim and touched the brace he held the caterpillars question wait wait tappy he protested i guess you know what this thing isdid you always know she shook her head no you remember now our entry into this world jogged your memory she nodded yes so now you know how to control it you know how dangerous it is yes then you will have to show me he said this thing is so powerful i dont dare use it ignorantly it was just luck i didnt have it pointing toward one of us instead of that tree he got down and scraped the leaves and twigs away from a section of the ground heres a diagram of the buttons on this thing he said taking her hand and using her finger to draw it so she would know exactly what he was doing here is a big scarlet button which is the onoff switch it glows faintly when its on he pressed her finger into the dirt here are six smaller orange buttons onetwothree onetwothree when i turned the big one on and touched this one zap it cut through that tree tappy disengaged her hand and took his instead she was going to make him point to a button he extended his finger you have me over the orange buttons he told her as the tip of his finger moved the scarlet one is farther over but she knew where the buttons were she seemed to have a good memory for what she had touched she pushed his hand down thats the third orange one in the righthand row thats the one you mean she pushed his hand down harder okay i got it tappy third button but still she pushed what was wrong here look tappy i dont think this will do anything unless the scarlet one is turned on first so she nodded affirmatively but still kept his hand down theres something different about this i cant let go of it she nodded yes but of course i can let gooh do you mean sustained fire she nodded again and finally let his hand go got it he said turn it on touch that button and treat it like a gushing fire hose dont point anywhere i dont want to cut even if im no longer touching the button thanks for warning me once more she pointed urgently toward the rim it was high time the searchers were uncomfortably close by the sounds okay tappy on our way he took her hand with his free one and set off for the rim they weaved around trees and bushes keeping low and left the sounds of pursuit behind this was interesting he thought as he moved he had assumed mat the most dangerous place was nearest the rim but maybe piers anthony and philip jose fanner they figured the bugs would not go near the glass of the jar so they were concentrating on the center the bugs were moving in an unexpected direction how was it that their pursuers knew in a general way where they were but not specifically if there was a bug on thema radio frequency emitterit should enable others to close on them readily enough not that there should be a bug unless unless that honker had planted it that marble under tappys skin between her breasts what about that first the marble then the giant ship onetwo but several things made him doubt it that honker had seemed friendly rather than threatening despite what he had done and if that had been a location device why was it so ineffective at close range and why so obvious it would have been easier simply to plant it in tappys clothing so that they would never know it was there so whatever that marble was it was unlikely to be a bug of that kind jack didnt want to think about whatever other kind of bug or grub or egg it might be the huge rim loomed close as high as it was thick about two hundred feet it looked like a twentystory building without windows extending to either side slightly concave the wall was absolutely smooth all too much life the glass of a gargantuan jar except for its opacity who could have made a flying device this large its mere existence suggested a technology far beyond anything known on earth since when had he believed this was anywhere close to earth tappy had led him through some kind of space warp or time warp to an alien planet that had been obvious from the start yet how had she known of that aperture he was sure she had not known that anything like this was going to occur when they started she had been too forlorn too sensitive to the hurts of the world only now that they were here was she really coming to life well not exactly that evening in the cabin when they had made lovemaybe it was statutory rape to others but it had been love to the two of them in those minutes she had known what she was doing perhaps better than he had he had condemned himself for it but now tappys hand was tugging him again she knew he was losing his focus on the present he was doing that too much if they somehow won free of this hightech trap then maybe he could think about love the caterpillars question im aiming it at the wall he told her im turning it on this is what im supposed to do she nodded yes emphatically he touched the third orange button a circular section of the wall glowed then it disappeared and some of the ground under it now there was a hollow in it deepening visibly jack gaped its eating through the rim he exclaimed like melting butter only theres no vapor the wall is just gone there tappy urged him forward toward it when he stepped forward correcting his aim so as not to intersect the ground the circle of indentation became smaller but the center deepened more rapidly it was as if he held a cosmic blowtorch whose heat was greatest in the center the original dent now and a smaller but deeper dent inside itand as he proceeded that inner dent developed another its a conic section he exclaimed i mean a conethe ray is coming from this device and expanding and it vaporizesbad wordit disintegrates in an expanding circle so as i walk into it it seems to be getting smaller but its not really am i making sense tappy merely urged him on they walked into the hole he was making it was a tunnel now about ten feet in diameter forming about twenty feet ahead of them the radiator seemed indefatigable the radiator suddenly tappys sleeptalking words came back to him alien menaceonly chance is to use the radiator this had to be what she had meant a weapon that radiated a cutting or dissolving beam the aliens had trapped them but the radiator was cutting them free the aliens had set a jar on them but these bugs were drilling their way out there was a clamor of alarms the sound was unfamiliar but its strident nature was unmistakable the aliens had finally caught on to what was happening tappy heard it and jogged him hurry jack broke into a run keeping the brace aimed the tunnel became smaller as he came closer to the site of action but it quickened its drilling pace he was operating closer and the cone was smaller so had less metal to drill and was faster he should have thought of that before the tunnel became irregular as he ran he was waving the beam and it showed he tried to keep it steady but it was piers anthony and philip jose farmer impossible it didnt matter as long as there was a tunnel they could follow he turned his head trying to look back as he ran the tunnel started veering to the side he had to focus ahead but he had caught a glimpse of a shape in the tunnel behind them they were sitting ducks or at least running ducks for any shot from behind then at last the tunnel broke through to light firs t a circle then a fullsized disk opened ahead of them they were through the rim but he heard footsteps behind he touched the scarlet button turning off the radiator then he had a better idea he whirled to point the device back at the tunnel a man was there he threw himself down trying to get out of the line of fire he knew what the radiator would do to his body human heads appeared above the rim peering down from its distant top jack aimed the radiator at them they disappeared he hadnt fired they had dived out of the way a bluff was as good as a real attack he was glad of that because he was no killer he was just trying to get away he turned again and ran with tappy into die thick of the forest which seemed to have been cut back somewhat by the landing of the ship they skirted the huge trunks of the trees now hidden from the ship by the interlocking canopy above jack was trying to put as much foliage between them and the ship as possible they had broken out but it would be no good if the men caught them and hauled them back why hadnt someone shot at him and tappy there had to be weapons and the two of them had been an easy target in that tunnel someone could have fired from cover above the rim too before they reached the trees the answer had to be that this was a capture mission not a kill mission the way the ship had come down enclosing rather than flattening suggested the same this was a nosquishbug effort greatit gave the bugs a real advantage but why what was so precious about these bugs to make them worth mis phenomenal endeavor tappy he gasped as they ran we seem to be getting away but we wont stay clear long if we dont learn more unless you know whats going on here her face turned to him her head shaking yes then no that meant that she understood some but not enough the caterpillars question then lets get some information he said he was not what he thought of as a bold man but the past few days had shaken him loose from every preconception he could think of tappy didnt object so he set up his trap wait here he told her he turned on the radiator and dissolved a tunnel through the thickest part of the forest where the trees were small and set closely he followed the developing opening running behind die cone the smell of peppermint came from the cut plants he hoped he wasnt extirpating some animals along with the foliage he hadnt thought of that in time then he curved it until the tunnel end was just out of sight of its beginning he turned the radiator off and ran back to tappy now we hide he gasped drawing her to the side they found a place behind a thicket of young orangebarked trees and ducked down watching the tunnel the normally noisy animals were quiet now he hoped that didnt give the two of them away soon enough a man came running spied the tunnel and charged into it he was carrying a weapon of some sort which startled jack what was the point if it was not to be fired at the fugitives but he had no time to worry about that he stepped out into the tunnel pointing the radiator hey joe he called the man stopped and looked back chagrined he started to bring his weapon to bear nuhwi joe jack said putting a finger on a button of the radiator drop it the man let the weapon fall to the ground jack strode toward him keeping the radiator aimed he had never intended to fire it at the man but he was pleased with the success of his bluff now talk joe whats this all about why are you after us the mans mouth tightened he seemed to understand jack but be refused to answer and the threat of the radiator was no longer persuasive strange and awkward because the man had called his bluff and he couldnt do anything about it it was a mistake ultimately to bluff he realized because once it was proved empty all was lost it was necessary either to be able to follow through on a threat or to make the bluff so bold that the other did not dare call it he couldnt carry through he just couldnt kill a man who wasnt attacking him he probably couldnt kill even if the man piers anthony and philip jose farmer did attack him he was a sensitive artist not an insensitive goon only if tappy were threatened would he jack had an inspiration he pointed the radiator at tappy nao the man cried horrified so he had guessed right it was tappy they wanted to capture he had suspected they didnt much care about jack hi nself he was nobody just an ignorant person who had happened to get involved with her tappy had known or remembered how to reach this world so she must have been here before the aliens must have been waiting for herand they wanted her alive larvachrysalisimago there was something about tappy that made her valuableso valuable that this monstrous flying cage had been sent to catch her but she had been given a weapon and taught its use so that she remembered once the situation required it that knowledge must have been hypnotically suppressed her return to a more familiar environment was bringing back her memory but why give a blind girl a weapon that required sight for its operation if jack hadnt been along tappy would have been virtually helpless these thoughts were buzzing through his mind as he faced the man he knew that they did not have much time at any moment there would be others coming here but there were questions that had to be answered lest they fall into the next trap their pursuers sprang so you do speak english jack said you may not care much about your own life but you do about hers well keep quiet and follow us or i will radiate her he was ashamed for the lie but he was afraid tappy would be subject to some fate worse than death if he didnt use this lever to get the truth find a place we can talk he murmured to tappy tappy immediately moved to the edge of the nulled tunnel and felt her way into the green and purple foliage jack followed pointing the radiator at her she understood what he was doing yao are naot serious the man said he had a strong but indefinable accent as if this was a language he had learned in a class and hadnt used much yao are with hurl yao will naot radiate hur jack used his pencil to touch the scarlet button the dim light came on dont let him call this bluff he prayed the caterpillars question aokay um caoming the man exclaimed his accent worse there was no doubt that the threat to tappy really unnerved him despite his suspicion that jack didnt mean it empire of the stars could she be the daughter of the emperor stolen away and now to be recovered but surely she would want to be returned to her family and her status unless this was a hostile force a usurper who wanted to hold her for ransom or brainwash her and set her up as a figurehead if she died they would have no chance to make a pretense of legitimacy and the loyal subjects would rise up and throw them out but then why send her to a backwater region of a primitive planet like earth why let her suffer as the ward of an unfriendly family all these years anything could have happened to her if they had the technology to give her the radiator why hadnt they at least fixed her sight jack was no psychologist but even he had seen that she was a desperately lonely and unhappy girl she was about as unlikely a princess as he could imagine tappy was better at finding a hiding place than he would have been because she tended to explore with her hands and body while he depended more on sight soon they were in a niche in the undergrowth where the sunlight hardly penetrated they would be able to hear any searchers before they got close the man sat on one side and jack faced tappy on the other side keeping the radiator pointed and his pencil poised he knew that the moment he got careless the man could jump him even if jack won the struggle the noise would give their position away and the others would close in with the best luck he was unlikely to have much time he had to make it count why are you after tappy he demanded the mans gaze flicked to the girl and jack realized that he had blundered already the man had not known her name not her earth name at any rate but he answered jack was already getting used to the accent and tuned it out in favor of the meaning we must restrict the imago there was a key word what is the imago jack demanded why must you restrict it the man seemed at a loss it has to be restricted look joe im an ignorant lout from a primitive planet i dont know anything about this imago except that its gotten me into a lot of trouble so youd better give me good reason not to wipe her out and wipe you out and anybody else who conies after me so that i can go home and forget all this tell me all about piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question the imago before anybody else gets here give me reason not to radiate everything in sight he hardly believed himself he was talking like a thug from a grade f movie but he didnt have time to figure out how to act like a tormented perfectionist from a grade a film the man told him somewhat awkwardly it wasnt that he didnt know it but that he could not believe that jack didnt so he kept skipping over elements that he assumed jack already understood in the course of this jack picked up some background about the empire and the planet they were on it seemed that there were several components of the empire it wasnt exactly an empire but whatever it was was too complicated for jack to assimilate at the moment so he used the term as mental shorthand it included so many stellar systems that there was no reliable survey listing them all human beings were on several of its planets not because they were native but because they had been imported as labor from overpopulated earth which didnt even miss them the alien rulers were called the gaol as it were the gaolers of the empire they did not care what the human laborers did as long as they did their jobs they were allowed to have their own families and entertainments one of the planets they worked on was this one where the dominant native species was what jack thought of as the honkers the empire was governed by completely alien creatures who had no biological and little intellectual association with human beings but whose technological power was such that no known force could oppose it except the imago therefore it was to the gaols interest to nullify the imago the imago seemed to be another type of alien entity possessing no body of its own other than what for want of a better term was a spirit it seemed to be singular though perhaps it was that only one of its kind chose to interact with solid creatures when it did it manifested only by the enhancement of the powers of that person whether it entered other than human hosts was unknown but probably it did because sometimes it skipped a generation of human beings only to reappear seemingly randomly it seemed to associate with this honker planet where spirits had more force than they did elsewhere but when it entered a person it took time to manifest at first it was the larva largely quiescent inhabiting the person from conception into childhood that stage seemed to last for about seven years until the child was six and the spirit could not be detected then it metamorphosed into the chrysalis the child did not change physically but now the symbiotic entity manifested the child developed mental or emotional rapport with other life including animals and plants and there was a faint mental aura that sophisticated sensors could detect after another seven years it metamorphosed to its adult stage whose nature no one knew except the gaol who governed the empire it was conjectured that the rapport with other forms of life expanded into fullscale telepathy and the power to modify the emotions of others if so it meant the imago could take over even the minds of the gaol and make them do its will that would give it the capacity to rule or to destroy the empireeven if it was based in the body of a blind human girl then why dont you just kill it jack demanded so it cant mess with your alien masters he still hated to talk this way as if he didnt care about tappy his feeling for her was a strange and wonderful thing not exactly love and not exactly apart from love already he recognized the truth of what the man was telling him tappy related to other life and he felt that relation through his mind and heart he was beginning to understand why he had made love with her as the chrysalis of her nature touched him if this was only the suggestion of her mature power what would be its full expression the man explained the imago could not be killed if its host was destroyed it simply sought a new host then fourteen years later the threat to the empire returned in the early days perhaps millennia ago the imago had so disrupted the empire as to cause its dissolution only when the gaol had learned how to nullify the imago had they been able to reconstitute and maintain the empire now they tracked the imago diligently and when it manifested they captured its human or other host drugged it into unconsciousness and maintained it in tight security within a field that scrambled any possible mental or other emanations they kept it in that condition carefully alive as long as nature and technology permitted with luck their reprieve lasted as long as a century when the captive imagohost finally died the search began aain its occupation of a new host seemed to be random no one could predict where on this planet it would appear next the gaol had the power to obliterate the planet but feared the would only manifest on another it was better to keep it so this world was left in its natural state unlike most other piers anthony and philip jose farmer planets the gaol intended to locate and nullify the imago as usual forestalling any possible threat to the empires stability if the imagohost was found and killed the process woula have to begin over therefore the empire impressed upon its minions that due care should be taken whoever was responsible for the loss of the imago would suffer in ways no ordinary person could imagineand so would his family and his community now at last jack understood tappy was the current host of the imago she had been the child of a human colonist on this honker planet when her expanding empathy for life had manifested at age six she had been hustled to a place where the gaol could not quickly find her there must have been trouble maybe the minions of the empire had been in pursuit and tappys father had been killed and she maimed and blinded but she had gotten free though at the terrible price jack had seen her injuries had turned out to be an advantage because they restricted her so that she did not call attention to herself she had been put under a hypnotic block against even speaking the language all this had been necessary to hide her from the notice of the gaol whose search methods had to be sophisticated and unscrupulous indeed the empire must have searched and finally was on the verge of locating her so she had had to be movedand an ignorant earth native had been hired to transport her jack why didnt she return to her family here jack asked the man grimaced what family when the gaol found out she was gone poof so was her community jack looked at tappy she nodded she had known throughout that she was orphaned the earth coverstory had been accurate in essence if not in detail that was the price of being the host of the imago so where are you going jack asked her for she had certainly been headed somewhere with great urgency that is what we want to know the man said so we can stop her from getting there but it no longer matters because we have captured the imago dont you wish jack exclaimed youre not locking tappy up drugged for the rest of her life ill radiate her into nothingness first this time he was telling the truth death was better than that he saw her nod she agreed then there was a faint flash jack did not lose consciousness or even feel pain he simply lost his volition the minions of the empire had closed in on mem and used some sort of weapon he the caterpillars question had talked too long and been caught worse he had betrayed tappy into their power now other men appeared good job joe one said mockingly using the name jack had bestowed on the man you kept them distracted until we were sure of our shot jack had after all played the fool he had been so interested in what he was learning about tappy that he had not kept properly alert and they had crept up close no wonder joe had been so cooperative once he got started talking it hadnt mattered how much jack learned so long as he was kept occupied get up follow that man the new man said to jack and tappy indicating a man who was now standing nearby jack got up and followed the man and tappy did the same his body was not paralyzed just his control over it he had to do what anyone told him go to the container and get the null dose the leader told the one they had been talking to now that man got up apparently he too had lost his volition jack found that though his body obeyed the directive his mind remained free he could think anything he wanted for what little good that might do him so he pieced together the remaining elements of what had happened the weapons the men carried were not for killing or stunning but for blocking off the minds conscious control of the body they probably generated an intense local field that affected all people in it but did not extend far so one shot had taken out all three of them in the niche but not those standing beyond it this was surely a necessary limitation that explained why the men pursuing them had not fired at them before they had to get within the short range of the willstunner before using it the radiator seemed to have no such limit so had been a fearsome counterweapon if only he had remained alert with it the anonymous leader made them march toward the huge cage ship which it seemed was called the container that made sense it was used to contain fleeing people but for the radiator it would have contained them effectively enough now they had lost the radiator what a mess he had made of this he should have let the information go and kept running with tappy as they approached the ship he saw that the hole the radiator had carved through the giant rim was smaller no one was piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question working on it the thing seemed to be healing iiself at the rate it was going in a few more hours the injury would be gone injury what was he thinking of the rim of the container loomed high then a dimple appeared before them expanding into an opening inside was a ramp they stepped in and the ramp carried them upward in the manner of an escalator it deposited them somewhere in the middle of the rim another door irised open and they stepped into a beautiful apartment the walls seemed to be windows on planetary scenes the illusion would have been perfect except that each wall showed a different planet one had a deep green sky with two small bright suns orbiting each other their dual shadows were slowly changing configurations and shades as he watched another was night with a few scattered stars and a monstrous nebula or galaxy seen endon beyond them taking up half the view wondrously threedimensional another was a cityscape whose buildings curved esthetically to touch each other at different levels one even made a loop which was unlooping and extending toward a different building at a fair rate it was as if the buildings were kissing or copulating still anotherfor the walls were not set square but angled in the manner of the interior of a faceted stoneshowed a ship on a great yellow sea and the ship flexed to accommodate the passing waves while tiny people or creatures sported in those waves hello jack would have jumped had he had control of his body he had been standing immobile only his eyes moving to take in the wonders of the walls now he looked at the woman who had spoken she sat before a wall looking out over fairly conventional snowcovered mountains she was impressive it was not that she was young for somehow he doubted that she was despite her remarkably firm and slender body she wore a closed cloak that was opaque only at the fringes her central torso showed clearly through it her breasts so well formed that they seemed unreal her legs slightly spread so that her manicured pubic region was plain jack felt an erection starting an involuntary response to the potent suggestions of her apparel and posture you may call me malva she said what may i call you she looked at jack now he found he could speak jack but that was all he was able to say his mouth would not work at his own behest the womans eyes flicked to tappy who remained silent they returned to jack tappy he said she cant but he was trying to go beyond the immediate directive and stalled out malva nodded a block standard procedure her gaze returned to tappy but you will respond appropriately by nodding tappy nodded meanwhile jacks gaze drawn to malvas head when he had to answer her noted eyes whose irises were red not bloodshot but a deep esthetic cast her hair was the same hue looking natural though no living woman had ever grown that shade perhaps it figured if she had gone to the trouble to have plastic surgery on her body so she could show it off she would think nothing of dyeing her hair and using tinted contact lenses sit and we shall talk malva said they sat on the blocks that slid out from the wall behind them where the door had been they looked like hard plastic but they were soft with just enough spring to be comfortable i serve the gaol malva said i am fiftyfour earth years ow but as you can see i am attractive without the gaol i would be far inferior physically and mentally and i would not have this pleasant residence or the privileges of rank i say this so that you can appreciate the advantage of the favor of the gaol you will not be offered such favor but you can avoid incurring their disfavor by timely cooperation the wall behind her abruptly changed scenes now it showed a classic inferno a medieval representation of hell with tall fires forming the walls in the foreground was a rack on which a naked human man was bound a blackhooded tormenter was extending a glowing red rod toward the mans genital region any torture your mind can imagine and a number it cannot imagine may be visited on your body by the order of the gaol malva said behind her the rod touched the mans penis and the flesh blistered and smoked while the mans body struggled ineffectively and his mouth opened in a soundless scream of agony so i am sure you will not hesitate to answer my simple questions so that i can make a proper report to my masters she looked at jack how did you come to associate with the host for the imago jack stared a moment more at the scene beyond the womans loscious body the redhot rod was now cooking the victims piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question testicles the scene could be a mockup or a recording rather than any contemporary event but it was distressingly realistic he suspected that this was a bluff similar to his own tireat to radiate tappy but he decided not to chance it i was hired on earth to drive her to another address what was the nature of your relationship with her there again he saw no reason to equivocate i was her companion and then her lover malva nodded slightly unsurprised the wall behind her returned to the mountainscape you did not know her nature but you felt the effect she is the chrysalis yes how did she drop from our screens jack gazed blankly at her you can not answer or you will not she inquired frowning briefly i can not i dont know what you mean but he had just learned something there was a choice apparently the loss of volition extended only to the body not the mind he could not speak unless she asked him to but his mouth would not say what his mind did not authorize and she will not we can not force the imago malva considered a moment crossing her legs under the cloak now her pubic area was not visible but the underside of her thigh was similarly fascinating she was an old woman with the body of a young woman and she knew exactly how to display it he hardly knew her and what he was learning he didnt like but his body had notions of leaping and plunging would some information help you to answer i do not know are you willing to answer if you can jack did not consider himself a coward but he knew he was no hero if they used even the crudest of tortures on him he would scream out all he knew about anything or say whatever they wanted him to he knew that had been the case with the victims of the inquisition and he had no doubt that this woman could have him put on exactly such a rack as the wall picture had showed he and tappy were captive already lost resistance was pointless especially when he didnt know anything anyway yes the gaol supply us with certain techniques of observation malva said now the panel behind her showed the surface of a planet that looked very much like the one they were on the natives are hostile to the gaol they do not resist openly so are allowed to exist but neither do they volunteer any information the honkers appeared marching by in much the manner jack had seen when he and tappy had first arrived on this world but we do not need them we are able to survey the natural pattern of life on the planet and to detect net changes caused by unnatural interference every living things spirit remains with it until death and for a time after its death a dichotomy manifested we traced it to the unnatural death of two salamanders do you understand we did kill and eat salamanders jack agreed but any animal could have done that the balance of nature is finely tuned there was a slight excess in deaths next day there was a similar excess but we could not locate it or confirm it it was only a probability of outside interference so the creatures they had eaten had given away their presence jack had never heard of such a survey but he had no reason to doubt it why should malva lie to him instead of torturing him in due course we found their vacated spirits and were sure the woman continued we were at that point able to get a fix on the aura of the chrysalis rather than intercept it immediately we elected to wait to see where it went that would enable us to root out whatever remaining traitors to the empire were on the planet and diminish the likelihood of any assistance being rendered to the next imago should it manifest here do you understand he was appalled but he did understand yes you intended to root out every part of the weed then abruptly the aura faded malva said we had to act immediately lest the imago be lost we brought the container in and enclosed the region of the auras last manifestation she peered closely at jack something happened in that night which we do not understand what damped out the aura of the chrysalis suddenly it came clear the honker the honker had injected something into tappy that formed a tight marblesized ball under the skin between her breasts a timedrelease capsule of a chemical that somehow counteracted the broadcast of the aura the ship was tracking tappy realizing that they were probably being tracked had talked to the honker when she bought food from piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question him the honker had accepted the pretextwhat need did it have of an earthly quarterand made its preparations then it had come and done what was necessary returning the quartet it had not been a sexual attack die honker had a penis which remained unused it had been a favor to the imago which the honkers surely recognized and supported because the small operation was painful it had anesthetized them botii giving it time to do the job and for die chemical to circulate slowly through tappys body interfering with the manifestation of die distinctive aura tappy had not known exactly how the honker was going to help probably the honker had not known either until checking with others of his kindso had been frightened at first as a child might be frightened of the doctor despite knowing die doctor was trying to help as long as any of that ball of substance remained with tappy the gaol instruments could not track her yet what difference did it make now jack had blundered them into captivity anyway still if there was any chance at all that tappy could escape that marble on her chest would be invaluable it didnt show under her nightie even with her jacket hanging open though her breasts were nascent the stretch of cloth between diem masked the swelling the minions of the gaol so certain of their power had not bothered to search the captives at all the marble had escaped notice jack was not about to tell this empire quisling about it is your silence one of ignorance or resistance malva inquired he wanted to lie but found he could not that required too great an act of volition his choice was between the truth and the refusal to answer he refused to answer malva nodded unsurprised so you do know something and the imago has corrupted you let me remind you of the alternatives there are possible advantages to cooperation the screen behind her showed a bed sliding out from a wall and to this bed came die image of malva herself her cloak dissolving away her breasts and buttocks quivering as she walked from the other side came jack his clothing dissolving similarly away to reveal the erection he really did have malva lay on the bed smiling invitingly as she spread her legs but jack knew this was merely a sophisticated show this woman had no interest in him only in his information she might indeed offer sex to him to obtain it but the moment she got it she might have his skin made into a lampshade meanwhile the thought of tappy as a drugged and imprisoned thing kept artificially alive for most of a century was such a horror that malvas temptation became anathema he remained silent and disadvantages to noncooperation malva continued after a moment the bed became the rack die curtains of the room transforming to flames and the body on the rack became tappy her small breasts shaking as she writhed with fear the jack figure donned a hood and fetched a blazing redtipped poker he extended that tip toward tappys genital region angling it threatening to rape her with it the substitution of tappy as the object of torture was startling not only did it show the versatility of malvas control of the images it betrayed the falsity of them there was no marbleswelling between the images breasts malva didnt know about that and he would not tell her he was unable to look away but he tuned out the image as irrelevant malva was bluffing and he had found her out and now his hand was greatly strengthened he was learning about bluffs what is your statement malva inquired that gave him more latitude he no longer had to betray tappy or be silent he called malvas bluff you can not torture the imago you probably cant torture me either or you would have done it by now your masters dont give you that much authority malva pursed her lips as the mountains reappeared behind her you may be ignorant but you are not entirely stupid it is true that i am limited to the mechanisms of oblique persuasion but it is also true that die end will be the same and that you will find it far more comfortable to deal with me than with the gaol i will proffer one further offer which will not be repeated give me the information i requirei see that you do have itand i will grant you one year of extremely comfortable life with the woman of your choice which may be me or a simulation of tappy or any other you prefer and subsequent return unharmed to your own planet face the imago jack obeyed die directive he turned to face tappy who stood without moving she looked like a street waif in her oversized jacket over her nightie her only expression was a single small tear on one cheek imago i can not force you to do anything malva said but i can free your host to give your companion an honest answer you know enough of die gaol and their human minions to judge piers anthony and philip jose farmer whether my offer will be honored if jack agrees you know he must make his own decision based on the truth so you have no motive to deceive him answer him is my offer valid the tear accelerated slowly tappy nodded yes your answer jack it seemed like folly since the woman would discover the marble the moment tappy was stripped for her incarceration yet two things stopped jack from capitulating the first was that he suspected majva was still bluffing she was desperate to make him tell so was pulling out all the stops and she wouldnt do that without good reason so there had to be reason for him not to cooperate maybe there was some way to save tappy or maybe it was simply that malva was expected to handle things and the gaol would be annoyed with her if she left a loose end and would demote her or replace her with a rival the second reason was that no matter how much objective sense it might make he could not betray tappy and this would be a betrayal her tear told him that no go down the ramp and enter the small craft at the exit malva said it will convey you to the gaol her voice was controlled but jack thought he could detect a slight stress in it the stress of fear or of fury whatever else he had failed to do he had scored against her but his body was already moving as was tappys that single shot from the nullvolition pistol had really fixed them apparently the effect continued until nullified and no other restraints were needed not for enough time to get them safely to the gaol malva had to be sure of that or she would have taken other precautions now of course his doubts loomed what had he accomplished by his defiance he hadnt saved tappy but he had doomed himself he was a painter not a hardnosed negotiator there were two seats in the little vehicle which looked like a gullwing door car with the doors left open they got in but the doors did not swing down instead a slight scintillation indicated the presence of a force field that sealed in the car then it rolled forward accelerating like a jet plane and took off those gull wings really were wings this was an airplane jack would have gaped but no one had authorized him to do so so his mouth remained closed the plane flew low over the forest evidently programmed so precisely that the close clearance was no problem then it lifted the caterpillars question and jack saw the huge crater valley where they had entered this world with its gigantic symbols around the rim the symbols that moved grandly around periodically like the elapsedtime ring on a divers watch making a new setting now flying over it he saw that the depression was far too regular to be a natural crater it was either artificial or had been excavated and reshaped after its formation for some alien purpose that reminded him of another mystery the brief redness of the river he had seen what could have caused that there was so much about this planet he still didnt know there was a touch on his shoulder jack turned to face it taking it as a command for attention before he realized the significance of it tappy was the only one beside himand she had done it she had volition tappys finger touched her lips in the signal for silence you bet a radio could be monitoring this cabin as a routine precaution if she had somehow thrown off the effect of the shot he would keep her secret but his own body remained helpless tappy pointed to the panel before them he looked again obeying the implied directive he could obey her as well as malva it didnt matter who gave the orders or how they were given there was something like a steering wheel there recessed into the panel that must be for use by the pilot when this craft was not on programmed flight tappys hand extended until it touched the panel then slid along it until she felt the wheel she nodded then she found jacks arm and guided his hand to the wheel she made a gesture of pulling it toward him she was telling him to fly this thing he looked at her startled she nodded yes knowing his question but he couldnt do that he had no idea how to operate a normal airplane let alone this alien craft but the alternative was to let the two of them be flown to meet the gaol he had no idea what the aliens looked like but formed a mental picture of huge sluglike monsters whose proboscises racked out the guts of human beings surely false but it made the point it was better to crash this craft than to suffer what the liens had in store for them he had been given his directive now his arms and head were ftee he took hold of the wheel and pulled it toward him it didnt dome it was locked in place probably it required a special key or piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question code to free it to prevent exactly such an accident as this one tappy aware of his problem turned around in her seat and reached behind it in a moment she brought something from a compartment there it was her leg bracewith the radiator the fools had dumped it in the craft for delivery to the gaol along with the captives what arrogance of assurance she touched another orange button with her little finger pointing it out to him then she handed him the brace and touched the panel her hand coming to rest on the wheel use that on the wheel it would null it into nonexistence together with the entire front of the craft but tappy was insistent it was a different button she had indicated and evidently it did a different thing if not did it matter they would be better off to crash and die than to fall into the handstentaclesof the gaol he was sure jack pointed the radiator at the center of the wheel nerved himself and touched the large scarlet button it glowed then he touched the correct orange button there was a click that was all nothing changed he turned off the radiator lest he brush a functioning button and do something drastic tappy found his hands and took back the radiator jack frustrated gripped the wheel again and yanked if only to show the futility of the act it came out of its recess and locked into place and the craft wobbled jack stifled his astonishment realizing that once again tappy had known what she was doing that setting of the radiator had evidently shorted out the locking mechanism which might be magnetic and freed the wheel he had just overridden the programming assuming manual control it was that easy now all he had to do was fly this thing he turned the wheel clockwise just a bit the craft veered right he turned the wheel back and the craft responded he pushed down and the craft dropped he lifted and it rose he squeezed it and the craft accelerated he had the hang of it already this thing was made for an idiot to fly that was fortunate because he was an idiot in this respect tappy touched his arm he looked at her she made a gesture of a circle then pointed up fly up after circling he didnt think he understood why the circle unless the circle represented the crater valleyor a compass they had been going north from the crater and up on a compass could indicate north he leaned toward her north he whispered she nodded agreement he turned the craft until it was flying north at the rate it was going they would soon get there if it was on this planet but where was he supposed to land he could do so only on tappys directive and she was blind how had she thrown off the volition nullification suddenly the answer was there the honkers marble not only had it made it impossible for the aliens to track the imago it had made their weapon lose its effect on tappy either she had thrown off the effects of the weapon rapidly or she had never suffered loss of volition at all she might have faked it knowing that jack had no control until there was a chance to escape if he had betrayed her and told malva about the marble they never would have had this chance and tappy had been unable to tell him that she had had to let him decide himself and had been afraid he would succumb how glad he was that he had not he had been more of a man than he had taken himself to be something flashed on the panel attracting his gaze two little blips were there blinking ohoh he had a notion what they might represent he looked around there at about seven oclock on the dial were two flying craft similar to this one they were closing fast he knew what had happened the alarm had been given the moment he overrode the program and assumed manual control other ships had been sent out to bring him in again he leaned toward tappy were in trouble he whispered then he managed one tiny act of his own volition with great effort he kissed her ear perhaps it was possible only because he knew she would like it the caterpillars question chapter two gaol airplanes coming fast he told tappy he thought what do i do now the chances were that the planes climbing up below him were faster than his even if the speed of his craft matched theirs he was very handicapped this was his solo flight and he had had no training an aerial dogfight between him and two professionals would last a few seconds if that get a grip on yourself he muttered that reminded him that squeezing the wheel caused the craft to accelerate he clamped down as hard as he could on die inflated rim but the plane was so high up that he could not tell at once if its velocity was increasing swiftly he looked out of the window on his left the pursuer seemed not to be gaining so swiftly however his hands would get tired soon surely there must be a control on the panel before him that locked in to whatever speed he wanted it was a dumb idea to regulate the airspeed of this craft by squeezing on the wheel the engineers who had designed this certainly did not think like their earth counterparts however this machine surely should have something like the cruise control of a car when set it would maintain the desired rate of travel to give the pilots hands a rest the names on the plates below the lights and switches and buttons on the panel were in a totally unfamiliar alphabet if it was an alphabet maybe the letters were ideographic or syllabic like ancient aztec or chinese or whatever another glance through the window showed him that yes indeed the chaser was eating up die space between his craft and his quarrys perhaps its pilot could squeeze harder but he did not think so the adrenaline surging through him should give his hands die strength to crush rocks he wished he had a brush big enough to paint the other planes out of the sky reality unfortunately was not a painting it was hard objects some of them moving very fast objects driven by human beings out to kill him and tappy that thought was conceived out of despair by panic but it gave birth to relief a limited relief true yet it was tinged with hope whatever they would do they would not kill tappy though desperate to catch her they must avoid doing anything that might result in her death therefore they would not shoot the plane down what they would do probably would be to try to force their quarry to land unless no use attempting to imagine what was in their bag of tricks he would find out soon enough the planes were slowly but steadily closing the gap between them and jacks plane one pigeon two falcons below a forest spread out dark green like an earth woods except here and there were irregularly shaped areas of orangecolored trees the crater was receding fast ahead was more forest in the distance were the peaks of a mountain range now and then the sunlight flashed on a river or was there more than one a large lake appeared on the right a number of tiny boats with single masts and bright white and purple triangular sails scudded across the smooth green water jack was too high to make out the figures on the decks he started as somediing touched his neck it was tappys finger of course he was very jumpy for a second he had thought that an insect had landed on his neck her wondering and anxious expression showed him that he had been silent too long the plane on my left is now even with us he said the other here it comes its even with us now now theyre rising i think they plan to get above us and force us down jack shouted oh no you dont tappy gasped and jumped a little at his outburst savagely he turned the wheel to the left pushing in on it at the same time the craft curved to the left and dropped swiftly jack glancing at tappy saw diat her eyes were wide open and she had paled im trying to shake them he said hang on we may be in for a rough ride piers anthony and philip jose farmer he was thinking why in hell didnt i grab the radiator and try to shoot them with it he was doing better than he had thought he would in such a situation so far he had not done badly for one who considered himself to be an artist not a man of action ten thousand miles from being an indiana jones but that had been on the ground he had frozen for a while when in the air and he still was not completely thawed out the pilots of the gaol machines had quick reflexes though they had not been caught with their mouths open their planes had curved and dropped too following his course by a split second or so now they were above him again diving at the same angle and velocity they were also jockeying so that each would be just above the end of one of the wings he turned the wheel and pulled it back until the plane was on an even keel at least he thought that it was by now he assumed that one of the instruments on the panel was an angle indicator it looked like the ones he had seen in movies showing an airplanes cockpit it was round and in its center was a horizontal line the line swung up at one end and down at the other or vice versa as one wing dropped and the other rose at the moment it was straight across and the wings seemed to be level too give him enough time and he might figure out most of the functions of the instruments but he was not going to be given that time the bottoms of the fuselages twelve or so feet above the tips of his wings began lowering he noted with a part of his mind that the wheels had withdrawn into the shell he supposed that the wheels of his craft had also withdrawn but he had heard no sound of machinery moving jack told tappy about the situation she lifted the radiator with both hands holding it before her face yes i know he said but wait a minute i want to try something by then the fuselage bottoms were only six feet above the wingtips of jacks machine the gap between them constantly varied by a foot or so the rough air bounced jacks plane up and down and did the same to their pursuers they would not be able to touch their bottoms against his wingtips otherwise the wingtips might break or something else and worse might happen they were betting that he would not try to call their bluff the caterpillars question lets see he said loudly he released much of his gnp on the wheel rim at the same time he pulled back hard on the wheel the nose of the craft lifted sharply and the wingtips almost struck the other planes the pilots must have been startled but they lifted their own planes quickly enough to avoid the collision they did not slow down however they shot ahead of jacks machine jack took his hands off the wheel the nose dropped and the craft headed downward at an angle of perhaps fortyfive degrees in relation to the horizon he had expected it to stall and to fall like a stone but it must have some sort of safety factor a foolcompensator in its program in several seconds it began to level out the machines in front of him began climbing and turning at die same time for certain they would come back and attempt the same forcingdown he had gained some time and distance however and the sky which had been clear was suddenly dark on the horizon he hoped that the clouds would be heavy with rain a lightning and thunder storm would be welcome too he just might be able to lose the gaol in a storm he said tappy are we still going north headed directly toward whatever you want to get to she turned her head slightly to the left and to the right then she pointed a few degrees to her right jack turned the machine until she nodded and he straightened out the course he had seen that one of the indicators on the panel had swung its pointer too the needle tip now rested by a symbol which he supposed must indicate north soon too soon for him the gaol had returned one of them rode on his left making no attempt to get above his wingtip he stretched his neck to turn and look through the window in the top at first he saw only sky then abruptly and sinisterly the nose of the second machine appeared it was directly above jacks machine and descending on a horizontal plane he understood at once what its new position meant it was going to lower itself on the top of jacks plane then it would land in a manner of speaking on his plane it would decrease its speed until us quarry would have to support part of the weight of the gaol craft its pilot must know what he was doing he must be sure that jacks machine could not sustain the added weight and that it would be borne however slowly to the ground a moment later a grinding noise and a shudder running through piers anthony and philip jose farmer the fuselage announced that jack was right the window was blocked by the blue bottom of the fuselage jack told tappy what had happened her alarm and puzzlement vanished she held the radiator out to him he took it and said id rather not shoot through the skywindow one of the panel dials had on its face a vertical tube like a thermometer the mercury was a bright orange its top had gone down passing symbols marking he supposed altitude the machine was losing speed and height at a rate that upset him but he was not going to panic not now anyway his mouth was very dry and a lowburning pressure in him told him that he must urinate soon or the pressure would be intense and the burning would not be low i want to open the window on the door in my side he told tappy there are two buttons the forward one is orange the one behind it is yellow with a blue stripe running across it she had shown him how to unlock the operational program maybe she was familiar with the design of the cockpit tappy smiled and groped along the door to her right until she found the buttons then she rested a finger lightly on the yellow one thanks he said he pushed in on the button on his door the window began to lower and cool air screamed into the cockpit he reached out to take the radiator from her at the same time he thought wait a minute how did she learn so much about the design and operation of this airplane she was six years old when she fled from here to earth how could she know all this how many kids on earth or here would be familiar with this complex stuff the answers to this question as to many would have to wait he hoped he would live long enough to hear them the window was completely open now he reached into his jacket found one of the pencils in the leather holder in the inside pocket and withdrew it then leaning out of the window and twisted so that he could look back along the fuselage and upward he extended the bracethe radiatortoward the wing of the gaol craft the air tore at him and caught the radiator but he was gripping it hard it was not easy to keep the weapon pointed at the wing while he pressed the pencil end against the orange button the firing activator the trigger the caterpillars question there was no visible radiance expelled from the end of the brace he knew there would be none but he had momentarily expected one he was too conditioned by all the sciencefiction movies he had seen and all the books he had read the wing cut in half was whisked away tumbling over and over he should have expected the shadow but he had not he grunted when he saw the transparent but still visible plane attached to the shearedoff wing then the strange and unexptainable thing was out of his sight the plane suddenly lifted as the solid and opaque gaol craft on its back fell off he swung the radiator to point at die other plane for the first time he could sea the pilots face clearly previously it had been a blank or rather a generic human face now it came into focus and he saw the features of an individual a womans face since she was unhelmeted her reddish hair was visible it was coiled into a bun on top of her head a psyche knot her delicate and rather pretty face was frozen her mind must have gone blank when she saw the wingtip flutter away and her colleagues plane roll off the back of jacks machine the next moment she had an even more puzzling and urgent matter to disturb her jack had pressed the radiator button the tail of her plane got a quick divorce from the front part it dropped the shadow of the other part turning as it turned and a shadow of the rear section projected from the stillflying part for a few seconds the winged halfplane struggled onward though losing altitude swiftly and beginning to bank to the left the propulsivelevitation engine must radiate from inside the wings jack thought but the pilot could not steer her craft then the shorn plane nosedived jack turned the plane to observe what would happen next to the gaol machine it sped straight downward a half a minute later he pilot dived out of the window something was strapped to her front presently she managed to straighten out and she flew at a steep angle toward the ground she had put on some kind of parachute or emergency oneperson miniaircraft he looked in the space behind the seat it held two cylinders about fourteen inches high and with a radius of six inches three levers were sticking out halfway down a yellow vertical stripe attached to the cylinders were harnesses piers anthony and philip jose farmer the pilots hands had been on die cylinder evidently she had been using the levers to guide her flight jack turned back to the north the compass needle indicated that he was headed toward the exact direction that tappy had indicated but just to make sure he asked her again if he was headed in the right direction she nodded it was strange that he trusted her more as a compass than he did an electromechanical device or was it she knew the true direction better than any manmade compass but the panel device could be malfunctioning or affected by aberrant magnetic fields while he was going toward the black clouds he looked at the instruments one of those switches or buttons must be a cruise control another would put the plane on automatic navigation and what was that blank screen that looked so much like that on a tv set he decided that it was best not to monkey around with anything the exact function of which he did not know so far he was doing all right with his flying but what about when he had to land what activated the machinery to lower the wheels of course ask tappy he should have thought of that automatically but his mind was still not completely thawed out it contained ice the ice of anxiety no genuine hero i he thought he had not volunteered for this perilous voyage no one in his or her right mind would do that well yes he had entered the rock and no one had forced him to do that however he just could not have allowed tappy to pass through the gate or whatever it was alone what he should have done he should have kept her from going into it even if he had had to use force no somehow she would have found her way back if he had dragged her away it was her destiny and it was her will to follow her destiny my destiny too he thought if i had refused to go with her i would have loathed myself until i died and am i not really living vibrating keenly aware alive in every atom of my mind and body wasnt i a sort of walking dead before i passed through the gate i didnt know it i had to come here to find that out all those people on earthwell most of them anywayare semizombies the caterpillars question the clouds and the mountains ahead swelled after a while the black roiling mass shot with lightning streaks covered the mountains it would be raining inside that mass that reminded him that his mouth was still very dry his bladder pained him again during the dogfight as he thought of it he had forgotten about the urgency within him where could he land to get muchneeded relief there was forest below him as far as he could see could this plane alight without a long runway come straight down like a helicopter it certainly had used a short takeoff space but there were very few open areas and these looked as if they were small that reminded him that he had meant to ask tappy about the panel instruments urged by him she ran her fingers over the switches buttons and dials when he told her to stop at a certain instrument she did so but she could not tell him what they were for unless he ran down a list of questions and she would nod if he was right this took too much time and required too much patience for him to learn what every instrument did however he did make a lucky guess about the screen it showed the view from the rear of the plane if you pressed one of two buttons below it he activated it then he said just what i was hoping wouldnt happen three large black dots were in the sky flying in formation they were at the same altitude as his plane were being followed he said theyve sent at least three pursuits after us he looked through the windows to each side and through the window in the ceiling he could not see any other craft then it occurred to him that there could be gaol machines below him but his eyesweeps saw nothing the chasers seemed to be in faster aircraft than the two he had disposed of the dots had grown larger it was highly likely that the downed pilots had radioed their experiences to their hq these newcomers would be much more cautious the radio blared startling him and the girl malvas voice filled the cockpit you will turn back you will turn back return to the place from which you took off return to the place from which you took off you will be escorted back you will be escorted back jack said for gods sake though his mind threatened to rupture from the strain of its resistance to the commands it was making him turn the plane piers anthony and philip jose fanner if his mind could have teeth it would be gritting them so hard it would break them off tappy order me to disobey malva but how could she do that she could not speak he was desperately trying to think of an idea his mind was running around like a squirrel looking for nuts it had buried during the summer it knew they were somewhere in this area but exactly where the plane was by now going in the direction from which it had come tappy he said loudly can you write she nodded he released the pressure on the wheel rim let the plane slow down he was in no hurry to get back a few seconds later he handed her a pencil and the small notebook he carried in the leather holder in the inner jacket pocket write down your order to me to disobey anybody but you then show it to me i dont know if itll work but weve got to try everything why didnt i do that long ago he thought then well thingsve been happening too fast i cant think of everything tappy frowning in concentration wrote on the topmost paper of the notebook she held it in front of him he groaned the writing was in gaol characters he was surprised that she knew that she had fled this planet at the age of six and how many that age could write though he could not read the characters he could see that her penmanship was beautiful she must have been precocious or maybe the daws had continued her gaol education which meant that they were not just your ordinary earth citizens no in english he said looking distressed she shook her head do you know any foreign language i mean nonenglish earth language like french or spanish again she shook her head that squirrel in his mind was frantic now it was whirling around like a furry gyroscope all right lets try something else you used body and hand language to tell me to fly this plane can you do the same to tell me to turn back to the north malva will give her orders again the caterpillars question but you could cancel them malva would repeat her command and tappy would have to override malvas orders and then malva would give her orders again the plane would yoyo until the pursuit planes caught up with it the bitch might be listening in now via the radio he leaned over and whispered to tappy you didnt point out the radio switches we have to find them and turn them off malvas voice had come from a grille inset above his head but there were no buttons or switches near it first he eliminated the controls and indicators the function of which he knew that left about twentyfive unknowns what if resetting one caused a serious change in the performance of the craft like shutting off the power to the engine he had to do something very soon the three pursuers were steadily growing larger at that moment malvas voice rang in the cabin you will obey the orders transmitted to you by your escort one aircraft will guide you follow it stay at the same level as it descend when it descends ah jack said when the voice had come on a green panel inset in the center of the steering wheel started to glow repeat malva said you will jack had cut her off by pressing the green panel with his fingertip the panel ceased to glow gotcha he pressed the panel again follow the plane in front of you and sure well just do that you bitch jack shouted and he turned the radio off all that time the radio had been on and he had not noticed the glowing panel but then he had been busy moreover he was not a trained pilot he laughed as he wheeled the craft around and headed for their destination some of his dread and uncertainty was gone that malvas commands were being ignored must be whirling her around as if she were glued onto a jet engine vane she would be horrified burning with panic her masters would not be tolerant about her failure he did not feel the least bit sorry for malva piers anthony and philip jose farmer now the air had suddenly become much rougher the plane fell and rose as if it were diving into and out of express elevators this was the forerunner of the storm what would it be like when they were inside its troubled heart if it were not for those aircraft catching up with him so swiftly he would have tried to climb over the storm but the chasers would overtake him sooner if he lost speed by ascending they might do so anyway the only way to escape was straight ihead the electrical disturbances there might affect whatever detectors the pursuers had if this happened they would lose him and tappy might if it did no good to wonder about mighthavebeens but that was an integral part of the human mind animals never worried about these humans found it necessary they had to fantasize so maybe it was good for them no time for that he squeezed the inflatable rim again go ahead tappy try to cancel the spell whatever it is the control she has over me tappy seemed to be thinking hard then she smiled after tearing off the sheet she had written on she drew a single character she held it in front of him you know i cant read it she half turned and gestured behind her then she passed her hands over her face and twisted her features she was trying to look like somebody but she was blind you mean he said slowly youre giving me the impression of a face from the voice of that person she nodded and she pointed behind her again her expression was haughty and arrogant oh you mean malva she nodded and smiled happily but knowing that hows that going to help me she opened her mouth wide stuck the sheet of paper close to it and moved her mouth and jaw as if she were chewing then she pointed at him he started to ask her what she meant when she reached over felt along his face until she found his mouth and jammed the piece of paper between his lips before he could protest he found the paper stuffed into his mouth she was still making the chewing motions grrbgrrbgrrbgrrb the caterpillars question which meant you want me to chew this and swallow it evidently she did so he did tappy threw up her hands to indicate that all was well he was not so sure only one way to find out he activated the radio again and said malva you slimy evil slut what do you think about your control of me now he winced at the hatred and viciousness of her invective not all of which was in english then malva after her hard breathing had ceased shouted you will obey me you will obey me come back as commanded come back as commanded jack did not have the slightest urge to turn the wheel he pressed the greenglowing panel again and grinned at tappy now we can get back to business but the roughness of the air had become a savagery he and tappy had been bouncing up and down and swaying hard from side to side now they might soon be lifted from their seats he said tappy we need belts to hold us down tappy frowned again her mouth drew up at one corner then she smiled her fingers brushed along the center area of the panel and stopped over a button the plaque above it bore a character different from any other on the panel below it was a flashing orange light she pressed her back against the back of the seat she gestured that he should do the same as soon as he had obeyed she pushed the button immediately after she sat upright against the seat back he heard a click from the panels behind the seats slid two long bands these began curving went over his and tappys chest and stopped after they entered two extensions which had risen from beside the seats safety belts then he felt something curving around his waist another metal band was enclosing him both belts seemed to move settling in feeling the shape of his body fitting themselves with maximum efficiency that was not so surprising but he was amazed when the metal of the belts suddenly became much softer in fact they felt like stiff cloths the orange light went out the recessed bulb beside it was now glowing a steady green jack said you just remembered where the belt button was she nodded piers anthony and philip jose farmer again he wondered who or what had inhibited her against speaking english whatever it was it had not kept her from talking to that honker if only he had time to learn from her how to communicate in honkerese he could bypass that inhibition there he went again if if painting pictures in his mind suddenly the savage bumps and drops and rises of the plane increased in frequency and intensity if it had not been for the belts he and tappy would be ricocheting around in the nakrow cockpit or should it be called a cabin what was the difference being bruised and having bones broken did not depend upon word definitions then the light dimmed and the lights inside the plane came on automatically tappy had pushed no buttons straight ahead and very near was the evillooking black roil of the storm edge he gripped the wheel so hard that the plane surged ahead though he had thought that he had been squeezing with all his strength he had fooled himself just before the plane plunged into the clouds he remembered reading something long ago that entering a violent storm in an aircraft was like slamming it into a concrete wall that had certainly been exaggeratedsomewhatsince the impact did not flatten the plane out it kept going though it had shuddered and the altitude indicator showed an alarming loss of height rain and darkness enclosed the craft but almost immediately the rain on the windshield evaporated yet the downpour was still almost solid a few inches from the shield this machine had no visible windshield wipers something was keeping the rain from hitting the windshield the headlights of the craft were on but he could not see more than a few feet beyond its nose he was still squeezing hard on the wheel and had it pulled far back though he was not losing any more altitude he had not regained that lost when entering the storm the mountain peaks how far below the plane were they lightning exploded nearby thunder boomed tappy reached over and felt his neck then lowered her hand to grab his shoulder well be fine he shouted it was within the realm of possibility but she needed strong encouragement so did he soon embarrassment and discomfort would be added to the danger he was going to wet his pants the caterpillars question maybe there was something to help him in the storage space behind the seats like a bottle anything he did not dare to lessen the pressure on the wheel rim tappy would have to grope around in there for him he told her what he wanted her to do and why she twisted around in the tight restraint of the belts and felt as far as she could reach she smiled and then worked away at something he twisted his neck far enough to see that she was unfastening a belt around a box the belt came loose when she clicked something on the buckle then she managed to bring out with one hand a plastic container it was heavy and fell out of her hand before she could grip it with both hands but it was on the space between them after feeling it she found and pressed a button on the box the lid came open inside were stacks of small plastic square containers and plastic bottles the bottle she brought out held a transparent liquid water he hoped and it was she unscrewed the cap and tasted it smiled then held it out to him at that instant the orange liquid inside the altitude indicator shot up he was pressed against the seat an updraft was hurtling the airplane toward the top of the storm he released his right hand from the wheel and took the bottle it had slopped some water out of it but there was more than enough for him despite his intense thirst when he handed the halfempty bottle to her he said drink it all up ill use the bottle then she lifted it to her lips and did not put it down until all the water was gone she must have been as thirsty as he however using the bottle for its second purpose was not easy the plane was still bouncing around while going up there seemed to be up and downdrafts within the big updraft desperate he managed to relieve himself completely never mind what missed the bottle meanwhile tappy had been holding down the box which tended to rise during a vigorous downdraft she screwed the cap back onto the bottle and placed it in the box after relocking the box she struggled to get it back into its place in the storage area finally she did it he had no time to thank her now a fierce downdraft plunged the machine toward what he squeezed the wheel rim with all the muscle he could muster and he pulled the wheel far back though he wondered if pointing the nose of the craft too piers anthony and philip jose farmer high would cause a stall he hoped not it seemed to him however that the propulsivelevitational power might pun intended forestall stalls at least he felt better now otherwise he would not be making a pun especially such a lousy one he had no reason to be freed of some of his fear at any moment a downdraft could smash the plane into a peak or the plane might fly headon into a very high mountain a minute later he was again thoroughly scared the dazzling white lightning bolts and their earramming explosions increased they seemed to be in a nest of electrical entities hatching right and left tappy squeezed his thigh while the ravening energy transformed the black world into a white one her fingers dug into his flesh when a gigantic round ball its brightness brainpiercing appeared in front of them she could not see it he supposed but it must be making some impression on her nervous system as they hurtled through it their flesh seemed to become as clear as spring water their bones were dark tappy was a moving skeleton beside him and his hands and arms were deaths own body then the ball was gone they were again fleshed but their hairs were standing on end her long tresses stood out like straight needles she looked like the bride of frankenstein somewhere behind them the ball exploded and the airplane shook their hair crackled and then fell back free of the static electricity a moment later tappy shook his shoulder he looked at her pale face she was obviously distressed about something he did not think that it had been caused by the ball what is it she was shaking her head and pointing at her forehead then she pointed straight ahead held up her hands and rotated them after which she made a circular motion close to her head with her right hand she looked very puzzled i dont get it he said she reached out and ran her finger along the instrument panel until she located the compass holding the tip of her finger on it she turned her head toward him with the other hand she made the circular movement he said oh you mean you dont know now where that place your goal destination is where weve been headed since we got here the caterpillars question she nodded vigorously and sat back now she looked distressed im sorry he said that did not help her or him and it was a winner of an understatement it mustve been that whitehot ball that st elmos fire he said that last explosion it was a huge sphere of electricity discharging somehow it glltched that homing sense whatever it is that was leading you straight to your destination i thought that was some sort of psychic power but it could be electrical semielectrical anyway tears rolled down her cheeks we still have the panel compass he said and maybe your uh power homing sense will come back soon no use telling her that the compass was probably messed up too he intended to go by it until he knew that it was malfunctioning a half hour later they shot out of the storm the late afternoon sun shone unimpeded by clouds and revealed that they were only about two thousand feet above the ground the mountains were behind them ahead was a plain that ran over the horizon isolated trees and groves of trees were scattered over it a river made stums across the terrain the vegetation was much thicker along its banks many animals were heading toward or away from the water the land reminded him of an african veldt except that the grass was a bright green and many of the beasts did not look like earth fauna not like presentday animals anyway some of them looked like mammals that had roamed earth many millions of years ago for instance an elephantine creature with a long proboscis and four tusks two turned upward and two downward its ears were rather small though that must mean that this area did not have a hot africanlike climate heading north by die panel compass jack flew for another thirty minutes meanwhile he worried about tappy she was still weeping and then there was the fuel supply which of the indicators showed how much was left to take her mind off her lossif it could be donehe asked her to locate the fuel indicator she touched an instrument much like the altitude indicator except that the liquid in die tube was a bright green and the symbols alongside it were different looks as if its halffull he said with a cheeriness he did not feel we can still go a long way how about that piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question despair had been covering her face like a transparent mask it did not change the plain eased into hills which soon arched their backs like a meow of alarmed cats to become minimountains colossal trees seemed to stride over these trees the lowest branches of which curved downward into the ground forming enormous gothic arches after an estimated forty miles the plane put the hills and the great trees behind it ahead was another vast plain five miles from the edge of the forest was a broad shallow valley in its center was a very strange phenomenon theres a dark and roughly circular cloud about a half mile across he toid the girl every seven seconds something in its center glows must be very bright to get through that cloud cant make its outlines out wait a minute let me count ah the glow lasts seven seconds and theres a camp a big one circling the cloud tents huts lots of people scattered around vehicles parked past the camp some planes parked beyond them he swung the plane back and straightened it out parallel to the edge of the forest well land along here someplace and then hide the plane if we can i dont want to get any closer if theyre gaol hope they didnt see us as he turned the craft he had seen men behind some big instruments aimed at the cloud a small party was entering the cloud the flash silhouetted the men when diey were first enveloped but a few seconds later they were no longer visible tappys finger touched the side of his face when he turned his head he saw her smiling the despair was gone she leaned forward traced a fingertip along the instrument panel and stopped it at the compass her gestures after that plus her evident joy told him that they were close to their destination he was concentrating on landing but he said those people there are they gaol he glanced at her she was drawing the edge of her right hand across her throat then she nodded we have to get down and hide the plane he said i hope the camp doesnt have radar equipment if they do theyll have spotted us by now everybodys attention seemed concentrated on the cloud he was also worried that their three pursuers might suddenly appear and see mem he lowered the window leaned out and checked the wheel wells what would be called fenders if this were a car the wheels were still within the wells okay if he had to land it on its belly he would he asked tappy about the wheellowering control she did not know where it was he took the craft down parallel to the edge of the forest except for some bushes here and there die plain made an excellent landing field it was not as smooth as a concrete strip of course but it would do he flattened out the angle of descent about ten feet above the ground and slowly eased it down then he leaned out through the window again the wheels fore and aft on the left side were halfway out of die wells must be some radar in the plane that automatically activated the wheellowering mechanism when it came within a certain distance of the ground the front wheels touched a second before the back wheels which came down with a bang how do i stop this plane he said where are the brakes he had released his grip on the inflatable wheel rim but the vehicle was still going at about five miles an hour he had to steer around several bushes blocking their path tappy groped along the panel until she touched a slight protuberance a purple panel glowing with a faint light she pushed in on it the panel lost its glow and the plane slowed down then stopped he pressed the panel again and turned the plane into the forest somewhere on that panel or maybe on the wheel was a control that would permit him to lessen or increase the speed below five mph at the moment he would have to do without it improvise can the wings be folded he said she shrugged dont know right the plane taxied between the arches of two trees its wingtips almost scraping the bark then he swung sharply right and went under an arch when the craft was behind the trunk unseeable from the forest edge he pressed the purple panel the plane rolled about ten more feet before stopping it was still behind the tree which had a trunk ten times thicker than that of a california sequoia the seat belts hardened and slid back into their recesses know how to back this thing up tappy shook her head as he got out of the plane jack realized how tight and tense he was his body ached and his neck muscles were as stiff as a hardcover book after he got tappy to knead his neck he could piers anthony and philip jose farmer bend his head without the neck vertebrae cracking he did the same for her then they explored the area though making sure not to go too far it would be easy to get lost in this vast shadowy place where the longest line of sight ended at sixty feet they drank deeply from a brook decided not to eat some big juicylooking red berries on a bush listened to the screeching pandemonium of the numerous birds above them and then returned to the plane they ate from ajar in the storage compartment a thick pudding colored chocolate brown and tasting like beef mixed with chestnuts tappy then pulled on his arm with one hand as she gestured toward the north with the other i know you want to push on now he said but we cant cross the plain in the daylight now you want to get into that cloud right she nodded vigorously wed better get some sleep first and fill our bellies too before we venture out first though he put some containers of food and water in a plastic sack he found in a box he looked for and found a flashlight he removed most of the stuff in the storage space so that she could curl up on its floor he would try to rest on the seat she had occupied his feet on the pilots seat but a minute after he had settled into the least uncomfortable position he could find his eyes opened i just thought of something he said the cabin lights they come on automatically when it gets dark the lightll be a beacon for the gaol you know how to override the automatic turnon for them she did not but as he reviewed the flight he remembered a panel light that had been illuminated when the cabin lights had come on as the plane entered the storm he pressed the inset under the light and the cabin lights sprang into photonic being another pressure and the lights died thats done he said we can both sleep now but a minute later he sat up eyes open does malva the gaol know where you were heading i mean do they know the cloud that flashing light is where you want to go she had her eyes closed she sat up too and spread out her hands and lifted her shoulders she was uncertain about what they knew the caterpillars question si he lay back down go to sleep tappy i promise not to say anything more until weve had a good long snooze it was some time before he drifted off he could not keep from worrying about malva setting up a trap for them in the camp however he and tappy would not know about it until they went into the camp so let the fates decide that was not a thought to ease his anxiety anxiety a psychological jargonword for fear finally he slept and he dreamed mat he was painting one of those gigantic figures that marched along the inner wall of the crater when he awoke his neck stiff again his back aching he remembered the dream he thought thats what i should be doing now painting not be running scared dirough a world i never made and never would make but earth was also a world i never made and would considerably alter if id had anything to do with the creation take things as they areyou cant do anything about changing its basic structureand deal with them as best you can he got up without disturbing tappy as he crawled out though he heard her muttering in her sleep reality is a dream sometimes its a nightmare he thought once more he wondered why she could speak english while asleep yet could not do so while awake tappy woke up four hours later she looked refreshed though the hard floor must have been uncomfortable by then clouds had covered the night sky and thunder and lightning were playing rough games in the west a wind had come down hard like a swatter against a fly even in the comparatively sheltered forest it whistled and streamed tappys long hair out all that cheered up jack the visibility on the plain would be limited and the gaol would be snug in their tents and huts he hoped if it would only rain he and tappy would not care if they were soaked that would be one more thing to help them he did wish however that tappy could tell him why they were going to that cloud and what awaited them they set out across the plain he carried the radiator in one hand after walking two miles leaning a little sideways into the wind they were in a savage downpour the cold water made them even more miserable but it did make them step up their pace piers anthony and philip jose farmer after what seemed a long while but was not they were at the rim of the shallow valley the light from the center of the cloud was still coming on every seven seconds the cloud itself otherwise invisible in this darkness was outlined when the light flashed there were lights on in the shelters and strung along paths which led to huts that jack assumed were latrines not a human being was in sight that did not mean that no sentries were posted it could be that he just could not see them but what did the gaol have to fear besides this camp looked to him more like a scientific expedition than a military base on the other hand what did he know the lightning arrived at the camp at the same time he and tappy got there the white streaks helped illuminate the camp for them but it would also help any guards to see the intruders he waited awhile crouched on the rim and surveyed the scene for sentinels if there were any they were well hidden finally he said lets go tappy they scrambled down the muddy and rockstrewn slope slipping now and then he held die radiator high to keep it from getting dirty however the rain cleaned their clothes in a short time shivering from more than the cold water and wind they walked across a fairly even ground to the outer rim of the camp crouching they passed between two windflapped tents he held the radiator ready the pencil in die other hand loud voices came from the tents lights shone from the little windows they left these behind passing after a quarter mile of sticky mud several of the huge machines jack had seen these stood on towering tripods the ends of which were stuck in the ground cables also ran from them to big metal pegs driven at an angle into the earth other cables led from them into the darkness toward die camp jack assumed that these were power conductors the machines on top of the tripods resembled giant cameras but he doubted that they were for photographic purposes while lightning screwed through die sky exploding at a sofarsafe distance from them and thunder banged maniacally they crossed about a half mile of plastic covering that kept them from sinking in the mud then they were dazzled by the light in the center of the cloud now closer to the whiteness they could see more clearly its source seemed to be a titanic building it was perhaps not more than five stories high but its length was at least two thousand feet they could not be sure about that nor about the roundness the caterpillars question of the structure but jack got the impression of a brobdingnagian cylinder whether or not one of its ends was pointed he could not determine jack halted the light disappeared though the afterimage of the building lingered for a second or two he did not wish to go into that cloud which now mat he was near it roiled like the storm in the sky and extended pseudopodia and shrank them back into itself the light blazed again this time he saw the center thing more clearly the end on his right was pointed the main body was rounded tappy had been holding his hand she moved ahead pulling him after her if she was courageous enough to plunge into the cloud he could not hang back and she should know what she was doing would she penetrate the cloud if she thought they were in danger yes she would if it held something she desired or thought was worth the risk the cloud closed around them instantly the wind ceased he felt no rain pouring on him somehow the cloud repelled or evaporated it before it got to the ground but the stuff that enveloped him was oily and sticky moreover after a few steps be seemed to slow down to have to push against the cloud it was as if its essence was a very thin jelly that must be a delusion he thought if the cloud really was thickening it should make it harder for him to breathe that did not seem to be happening then he smelled a sickening odor as he drove on against the everthickening element he was permeated with the stink it reminded him of rotting beef if it got worse he was going to vomit tappy was pulling harder on him as if she were getting impatient with his lagging then she fell her hand sliding out of his he could not see until the bright light came back for seven seconds he had a good look at her she had fallen over something just before the light went away leaving him in the greasy darkness he realized that she had stumbled over a body it was in the uniform of a gaol and it was lying facedown but its neck and body and arms and legs were swollen the source of the stench was the dead man he thought up in the airplane i saw men going into the cloud but i did not see any coming out piers anthony and philip jose farmer tappy got up though he did not know it until her groping hand touched his chest he reached out and pulled her close she was trembling whats going on he said holding her close she could not answer him of course she released herself from his arms felt along his arm and gripped his hand again then she was leading him into the cloud the stink of death was left behind after only a few paces that cloud must be heavy and keep the molecules of the decaying body from going far certainly the stuff sheathing him was getting denser he had to push even more against it his growing nausea however was now receding ill bet no gaol has reached the building or whatever it is he thought why does tappy think she can succeed even if she does have some ability the others lack shell have to leave me behind and why did that man die if he could not go ahead why did he not turn around and come back out of the cloud what killed him finally he could not struggle any more he was winded and each breath was heavy with oiliness the stuff seemed to soak into his mouth and nose bis throat his lungs he was trapped like a fly in molasses panicky he yanked back on tappys hand but she did not move her hand came loose from his he struggled to take a step backward and found that he could not move his hind foot more than several inches if i die he thought will my corpse sag slowly sinking by inches until i finally lie on the ground will my body begin decomposing halfway through my slowmotion fall then something touched his chin the light brighter than lightning returned and he saw tappy she was turned around had gotten closer to him and had reached out with a questing finger she could move though her briefly seen face was twisted with effort go on tappy he shouted you cant help me go on he could hear his voice but it seemed to be inside his head he doubted that his words got very far from his lips before they were absorbed chapter but her touches did not stop her hands were on his shoulder trying to lift him trying to make him resume walking she didnt want to go on without him he tried again this time with reason rather than muscle tappy you have something important to do you have a destiny you are the imago you must get to where youre going and you can do it because you are what you are but i am only mortal i cant reach the source of that light i will die just as mat gaol soldier did thats how its meant to be only you can get through he paused gasping with the effort of shouting through the cloying fog but he had to convince her my job is done i had to get you safely to this place now you must go on dont let this effort be in vain go and be the imago go go but she refused he knew why she might be the imago but she was also tappy the blind mute girl she had a crush on him he fool that he was had taken advantage of it and that had done nothing to abate her love she had refused to leave him before and she was refusing now reason was no good against adolescent passion which meant that if he gave up so would she and it would be for nothing he had to do something but what then he thought of the radiator it had gotten them out of more than one scrape already could it do so again but this seemed so farfetched that he couldnt quite say it outright thecan it here but she understood him immediately she passed her hands along his body until she found the radiator she brought it up and found a button he didnt even know which one only that she put one of his fingers on it piers anthony and philip jose farmer it was worth a try he aimed the device away from her turned it on and pressed that button this time a visible beam came from it rather an invisible beam with a visible effect it dissipated the fog in its path the fog just seemed to shrivel or melt giving out a noisome odor leaving a tunnel of clear air could he go into that tunnel if it was the fog that held him then maybe he could he hauled one leg forward toward the clear region ahead the fog resisted seeming unwilling to give up the limb but the fog had been weakened and the leg was able to break through then the other leg the tunnel was narrow here but broad ahead in a slowly thickening cone his feet remained mired but his legs were now clear and he was able to duck his head to clear it too what a relief to breathe free again he worked his way farther into the tunnel it was like stepping out of quicksand now his body was free the tunnel remained where it had been carved enabling him to move through it he looked back and saw it slowly squeezing together behind him but that didnt matter in fact it might be good because he didnt want to leave a passage for the gaol forces to enter he aimed the radiator toward die intermittently flashing light it sliced through the fog leaving a closing offshoot like the cutoff elbow of a meandering river when he held the beam in place the new tunnel broadened and clarified he wiggled it around enough to enlarge the tunnel at the near end then turned it off he didnt want to waste the radiators power not knowing how much of a charge it had he glanced at tappy who was standing beside him its working he said his confidence resurging on to the light she nodded then follow me he marched ahead he did not want that beam touching her soon there was a whiteness that did not dissipate it was the hard surface of the structure inside the cloud it glowed blindingly by its light he saw pseudopodia of cloud extending inward from the round rim of the tunnel like so many cilia eager to move him along this intestinal tract he was not comfortable with the image then abruptly it was gone he blinked trying to adapt his sight to the relative gloom now there seemed to be nothing where the building had been in seven seconds it was back blindingly bright again tappy theres something strange here she merely urged him on pushing him from behind the caterpillars question theres a glowing wall or something the side of the building if thats what it is for seven seconds thats what makes the light through the cloud then its gone and i think its just an empty hole that the thick fog cant fill in in only seven seconds but it cant just vanish it doesnt sink into the ground its just here and then its gone and then its here again he was watching it do this while he spoke shielding his eyes from the brightness so that he could see better in the darkness its as if it just ceases to exist but theres no implosion of air or anything tappy that thing may be dangerous but she kept on pushing she was not alarmed rather she was excited tappy do you understand what im saying this thing is big maybe a third of a mile on a side and maybe some kind of superscience can make it phase in and out of reality but i dont want to be standing on its turf when it phases in wed both be crushed flat she came up beside him she pointed ahead and nodded her head positively and vigorously she urged him on yet again okay tappy he said dubiously ill warn you when were at the edge because but now she was hurrying ahead by herself and he had to lumber after her wait youre going to run right into it wait for it to cycle back too late tappy ran across the section where the wall had been then the wall returned and he crashed into it the surface was diamondhard as befitted its brilliance stunned more by the realization of tappys fate than by the physical shock jack leaned against the wall why had she done it he had warned her as the horror deepened he struck at the brilliant wall as if to punish it for crushing that innocent child yet he condemned himself too for not catching her in time she had misunderstood she had not heard she had the wall disappeared he fell into the vacant space automatically lifting the radiator clear taking the fall on his shoulder and side pain lanced through him he knew he had suffered an injury but what did it matter in a moment he too would be squished so flat that nothing showed for there was no sign at all of tappy not even a bloodstain she had been totally obliterated jack lay flat on his back and waited for the return of the bright building somehow this termination seemed fitting piers anthony and philip jose farmer then there was light but this time gentle in shifting pastel colors he blinked trying to align this with his notion of death hands were touching him caressing him then a face was kissing him it was tappy she was whole and warm despite her wet nightie and sodden jacket she was every bit as glad to find him here as he was to find her butthe building he protested holding her close again there were two levels of reaction the sheer relief and wonder of her wholeness and the mystery of what had happened his body was reacting emotionally while his mind was floundering intellectually if i may a mans voice said jack jumped looking around he had somehow assumed that they were alone in the afterlife or whatever this was now he saw a nondescript young man wearing ordinary shirt and slacks neither of which seemed to fit perfectly it was as if the manufacturer had had another body style in mind who he asked at a loss i am an agent of the imago the man said i and my companions exist to foster the wellbeing and success of this entity because the imago has assumed human form and has brought a human companion and is conversant with your language we are assuming this form and mode of communication because the imago desires your welfare we shall treat you responsively jack looked at tappy who nodded feeling his motion he made as if to stand and immediately the man and another came to help him up two young women appeared helping tappy similarly the women wore blouses and skirts which seemed to have been crafted by the same misguided tailor who had done the men their figures seemed good but their clothing was making a valiant effort to demonstrate otherwise the colors were all over the place nothing matching or complementing well this simple action did not reassure jack the men looked ordinary but there was a machinelike strengm in their bodies and their flesh was like plastic he could see that the women too were inhumanly powerful despite their appealing forms jack found himself feeling lightheaded as if he were running without a warmup and his system was out of whack hands cold and pulse racing he had thought tappy was dead then thought he would die too and suddenly everything seemed all right he just didnt trust it he had a tendency to react inappropriately when caught out of the caterpillars question sorts he did his best to control it it wasnt just himself involved here it was tappy when he had undertaken to deliver her to the clinic he had assumed a commitment to get her there safely as it had turned out they had gone on a spectacularly strange journey maybe this was the true clinic but maybe it wasnt he owed it to her to find out uh tappythese are your friends he asked she nodded and smiled is it okay if i find out more about them tappy nodded again jack turned to the first man are you human no i am what you would call an android or machine we all are an android as i see it is an artificial living man a robot is a machine in humanotd form with a computer for a brain which are you we conform physically more closely to the latter description but we are sentient in the manner of the former you mean you are conscious freewilled youre not just a program that is correct certainly it seemed possible considering what jack had already seen a monstrous spaceship that healed itself and a building that flashed in and out of existence without crushing what was under it that cycling seemed to have stopped once the building had taken them in it remained firm maybe we had better introduce ourselves i am jack this is tappy whom you call the imago what are your names we have none but will answer to whatever you choose to call us if the imago agrees call her tappy the man glanced at tappy imago tappy nodded jack tappy and our names are the urge to be flippant increased jack had to yield to it a little or risk going wrong in some worse manner maybe he could get a smile from tappy and tide through it hardly mattered whether these were friends or enemies it was better for him to hold his cool until he knew for sure he decided to do it the simple way alphabetically you are abraham abe for short he is bartholomew bart for short are there any more of you piers anthony and philip jose farmer there are six of us presently animated abe said three of each apparent gender that meant that they werent really male and female then the third male is coleman or cole jack turned to the women and you are abigail or abbie and bridget brie and the one i dont see is candace or candy thank you the two females said together you sound just alike jack said can you make your voices different so we can tell you apart by sound as well as sight yes the two said in different voices yes the two men said similarly tappy smiled this was almost too easy jack hardly trusted it look maybe wed better get changed and then we can talk i guess you folk dont have to eatyou have power cells rightbut you know we do so certainly abe said come with us jack jack knew he would have no choice if his will opposed theirs well change and then tappy and i will eat together he said they hesitated then tappy nodded and abe spoke immediately as you wish jack jk they took him to a smaller chamber where he apftjppkl wincing as he flexed his bruised shoulder you ate m physical distress jack abe inquired i bashed my shoulder coming in it will heal there is no need to wait abe placed both his hands on the shoulder one on each side jack felt a current and his pain faded the man might be a robot but he had a healing talent maybe it was just some kind of electrical anesthetic but it made life easier for the moment then jack stepped into what looked like a shower suddenly he felt warm and clean he had had the equivalent of a full shower in half a second painlessly he was still marveling as they presented him with clothing similar to their own he could tell by the feel that it was of alien material but it felt good and fit him well in fact it seemed to adjust itself to his body of its own volition so why didnt it fit these alien men and women better uh before we go back jack said is there aa bathroom i mean a place where i can step into the purifier again abe said jack stepped in but didnt see any toilet then suddenly he the caterpillars question had no need for it somehow the wastes in his body had been removed he decided not to protest um abeyou serve tappy right the present form of the imago yes and me you help only because she wants it yes it is not ordinary but her will is our law literally and you went to the trouble of learning my language and customs because of her you really dont care about me otherwise this ts the situation and if she told you to kill me you would do it if she were serious and tappy herselfyou would never harm her or go against her wish this is approximately true were she to desire something harmful to herself we would decline got it you really are her agents no matter what this is the situation thanks it is her will that you be given full information jack was satisfied with that since he also wanted what was best for tappy there should be no trouble if these humanoids really were to be trusted they returned to the main chamber there was now a table there with fairly familiar food on it tappy was standing behind a chair dressed in a clean and wellfitting blouse and skirt her hair brushed out and tied back by a red ribbon only the scar on her face marred her dawning prettiness that and the slightly unfocused eyes you look wonderful tappy he said she broke into a smile extending her hand to him he saw that though she was the mistress here she remained eager for his company and reassurance he took her hand and squeezed it then they sat down to their meal catered by abbie and brie it consisted of a small lettuce and tomato salad mashed potatoes and a steak with a glass of milk on the side but the lettuce was red which was possible and the tomato green also possible depending on the variety the milk was brown which could mean chocolate the steak was blue it was that last that made him conclude that this was not ordinary food after all it was artificial food surely with the piers anthony and philip jose farmer requisite nutritive elements but the agents of the imagothe aievidently had no direct experience with the world jack had known that showed in their clothing and in the food either they were colorblind or they had misinterpreted the colors tappy could not correct them because she couldnt see the food but it took only a moment for jack to conclude that he should keep his mouth shut except for eating this was his first direct evidence that the ai were fallible there were things they didnt know that was reassuring it also argued for their legitimacy in a perverse way they were here to help tappy who didnt care about the fit of their clothing or the color of die food so they didnt pay proper attention to that they hadnt expected jack who could see and who knew so were caught short malva would have put him under a mindprobe or something and gotten the details right even if it burned out his brain the ai had left his mind alone he had better encourage them to continue doing that tappy was already eating he dived into his meal and the taste was close enough probably everything was made from hydroponic soybeans and injected with taste and color but for all he could tell the steak was from a dragon it would do for dessert abbie brought green pumpkin pie and brie brought cheese jack looked at her and at the cheese and stifled a laugh it wasnt that the cheese was blue literally it was the coincidence of the name tappy became aware of his reaction her face turned toward him its nothing he said just that i named her brfe and brie is a variety of cheese she smiled brie the seeming woman did not she did not seem to be offended she just did not have emotions and would not have understood the humor anyway and there was another key these were indeed robots they might be conscious and know a lot but they were not feeling it seemed that it was not feasible for even thisadvanced civilization to duplicate a living creature to that extent they completed the meal and the ai brought small handheld units that blinked by their mouths making them suddenly clean no toothbrushes needed here now that he was fed jack realized how tired he was it had been an extremely trying sequence of several days physically and emotionally the frenzied trek up the mountain in the night the caterpillars question the crossing through the portal encounters with the honkers big domeship of the gaol the capture and interrogation by malva the flight in the airplane the struggle to get through the cloud the nullification of volitionhe realized that he had had no problem with that since tappy had had him eat the paper with the symbol on it he felt freewilled now but tired maybe its time to rest he said if its okay with you folk he suspected that they had a lot for tappy to do but he was sure she was as tired as he was tappy nodded agreement and that forestalled whatever the a might have had in mind there are bedrooms abe said they got up and tappy managed to catch his hand her fingers clung to his not letting go she wanted him with her for what passed for night in this building should he argue the case on the one hand he did not want to give the ai the notion that he regarded the imago as a sex object so it was better to sleep apart on the other he still didnt really trust this situation and feared that once he separated from tappy for any length of time he might not be allowed to get together with her again the ai could kick him out and tell her that he had decided to go home then there would be no living person to watch out for her interests maybe the ai really wanted what was best for the imagobut what of tappy there was a living feeling girl there who was in some ways just like any other but in other ways a truly tragic figure jack was no psychiatrist but he honestly felt that in this situation he was the only one who could truly relate to that girl so he went with her to the bedroom they had designated for her the ai expressed no objection abe and abbie came in to undress them uh jack began then it occurred to him that he valued the things the ai did not know about him and shouldnt give diem away they didnt know that human beings who chose to share a bedroom did not necessarily have strangers undress them let them remain ignorant so he let them do it he was facing away from tappy and left it that way in due course he and tappy were in pajamas and nightie and in the bed which was large enough for two the ai withdrew through the doorway which seemed to close behind them the light faded leaving them in darkness tappy found his hand again and drew it to her she wanted him closer piers anthony and philip jose farmer jack knew he had gone wrong once but he wasnt going to do it again not this way tempting though the prospect might be on one notquitesecret level if she was the imago she was probably beyond his aspirations if she was a hurt blind girl she was underage either way forbidden i am here to help you tappy he murmured i think i can help you best just by being near you until you achieve your destiny then he drew his hand loose rolled onto his stomach and tried to sleep for a moment he was afraid she would start crying then she rolled over too toward him and set her hand on his back with that contact she seemed to be satisfied her breathing became even he was relieved he knew that had she insisted on more he would in the end have succumbed he had before it was not easy doing what he believed was right but it was best he could never fully redeem die wrong he had done her there in the cabin in the green mountains of vermont so far away in more than one sense maybe his recent efforts to get her to wherever she was going represented his need to atone meanwhile he could at least avoid making it worse he slept and dreamed and in one dream he was approaching tappy desiring her and feeling guilty for it he knew even asleep that she was beside him and it was his duty to leave her alone but there was that in him that wanted it otherwise he knew it was morning because it was light and abe and abbie were there to get them dressed jack felt greatly refreshed maybe there was something restorative in the air here he had slept well and it seemed that tappy had too he was amused to note that the two ai had gotten mixed up again abbie was tending to jack and abe to tappy an individuals sex was evidently not of great significance to them they took turns in the shower stripping down for it jack had managed to avoid looking at tappys nude body the night before but realized that he could not do so now without making more of his human foibles apparent than he cared to fortunately he had a reflex that prevented him from having a masculine reaction in public so he affected neutrality as he had during the night whatever the ai did not know about any aspect of his relationship with tappy was fine by him her body was and was not what he expected she was slender the caterpillars question but not thin her legs were nicely fleshed her hips and buttocks rounding into womanhood and her breasts were well enough formed yet neither was she at the adult level he judged that she was about halfway across her transition from childhood to womanhood physically in some countries as he understood it a girl was considered to be old enough if she appeared old enough mere years did not define statutory rape in such a country he would have been in trouble anyway but there was something else that intangible glow she turned her face to him and smiled fathoming where he stood and it was as if there were an aura about her she knew what they had done and she regretted it not at all she had in that sense proven herself perhaps it had been at mat point that she became independent of the need for the leg brace she had begun to assume command of the situation to choose her own course to lead she had led him to the portal between worlds the imago had begun to manifest and surely it permeated her now she had power and knew it and her growing confidence manifested in a straighter stance a certainty of acceptance and a subtle knowing in a country that judged by attitude she would be deemed old enough when she was dressed that aura remained she took his arm guiding him rather than being guided by him she squeezed indicating that she was by no means through with him oh yes she was changing after breakfast it was time for talk they sat in comfortable chairs in a threequarter circle there is more to clarify jack and it is best if your ignorance is quickly abated abe said we think you will be more receptive if you learn it in your own manner please make the remaining inquiries in your mind jack reminded himself that this was not a living man he should not react to the seeming condescension but he was slightly irritated so he became slightly unreasonable i have no remaining inquiries thank you tappys face turned to him her tongue was between her teeth as if she needed to bite it she was amused surely you do jack bart said neither amused nor annoyed you folk are interchangeable jack inquired now playing to his audience of one living person you alternate on sentences yes if you wish abe said what about the missing two why havent we seen cole or candy they have been at work on maintenance but you need have piers anthony and philip jose farmer no concern their responses would be identical to ours this was getting nowhere jack knew he was being unreason able therefore he became more so maybe i d rather judge that for myself he stood ill go find candy abe looked at tappy she tittered it was the tirst truly human sound he remembered hearing from her abruptly his unreason ableness took another turn youre here to serve the imago right well you can serve her best by removing the block that stops her from talking to me in my language you can do that cant you we can abe agreed but then get on it jack snapped then she can ask the questions let me know when she s ready he strode from the chamber no one followed probably tappy had indicated no and she herself had been intrigued by the notion of being able to talk again he had half expected tappy to try to come with him to plead silently with him but she had not it was a sign of her new confidence that she knew he was making a deliberate scene and apparently she was enjoying it maybe the emotionless ai manikins annoyed her too but because they served her she could not make an issue of it but now he was stuck wandering around the building without a guide he had no idea where he was going so he was making pretty much of a fool of himself but he was stuck on his course he kept walking striding down the hall he found himself in he came to some sort of central square except that it was round halls radiated out to the four directions and there were shafts going up and down he was walking so fast that he was stepping into the pit below before he realized but he didnt fall he just floated across the center as if he weighed nothing his inertia carrying him on to the far side antigravity well why not they seemed to have everything else he decided to explore the shaft above he turned and jumped if there really was no gravity here he should be able to sail nght up to the top instead he found himself angling toward the far wall of the shaft he twisted as well as he could before crashing into it managing to get a foot out to break his fall but instead of rebounding back into the center he found himself catching his balance and straightening up the wall was now his floor the caterpillar s question he looked back there was the center with its radiating halls now the one he was in seemed level and the one he had come from seemed vertical jack shook his head live and learn he resumed his walk going toward what might or might not be the top of the building there did seem to be light at the end of the passage it turned out to be an opaque but glowing wall or floor when he came to it his orientation shifted again and now he was walking on it its surface seemed slightly curved so that he could not see the full length of the new passages which extended in four directions from the mergence this was like the center square only one hall was missing the one which would have led on through the wall and outside perhaps where do i go from here he asked himself aloud he realized that he could fairly readily get lost and make an even bigger fool of himself than so far maybe that was why the ai had let him go they were waiting for him to give up and accept their way of doing things passive persuasion a woman appeared before him may i assist you jack startled he stared at her she was definitely not one of the ones be had seen before abbie and brie were female but conservatively so really not much more developed than tappy herself this one was comparatively voluptuous with an orange dress that showed the rounded upper contours of her breasts somewhat more than would have been the case had the fit been perfect her dark hair swirled about her face and shoulders cohesively lending additional sex appeal i have two questions three four i am at your service jack you are one of them an ap yes jack then you must be candy yes how did you appear so suddenly i stepped through the panel she demonstrated by stepping back her body disappeared first the front side then the back side then her face reappeared framed by darkness it is an opaque screen you may enter if you wish her face disappeared again jack put out one hand it passed through the opacity and disappeared ohlike the rock like a portal yes candy agreed she was standing in the piers anthony and philip jose farmer chamber which was like another bedroom now he was too and your fourth question why are you so different from the others we established four of us as the original complement of a neutral type to serve the imago and her companion we were not certain what was in order so withheld two pending further information our research indicated that your species is highly sexual and since you did not indulge with tappy we crafted my form to be more mature you may relieve your sexual frustration with me if you wish so he and tappy had been watched somehow he had known that would be the case the ai intended to protect the imago and for al they knew he could be dangerous to her im not sexually frustrated he said shortly then i apologize for our misunderstanding when your copulatory member became rigid in the night thats normal they had observed all right he had forgotten the dream but now it came back he hoped they had not been able to see into his mind then we did not know candy said your particular species has not come often to our attention i can assume a less provocative shape you can do that just change your shape do you wish me to demonstrate this suddenly he believed it no keep your present form i like it and maybe he realized he should take her up on her offer so as not to be further tempted by tappy candy might be a robot but he suspected that she would feel exactly hike the most cooperative of women and she surely knew what she was doing in that sense she was adult regardless of her technical age i will show you more of my body since you like it she said her hand going to her dress no for suddenly he realized that this too would be wrong she was a machine possessing no emotion so it would inevitably be fake not real a cross between sex and masturbation and to whatever extent it was real it would be a betrayal of tappy i apologize for disturbing you i will conform precisely to your expectation if you will advise me what its not that its but again he did not want to tetl her knowing that in reality she was a neuter machine just how old are you anyway in your terms approximately one hundred thousand years the caterpillars question jack tried to keep his jaw from dropping and half succeeded he had assumed she had been constructed within the past year or so youve beena beautiful womanfrom before the time there were human women no jack she said unsmiling i am not human i have served the imago in the shape of whatever species the imago has chosen as host as have we all we are long conversant with the imago but not with your species but with your fancy building right here on this world near earth you must havei mean even the minions of the gaol are human here she paused just an instant i think it is essential that your ignorance be swiftly abated as abe advised you but it is apparent that we are not evoking your cooperation please advise me of the manner best to approach you so that you will be receptive jack stared at her you really want to know yes jack why because the imago is presently in a human host she is therefore subject to the idiosyncrasies of the human nature if we learn from you what those are we shall be better able to work with her oh so its her you care about not me yes jack actually they had never pretended otherwise he was here on sufferance because tappy had brought him and they treated him courteously by their definitions because she wanted them to they were not evil merely ignorant of the human nuances their very mistakes with him demonstrated the truth of that had these been secret agents of the gaol they would have approached him in either a more deceptive or more forbidding manner malva had alternately enticed and threatened him it had all been bluff but it showed the way she worked these ai had done neither well candy had offered him sex but had done it so clumsily that it was obvious that she knew next to nothing about the emotional aspects of it that wasnt surprising in creatures who had no emotions the conviction was growing that the ai were the genuine article and that he really ought to cooperate with them but he needed something more you are all in mental contact with each other he asked when i talk to abe its the same as talking with you even if piers anthony and philip jose farmer youre not there and vice versa whatever i do with you is the same as doing it with him yes jack so if i had decided to have sex with you it might as well have been with him yes jack he would have formed an orifice give me one decisive reason to cooperate with you we exist to forward the purpose of the imago jack stared at her thats it yes jack they remained at crosspurposes he pondered a moment suppose i said i would cooperate if you ripped off one of your arms and threw it away she put her right hand on her left elbow and made a contortion the left arm came out of its shoulder socket dangling tentacular threads she threw it to the floor that was just a question jack exclaimed appalled i didnt mean it literally i apologize for misunderstanding jack he stooped to pick up the arm it remained warm and soft no bone projected from the torn end just a hard plastic surface doesnt it hurt we do not experience pain but its a shame to waste such a finely crafted limb now you cant use it the fingers on it flexed i can use it jack it merely lacks anchorage he handed her the arm put it back on then she took it by the elbow again and pushed the end into the gaping shoulder socket the shreds of plastic melted and flowed sealing over the injury it will not be at full strength immediately but it will serve she said okay ill cooperate until i find reason not to he decided not because i know anything about die imago but because i care for tappy tell me how to avoid antagonizing you so that you will not find reason not to cooperate with us for one thing stop this damned condescension i do not understand jack you keep treating me like a feelingless object yes does this disturb you yes it does and it will disturb tappy too in fact that could the caterpillars question be why she wants me here because at least understand her feelings somewhat but we are feelingless objects ourselves then how the hell did you manage to serve die imago in its other hosts werent they all living creatures we were more conversant with their nuances and had competent input they were in the galactic registry and my species is not it will be added jack now that the imago yes i see the imago must have chosen it because it was a primitive backwater species no one would suspect of harboring such a significant entity that is a likely conjecture so you were caught short this time yes if you will tell me what i am doing wrong i will correct it immediately just like that he said with irony yes jack okay ill make you a deal you show me around diis place and tell me what i need to know and ill tell you how not to antagonize me while youre doing it this is what we asked of you at the outset of our association first lesson never say i told you so they walked through the doorportal and she showed him around they talked and he pointed out die nuances of human interaction as she ran afoul of them beginning with the illfit of her dress she became both more human and more attractive at a rate that was alarming in its implication he looked at the brightness of the outer hall whats beyond this at her gesture the white wallfloor became transparent and they could see outside jack stared it was a blaze of light from a seemingly infinite number of sources thosethose are stars he exclaimed but so many so close we are in a globular cluster of stars orbiting the galactic center because this cluster is outside the plane of the galactic ecliptic it will be among the last to be drawn into the black hole so you wont have to move and rebuild soon he asked still stunned by the change no that is of no immediate concern as is anything beyond piers anthony and philip jose farmer a few billion years but it represents another backward region of little interest to the gaol so they are unlikely to search here soon backwater species backwater cluster he agreed it does make sense but how did we come here this building was in a cloud on the honkers world this is not a building jack it is a mobile city to fetch the imago we rendezvoused intermittently at the designated spot and broadcast our signal when the imago came we ceased the shuttling and settled at the primary location let me see if i have mis straight he said staring at the amazing sky when tappy came through the portal to the world of the honkers you picked her up on your instruments and sent your city seven seconds there seven away tappy could tune in on your signal but so could the gaol so it was a race the gaol tried to get to the city and destroy it but couldnt so they tried to intercept tappy instead but the honkers helped her avoid the minions of die gaol and to get away from them when they did capture her it was a close call even so candy smiled a thing she had not done before he advised her about things like that you have a marvelous understanding of the situation jack just how far is this from the honker planet and how far was that from earth this is about fifty thousand lightyears from the honkers and that planet is about one thousand lightyears from earth the planetary portals cannot retain their tuning long so are normally established for short ranges jack shook his head so this is a spaceship really i think it does not match your concept jack a ship of space can travel where it chooses a city must be carefully programmed and routed this one is able to travel only from here to the realm of the imagos concealment now that it has vacated that world it will not be feasible to return there the gaol will prevent it he could appreciate the determination of the gaol so they are searching for us now will they follow us here they can not trace an intermittent phasestate that is why we used it and have used it in prior millennia they will have to spread their net again narrowing down die possible regions of the galaxy where we might be their efficiency has been increasing in recent centuries and we may have no more than the caterpillars question a year to complete the training of the imago this is why we require your help a year how long does training usually take seven yearsthe full term of the ripening of the chrysalis because the gaol were unusually alert this time the chrysalis had to be hidden instead this makes it difficult that was surely an understatement they had to squeeze seven years into one and work with a lifeform they understood only imperfectly it would be about as easy to teach a dolphin to speak greek but with the help of another dolphin who understood their purpose and was friendly with the one they had to train maybe it was possible they walked on around the outer wall of the city gazing out of the floor the ground came into view seeming to be like a vertical wall the gravity inside the city related to the city not the planet outside a glassy covering extended over the region surrounding the bright shell and through it jack could see what appeared to be exotic foliage is that a greenhouse he asked where you grow the soybeans please clarify your reference youre feeding us reconstituted things or adapted from something you grow im sure it isnt what it appears to be because this isnt earth we do a lot with a plant called the soybean and maybe other plants too she smiled why yes jack you are most perceptive despite his knowledge that she was following a script which he himself had just revised he found himself warming to her he liked being flattered by a beautiful woman lets go down there she shook her head no jack that would not be wise why not those plants arent going to eat me are they not physically but they are of rather special breeds capable of adapting rapidly to unusual conditions such as the light of thousands of suns and of producing particular nutrients as required they are responsible for the air you are able to breathe which is poisonous to most creatures of the galaxy and they refine your essential fluid water we select those aspects of their production which are appropriate there are other aspects which are not appropriate more was falling into place the planet of the honkers was similar to earth in its atmosphere and gravity so human beings piers anthony and philip jose farmer had been able to colonize it how they had come therewell he could ask and would surely receive an answer but he preferred to wait and find out for himself so the gaol recruited human minions to serve in that region and perhaps elsewhere but humans were no more significant than goldfish in a bowl except that this time the imago had chosen a goldfish as host what a kettle that was just what would happen to me if i went among those piants he asked physically you would not suffer the plants have been attuned to your biology but your mind and emotion might be affected by their pheromones we have no direct information but our references suggest that your perception of reality could be distorted changing your nature significantly reality is a dream jack remembered those sleeptalking words of tappys did diey relate he turned away from the scene as if losing interest i note you have control of gravity here yes how is it that you have such hightech features yet have to hide from the gaol the gaol are conquerors we are not we lack emotions therefore have no desire for aggrandizement we exist only to serve the imago but you are machines some living species must have made you what happened to those folk i know of no such species youre saying that you robots evolved on your own i have no knowledge of this jack dropped the subject but filed it away in his unfinished mental compartment they continued walking then candy paused as if startled jack we have learned that the gaol are quartering the galaxy and will locate us sooner than we anticipated we shall have to accelerate our program your cooperation is essential because tappy knows and trusts you but we of the ai do not know or trust you well enough to risk the imago with you will you allow us to survey you youve been risking tappy with me all along jack exclaimed last night no you were monitored jack as you know had you sought to bring her to harm of physical mental or emotional nature we the caterpillars question would have interdicted it now we must allow you greater access to her for you relate to her in a way we do not im human he said wryly that is true you also have a relationship with her that has greater leverage than we can muster at the moment we had hoped to learn the human ways and relate to her so as to train her adequately in the time available but now we must work dirough you more directly what happens if she isnt properly trained this much we have learned of your recent culture you have a weapon called a gun yes we have guns he said scowling so do the gaol if you expect me to use a gun no but if one were to place a gun in the hand of a small child the power of the imagoits like that dangerous the analogy is imperfect but in degree it is like a gun capable of causing a planet to rupture i think you can not at present appreciate the actual nature of the power of the imago perhaps gun is not the appropriate term perhaps grenade or detonator im getting the gist that girl is dangerous only if her power is improperly used but with appropriate direction it means the salvation of galactic culture it is essential that its proper potential be realized so you want to use me to make tappy do something im not sure i care to be used she turned to him taking him by the arm staring into his face now she was animated and startlingly pretty jack we need you i beg of you help us how well she had learned every inflection was right every aspect of her facial and bodily expression her hair was tumbled back her bosom was heaving her eyes were wide on top of that he believed her the ai were now desperate there was no way he could turn down her plea without feeling like a heel what does this survey entail we will put you in a chamber and question you your responses will be analyzed by this we shall know whether it is appropriate to place the imago in your charge my charge tappys a person she should be free to make her own decisions piers anthony and philip jose farmer tappy is a person she agreed the imago is not if i may return to my crude analogy the imago is like the gun in her hand you must tell her how it is to be used when we are sure that your judgment and motive are suitable so that she wont turn that gun on you that is not our concern if the imago were to desire our destruction we would destroy ourselves but we can not allow the imago to be misdirected they had a point okay survey me here she led the way into the closest stepthrough panel was it coincidence dial they were right here or could any chamber serve he decided that the chambers were as interchangeable as the ai diemselves were then candy was gone jack stood alone in what appeared to be a rocky desert but the rocks were giant crystals and the sand was confetti and the sky was purple evidently the ai notion of an earthly landscape had you your desire what would it be you mean apart from tappys welfare he asked without qualification well first id see that tappy was okay in fact id like to see her cured of everything that ails her i want her to see again and be happy do not speak imagine imagine maybe i could paint it he said if i had my paints paint he pretended he had a brush palette and canvas set up on an easel he touched his brush to blue and made a sweep to paint the sky blue the blue appeared he moved his hand farther and the blue spread accordingly then he let his hand drop and just pictured itand abruptly the entire sky was blue instead of purple like a computer painting program he exclaimed clarify your reference he ran through the mechanism of computer painting in his mind there was agreement this was somewhat like that then he really got into it he painted a picture of tappy not as she was now but as she would be if he had his wish she stood before him in a green dress with a yellow sash her hair tied back with a matching yellow ribbon but nevertheless falling to her waist her face was without blemish the scar was gone the caterpillars question her eyes focused on him jack i see you she exclaimed im happy she made a pirouette her skirt flaring showing her legs to the knees no brace and for yourself jack was at a loss he discovered that his original ambition of being a successful commercial painter had left him that would require returning to earth alone and rejoining its culture how can you send them back to the farm after theyve seen paree he asked repeating an imperfectly remembered quote he had not seen the best of what the galactic society had to offer in fact he had seen mostly pursuit and oddity and ugliness but behind it lay the amazing technology of the advanced cultures and now all he wanted to do was know more of it no that wasnt all but somehow he was unable to settle on the rest i dont know he said the chamber became ordinary again candy stood where she had been apparently she had never left thank you jack she said he smiled ruefully i guess i washed out on dial one my mind just went blank no jack you provided us with the information we required we now trust you but you didnt learn anything about me couldnt answer the simplest question about the nature of my ambition you have no selfish motive sure i have selfish motives i just wasnt able to define them i mean theres so much here that i want to learn about only i have no way and i know i dont belong here but i dont want to go backwhat a mess jack if i had emotion i believe i would like you she took him by the elbow guiding him from the chamber it opened immediately on the larger room where he had eaten with tappy but she was no longer there he was suddenly nervous tappywhere is she you havent isolated her while you were distracting me have you i tell you all bets are off if she will join you in a moment candy said now we have important material to impart which of us would you prefer to do this all of you he snapped somethings up i know it if you want my cooperation bring tappy here now the other ai appeared stepping together through the opaque panels around the room their clothing now fit perfectly one piers anthony and philip jose farmer man was unfamiliar that would be cole in a moment they said in unison first we must acquaint you with the situation oh for gods sake i didnt mean it literally abe you be the spokesman the rest of you just settle back and twiddle your thumbs or something whats going on abe stepped forward the other five stepped back putting their thumbs together jacks annoyed glance stopped that they were coming to understand about nonliteral the gaol will isolate this retreat in as little as three days abe said three days candy said the gaol were coming sooner than you expected but three days how did that happen we surmise that they located this site in the globular cluster during a prior quest for the imago several centuries ago and retained awareness of it there are a limited number of suitable planets in such clusters in this manner they arc able to check potential locations much more rapidly than is possible in a routine quartering this puts us in an extreme situation extreme isnt exactly the word you need seven years you were going to cram it in in one year and now three days i dont know much about how you operate but that seems pretty chancy to me you have understated the case abe said sometimes i do that too or do you mean there is more i dont know yes we have treated tappy in the manner you desired with her acquiescence but without complete success jack felt an ugly thrill of apprehension all i said was to null that mental block that stops her from speaking english you mean she can only speak some words he knew it was more than that we also eliminated her physical deformities abe said she now has no weakness of limb and should be able to see normally you cured her blindness this was more than he had hoped for it is your desire abe said you wish her to see and speak and dance when we made her aware of that she acquiesced and we proceeded my survey you told her what i imagined she wished to know she had supposed that you might prefer her unchanged learning otherwise she chose to change the caterpillars question of course i want her to see jack said i want everything that is best for her but i didnt know it could be done whats this about your not succeeding what happened to her we eliminated her physical defects but this does not appear to be sufficient she can see and speak but she does not we suspect that despite her acquiescence to your will she lacks motivation to do diese things jack thought about that there had been a hint back on earth that tappy might be able to do more but didnt try he could understand that her case had been hopeless but she had come alive with him in more than one sense now she should be eager to see everything and to talk about it what was holding her back once the imago is ready jack said slowly what then i mean what does tappy do she will serve the imago implicitly as do we will she have any time to herself any social life will she get to read any books or splash in the ocean or sleep an hour late such things are meaningless to the imago well then i think i have a glimmering of what you dont i can see why she might hesitate just to step into this role please explain this to us tappy wants to liver he exclaimed shes not a robot shes had so little joy of life and now maybe she has a chanceand shell have to throw it all away and get into harness as the imago no chance at all to be a child or a girl just to change from one kind of freak to another no wonder shes afraid to move ahead it is true that we do not understand the urges of human life abe said either in their acceptance or their denial he glanced at candy and jack realized that none of diem understood why he had not simply made sexual use of the woman when she suggested it maybe other galactic creatures had no hangups about that sort of thing however the imago may do as she desires nothing is denied her she may splash in water or gaze at a text if she wishes but she wont want to you said past manifestations of the imago have not had incidental interests of the flesh because you had seven years to train mem jack said there was no place for such things in your curriculum piers anthony and philip jose farmer true what is your point jack took a deep breath you are right i really do understand tappy in a way that you dont therefore it may be possible to make the imago functional in the current host with your help despite the extreme brevity of training this is what we ask of you you want me to talk tappy into seeing and talking so you know she is functional so she can step right into harness now as the imago yes and thereafter you must serve as her immediate adviser so that she does not misuse the power of the imago and you dont care how i do it i can talk to her have sex with her anything just so long as she snaps to yes and you will be advising me what to advise her so that my own ignorance doesnt mess things up true how do you know i will do what you advise that was ascertained in the survey jack was gaining respect for that survey it hadnt seemed like much but obviously they had fathomed his motives if he agreed to the deal he would honor it and why do you figure shell do what i tell her to because she loves you this is a phenomenon we understand no better than we do the source of the power of the imago but we have seen its effect she is immediately responsive to your will but dont love her therefore you are objective this is appropriate jack ground his teeth why dont you take a flying fuck at the nearest sun this is a rhetorical question this is a nonrhetorical no i wont do that to tappy abe paused only that fraction of a second that passed for machine confusion why because it isnt fair to tappy she may be the host for the imago but she deserves some joy of life and i refuse to be the one who denies that to her especially i refuse to toy further with her emotions she never did deserve that it is concern for her larger welfare that motivates you yes want to verify it in your survey chamber no we accept this but we must remind you that tappys the caterpillars question alternatives and ours are limited we believe that the course we ask of you is best in the circumstance maybe youd better spell out those alternatives for me the first we have described you will work with her under our guidance in this manner circumventing the training we are unable to provide got it the second is to delay until the gaol arrive and capture her the seven of us will then be destroyed and tappy will be cocooned for the duration of her human life allowed neither freedom nor death god no i heard about that no way the third is the easiest and perhaps best but we suspect you will object to it also maybe lets have it he figured he had them on the run now to destroy the host immediately freeing the imago for a future host who may have better prospects then jack knew he had lost his ploy of course that made sense they served the imago not the host they did have an easy way out but it was impossible for him tappy had to live you win i will cooperate in the first course we thought you would however your reactions have been irregular but i have a condition is this something that will facilitate your effort i think so you have told me the bleak alternatives now im telling you that you cant treat tappy like a machine you want me to make her do things which she fears will make her independent of me thats the one kind of thing she wont do for me help me get rid of her not if she knows what shes doing we do not follow your logic you dont have to just take my word for it if i have to do your dirt it has to be my way what is your way put us in your greenhouse again that pause if this is not effective we shall have to destroy both of you before the gaol arrive they were machines they did not bluff he was putting his life on the line and tappys just dont jump the gun okay you are asking us not to act prematurely yes piers anthony and philip jose farmer then we shall do it your way when she is able to see you and talk to you you must emerge from the garden then we will know that the two of you are ready jack nerved himself and gave himself no time to waver then get on with it wheres tappy the room widened there stood tappy in the green dress and yellow sash he had imagined during the survey with the matching nbbon she was unscarred and her feet were in yellow slippers without trace of any leg brace her body seemed to have filled out somewhat though that could have been the enhancement of the dress there was an intangible glow about her which could have been the animation of the strengthening imago or of the love they said she felt for him jack she was to his eyes at once young and vulnerable and in need of protection and absolutely beautiful in her own right then he saw that she held a book in her hand that would be the little prince he felt like laughing and crying without being quite sure why tappy he said she turned toward the sound of his voice smiling in her face was sheer adoration but that was not what shocked him it was that both he and the ai had seriously misjudged the situation in one vital respect there was no chance of his deceiving or betraying tappy he would never do that it was that his objectivity which they depended on was threatened he was in the process of falling in love with her then the chamber faded and strange vegetation appeared around them they were in the garden chapter the threeday garden jack thought the manycolored wonder around him the exotic plants and queer insects the multitude of birdsongs would under other circumstances have thrilled him he would have run from this fascinating growth to that fascinating growth and dragged tappy behind him while he chattered away describing everything he saw moving her hand so that she could feel the trunks and leaves and fruits and bemes all of them strange and delightful not now all he could think of was the time limit they had three days he had to perform a miracle before they had passed and he was no god god he was no god the flaming colors and the varied shapes he saw did not blaze loveliness and form beauty they imaged forth despair he closed his eyes to shut out the garden he needed to think without distractions a human in an unfamiliar place tended to think unfamiliar thoughts it did not slide along the old groove it lacked the oil of the accustomed it halted because of the faction of the strange true the unfamiliar would in time become the familiar but time was what he did not have he felt tappys left hand touch his nght shoulder move down his arm find his nght hand and slip hers into his it was as if the correct key had been inserted into the correct lock but for some reason the key could not turn he said itll be all nght tappy well make it he opened his eyes she was standing by his side her head turned to look at him look she could not see if he did not find a way soon to restore her vision both of diem would be dead and forever sightless that thought soared like a silent scream from the garden and drilled into the sky piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question he was close to breaking down become at ease with the surroundings he told himself then you can think straight whatever pressure you might be under maybe the sky was blue and the sun now straight overhead looked like earth s it could be real or it could be an illusion made by the ai it made no difference it was a clock when it was at the zenith for the fourth time it would mark the end of the third day oh time run slowly flow no faster than a glacier still holding tappys hand he turned toward her she was smiling as if she knew something he did not he was going to ask her if she really did when he saw something out of the corner of his eye he switched hands and kept on turning the object was a huge tent that looked like one of those hed seen in arabian nights movies caliph haroun alrashids or aladdins it was scarlet with strange green yellow black and white symbols on it with a wide entrance over which sheer drapes fell with symbolbearing flags fluttering in a light breeze he led tappy into its cool interior the ground was covered with very thick orientaltype rugs displaying abstract designs six rooms were within gauzy drapes forming their walls in the center of the entrance room was a marble fountain with running water a faint quitepleasant musky odor was everywhere he found a table large enough for six diners on it were many covered dishes and silver cups and cutlery in two other rooms were beds suspended from the overhead poles one room contained a washbowl a bathtub and a toilet plenty of towels washrags soap toothbrushes toothpaste and toilet paper everything in fact including cosmetics that they could possibly need much more than they could use in three days maybe well have guests he murmured since neither was hungry they went back outside he was silent for a long while as they walked through the garden he led her by the hand but often she stopped when her free hand felt something interesting then she caressed it until she had the shape and texture and odor of the tree bole or flower or bush branch or berry in her mind once while she was doing that he said youre like one of the four blind men who felt the elephant you can feel a part of the elephant so you think you know how all of it looks he paused for emphasis but but if you could see you would know what an elephant really looks like and if you could talk you could describe how be elephant looks to those who cant see she frowned with puzzlement he said so okay you havent heard that story he told her the ancient arabian tale of the four blind men who had for the first time in their life a chance to feel an elephant when asked what it looked like to them each gave a different answer the man whod felt the tail said the elephant was like a rope the second having fingered the trunk said the beast resembled a large snake the third groped around a leg and reported that the elephant was undoubtedly shaped like a living hairy monolith was in fact a very tall uniped the fourth felt a tusk and said that the beast was more like a hardshelled fish than anything else i may not remember that gradeschool story very well jack said but it was something like that you get the idea feeling and hearing arent enough you cant get the whole picture the true picture of the world unless you can see he waited for a reaction she was expressionless for a minute or so while they stood there then her face became sad and a tear oozed from her left eye she gestured with her free hand as if she were signaling hopelessness at least that was how he interpreted it it could have indicated helplessness what if those blind men only had to open their eyelids to see he said harshly he hurt inside the pain resonated with hers but he could not be too tender too careful of bruising her feelings if they had refused to see well they shouldve been kicked in the ass a second amoebashaped tear crawled out and ingested the first and she pulled her hand away from his oh hell he murmured doing this was like attacking her with a spear equipped with a blade on each end he stabbed himself and her at the same time they were standing by a tree with a twentyfootwide trunk at the ground level instead of bark it had a transparent and skillsmooth covering below it were blue and red networks the fingerthick red tubes and the pencilthick blue tubes pulsed alternately the trunk bent abruptly just above the ground became horizontal then curved into an upward spiral the trunk narrowed as it ascended becoming a thin tip when a hundred feet high piers anthony and philip jose farmer atop it was a flower which looked like a christmastree star corkscrew branches bearing round purple leaves grew from the trunk halfway up it jack thought he saw die vertical part of the tree move itself slightly toward him it almost had the air of an eavesdropper bending his head to hear better no must be his imagination but several seconds later something fast slammed into the tree a few feet above him instead of bouncing off it clung with eight tiny legs the legs telescoped from below the buttercupyellow body which was hemispherical and as large as a halfcoconut it had no head or wings that jack could see then from the bottom center of its body a thin and stiff member extended downward its sharp tip plunged through the glassy skin into a red tube the skin rippled violently the thing insect whatever was propelled from the skin it fell onto its back and lay there while its legs telescoped into themselves the redfluidtipped proboscis became limp and the yellow body turned green and then black jack had no idea of what had happened but the tree had gotten rid of the parasite just as a horse twitches its hide to get rid of a biting fly but the twitch doesnt kill the fly where had the ai gotten the fauna and flora of the garden from what strange world had they come distractions he thought ive no time to explore the garden and to contemplate its wonders and beauties the tent should be pitched in the middle of a flat desert he became aware that tappy looked as if she had a question suddenly he recalled that she like him had been startled by the loud noise of the impact of the creature on the trunk he said it s okay just a big insect running headlong into a tree mustve been going fifty miles an hour he wanted to be alone for a while so he could think but he could not leave her since neither had had any sleep for a long time he suggested that they lie down in the tent he did not intend to take a nap that would waste time but sleep would give her the energy she was going to need when he started the intense process of artificial emotional maturation forcefe sng of the psyche when he started if he started at the moment he did not have a smidgeon of confidence that he would be able to think of a plan that would work within the strictly allotted time in fact he doubted that he would be able to imagine any plan at all the caterpillars question they entered the tent and went into a room with two large banging beds tappy crawled into one and gestured that he should join her he was pleased she must have gotten over her wounded feelings and she would want the physical and emotional warmth of his body next to hers any other time he would have lain down by her he went to the bed leaned over and kissed her then he said i have to think tappy ill be in the other bed while you sleep believe me it s absolutely vital for me to be undisturbed if i held you id have thoughts i couldnt control you understand she shook her head and she held out her arms you have to grow up fast he said softly become an adult in hothouse time part of being an adult is being able to give up something so you can achieve something better he kissed her on the lips again and patted her thats the way its going to be as he got into the bed however he did not feel nearly as confident as he had sounded his project was in some ways equal to gods creation of the world but god took four days just to make the heavens and the earth and divide the waters from the dry land and make plants and then the animals the work assigned by the ai to one puny earthman had to be done in three days the big difference aside from the power demanded was that god knew how to go about doing what must be done no there was another difference tappy had free will assumedly once god had created humans he had left the use of their free will entirely up to them tappy did not want to see and speak and god himself wasnt going to change her mind he stared up at the sagging ceiling of the tent the girl was snoring gently somehow she had managed to fall asleep at once that pleased him she very much needed the rest and she would not be bothering him with her silent but seen presence it was not easy to organize his thoughts and slide them down a single channel he kept thinking of the ais words past manifestations of the imago have not had incidental interests of the flesh put simply she wont care at all about affection or screwing well he could handle that that was what one part of him said another part was greatly disturbed by it he steered his mind firmly back to the initial phase of his task project tappy how could he get her to see and to speak piers anthony and philip jose farmer then there was the warning the ai had given him he must make sure that tappy did not misuse the power of the imago but that sounded as if she would have some control over the imago if she did how much hey he told himself ive drifted off the first phase back to the track then there was the promise of the ai to help him with the project no the ai had said that he would be working under its guidance but no ai had shown up to help him and itthey had not told him how to summon them and he had to use tappys love for him to get her to do what must be doneif he ever figured out what to do since he didnt love herdid hehe was somehow not honorable to use her love as a tool against herthough it was actually for herhe might have to pretend that he was madly in love with her that made him fee sneaky and treacherous really rotten unclean suddenly he heard bells ringing loudly they might be warning bells or wedding bells or funeral bells what a crazy idea he thought almost at once he realized that he had fallen asleep between the thought of how rotten he was and the wakening thought of the bells or had the latter been the tag end of a dream he did not remember he sat up rocking the bed oh lord he said loudly whatever i do ill lose her if he could not make her mature enough within three days he and tappy would be destroyed if he did succeed he would keep her alive but she would no longer be completely human she would be the fleshly instrument of the imago tappy must have heard his exclamation she turned slightly but she did not awaken presently he heard her mutter reality is a dream was that phrase the key to the door which would admit the imago im just not up to this he told himself talk about your frail vessel or your brittle tool im it i just cant do it might as well give me a spoon and tell me to dig the panama canal in three days he got out of bed and went to the entrance room there he drank deeply from a cutquartz glass filled with the fountain water then he turned toward the entrance he stopped the caterpillars question the garden was gone replacing it was the flat desert he had wished for sand and rock rock and sand no plants at all no shadows the only moving things heat waves the expanse as straight and as level as the tracks of gods locomotive to the unbroken horizon he felt as if he had just seen zero and infinity converge chapter for a moment he was dizzy at the same time he was numb his heart thudded against an icy shield as if it were a whale trapped beneath arctic ice and trying to break through though he had lived through events much more outre and terrifying than this he had expected them to be strange and dangerous this one was completely unanticipated it caught him as off guard as if his bodys electrons had suddenly reversed polarity instead of a rug a world had been yanked from under him when his numbness thawed out he thought the ai they must have some kind of telepathy i wished for the garden to be replaced with a desert and the ai like aladdins genie granted my wish but they did it while i was asleep his question now had he and tappy been transported elsewhere or had two worlds been exchanged or was all this an illusion or a dream next thought what difference did that make it was then that the ai a female came around the corner of the tent he jumped and his nerves clanged like the bells in his awakening dream for gods sake he said next time give me some warning before you do that i will the ai said apparently it knew what he meant it walked up to jack and stopped with its nose less than an inch from jacks its breath smelled like machine oil that of course was his imagination but it stepped back saying you are uncomfortable because i am so close to you does this distance make you more at ease you can read my mind jack said after he had nodded despite the double jolt he was breathing easier and his heart was slowing down the caterpillars question not your thoughts my ability isnt like reading words on a screen i sensed that you wanted help just as i sensed your uncomfort at my near proximity what about replacing the garden with this jack waved his hand to indicate the desert id think thatd take a pretty concrete image images yes the ai said not words i can receive images though theyre distorted but i can unscramble them why do you need help or guidance have you thought of something which needs our help physical or mental not yet the ai looked up at the sun an hour and a half has passed since you came here oh well just hang around for a few minutes ill have it all figured out by then that would be most gratifying the ai said the thing would not understand sarcasm of course jack said when i really need you ill transmit an sos sos i dont have that vocabulary item the ai said and im wasting time talking to you jack said snarling begone without replying the ai walked around the corner of the tent jack hesitated then hurried after it by the time he had rounded the corner the ai had returned to the building wherever it was more of my precious time shot down jack thought the first day became the longest that jack had ever endured yet when the sun dropped into the slot of the horizon it also seemed to be the shortest his whirling brain a mental centrifuge threw off scores of plans and many variations and combinations of these none was worth anything each was weighed in the balance and found wanting meanwhile tappy paced back and forth within the entrance room or walked around and around the fountain her burntumber hair and yellow dress made her look very young and very pretty and very vulnerable the upright and horizontal poles supporting the tent emitted light jack and tappy took turns in the bathtub for some reason the ai had not supplied a waterless skincleansing cubicle perhaps they sensed that water and soap were more satisfying to the humans they were not capable of perceiving that a shower would have been even more satisfactory afterward jack and tappy sat down to eat jack tried to keep talking so that the piers anthony and philip jose farmer dismal silences could be brightened but they increased in number and length when they were through eating he said youve been kept in the dark too long tappy i havent told you whats going on because i wanted to spare you fear and distress however i believe now that keeping you in ignorance isnt fair if something bad happens it shouldnt take you by surprise and maybe you could help even if you cant talk she listened intently while he told her the situation he omitted the desire of the ai for him to use her love for him as a tool she took it well though she could not keep her face expressionless shadows of fear passed over her face now and then like the shades of very thin clouds on the earth when passing below a bright moon now you know he said he leaned over the table and took her hand in his i told you all diis only because were in a desperate fix she squeezed his hand and she looked confused he said i know its all mixed up there are many things i probably dont understand any more than you do one of the most perplexing is why you still dont see and talk the ai say theyve removed the blocks keeping you from doing that they also say that its up to you to go ahead you dont they say because you arent motivated to do so is that true she raised her hands and hunched her shoulders that meant he supposed that she did not know the ai have great powers he said but theyre not allpowerful or allknowing for a moment he was strongly tempted to lie and to tell her that he was madly in love with her the ends would justify the means after all the fate of the universe was at stake corny as that sounded echoes of thousands of sciencefiction stories it was true however he was not deeply concerned about the lives and deaths of perhaps trillions on trillions of people not at this moment he deeply cared only about tappy and himself if you could speak tappy if only you would he heard silence he saw tears something rose up within him it was a red flash flood that crumbled the walls of his selfcontrol he banged his fist hard against the table then he yelled my god tappy well die what is it what keeps you from speaking and seeing do you the caterpillars question want to be blind and dumb do you want to die is there sometiling in you that says you should die that you deserve to die even if it means that i die too she reared up out of the chair and walked away her shoulders straight neck stiff her body seeming to vibrate with anger sincedie was familiar with every inch of the walking space of the tent she made her way to the bedroom as if she had vision a few minutes later he followed her she was lying on her bed faceup tears welling he said softly im very sorry i yelled at you i didnt mean what i said accusing you of wanting to die i mean its just that im so frustrated and scared i am human can you forgive me she smiled weakly then she held out her arms he went into them and wrapped his arms around her for a while she sobbed when his back started to ache because he was so bent over he eased her down onto the bed and straightened up she reached out picked up the little prince from the bedside table and held it out to him he did not know why the story seemed to console her perhaps she could insert herself into it and forget for the time being her own identity and troubles she might be the sad little boy whom saintexupery described in such simple but telling language in a way the plight of the child prince was hers he too was parentless and lonely and sought a true friend and companionship and was puzzled by die world in which fate had placed him jack was reading to her about the childs encounter with the desert fox when he stopped he was silent so long that she reached out and tugged at his arm looking up from the book jack saw her questioning expression i just got an idea he said from this story she shook her head the fox wants to be tamed by the little prince but the prince doesnt know how to tame the fox so the fox instructs the prince how to tame him dont you see tappy you can teach me what i must do to change you well try anyway it might be the way to do it her hunched shoulders raised eyebrows and spreadout hands palms up said how his enthusiasm propelled him from the chair he had drawn up next to the bed and sent him to pacing back and forth dont know yet but at least i we have got something to work on let me think piers anthony and philip jose farmer while he walked he struck the palm of his left hand with the book it was as if the hand were iron and the book were flint and he hoped to strike fire from them when we were in the plane you gave me a piece of paper on which youd written a word it was supposed to make me able to disobey malvas orders over the radio but it was in gaol writing it had six different characters and two that were repeated now listen carefully do each of these characters have an equivalent in english speech she frowned i mean lets say does one of them for instance symbolize any single sound in english like t as in lend like t as in tappy like e in lend or v as in seen got it the girl nodded good he looked around but realized that he had not seen any paper or pencils in the tent he closed his eyes and visualized a sheaf of writing paper and three sharpened pencils then he summoned up an image of a knife hed have to have something to keep the pencils sharp tappy stirred restlessly he said be patient a minute later he heard a womans voice do not be startled he said come in and an ai walked through the entrance into the bedroom he groaned she was emptyhanded we do not have the strange objects you telepathed that you wanted she said what use are they you can perform technological miracles he said teleport us read minds but you dont know what writing paper and pencils are we dont have everything it said especially primitive artifacts tell me in detail what you need their use their materials after his description it said i cant say precisely when ill be back but itll be soon it walked out of the bedroom curious jack followed it into the hall made by drapes he saw something blurry like heat waves appear around it concealing it suddenly the ai and the wavy envelope were gone he had expected a bang of air rushing in to fill the vacuum left by the ai there was no sound the caterpillars question he returned to the bedroom tappy he said while were waiting ill tell you more of what were going to do ten minutes or so later an ai a male this time appeared jack and tappy were deep into the procedure the ai not bothering to excuse the interruption said this is not what you asked for its the equivalent though that is not the correct noun its better it held out two white flat thin and onefootwide squares made of what looked like plastic one side of each was silvery after jack took it the ai extended to him two silvery objects that looked like a pen pass the end of this across the screen and it will make what you wish to write on the screen you dont have to press it against the surface weve got something like that on earth jack said press the orange strip on the side after youve written on the screen it said and it will voice what youve written press the green strip and what is written on one will appear on the screen of the other press the yellow strip on the edge of the bottom and the writing will be cleared activating the green strip will allow you to dictate to it and see your words in printed form this tiny projection here when pressed once lets you scroll down pressed twice it scrolls up the ai showed him the rest of the controls jack guided tappys hand to a square and a stylus she had heard the ai and did not need instruction thanks he said to the ai you can go now it walked into the hallway jack said okay tappy lets go ive asked you a lot of questions from your responses ive learned that the gaol alphabet doesnt have an equivalent letter for each letter in the english alphabet like for instance the english letter a can stand for several different sounds so can a number of other letters like v stands for the initial v in surprise and also for the z sound in the second s and so on but the characters in gaol writing stand for one sound only some of the gaol pronunciations dont exactly correspond to our english way of sounding them not american english anyway but the letters for them cover both pronunciations there are some sounds in gaol we dont have in english but they probably wont give too much trouble anyway youre going to write in english with the gaol letters after i learn the equivalents right she nodded he pressed the orange strip on her recorder he began slowly dictating sentences in english they would include all the sounds in english speech at least he hoped they would piers anthony and philip jose farmer he was no linguist but if he found that he had overlooked some he could supply them later her printing appeared on the screen of his recorder as she made them on hers when she was done he said the gaol alphabet is longer than ours but i expected that he sat for a while studying the gaol letters and their english equivalents apparently the gaol had no p or d in their language he told tappy to double the gaol b and t to indicate these sounds now ill ask you questions youll write the answers in english using the gaol letters more than one way to skin a cat whoever installed those mental blocks wasnt smart enough to make them foolproof tappys smile was so wide it reminded him of the cheshire cats grin his smile was not as big even if he could converse with her in this roundabout fashion he had not found the way to make her mature seven years in three days but it was a step forward that is it was unless another obstacle was revealed first question one of many tappy maybe and the most important he told himself though i dont expect an answer do you know how to compress seven years of aging into three days tappy looked startled she wrote with the stylus two letters which appeared on his recorder he had to scroll down the section with the gaolenglish equivalents to check his memory the letters spelled out no there went his idea derived from the little prince that she could teach him how to mature her however maybe she could do that but did not know it as yet he said do you have now or have you ever had any awareness of the imago within you anything that might be the imago making itself manifest no he sighed if only forget about ifs no time to fantasize until we came to the honkers planet then nobody had ever said anything to you about the imago or hinted at its existence no can you remember anything before the plane crash in which your father died no the caterpillars question no jack said then how can you remember the gaol writing you must have learned it before you came to earth she printed i dont know i just do then your mind isnt completely blocked off jack said maybe we could pry it open wider but we dont have time to try even if we had the psychological tools he paused then said you dont remember anything before the plane crash but you can somehow use gaol writing maybe there are other things you could use how to find what these were if there were any he wished he could go back to earth and locate the daws the last people to have known tappy they could tell him much maybe had the daws or other people before them imposed this hypnode memoryblock if they had they could also cancel it then there were the honkers the beings who he when he first saw them had assumed were sapient but not very bright one of them had implanted that tiny bead or egg in between her breasts and thus kept her from being subject to malvas will that showed mat they were no dummies it also showed that they must know much if he and tappy could get back to the honkers planet they might find out more or perhaps all about this mystery and if only tappy were six years older and thus close enough to maturity that there you go again he told himself if if if if that word suddenly glowed in his mind like a times square of revelation its light generated what might be a great idea maybe it would work but hed have to ask the ai if they could do such a thing he sent out a mental message get your halfmetal asses down here chapter they consisting of one female ai met jack by the fountain before he proposed his plan jack asked it about something that had occurred to him while he was waiting for the ai to show up it had little to do with the previous idea except that it involved tappys mind also it might be important later on could you get through the block that keeps her from remembering her first six years he said my data indicates that it would be extremely difficult and would take a long time the ai said we dont have time for that also its tricky even with the instruments we have using diem could drive her mad or even completely destroy the memory now inhibited jack said i thought id ask for future reference he explained what he had in mind for her immediately and asked the ai if his plan was workable within die deadline that is the ai took about ten seconds to consider jack drought that it must be linked to a data bank because it surely did not have the required information in its brain there was no use asking it about a linkage just to satisfy his curiosity it did not matter enough for him to waste time over it its possible dial we can do what you have proposed the ai said of course we cant give her a complete false memory covering seven years that would mean imposing trillions and trillions of data of different kinds sensory iconic verbal oneiromantic i get the idea jack said no use to list them all thus the impressions would have to be relatively few but they would be vivid they would seem to be real as ive been informed you humans have great gaps in your memory the caterpillars question some dont jack said a few gifted people have photographic memories we know that die ai said in die womans case it doesnt matter she cant remember back before she was six years old and any seeming gaps of memory after her treatment could be accounted for by the traumas shes endured however since she would supposedly be twenty years old how would we fool her wouldnt she wonder why she a twentyyearold still looks thirteen shed just think that she looks very young for her age jack said shes one of those people who probably will look younger than dieir age i suggest that you insert a few memories of people telling her how young she looks noted itll be done but we have doubts that the memory insertion will deceive the imago i dont know if it will be fooled or it wont be jack said it makes no difference we have to try and wed better get cracking very soon he started to say something more on die subject but no sound came from his mouth his lips were open and his jaw hung down then he snapped it shut and frowned the ai waited patiently for him to speak ah of a sudden jack murmured all of a sudden what the ai said it struck me that ive got an ethical problem i havent asked tappy if its okay if we mess around with her mind its a terrible thing to do that and not even ask her if we can yet die situation is such that we cant ask her if shell cooperate to do that would negate the plan from the start the larger ethical issue overrides the smaller the ai said our data makes that clear you have no intuition about ethics jack said you rely on data we humans do too but we also have feelings mine tell me mat we are sinning against tappy we know the definition of sin the ai said its a philosophical and theological concept which has no relation to reality except as it governs the behavior of homo sapiens and some other sentients how about the imagos concept of sin its ethical standards i have no direct knowledge of that but it always works for the general good of sentient groups who are also ethical piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question jack thought that no group or individual for that matter believed that it was doing evil did hitler or stalin or mao believe that he was evil no what they did was for the good of the group they ruled or so they believed apparently though the imago could perceive what and who was truly good go away jack said let me think the larger does not always outweigh the smaller the ai said but in this case it does it turned and walked out of the tent and around the doorway jack paced back and forth presently he heard the tinkling of the little bell which he had gotten from the ai and then placed on the table near tappys bed she could not call out to him if she wanted him but the bell could be heard throughout the tent and some distance away from it he went to the bedroom where she was now sitting on a pile of pillows near the bed what do you want he said she held up her recorder he went to her and read what she had printed on it by now he was becoming fairly proficient in reading the gaol alphabet he only had to refer to his equivalence list twice she had written what is happening ive been busy with the ai he said he hesitated then said lying were going to put you under hypnosis and try to break through your memory barrier maybe if were lucky we can find out what happened before the plane crash suddenly he had known what he must do to her it was making him lie to her because the most important thing the only really important thing was to develop that entity inside her to the imago phase god help her god help him they were from the cosmic viewpoint only agents in some respects their fate was no more important than the ais but it mattered greatly to tappy and him they were not unfeeling robotic ai tappy looked anything but happy in fact her left hand was gripping her right hand tightly and she was biting her lip whats the matter he said she shook her head he said you are troubled dont deny it i have to know what it is he picked up the recorder from the little table and nudged her shoulder with it after she had taken it he handed her the stylus tell me he said she wrote i reely dont know but i get paniky sick at my stomik feel cold as ice when i think of being hipnutizd she added please dont make me do it she was terrified why because he was sure whoever had installed that block had also put in a command to make her resist fiercely any attempt to remove it since he did not intend to have her hypnotized he found it easy to reassure her he said dont be afraid we wont do it youre safe from that i swear she relaxed at once and smiled though shakily now though she would fight against anything she could interpret as an attempt to probe her mind the only thing to do was to sedate her while she was asleep and then have the ai insert the false memories he hated the idea nevertheless it had to be done he pulled her up from the chair and held her tightly she was still trembling and did not quit until several minutes passed he spoke soothingly and told her that somehow things would work out well though she probably did not believe him she may have found some comfort in his words perhaps she was interpreting his embrace and his concern as an expression of his love for her that made him feel even more traitorous what a judas he was finally he released her it was evident that she did not want him to do that but he held her at arms length one hand resting lightly on her shoulder i have to talk to the ai he said ill be back first though is there anything i can get them to get for you they can probably provide anything youll want except safety and peace of mind and my love he thought she wrote id love a big reel big mug of hot coco with a marshmello the childs spelling caused him to be engulfed with tenderness she was a child and she had been terribly wronged and now he was wronging her ill do that he said be back shortly he started to withdraw his hand she grabbed it and held on then she made signs with one hand that she wanted to go with him im very sorry he said i just cant do that piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question he gently pulled his hand away and walked out of the room by the time he got to the fountain an ai a female was waiting for him he told it about tappys request for cocoa itll be ready for you when you go back the ai said put a sedative in it jack said she needs to sleep a long time while were planning what kind of memories to give her and when were ready to insert them shell need something to make her unconscious before shes put wherever you plan to put her during the operation it will be done she must be very disturbed we received impressions of great fear from her do you blame her jack said we dont blame or praise the ai said you just do the job you were made for right give me the cocoa ill take it to her and stay with her until she falls asleep he was startled though he should have been prepared for something like it when the waves appeared behind the ai they suddenly cleared to reveal another ai a male it held on a tray a mug with at least a quart of steaming cocoa and a huge marshmallow floating on it he took it about six minutes later he returned the male was gone it didnt take long he said she fell asleep before shed drunk a quarter of the cocoa he had thought that he would be taken to the cityship for the conference but the female ai candy was the only one he saw and they stayed in the entrance room he sat down on a pile of huge pillows and made notes on the recorder while they talked candy stood in one place and moved only its lips its lack of the gestures and twitchings and slight shiftings of the bodies all humans make while talking bothered jack it also lessened his feeling that the ai were human though he had known they were androids he had clothed them with humanity with real life now they were naked of these they were just machines so what was he doing talking with machines it was he acknowledged better than having no one to talk to after they had covered various possibilities jack said okay heres how itll go if you agree it can be done youll make and then insert about seven major memories per year over a sevenyear period fortynine very strong incidents that is memories of incidents which have been powerful in maturing her then youll insert a number of lesser incidents things that might not be significant to other people but tappy will remember seem to remember anyway because theyre important to her things mostly pleasurable id say she might as well have some happiness in her past even though theyre false memories seven years is a long time for a human candy said and as i understand it time seems to go more slowly for a youth than for an adult the older you get the faster time seems to go is that correct thats what older people say jack said i know that my childhood seemed to stretch out for a much longer time than when i was a teenager then logically shouldnt she have more memories in the earlier years of her pseudomemories than she has in the later years the first four of her seven years should contain more memories than the last three not necessary jack said just give her a sense of extended time during those years the feeling that the first four were the longest for the last year though since the events of that year will seem to be the most recent you should increase the number of pseudomemories writing a scenario for seven years was not easy and required much rewriting tappy had awakened before dawn jack had to quit work talk to her awhile and give her another sedative in a fresh cup of cocoa she was not aware that much time had passed between the two drinks while he ate breakfast he worked on the scenario though he desperately wanted to sleep he kept writing and talking to candy until he had completed his work then he said you can start work on the memories it seems satisfactory candy said it was silent and unmoving for a minute jacks eyes were drooping his body sagged he felt that his immediate surroundings were sliding in and out in and out they seemed to be drawers filled with tableaux which someone invisible was pulling out and then shutting suddenly candy was shaking his shoulder jack said wha whass going on you were sleeping candy said we didnt want to wake you up but you should know that the work is complete tappy has her seven years of pseudomemories piers anthony and philip jose farmer the caterpillars question that brought him up off the pillows and to a standing position his legs felt numb his back ached and his brain seemed to be filled with antifreeze how how long have i been asleep fifteen minutes and thirtytwo seconds candy said that quick the scenario was prepared while you wrote it out and the changes were made immediately the ai said i thought you had to take tappy to die equipment you assumed that all the pseudodata was transmitted to her mind while she slept in the bedroom jack asked for a large mug of black coffee it arrived about ten seconds later carried by a male ai after jack had downed the hot liquid as swiftly as he could stand it he walked to the bedroom and looked in it by then the sun had come up but the pole lights were still on tappy was sleeping on her side she was in a new nightgown near her on hangers on a line were her new clothes her old clothes had been stripped off and thrown away when she woke up she would have to have different garments of course in fact one of the false memories was of throwing the original nightgown away held in one arm was a big fuzzy teddy bear that had been given her supposedly several years ago as a birthday gift she had supposedly asked for it and since then had used it as her no security blanket her no was jack himself the suspended bed had been replaced by a conventional one it was large enough for tappy and jack to romp around on in sexual play jack was supposed to have been sleeping with her for the last five years the formerly bare room was now filled with many things furniture machines that played the music of many planets though not of earth dolls an icecream dispensing machine a table loaded with cosmetics which she supposedly used for makeup and a mirror she could not use as yet games for blind people and dozens of other items some useful some recreational one of the ai had followed jack to the bedroom entrance jack turned to it the imago he said very softly shouldnt it be manifesting itself his heart battered his chest hard he felt a great fear and awe it was as if he would soon be in the presence of the living god he did not know if he could endure such an experience his flesh would become wax and would melt in the terrible light and heat he looked at tappy and drought he saw for a second something stirring in her something no human eyes could look upon without being seared why doesnt it wake her up he said softly his voice trembled part of his fear was the knowledge that she would no longer be the tappy he had known she would be a fleshly tool of the imago what do you mean me ai said it die imago should awaken her when it awakens i dont know why the ai said it added theres no guarantee that the woman will have matured even though she may think shes seven years older her body might not or her subconscious may not be fooled or the imago may perceive the truth can you give her a shot of somediing to make her wake up its better to allow her to awake naturally at that moment tappy turned onto her back jack said for gods sake her nightgown revealed the top half of her breasts between them was a bulge the size of a large egg the tight and dark red skin over it looked as if it were about to burst around it at its base was a purplish swelling a yellowish liquid shone on its surface and diat oozed out even as jack stared at it he strode to her bedside and reluctantly touched the skin on top of the bulge it was feverhot her forehead felt hot too though it was cooler than the bulge the egg the honker inserted he said its infected no its just grown the ai said it put a finger on the bulge and then on tappys forehead notice how much weight she seems to have lost in the last few hours the eggs grown so fast its sucked energy from her the whole process probably involves an enormous expenditure of energy she should be all right as soon as the process is completed what does tiiis mean for tappy despite the ais reassurance jack was certain that she was sick and that she could die from the disease i do not know it must be part of the imagos maturing process or hers or both or it could have nothing to do with the imago well have to wait and observe piers anthony and philip jose farmer tappy though still sleepingor unconscious from the fever jerked that was followed by a twitching of her hands which then became motionless her eyelids fluttered but did not open then a line redder than the rest of the skin appeared on the very top of the bulge one end was pointed toward her chin the other toward her navel then the break gaped like two thin lips a few seconds later it extended itself for a half inch on each side of the bulge revealing something dark greenish below it then the line very quickly ran down both sides and disappeared into the purplish fester we have to do something jack cried we can only wait and observe the line bisecting the skin gap on the top widened slightly the greenish round thing pushed upward a trifle the ai standing by jack touched his shoulder he looked up and then behind him as the ai gestured to him a haze just beyond the entrance was clearing it cleared revealing a female ai it walked in swiftly and stopped a few feet from jack before speaking with the usual emotionless tones of the androids if it had been human it would have screamed out the news the gaol have found us chapter a flurry of questions surged through jacks mind could they flee again obviously not or the ai would have done so could they fight the gaol same answer could they talk the gaol wit of it unlikely jack realized that their ploy to age tappy in her fancy so as to evoke the imago immediately no longer mattered the imago might be awake or it might still be asleep either way the gaol had won because they had closed in too soon there just hadnt been time he sighed this was the part he hated then do what you have to do he told the ai and what is that destroy us both so the imago will be freed to seek another host its the only way we can foil the gao now we are unable to do that jack was perversely annoyed what do you mean unable you told me that you would do it to prevent the imago from falling into gao power theres very little time left so do it now while you can the scene was fading or changing the exotic vegetation he had first seen from the stations window appeared around them the ai assumed better definition and became the voluptuous creature he had named candy no no why because we no longer serve the imago we have been taken over by the gaol and are now agents of the empire jack saw the awful logic of it naturally the gaol knew how to handle the ai they had nullified those androids at the outset before physically taking over the station maybe they had managed to deceive the ai about their approach so diat the ai piers anthony and philip jose farmer thought they had more time than they did jack came to a sudden terrible decision then ill do it he turned toward tappy hoping dial he could bring himself to kill her barehanded one smash of her head against the floor could do it then they could do what they liked to him he didnt matter he saw that she now lay unceremoniously on the floor between the plants her book beside her he took a step but candy moved more swifdy than he thought possible and intercepted him suddenly he had an armful of phenomenal woman who was nevertheless not a woman at all she closed her arms around him and lifted him from the floor he felt her awesome power and knew that he was helpless she might look like a siren but she was also as deadly as one all right he gasped put me down im helpless she set him down so what happens now he asked he doubted that he would be able to distract her or change the course of the conquering gaol but he was casting about for anything that might conceivably make a difference now we wait for die arrival of the minion of the gaol oh you mean malva he said jokingly remembering the woman who had tempted and threatened him back on the honkers planet yes she is the human interface for the gaol no luck there he looked around whats happened here did the vision change the effect of the plants has been nullified by the gaol this is reality reality is a dream jack remembered that statement of the sleeptalking tappy suddenly it had new meaning could mis be just another dream a product of his own worry so dial the gaol had not captured them in that case all he had to do was change it he heard a small noise it was just a kind of plop he turned to tappyand stopped because now he saw that the eggthing on her chest had completed its hatching there was just a purple wound with yellowish froth something green was sliding rolling or scrambling away from her the hatchling candy dived for it but the thing scooted around one of the plants just eluding her grasp she tried to pursue it but it was lost what is it jack asked the caterpillars question we do not know but the artifacts of the honkers can have devious effects it is better to destroy it immediately too late for that jack said privately satisfied youd have to destroy the whole greenhouse to get it now she did not reply instead she went to tappy we shall cleanse and cover this injury she said it will not prevent the host of the imago from surviving and the gaol did want that host to survive so that the imago could not escape to occupy some other unknown host but here he was taking this vision literally again he needed to change it to something more acceptable to a dream in which the gaol were far away and the ai still served the imago he concentrated nothing changed but perhaps it would change when he slept as it had before except mat this last change had happened while he was awake and alert just as it would if reality were taking over damn then he realized that it didnt matter if this were merely another dream then the gaol were not here anyway there was no point in scaring himself he could believe anything he wanted good or bad but tappy would remain safe and maybe the imago would wake maybe all it needed was to be evoked to be called up imago he said i charge you wake we have dire need of you nothing happened candy was treating and bandaging tappy ignoring him she evidently took this dream seriously suppose this was reality if he gambled that it wasnt and did nothing tappy was doomed he had to assume that it was and search for any possible way to save her if he succeeded and it was real then tappy won if he failed and it was a dream tappy won only if he failed in reality did tappy lose even if he seemed to be succeeding in a dream so this was reality it was the only safe assumption despite the seemingly hopeless situation jack squatted and touched tappys hand imago wake there was still no response whatever it took to wake the imago this wasnt it unless its consciousness was linked to tappys tappy wake he cried squeezing her hand her eyes opened she smiled oh jack i see you he felt an electric thrill she saw him she was talking to him their ploy had worked piers anthony and philip jose farmer she sat up and she looked at candy and who is this woman you have aan injury jack said still elated over this success though her questions were awkward this is an ai android she is treating you tappy looked down oh it stings here is the bandage candy said let me apply it tappy lay back again allowing the treatment to proceed this wont interfere with our lovemaking will it jack the implanted memories she remembered five years of sexual activity with him what was he to say to that the injury wont interfere he said carefully but there is something else that will tappy the gaol have caught us and only the imago can get us free can youis itdid it wake with you she hesitated as if exploring her inner being no there is nothing tappy had been fooled but not the imago it was a pyrrhic victory how much better it would have been if it had been the imago instead of tappy who had gained the ability to see and speak it hardly matters a new voice said we have gained control jack turned startled there was malva the human minion of the gaol they had encountered on the honkers planet the woman they had tricked because she had not known about the honkers egg and its effect jack saw nothing to be gained by politeness you wouldnt have control you quisling if the imago had matured in time we are assuming that the imago has matured malva said didnt the androids tell you its nature no surely the ai knew but somehow in the rush of other things he had never thought to ask them directly so of course they had not told him it is a creature of extreme empathy any living entity with whom it associates closely becomes similarly empathic and transfers mis quality in turn to others though the effect diminishes with each transfer in due course it damps out but the presence of the imago continually renews it if it lives free the imago will in due course conquer the galaxy this is of course why the gaol oppose it empathy jack was bewildered how can that hurt the gaol the caterpillars question it does not hurt any creatures directly it merely changes them empire becomes impossible candy continued to work on tappy who was listening evidently she had not known this either i must be really dense jack said as i understand empathy it is merely a matter of identifying so closely with something else that you seem to fee its nature yourself you seem to project your personality into it you feel its feelings as your own thats nice for understanding but not much for blowing up enemy spaceships malva smiled you are indeed somewhat obtuse about this but this can be attributed to your primitive background do you mistreat oppress or exploit a person or creature for whom you feel empathy tappy for example no of course not then jack began to understand you mean the imago causes others to feel empathy for it so they wont hurt it no one can hurt the imago because it has no tangible essence it is eternal and invulnerable however it is true that others soon lose their inclination to mistreat whatever host the imago occupies but this is only part of it they develop general empathy for all living things and that changes their lives and it affects the gaol too jack exclaimed so they dont feel like exploiting other species precisely therefore the gaol take steps to prevent exposure of any other creatures to the imago it will be isolated for the lifetime of its current host but im with the imago jack said and candy and you weve all been exposed you have been exposed true the android is of course immune being without living tissue that is why the agents of the imago are able to kill its host if left to their own initiative they serve the imago in part by being unaffected by it i have not been exposed sure you have youre standing right here unless its range is pretty limitedand from what you say it isnt you probably have to be a mile away to be clear of it and you arent gaol policy is to allow no other creatures within the stellar system of the host of the imago though probably a lighthours distance is sufficient i am five lighthours distant like fun you are jack strode toward her ґ she did not move she merely watched him with a condescend fag smile he reached her and grabbed her armand his hand piers anthony and philip jose farmer passed through it without resistance amazed he grabbed for her with both arms finding nothing but air she simply wasnt there you are addressing my hologram malva said after a moment at the moment her face was right next to his and his arms were lost in the image of her body her voice seemed to come from her mouth your culture is too backward to be familiar with such things it is a projection in diree dimensions with sound it is a convenience of communication when direct personal contact is not desired as in this case jack had to accept the fact that she was not where she seemed to be he swept one hand through her apparent midsection one finger extended in a final gesture of contempt and backed off but die lightspeed limithow can you be five lighthours away to primitives the speed of light is an absolute limitation the gaol are not primitive thus when the ai city traveled fifty thousand lightyears instantly the gaols pursuit was limited by the speed of the search pattern not the speed of light our present dialogue is similarly unlimited jack realized that she had no reason to lie to him but still he hoped for some way out could he provoke her into providing it why are you wasting time talking to me he demanded if you have such power over us why dont you just put me out the airlock and seal up tappyt no tappy exclaimed candy had finished bandaging her and now she walked across to join him we have no intention of mistreating you in any way jack malva said it is true that we shall confine the host of the imago but you will be allowed to remain near her for your lifetime we shall if you wish conform the android to tappys likeness so that you will have suitable company and you wilt have all your material and intellectual needs met but youre going to put tappy in a coffin this is necessary yes the imago must not be allowed the freedom of even the ship but you are harmless if a ship will confine me why wont it confine her if it has to be why not confine us together because in past millennia the imago has proved to be remarkably adept at escaping confinement malva replied we have not ascertained exactly how it manages it but have verified mat complete immobility of the host in isolation is sufficient to confine it for the duration the caterpillars question well im not going to cooperate in the incarceration of tappy i u tear apart your ship piece by piece until i free her malva shrugged i think not suddenly there were bars in front of him jack turned and discovered that he was caged the chamber had been halved by a palisade of bars from ceiling to floor he was walled off from malvas image and from tappy and candy he grabbed the nearest barand received a formidable shock they were electrified but he still had his voice dont let them put you in their coffin tappy he cried tappy looked at him i will try to resist they dont want to hurt me because that might shorten my life span but the android is very strong jack had discovered that maybe thats the key tell them youll hurt yourself if they try to put you away you can do that before tappy malva said if you resist we will torture and kill jack tappy looked at jack then she spread her hands i will not resist but you must resist jack cried you cant let them salt the imago away for a lifetime tappy merely looked at him her tears flowing i love you jack and i love you he cried without thinking thats why they must not put you away she approached the bars and put her hands on them they did not shock her she put her face close to his and kissed him when he matched her on the other side these past five years with you have been so wonderful jack they will serve for a lifetimes memories go with candy i dont mind what form she takes so kmg as you are well treated she kissed him again and withdrew i am ready jack knew it would be useless to protest further tappy did love him and would not do anything to hurt him and that was why malva had talked to him to develop that leverage on tappy they were taking no chances at all with the confinement of the imago candy brought out what did indeed look like a coffin except that it was surrounded by equipment that surely was designed to preserve the life of die person within tappy climbed in and lay piers anthony and philip jose farmer down the nightgown did not seem to matter candy swung the lid down it was not a simple thing it was spiked inside like an iron maiden shell suffocate jack cried but even as he spoke he knew she would not there would be air piped in and nourishment and her bodily wastes would be piped out the seeming iron maiden was not a torture box but a mechanical maintenance device candy folded down clasps on the coffin and locked them in place now it was impossible for tappy to fight her way out even if she regained consciousnessand of course she would be drugged throughout then metallic walls formed around the coffin the plants in that vicinity disappeared whats that jack asked sure that he would not like the answer but unable to stop himself that is die formation of a spaceship the malva image answered the ai city station has been moved to a remote star and will be destroyed leaving only the isolation ship a gaol unit will keep it under continuous surveillance for the lifetime of die host which should be about a century since she is young the gaol empire will be preserved a detail filtered through this city will be destroyed but then what of me you will die with it of course but you told tappy i lied now the imago is secure and you are surplus there remains only the separation of the ship from the city and the destruction of the city with all its equipment all by remote control jack asked the numbness of the finality of defeat sinking in the gaol certainly were thorough no the confinement of the imago is too important to be done remotely a gaol will handle the concluding details no it wont jack said grasping what trifling fragment of victory he could because if it comes here it will be contaminated by the imago and you cant risk that true therefore the gaol individual too will be destroyed but one of the conquerors wouldnt sacrifice himself she shrugged believe what you will the gaol is now boarding the city and will perform the necessary chores now i bid you oblivion jack as my role here is terminated bitch jack screamed as she faded out candy walked across the chamber where are you going android he demanded the caterpillars question she did not pause to the portal to admit the gaol bring it back here and introduce us he called sarcastically when she was gone he turned to stare at the coffin he took hold of a bar to shake it but it shocked him again his arm was numbed he could not get close to tappy what was he to do he couldnt just give up yet there seemed to be no alternative chapter then he saw something it was small green and looked like a thicklegged spider no it was more like a tiny octopus it was crossing the floor toward him the hatchling he had forgotten it ordinarily such a creature would have revolted him but this thing had been with tappy and was formed mainly of her flesh he couldnt dislike that even if it was some honker joke also he did feel empathy for it and for life in general mava had been right about that much he squatted come here you little thing i wont hurt you im about to die anyway whats your business the thing approached his hand it extended a tiny tentacle and touched his finger jack felt a warmth it wasnt physical though it was emotional he felt an increasing awareness of the linkage of all things he was attuning to the exotic plants in the vicinity and felt their discomfort the gaol had established a field which suppressed their natural ambience and he felt tappy her consciousness fading as the drug slowly penetrated her system she was being forced into sleep but there were no dreams there the gaol did not trust the imago even to dream safely he looked at the hatchling he picked it up the thing assumed flesh color and disappeared against his palm youre doing it he exclaimed the empadiyyoure magnifying it are you the imago but as he considered the question he knew the answer the imago remained with tappy it would not leave her while she lived the hatchling was merely another agent of the imago of a different kind it was alive and it was mobile that trick of blending with his handwas that a signal of something more it had been green when it first manifested and the caterpillars question green when it had come to him jack moved to a green plant and set his hand against it letting the hatchling slide onto the leaf the hatchling turned green again matching the plant so perfectly that it disappeared quickly jack reached for it and found it where the leaf seemed to thicken it was solid but able to change its color and shape instantly he set it back on the floor which was metal gray in this section the hatchling became a perfectly matching gray as it flattened out it was a chameleon it had disappeared the first time when candy pursued it not entirely by hiding behind a plant but by blending with it so now he knew two things about it it magnified the empathy and it was very good at hiding but what good was either ability when tappy was locked away and the rest of the city was about to be destroyed if the honker who had planted this creature on tappy had intended to help her how had it expected her to overcome something like this because it was now apparent that the nullification of the gaols volition block had been the work of that egg as was tappys disappearance from the gaols tracking devices the egg had hatched and the hatchling had at least two other properties something else was neededand perhaps the honker had anticipated this situation also and the hatchling had what would be required jack reached down to pick up the hatchling but could not find it its camouflage was too good where are you little friend he asked the hatchling turned green again manifesting as it had before jace picked it up but how come you showed yourself to me before he asked it i never would have seen you otherwise then he realized that that was why it had wanted him to see it but why now when its too late sure we can be friends but soon were going to be dead do you have some way to rescue tappyt there was no answer just that overwhelming empathy the hatchling did not seem to be intelligent or to have any telepathic communication apparently it had responded to him because of die empathy it knew what he wanted just as he now knew what the surrounding plants wanted it knew he wanted to help tappy yet he hadnt wanted to see it when it came to him he hadnt known its nature and had forgotten about it after seeing it the first piers anthony and philip jose farmer time the hatchling had introduced itself to him by approaching and turning green didnt that indicate some separate understanding and decision on its part he reviewed the circumstance of that introduction it was just after candy had left so he was alone that made sense she had wanted to destroy it so it had waited until she was gone but if it wasnt intelligent how had it had the wit to do that to distinguish between her and him he had part of the answer candy was not alive and jack was so it could indeed distinguish them and probably avoided any moving thing that was not responsive to its power but the timinghow had it managed that well maybe it was programmed to hide as long as there was any hostile thing nearby whether living or dead so it could approach jack only when he was alone but the color changeit must have taken some wit to do that for him it could have come up to him unseen and worked its magic on him and he might never have realized that it was responsible for his suddenly broadening empathy it had made itself deliberately clear to him he went over the situation again candy walking out himself calling sarcastically after her bring it back here and introduce us then she was gone and the hatchling the hatchling had introduced itself it had responded to his desire for an introduction though his desire had been facetious the hatchling was not smart enough to distinguish the pretense from the reality mystery solved jack said much good may it do me i think that the honker just didnt realize how bad a situation we would be in it thought that maybe wed be in malvas hands and you would touch her and make her have empathy for us and help us escape instead were with an ai who is now ag agent of the gaol and cant be corrupted and were going to be blown to smithereens by a real live gaol then it dawned on him the gaol can you make it empathize and knew it could because the gaol feared the imago and the hatchling was helping the imago jack heard footsteps candy was returning stay cool hatchling he whispered to the imitation palm of his hand which mirrored even the lines and creases and slight variations of color this thing was good candy entered behind her rolled a weird machine it was blue with three wheels and three triangular handles like a huge trash the caterpillars question collector six little lenses circled it above the handles the top was a rounded dome there is the container for the host of die imago candy said indicating the enclosure around the coffin there is the human companion of the imago she indicated jack there is one other creature which hatched from an egg planted on the host it disappeared among the plants the machine rolled to a stop before the coffinenclosure the dome stretched upward becoming a column then turned at right angles something shiny appeared at its end a large lens it surveyed the enclosure jack realized with a shock that this was the gaol a seeming mead of machine and flesh a natural cyborg that wasnt just a lensit was an eye on a stalk the kind a snail had the six little lenses must be primitive eyes for general sensing in all directions wnile the big one handled the detail work time remaining until destruction fiftyfive minutes earth time candy said you bitch jack shouted you mean youve already set the bomb thats what took you the time just now she did not answer she was no longer responsive to him only to the gaol he couldnt insult her any more than he had been able to insult the image of malva then one of the triangular handles on the gaol unfolded the knob at its apex was actually a joint one leg of the triangle was the upper arm and the other was the forearm with a claylike mass on its end the clay sprouted fingers or tentacles and touched a panel on the enclosure the enclosure opened revealing the coffin inside the arm touched a fastening and it unfastened soon all the clasps were opened and a second arm unfolded to aid in lifting the lid the huge stalked eye peered inside yeah shes in there jack called outrage substituting for sense and now youre contaminated and will have to be destroyed how do you like that slugface the gaol lowered the lid and refastened the clasps evidently it couldnt be baited assuming it could even hear or understand him but surely it could hear because candy had spoken to it in english that language had been programmed here because it was what tappy understood and the gaol had not bothered to leprogram the ai why should they when the ai and all their worics were about to be destroyed piers anthony and philip jose fanner now the gaol rolled over to inspect jack followed by candy its eye oriented on him yeah im the freak from earth jack said he suffered a wild inspiration i have sometiiing for you he extended his arm carefully through the space between the charged bars the hatchling was now a green ball the gaol took the ball it oriented its eye on it the ball changed color matching the hue of die gaol it disappeared against the puttylike blue flesh would this work would the hatchling succeed in bringing empathy to the gaol captor or would the gaol simply destroy it thats the hatchling candy exclaimed the thing from the egg it may be dangerous the gaol ignored her it retracted its stalkeye and stood on its wheels thinking its own thoughts time remaining until destruction fifty minutes earth time candy said exactly as before she was on a countdown they had set the time bomb and she was now its readout the gaol remained immobile was it simply waiting for the countdown to be completed or was it responding to the hatchling the fate of the galaxy might depend on the answer minutes passed with no action time remaining until destruction fortyfive minutes earth time the gaol extended its eye stalk it oriented on candy there was a whistling sound it seemed to emanate from the creatures knobby elbow well sounds did not have to come from a mouth the gaol did not seem to have a mouth if the elbow contained vibratory apparatus so that it could whistle why not maybe it could whistle from all three elbows keeping in tune with itself maybe that was how it got its jollies jack realized that he was not making that up he was feeling empathy for the gaol too he was coming to understand it to a degree candy turned to jack the gaol wishes to converse with you i will translate for it so that elbow whistle was its way of communicating he would have found that considerably more interesting if his situation wasnt so desperate great jack said we can get to be friends while the clock the caterpillars question winds down then we can all be destroyed together the gaol whistled i am coming to understand your distress candy said i wish to make you more comfortable the empadiy was working i cannot be comfortable until tappythe imagois free again the whistle the imago will separate from diis unit at thirty minutes before destruction the imago will not be destroyed but thats not freedom jack protested thats the worst captivity for the rest of her life if dial separation is not effected the host of die imago will be destroyed with the rest that is not permitted i dont want the host destroyed either jack exclaimed i want tappy free it is not possible to defuse die bomb candy said for the gaol it will detonate on schedule jack realized how thorough uiis trap was even if the hatchling converted the gaol they would all be destroyed possibly the ai could have found a way out because diis was their city and they had centuries of experience but they now served the gaol unless there has to be a way he said desperately you candy you used to serve the imago can the gaol revert you so mat you serve the imago again the gaol whistled i have now reverted candy said just like dial jack wasnt sure he could believe it i will save the imago by destroying the host she continued no jack cried becoming a believer he had forgotten this aspect she paused at the gaols whistle there is no other escape for the imago jack death will free it then dont be in such a rush about it he said since this city is going to blow up anyway in half an hour fortyone minutes then you dont need to kill her just bring her out here with us and shell die when we do this is true she would have seemed surprised had she been human she walked to the enclosure and paused gaol may i open the ship and release the host the gaol whistled why do you need to ask jack demanded afraid that the gaol would change its mind havent you reverted to ai piers anthony and philip jose farmer i have jack she replied as she worked on the enclosure but the gaol retains authority and can cancel my reversion at any time it is better to verify so it was a spot nullification of the gaol program not a revocation of the whole the gaol might be becoming sympathetic to the imago but was not a fool a truly reverted ai might have turned immediately on the gaol and tried to kill it so i guess wed better talk jack said to the gaol he was privately amazed at what he was taking for granted but realized that the empathy could account for this whats your name the gaol lack names candy said as she swung the panels of the enclosure aside it is a concept confined to primitives well im primitive so i prefer names jack said will you answer to garth gaol he was being humorous again though he realized that humor was wasted on the others at least it helped him retain some semblance of sanity what does such a designation signify candy asked the coffin was now exposed again that you are masculine and understanding of human foibles jack said with a smile and that when i say garth i am addressing you or referring to you and no other entity it is a convenience for dialogue when more than two creatures are present i will answer to garth candy agreed for the gaol she lifted the lid of the coffin garth what are your present feelings i wish to enable you and the imago to achieve satisfaction why because jack remained wary of dangerous confusion empathy was fine but an alien definition of satisfaction could be treacherous just as candys idea of saving the imago had been to kill tappy if the creature could state a convincing rationale maybe he could trust it there was no response after a moment jack caught on and said why garth he saw that tappy was now sitting up looking dazed the drugs would take time to wear off because jack the facilitator is enhancing the rate of my corruption by the imago causing a conversion which would ordinarily require approximately twentyfour hours to occur in as many minutes the creature has the substance of the host of the imago therefore is dedicated to that host and tiirough it the imago thus it enhances the power of the imago to bring empathy to those it contacts the process is not yet complete in my case the caterpillars question but the first stage of the conversion is the instillation of the will to be converted so i am accepting it rather than destroying the facilitator and proceeding with my duty this was more of an answer than jack had anticipated the hatchling is the facilitator it facilitates whatever is of interest toto the person whose flesh has provided its substance then after another pause i direct the question to you garth the gaol had taken his instruction about the use of the name in a rather literal and limited sense that is its nature jack we were aware that such creatures existed but not aware that they existed on what you call the honkers planet perhaps it is an import such a creature acting in conjunction with the imago is a strategic masterstroke it makes the imago infinitely more dangerous to die empire so the honker had indeed known what he was doing except that they were shortly due to be blown up how much time till destruction candy he asked morbidly interested thirtysix minutes destruction tappy asked we have encountered aa special situation jack told her ill explain it in a bit this is garth gaol whom we may consider to be a friend he hoped just relax tappy did so ministered to by candy he returned to the gaol garth can you tell us how to save the imago and ourselves i mean without killing the host of the imago ordinarily i could do so jack but at present i am distracted by the process of conversion i am also losing my capability to think and act with precision and force because of the increasing constraints placed upon me by empathy with diose who would suffer the consequences of such action this too was interesting you mean die gaol dominate the galaxy because they lack empathy because they dont care about the suffering of those tiiey subjugate the gaol did not answer but it wasnt necessary of course it was true it was true historically on earth too power was grasped by those who had least sensitivity to the harm they did to others this was probably the root of the saying nice guys finish last empathy might not be the same as conscience but the effects could be similar something else registered candy didnt you say that the imago was supposed to be separated from this city thirty minutes piers anthony and phiiip jose farmer before destruction so that the host of the imago would not be destroyed yes jack so that things not just an enclosure its a spaceship that is true jack it is the isolation ship for the imagos host will it hold more than just the coffin i mean other people yes jack how much more i mean could we hitch a ride in it it is capable of supporting the lives of three sentient beings as represented here three jack was taken aback he had in mind rescuing all four of them tappy himself garth gaol and candy because if they all piled into that ship and took off the watching gaol station would not see anything amiss it was supposed to separate to establish the imagos utter isolation then the city could explode on schedule and it would be assumed that everyone was dead except tappy it was a way out damn he said someones going to have to be left behind why jack because there are four of us he snapped only three can escape in that ship but only three of us are alive jack you may leave me behind she was not alive of course that did reduce it to three but by the same token you can come along he said you wont be using any air or water or food and we need you to take care of tappy i mean the host for the imago this is true jack well then lets do it how much time do we have until separation two minutes jack and here he had been wasting time on details while their deadline was overhauling them naturally the emotionless ai had not been screaming warning get us all on board that ship now the gaol must authorize that garth you must authorize it the gaol whistled candy went into action at blurring speed she lifted tappy out of her coffin and resnapped the fastenings then she touched a button somewhere and the bars blocking jack disappeared he ran to the ship and the gaol rolled beside him tappy was now standing in the ship seeming to have suffered no the caterpillars question debilitation from her brief session in die coffin there were not even any marks on her however the lifesupport devices attached they did not seem to have punctured her skin close it up jack cried get this crate into the air candy paused the lifesupport container is already closed jack i do not understand the remainder of your directive he definitely had to watch that vernacular i mean the ship do what you have to do to get this ship safely sealed and separated on schedule candy resumed her blurring motion the panels closed and internal light came on it seemed like closing a wooden crate from the inside but it was a metallic spaceship separation candy announced jack looked around shouldnt we get into acceleration couches or something why jack oh inertialess drive of course they had crossed the galaxy without any feeling of acceleration why should this little ship be different then can we look out a portal to see where were going why jack im primitive remember i just feel easier and i think tappy would feel easier if we could see outside of course jack candy said in the manner of one humoring a child the opaque panels became transparent they could now see out in every direction in fact the whole ship was transparent it was as if everything were made of glass including the motor assuming it had one then jack realized with a start that the four of them were transparent too and almost invisible against the backdrop of the central core of the ship once again galactic science had surprised him thank you he said inadequately he took tappys hand and led her to the curving wall they looked out there was the city already drifting away below them from this vantage it looked like a giant globe he had thought of it as a blinking dome back on the honkers planet perhaps half of it had been under the ground the host must eat candy said the preservation unit is no longer sustaining her the foods all me same isnt it jack asked i mean nutritionally regardless what it looks tastes and feels like so bring us candy bars piers anthony and philip jose farmer this is a confection in my present image candy asked perplexed jack laughed close but no cigar i do not understand even tappy smiled then jack explained about candy bars soon an approximation was produced it looked a bit like something left behind by a sick dog and tasted somewhat like oysters steeped in chocolate and it squished suggestively as they bit into it but it would do tappy nudged him lets find a bed she murmured yes so you can rest he agreed in the normal manner without being sealed in a box so we can make love she smiled in die normal manner without being rushed we are the only human beings here there were those five years of sexual relations again implanted in her memory what was he going to do he didnt dare tell her the truth because that might not only hurt her feelings deeply it might cause die imago to retreat if dial was possible would garth gaol then revert to his nonempathy state and do what was best for die empire it couldnt be risked he hated lying or even evading the trudi with tappy but he knew he shouldnt do what she so innocently wished she now thought of herself as twenty which was old enough but she remained thirteen which was the greater evil the lie or more statutory rape the worst of it was that he did feel the stirring of desire his emotional state was in flux somewhere between fancy and love and her new ability to see and talk increased his feeling for her so did his heightened empadiy it now seemed natural to follow dirough with sexual expression but he knew it was not he had to stall youve been through so much tappy the the egg hatched and it drew substance from you which you have to restore then you were confined in the gaols box we feared it was for life but widi the help of the hatchling we managed to change garth gaols mind youve been in and out of something like suspended animation you need to rest and recover your equilibrium yes and mat is always so much easier in your arms after we have made love he was getting nowhere but maybe he could avoid it anodier way this was a tiny spaceship there shouldnt be anything like a double bed on it candy he called can you fix us up with the caterpillars question a wide soft bed of course jack she did something and the glassy interior of the ship convoluted now there was a glassy mattress behind them tappy sat on it widi a muted squeal of delight drawing him down with her jacks crisis of conscience intensified tappy had gone without resistance into the coffin in the belief that this would save jack and cause him to be well treated she had been ready to suffer her most terrible fate and to let him go to the arms of a pseudowomanbecause of her generous love for him and how had he returned that love by deceiving her by having her drugged and by doctoring her memoriesand by denying her what she most wanted oh tappy he said turning his face to her she remained glassy he could see right through her head but this startling effect did not change her outline or his burgeoning feelings i wish he was cut off by her kiss and suddenly it was as it had been back on earth the first time when he had tried to comfort her and been swept into sex widi her he did love her and what else mattered they broke the kiss her hands went to his clodiing she showed experience in thisthe experience of five years something caught his eye tappylook they looked the spherical city was flying apart in a moment the major fragments separated and separated again until there was nodiing but an outwardflying sphere of debris it reminded him of the remnant of a supernova only this was on a far smaller scale then that sphere became smoky and then it faded soon nothing remained but haze and finallynothing the ai station was no more now belatedly jack realized that they were hardly safe yet they were alive instead of dead and tappy was free and conscious instead of in a comalike state but this ship was supposed to remain isolated in this stellar system with no visitors and there was a gaol warship or equivalent standing guard how were they going to get to anywhere where the imago could do any good now diere were tears on tappys face the agents of the imagothey were good to me she said i never saw them except for candy just now i only heard them and felt uiem but they did so much for me it was long ago yet still then her brow furrowed it was seven years ago i remember i was blind piers anthony and philip jose farmer and lame but they helped me to see and walk without limping then you and i went to a nice planet with a wonderful little house and garden and oh its as if we just made love all the time after the first two years when you said i was too young but broke you down finally when i was fifteen and proved i was old enough then we just did it and did it and it was always so perfect i hardly remember anything else but then suddenly we were back in the ai city in space and i dont remember how that happened and the eggjack there was no egg before i was stung by the honker and it helped save us from the gaol but then the swelling faded away did another now jack appreciated the monstrous gaps they had left in her memory of those fictional seven years no mention of the egg at all how could they have forgotten to account for that and the seeming return to the ai stationthere should have been a rationale for that too they had thrust her unprepared into a situation both old and new no wonder she was confused he had to patch over it somehow so he started talking extemporaneously hoping to satisfy her because her doubt could be the destruction of them all he had to convince the imago too if it had any sentience of its own the fate of the galaxy might depend on that tappy youre right theres been a lot of confusion we did go to that garden planet and it was great and we thought it would last forever but the gaol had never given up searching for us we were there to give the imago time to mature and to give you time to get to know me really well so that when the imago manifested you and it would work with me for the good of the galaxy the ai said that otherwisethe imago is so powerful a force that great evil could come if things were not right when it matured so we werent really doing what we thought i mean we werent there just to have fun we knew it would have to end when the imago came he paused to take a breath and to gauge her reaction she was gazing raptly at him he was giving her a perspective that helped to shape her scattered memories and impressions and actually he wasnt lying he was just interpreting because the basic purpose was as he was saying only the time span differedand in her mind that time was all there so then the imago did mature he continued and at the same time the eggwe had thought it was just a sting or something but apparently it was a tiny egg that was timed to grow and mature the caterpillars question the same time the imago did so it could helpit grew big and hatched and the hatchling turned out to be a little chameleonlike creature that can greatly facilitate the effect of the imago the imago isis empathy for every living thing animal and plant every type of creature and it really can save the galaxy because a gaol with empathy for others is a decent person the way garth is you carry supreme empathy with you tappy yes she breathed lying back on the bed and drawing him down with her i feel it oh i feel it always a little but now overwhelmingly her hands drew him in tell me more about it while you make love to me jack had hoped she would forget about that but it didnt matter he knew he was going to do it she really was old enough now not just because of her phantom seven years but because the imago made her more fully adult than any normal person could ever be but with the arrival of the imago he continued stroking her body touching her small breasts on either side of the bandage through her nightie came also the gaol they had not been able to find us until then but they zeroed in on the imago as if it had been only a few days the ai had to fetch us to try to keep us safe in a hurry we had to leave everything behind even your favorite teddy bear im sorry about that but the gaol came to the ai station too just as the imago and the hatchling came the gaol took over the station maiva manifested looking exactly as she did seven years ago and just as mean and forced you into the coffin i mean the tappy touched his lips with one hand stop jack you have caught up to the present im relieved was afraid that something awfully wrongthat maybe it would turn out to be all a dream that you didnt love me after all oh tappy i do love you doubt all else but dont doubt that that much he could say with sincerity now i dont doubt it she murmured now lets make love yes relieved and flush with his burgeoning emotion jack got off the bed and stripped his clothing he had made the dream real for her and saved the situation whatever parts of it were lies he could at least make this much true he owed it to herand he wanted to do it he lay down beside her and touched her body again and discovered that she had fallen asleep chapter now we must have a council of war jack said hours later when he and tappy were rested let me be sure i have it straight candy has a great deal of specific knowledge about the imago but no real initiative she acts on the directives of the imago as relayed through its host or someone designated by the host in this case me this is true candy said and garth has a great deal of knowledge about the gaol and their empire and about the mechanics and organization of their space vessels but his newfound empathy for other living things has played havoc with his concentration and in any event he was not a decisionmaker he was a technician deemed to be expendable so he too lacks initiative the gaol whistled that is correct candy said but we do all want to serve the interests of the imago to the best of our abilities jack said so since i seem to be the one with initiative and tappy trusts me is it agreed that i serve as temporary leader of this group garth whistled what is a leader a creature who acts as the originator of the actions taken by the group as the guide for others to follow the one with initiative there was no response so jack prompted it garth agreed the gaol whistled candy agreed tappy i love you jack smiled he was still slightly startled to hear tappy talking she was quite pretty now with her face clear and her hair nicely the caterpillars question done candy was taking excellent care of the host of the imago and for whatever reason tappy did look older her breasts showed more clearly under her sweater and there was an aura of maturity about her she had the attitude of adult confidence apart from that yes agreed of course she glanced sidelong at him now will you initiate a kiss for me you arent going to try to seduce me again and fall asleep before we get there she shook her head smiling no jack he leaned over and kissed her that had really worked out well last night he had not denied tappy she had denied him and he still wasnt guilty of another statutory rape but he knew that he would not luck out that way again and wasnt sure he wanted to they were far from earth now and no one else cared about the detail of age certainly the conversion of the galaxy was more important than the precise timing of an act of love between two creatures still his earthly inhibitions remained so he loved and desired tappy and yet also felt guilty for those feelings irrational as that might be at least not right now tappy added crossing her legs so that her thighs showed under her skirt her legs too seemed to have added flesh if she intended to incite his interest she was succeeding she must have had considerable experience in this and learned exactly how to push his buttonsin her seven years of fantasy maybe her empathy because of the wakening of the imago enabled her to understand his desire in a way she otherwise would not have had it really been only three or four daysor had it been seven years and the brevity of the time span was his fantasy he looked at candy who was now quite demurely clothed her former sex appeal damped down she would knowbut could he trust her answer if this were another dream she would respond in the manner required by the dream which might have no relation to the truth jack shook himself there was no profit in such speculation he still had to assume that this was reality and make it work as reality this presented a considerable challenge all right so here we are in isolation the only free folk in this stellar system with a gaol empire ship standing guard five piers anthony and philip jose farmer lighthours away to blast any intruder into oblivion what happens if we try to make this ship leave this system garth nothing the gaol whistled it is incapable of interstellar travel then suppose we make it travel toward the gaol ship then when the gaol did not answer he added when i look directly at you when speaking as i am doing now this has the same effect as naming you it would take this ship several earth years to traverse that distanceand when it did the gaol ship would simply move away across the system in one hop so we can neither escape this system nor approach the gaol ship jack concluded how then can we accomplish our purpose he looked at garth who had no answer so he looked at candy we can bring the gaol to us candy said they will come if the host of the imago requires attention say you are capable of original thought after all jack exclaimed no only of assessing prospects in a given situation when required to do so she clarified the ai have become proficient at avoiding the attention of the gaol and therefore know what draws that attention still im glad we brought you along you are good for tappy and perhaps good for the mission this is my purpose in existence she reminded him it was no use trying to compliment the emotionless ai so what is the best way to bring the gaol ship to us he asked by best i mean to take into consideration brevity of time concealment of our motive and our chances of converting its personnel to empathy i am unable to assess these values with competence jack looked at garth are you yes it would not be wise to try to bring the full ship here as it would apply stasis to this craft and investigate it in detail from a secure distance any living creature who boards this ship or who approaches closer to it than one lighthour will be destroyed after completing its business you have a point jack agreed the big ship is not going to let us near it but how about a small shipor a robot ship could we take over that and use it without the big ship knowing the caterpillars question i could accomplish this garth agreed and because its a robot ship with no living creatures aboard to be corrupted they may not even check it jack continued now candywhat can you do to make them worry about the security of the imago host without alarming them enough to take precautions we couldnt circumvent a minor equipment failureperhaps a malfunctioning sensor suggesting that there is no problem but the sensor is giving a false indication a robot ship would routinely but promptly replace the sensor the gaol leave little to chance garth can you cause a sensor to malfunction do you know which one is minor enough to generate no real alarm yes yes and is there room on such a robot repair ship for the four of us no jacks heart sank for three two no no one jack asked despairingly their plan was coming apart already no not even one then how can we use the robot ship we can remove its robot and substitute one of us oh and then that one can convert the gaol battlewagon singlehanded and return here to rescue the others jack said yes he would have to watch that irony these creatures tended to take him literally which one tappy yes only the imago can convert the ship and she is the host she must take the facilitator because she will not be able to maintain close contact with any personnel for the requisite time but tappy knows nothing of a gaol ship jack protested she would get lost or caught immediately my empathy indicates that your argument is specious garth whistled you do not desire to risk the host because of your special feeling for her right on target but jack realized that if this was the only way out and they didnt try it their alternative would be to float here forever in space leaving the imago as effectively isolated as the gaol intended maybe they could set up another dream realm and have it a lifetime of love on a garden planet but that wouldnt do the galaxy any good piers anthony and philip jose farmer the host must be confined in the lifesupport container when the robot comes candy said otherwise the robot will know as it approaches and uses its detail scanners that something serious is wrong and will withdraw and send an alarm before making physical contact then tappy cant be the one to go jack said feeling mixed frustration and relief she must be confined until the robot boards then unconfined after it has been incapacitated garth whistled jack saw that it had to be he could not let his personal feeling for tappy which was romantic interfere with the mission of the imago it was that mission which had brought them to this realm of superscience he had been close to tappy from the time he first met her and the ambience of the imago had been working on him all this time he had to do what was best for it they worked on tappy for the next several hours drilling her on die interior of the gaol guard ship which it seemed was similar to the one in which they had first encountered malva garth clarified that the robot would dock at a special port where it would be cleaned in vacuum so she would have to wear a space suit but because that area did not have life sensors she would be ignored by the machines and could make her way inside there she would have to remove the suit but retain a face mask because the ship was pressured with gaol atmosphere that she couldnt breathe but you are breathing our air jack protested am not i am wearing a transmutation filter garth unfolded an arm to tap himself at his base between the wheels jack had assumed that this was part of the creatures transmission since the axles for the wheels projected from it but realized that he had been anthropomorphizing men did not breathe from their bases but it seemed that the gaol did and of course they did not use the same kind of air they were alien creatures maybe the honkers could share air with the human beings that was why both species lived on the honker planet but that must be a rarity of compatibility he just hadnt tiiought about it before what about malva then she hadnt worn a mask but she hadnt been in the company of any gaol either she probably had her own sealed atmospheric chamber he really had taken too much for granted he returned to the present situation once tappy was aboard the big ship she would have to make her way to the nexus gaol the caterpillars question or what jack called die captain she would use the facilitator to corrupt that individual and then he would help her corrupt the rest of the ship jack didnt argue about the term corrupt he knew that garth did not mean any affront but how could tappy ever accomplish such a thing the odds were against her there were so many things that could go wrong what are the odds he demanded grimly then he had to explain to them what he meant candy and garth held a dialogue and came to agreement the odds of the hosts success in this endeavor are approximately one in three but if she fails the odds are nine to one that die host will be dead and the imago will be free that too is success so the endeavor taken as a whole is worthwhile great jack said sick at heart if i am to leave you perhaps forever tappy said i want to make love widi you one last time of course jack said numbly but when they went to the bed the specter of her death loomed so large in his mind that he was impotent it was as if he were sending her into it and somehow it seemed that if he renounced this part of it she would not suffer the other part im sorry tappy he said i know i feel your guilt and sorrow just hold me that much he could do if i do not return she said after a while you must take candy as your lover it will not mean anything to her but it will help you to forget i dont want to forget he exclaimed you would not be here except for me i could not live or die in peace if i left you to the emotions you now feel promise me that you will take her i promise he said because otherwise she would have been even more unhappy and it would be his fault there were ways in which this newly adult tappy was harder to accept than the lame blind child had been then they slept embraced but without great solace they set it up tappy gave jack the hatchling which had come back to her after converting garth it was able to eat human food because its flesh was from a human being she returned to the coffin and candy locked her in then garth selected a sensor and sent a piercing whistle through it jack was aware of no piers anthony and philip jose farmer change but both garth and candy assured him that the sensor was now malfunctioning and would attract the attention of the monitoring ship they assumed their stations since no one was supposed to be aboard the isolation ship except tappy they had to hide in shielded areas so that their life forces would not be detected by the robot jacks station was by the entrance port he would use a tiny wire garth had provided to nullify the robots programming switch from behind then garth would fix the sensor and tappy would take the hatchling and enter the other ship in lieu of the robot then they would wait perhaps for a long time suddenly a small alarm sounded for the approach of a body in space this was in order the robot would pick up that alarm and know that the isolation ship was functioning properly despite the one bad sensor the robot ship was not velocity limited it had passed from the master ship to the isolation ship almost instantaneously but the final approach was slower so that the locks could be merged though the robot did not require atmospheric pressure the isolation ship was pressured for the sake of the drugged host and that pressure and composition would be maintained throughout the lock openedand a man stepped through jack gaped it was supposed to be a robot what had happened his little wire was useless because the man had no external programming switch and he was not alone there was the sound of footsteps behind him the man turned and saw jack his eyes seemed to widen in similar surprise his mouth opened to cry warning to his companion jack threw the hatchling it struck the man on the forehead and clung quickly fading out of sight then jack ducked around the man and flung himself into the other ship hoping to catch the second man by surprise he did he plowed right into the other wrapped his arms around him and bore him down jack scrambled to put a hand on the others chest to hold him down long enough to look at and discovered that it was a woman her face was petite and her chest was embarrassed jack removed his hand i dont suppose you speak my language he asked we are programmed for the language of die host of the imago she replied the caterpillars question and i dont suppose i can trust you not to attack me if i let you up we are not attack androids we are maintenance personnel oh no wonder it had been so easy she had not fought him at all then something else registered androidsyou mean youre not alive we are not alive she agreed and you could lift me off you with one hand like this she grasped him by the belt and lifted him into the air with one hand but you obey the directives of living creatures he cried desperately we do well im a living creature you must obey my directives of course what are they first put me down then vacate your ship then signal the home ship that all is well she put him down she got to her feet she walked to the other ship there stood the android man give me the hatchlingunharmed jack directed him because of course the hatchling had had no effect he had to describe the hatchling the man reached up to strip something from his forehead he handed it to jack the hatchling did not seem to be harmed jack realized that this arrival of the androids instead of the robot was better than what they had anticipated not only did this allow two individuals to return with the ship one of them could be a humanseeming woman without causing any alarm after that it was easy physically tappy emerged from the coffin and she and garth took the places of the two androids with garths direct guidance they judged that the odds of success were now three to one in their favor the locks sealed and the ships separated jack settled back to wait he was now the only living thing in the isolation ship but the three others looked human and would obey his directives he would be fine if he could just keep his mind from the challenges facing tappy since he couldnt do anything about them at the moment there was no point dwelling on them he needed to distract himself say do you folk want to learn to play strip poker he inquired brightly chapter jack had never felt so lonely like most creative people he did not suffer from isolation for long periods not as long as he could paint or read thoughtstimulating books but tappy was gone and he might never see her again he felt as if he were a lone figure standing in the middle of a surrealist painting say in one of salvador dalfs white plains stretching toward a horizon much farther away than earths a tiny figure the only human being on a vast malignant world nothing terrestrial existed there except him he could walk forever with only increasing loneliness for a companion though black depression might also join him since her ship had gone ten minutes had dripped as if from a stalactite when it had disappeared seemingly erased from this continuum it was like his heart had been anchored to the ship and had been ripped out when it had shot away that was of course poetic exaggeration but it came close to expressing his agony at her departure he paced back and forth passing by the three androids they stood without moving their eyes open and unblinking after a while unless he ordered them to do something they would seem to be furniture his imagination worked hard to envision what garth and tappy could be doing now but it was like an ancient roman slave pushing on a huge grindingwheel spoke it just went around and around and the pushing got heavier every minute he tried to think of something else the imago what could its true nature be how had it originated it seemed to be some sort of divine entity but as far as he knew it had no mind or in fact a body no material body anyway what was it a chip off gods block what did that phrase mean nothing a child of god or a special envoy or a mani the caterpillars question festation of god but manifestation was just a word which signified nothing in this situation it was a word to conceal ignorance just as most words in philosophy or in theology masked lack of knowledge about reality but tappy had murmured in her sleep reality is a dream i give up he said loudly he began weeping after several seconds he quit and he dried his eyes he felt better then though not much better suddenly glass shattered without sound around him there was no glass but it seemed as if there had been sharp things without edges pierced him the largest thing a piece a shard whatever it was slanted through his brain bringing light with it then the glass evaporated through the broad but at the same time thin triangular space left by the passage of the glass light poured into the wound the light expanded like a nuclear fireball then divided into two photonic amoebas one was still in his head one seemed to hang before his eyes through the latter he saw tappy then she moved from directly in front of his vision no whatever he was seeing through had moved she turned toward him and looked into his eyes but her face was expressionless she did not see him he cried out tappy as if she could hear him her lips moved and he could hear her the words were somewhat blurred but it was evident that they were not addressed to him immediately thereafter the clearness of the vision faded a ripple passed through it then all he saw was wrinkled and distorted tappy and the offwhite wall behind her and some partially revealed machines and instruments behind her stretched out as if they had been painted on a rubber band being pulled out lengthwise he realized that he was seeing part of the interior of the gaol spaceship to which she and garth had gone they had gotten into it though just where they were and what their situation was he could not tell suddenly the scene seemed to be squeezed on both sides making tappy and the machines tall and thin that state held for several seconds before abruptly becoming normal he realized that whoever or whatever the transmitter was it was having trouble controlling the output he was in some kind of telepathic communication with tappy no not communication it was a oneway transmission but definitely via a medium he had not believed could exist telepathy piers anthony and philip jose farmer then he no longer saw her he was looking at the gaol cyborg garth and he was hearing human voices and clicking sounds the hatchling it was his transmitter it had been on garth allowing a view of tappy from garths vantage then the hatchling had leaped from it to somewhere ah now he knew it was on her shoulder her hand and part of her arm had risen to block partially his view then dropped by means jack would never know the hatchling was showing him what it saw and heard through its peculiar receptors and transmitter or was the imago doing this with the hatchling as its transmitter but how and who did not matter being and doing did he stood for a long time almost as motionless as the androids near him while he watched tappy had turned about one hundred degrees to the left she and garth were at one end of a large room men and women in loose green robes were seated at desks and consoles many of these bore threefootwide square crystals their faces bore strange symbols and images most of mem seemed to be operated by verbal commands once a crystal extruded part of its face in the shape of a human hand with one finger the finger bent to point back to the screen its operator spoke and the hand sank back and became one with the face of the block what kind of computer was that large green vines festooned with huge manycolored flowers and clusters of berries covered the ceiling and parts of the walls since jack could not smell them he supposed that the hatchlings telepathic powers did not include odor the vegetation was primarily to supply oxygen and secondarily to relieve the sterility and monotony of bare walls the room vanished he swore was this to be the end of the transmission several minutes passed during which he paced back and forth had something bad happened to tappy and the hatchling or did telepathy demand so much energy that the hatchling could no longer project the view what what as suddenly as it had gone the scene was back but the hatchling seemed to be on top of tappys head now he saw that two of the berry stems on the wall just ahead of tappy no longer bore a berry also one berry was halfeaten for several seconds he did not realize the implication then he struck his right palm with his left fist the caterpillars question of course the hatchling like all creatures had to have food it had leaped to the cluster and eaten its fill though jack had seen no mouth on it it had one or it ingested as an amoeba did he also knew now that the creature could not see or hear as tappy and garth did it used their brains and eyes to transmit what they saw and heard he was looking through tappys eyes hearing through her ears when the hatchling was on garth it functioned as it did on tappy he should have understood that before now but he was somewhat numb from the shock of the unexpected transmission tappy and garth began to stroll across the room some operators glanced up at them nobody made a move toward or questioned them the two intruders were regarded as part of the crew though some may have wondered why the woman was not in uniform however the crew might know only what their duties were they might not even know why the ship was located here or what its overall mission was tappy and garth went through a door into another large room this contained several vast transparent cases at least sixty feet high in each of which spun an upright cylinder jack had no idea what their function was but they made a loud humming noise the two intruders approached a door at the opposite end of the room two guards bipedal cyborg gaol stood on each side of it they were eight feet high fourarmed and plated like knights their helmets had halfopen visors concealing the face but showing large glowing eyes two hands on their right sides gripped the barrel of a weapon with a disk at its end they did not move when garth led tappy past them and along the wall beyond them then he stopped and his wheels turned to face the wall a huge window was set in it and tappy could see into the next room jack realized at once that it was the control center of the ship it was not all the instruments and flashing varicolored lights and crystal display blocks and the intensity of the operators that made that certain it was the creature in the center of die room hesheit whatever it was was sitting if its posture could be called sitting on a slowly rotating wide disk on top of a narrow pillar six feet high the edge of the disk almost touched the upper end of a long narrow ramp a fourlegged being would prefer a ramp to a staircase piers anthony and philip jose farmer my god jack said the tfiing on the disk must be the true the basic the real gaol the being in its natural form garth and the other gaol he had seen were cyborgs their naturally endowed bodies reconstructed to be gaolmachines some had bodies in which part of their skin was exposed others were entirely armorplated these would be lowerclass gaol an oppressed class with no right to object to being made half machine or perhaps they had volunteered in any event weird as it was the captains body was what evolution had given it it looked like a giant ratcage with a head two arms and four doglike legs its organs were suspended in a sac inside the cage the sac filled threefourths of the cage its two very long humanoid arms anchored by a thick framework of bone on the front end of the sac had copperish skin the neck projecting from the sac was long and thick and molded purplish the head was a caricature of a human beings start with the bottom of the gaol that was a turtles lower plate almost six feet long from the sides rose long curving ribs that merged with a spine arcing from die rear of die plate to its front the blimpshaped sac was attached to the spine with muscles jack could clearly see through the copperish skin enclosing them when the gaol was momentarily before a bright light on me wall vague shapes were silhouetted in the sac its organs no doubt the bottom of the sac rested on a thick fleshy pad attached to the plate the neck extended horizontally from the front of the sac through a wide opening in the front ribs the head it had almost no forehead and the cranium had no room for even a small brain jack guessed mat me brain was in the sac brutal and fierce described the face the jaws projected to form a mouth like a sharks its open mouth revealed a multitude of tiny but very sharp triangular teeth set in three rows it had no tongue there were three nostrils on the end of the beastish head two below and one above the top one was covered by a small flap of skin that blew in and out though not smoothly and at regular intervals jack could not hear it but thought that it was communicating by whistling its morsecodelike words through that nostril at right angles above the jaws was a broad plane of bone in which were set two large quite humanlooking eyes these were the caterpillars question blue the ears resembled chrysanthemums what kind of a planet could have originated such a creature it could not be an earthlike world after staring through the window at the ghastly being garth rolled toward the two guards tappy followed it until garth whisded at her and gestured at her to wait for him then he lifted two extensions and shot the guards with a ray from each the green beams cut off die heads of the guards and these clanged on the floor and rolled a few inches their bodies remained upright their arms still gripped the barrels of their weapons garth opened the door to the control room revealing to tappys eyes an airlock chamber then the gaol entered it and the door closed behind him tappy was probably in shock because of garths unexpected and deadly attack jack did not know about that the hatchling did not transmit emotional feelings not in this situation anyway she looked around none of the operators in the room behind her nor in the control center had paid any attention to the killing they may not have seen it but the operators outside the control center must have heard the noise of the fallen heads whats going on jack said he had expected any action by tappy and garth to be subtle and in essence pacifistic but but what ah the hatchling could not enter the control room to transmit empathy to those wimin the gases the gaol breathed would kill it if it stayed outside the room its empathic effect would be eventually felt by the control center crew but garth had to take immediate action he had decided that there was only one way to seize control of the ship it must have been his idea since tappy could communicate with him only through gestures also he probably knew that tappy so full of empathysoaked with it in factwould draw back from use of violence garth had been affected by the empathy transmitted to him but he was still more governed by logic than feeling a good thing too jack thought tappy went back to the window and looked around the side of the wall into the control room by then garth had cut every gaol operator in mere and was rolling up the ramp the captain was standing up on his four doglike legs his arms waving the flap over his whistling nostril going up and down his face was incapable of expressing anything but ferocity but his hands said that garth would be sorry indeed dial he had attacked the captain piers anthony and philip jose fanner it was of course bravado the captain carried no weapons whatever it was saying in its whistling speech it did not impress garth he wheeled onto the rotating disk grabbed the captains head with two suddenly extruded hands and tore the head off from the fat neck a dark reddishblue blood shot out of the open neck but garth had rolled back out of the way of the spurt quickly enough to avoid most of it the captains legs gave way under him his bottom plate struck the disk surface the legs and arms flailed for a few seconds then were still the coppery skin of the sac became bluish garth threw the head across the room and against a wall with that savage gesture he had shown that die lowerclass gaol did resent and hate their lords tappy had turned away to avoid seeing more of the carnage a moment later jack could see nothing through her eyes the transmission had been cut off ten minutes later a loud clang throughout the isolation ship told jack that tappy and garth were back airlocks opened and closed and tappy sobbing ran into his arms an hour later they were eating at a small table in a comer of the main room she had calmed down enough to have a good appetite and to be optimistic but jack did not entirely share her bubbling outlook though it was difficult to resist it he knew that the empathy that had enabled them to conquer the monitor ship was a weapon with limits actually empathy alone had not done it violence had also been necessary he worried that the empathy might become so strong in tappy himself and garth that they would be unable to use force against their enemy too much of anything no matter how good it was could be a bad thing just now he and tappy were in the isolation ship which was inside the monitor ship which was now orbiting a huge gaseous planet of a gtype star the crew was under the influence of the empathy undoubtedly the gaol were aware that both vessels had disappeared along with the imago host they would be furious but at the same time frightened they would be even more disturbed jack thought if they knew what had actually happened garth rolled through an airlock he halted by the table candy said garth wishes to report tell him to report jack said when garth had quit whistling candy said he reports that the sensors indicate that the gaol probes will probably locate the the caterpillars question general location of this vessel within an hour once that is done the gaol wont take more than an hour to pinpoint its location tell him thanks jack said though he felt it was wasting time to inform a gaol of his gratitude but maybe it wasnt who knew how deep the empathy effect went he turned to the girl tappy ive been thinking about where we should go next its useless to just keep on dodging and ducking we should go back to the honker planet i have a hunch that there is where well find the key to defeating the gaol if there is a key anyway the honkersil help us they probably have a lot of information we need for instance the honker who sneaked in at night and deposited the egg in you what does he know who ordered him to do that would he and others help us hide someplace where the gaol cant detect us if such a place exists what do you think she did not hesitate it seems to me its the only way we can go i was just waiting for you to suggest it fine but dont defer to me from now on dont wait for me to suggest something if youve got a good idea spill it she embodied literally the greatest force in the world of sentient beings yet she looked up to him as her leader this would have flattered him if he had not felt so puny and helpless but he was not going to let her know that she needed someone she could depend upon or thought that she could she was under enough stress without having to assume leadership but she should think of herself as a junior partner for now he reached across die table and squeezed her warm hand weve kept ahead of the ratcages so far he said but until now weve mostly just been running away its time to take the offensive just how they could do mat he had no idea candy tell garth were returning to the honker planet i know hes never been there but hell find it in his star charts and hell get us there toot sweet toot sweet immediately now the exact spot where well land and what well do after that having finished die instructions he rose from his chair went to tappy lifted her up and held her tightly the hatchling which he was also now calling die imaget moved from her shoulder to her hair it changed color as it did so and became practically invisible jack did not worry about accidentally crushing it with his hand or piers anthony and philip jose farmer stepping on it it was so quick that it seemed to anticipate any movement threatening it which indeed it could be doing its telepathic powers could include more than transmission of the thoughts of others jack tappy candy and garth stood on the floor of the crater about ten miles away the gigantic icons and symbols on the crater wall moved very slowly in their neverending parade now that jack was close to the wall he could see that the figures were on a smooth band made of some kind of materialcertainly not of stone the band or ring was set halfway up the wall its lower edge was at least three thousand feet above the crater floor its upper edge was about five thousand feet from the floor thus tile ring was two thousand feet broad above this the crater wall extended upward for an estimated three thousand feet who were the makers of this brobdingnagian ring what did the images and symbols mean what could be rotating the mindreeling gigantic artifact what jack quit thinking about it or tried to do so he had a much more urgent problem to consider survival the gaol ship had left after garth had given it instructions it would be in orbit now ready to return if garth radioed a command if other gaol ships came while it was still in orbit it would transfer to the system of another star and it would move again if it were again located jack led the others toward the wall between it and the place where the ship had departed was a tiny camp of honkers jack wanted to give the honkers plenty of opportunity to be alerted to the presence of the intruders if the honkers were caught unawares they might scatter in a panic or perhaps attack the strangers but if jack could get friendly with them he might get them to hide the refugees maybe even direct them to the leader of the secret organization tappy said existed among the honkers beyond that though she did not know much about it piers anthony and philip jose farmer jack had to work fast the gaol would find tappy and her companions very soon if they did not get to a hiding place garth had told him that it would be at least three hours before the gaols vessels would appear above the planet the sun was just descending from the zenith the refugees were on the bank of a large creek the vegetation on the plain was somewhat like that on an african veldtnow and then but there were distinctly nonterrestrial plants here like those that resembled thirtyfoothigh croissants with one end stuck in the ground and with many largeheaded red pins stuck in them a moldy bluegreen moss dripped from the pins which were probably just exoticlooking branches the ends of the pinbranches had knobby growths with holes in the center very tiny reptiloids stuck their shiny plated heads out from the holes these trees and others lined the creek beyond these yellowish grasses as high as jacks waist grew thickly their expanse was broken here and there by plants twenty feet high their puce trunks ascending in a zigzag fashion to topknots of thick scarlet and lemon fronds far to jacks right some enormous blue pighke beasts with huge round ears and elephantlike proboscises munched on the grass somewhere an animal roared jack ordered garth to take the lead his big wheels pressed the grass down to make an easier path for the others if they encountered a large predator garth could cut it down with his builtin beamer but garths presence would make access to the honkers difficult these always fled if they saw a gaol on the other hand jack was betting that the honkers knew that tappy was the host for the imago if they watched the strangers long enough they would conclude that garth was not your runofthemill gaol they had walked a mile when garth halted his whistles were low and candy replying also whistled softly then she spoke in english he says he detects middlemass lifeforms ahead about twenty meters also on both sides of us and behind us he can hear them move and see their body heat he cannot hear them speak tell him to proceed very slowly jack said tappy came to his side and took his hand she looked wary but not frightened she certainly was much tougher than when he had met her her scary experiences might have destroyed the nerves of many but she was basically courageous and resilient the caterpillars question she had held his right hand briefly as if a touch could give her strength or did she think that she was giving him the strength though the imago seemed to be sleeping some of its power could be leaking from it to her and she was unconsciously transmitting that to him youre getting too introspective jack he told himself youre so eager to find hidden meanings in this mess youre getting ridiculous his left hand dangled free but it was ready to snatch the beamer out of its holster if it were needed he candy and tappy each carried one there was also one in a recess in garth jack could lift the lid and grab it quickly but that was to be used only as a surprise weapon all four beamers had been taken from the gaol ship before they had left it they also had extra batteries the gaol moved ahead jack walked behind him but several paces to the gaols right when he saw a figure stand up from the grass twenty feet ahead jack told candy to tell garth to stop the person in their path was a honker though unlike any he had ever seen its body was festooned with animals and reptiles at least that was how the honker looked at first glance tappy walked past jack and garth her right hand was raised high its palm open toward the honker the honker responded with the same signal jack knew that that was the icomeinpeace sign he made the same gesture and so did candy other honkers appeared from the tall grasses he looked behind him scores of their fellows had popped out of their hiding places they held flinttipped spears and long blowguns but these were pointed at the ground and when the first one to bar the strangers path blew some kind of salute they also saluted after tappy had quit honking the male wearing the animals bowed low the tentacles growing from his hips rose and waved ute dormouselike beast whose tail was embedded in the honkers navel waved its paws and squeaked loudly jack thought if i ever get back to earth ill do a painting of this exotic being hes so baroque so nightmarish i could make a career just from my depictions of nonearth beings and then theres tappy in her many moods tappy blind and tappy seeing at the moment it looked as if he had little chance of ever returning to his native world and if he and tappy did defeat the gaol and she elected to stay here he would not leave her without tappy he would not care where he was piers anthony and philip jose farmer now she was honking at the witch doctor chief or whatever he was when she stopped he honked for a long time at her while speaking he moved slowly toward her jack saw that he was old and wrinkled liver spots covered his body but he was certainly quick and agile nothing stiff or creaky about him the snake coiled around his neck had a long thin body banded with alternating black and scarlet its head was twice as large in proportion to its body as any earth snake would have been it resembled a skinned and earless wolfs it had neither eyes nor eye sockets it uncoiled enough to extend its body and to lick tappys eyes and cheeks with a long wet unsnakelike tongue the dormouselike beast the tip of the tail of which was sunk into the honkers navel also lacked eyes it stiffened its tail so that its body was at right angles to the honkers then its hairy threetoed paws clung to the skin of tappys belly for a moment while it sniffed with a huge doglike nose its tongue shot out it was cylindrical and tipped with four tendrils these momentarily flattened out on her belly curled then withdrew around the tip of the tongue which also withdrew jack had thought that the oystershaped thing over the honkers genitals was a sort of codpiece but it quivered widi a life of its own under its hairy exterior and it split bilaterally for a few seconds to reveal some of its organs jack shuddered with repulsion what function this molluskoid had he couid not guess nor did he really want to know by then the conversation of honker and human was over the animalfestooned male turned and began walking toward the crater wall except for the rear guard which disappeared into the grass everybody followed the weird male tappy said hes the oldest honker on this planet maybe two hundred or more years old hes the administrative and spiritual leader of all the honkers hes a sort of how to translate shaman from a long line of shamans does he have a name jack said its a word that means uh one who puts a system together uh one who also gets a system working and keeps it working you mean a builder no an operator no its more like a poor tappy her formal education had been very neglected she smiled and said an integrator the caterpillars question he told himself not to be so hasty in the future in judging her knowledge good lets call him the integrator i wonder what he integrates the honkers appeared to be stone age proliferates but that must be because they wanted the gaol to believe that as evidenced by the integrator they were more advanced in biological science man the peoples of earth what else were they concealing the integrator halted and he scanned the cloudless sky the only objects in it jack could see were five crimson birds circling high in the distance satisfied that he saw nothing suspicious the shaman walked into a grove of huge trees resembling banyans with thick overlapping plates of yellowish bark jack sniffed at their strong odor he said winos delight muscatel three dollars a gallon the shaman walked into the semidarkness of the center of the grove jack following him was startled when he saw the bark of the central tree open it swung out to display a hollow in the tree a honker stood within it he bowed once to the shaman and three times to tappy then he turned and went down a steep flight of steps the shaman leading all followed him but tappy stopped and said what about garth he cant get down the steps too its too narrow and these wooden steps wouldnt bear his weight oh man i forgot about him jack said he tappy and candy went back up the steps forcing the honkers behind them to get out of the tree jack was startled when he stepped out into the halflight garth was gone a score of honkers was busily erasing the tracks of the gaols wheels ask them where garth is jack said to tappy tappy honked at the nearest female then she said theyve hidden him in a big hole in another tree its covered up widi a fake section of bark for gods sake jack said why didnt they tell us and how did they get garth to cooperate she honked again listened and then said some of the honkers speak the gaol language they cant whistle but their honks can be the equivalent of die whistles that make up words they just have to be the same lengths of the whistles and have me same timing between groups of whistles he understands them when they do that but he doesnt know honker speech piers anthony and philip jose farmer the integrator didnt tell us that garth would be hidden apparently he took it for granted that wed know that garth had to be concealed up here thats the way of the honkers they assume a certain amount of intelligence in others wed better get used to their way of doing things jack they went down the steps again and passed through several tunnels lit only by pine torches set in wall sconces they emerged into a vast cavern this was well illuminated by light from plants growing on the walls and ceilings these were tangled vines growing luminiferous pods a twentyfootwide stream of water coursed from a hole in one wall to a hole at the far end of the cavern a bridge formed of material like spiderweb silk its cables attached to the cavern ceiling crossed the stream the mouthwatering odor of meat cooked in stone braziers filled the cavern the smoke drifted slowly along and was sucked up by a large hole in the ceiling about thirty honkers adults and a few children were here the youngsters were like children on earth or elsewhere playing making a lot of noise running around having a good time and testing the adults patience jack expected to be annoyed by them especially since he needed quiet and privacy to think about his plans and also to talk to the integrator surprisingly the noise was not to bother him perhaps his increased empathy made him more tolerant then he caught sight of a table near the wall and forgot about the infants he walked to it and bent down to look intently at the objects on its top they were three concentric circles made of some brown fibrous cardboard and in the center a tiny rosered stone bending over to get closer to the stone he saw that one side of it had been carved to make a sort of throne the inner circle bore on its inner side the same images and symbols that were on the craterwall ring these were also on the inner side of the two outer rings by them were several piles of papyruslike paper the top pages of these were inked with handwritten characters these honkers were not proliferates he called to tappy before she could reach him a honker walked swiftly to him and began talking when tappy got to him she said its a model of the crater bands apparently there are two similar rings around the one we can see theyre concealed inside the cliff he says this model is the latest in a long long series the honkers have been studying it for many the caterpillars question centuries maybe millennia trying to figure out what the function of the real rings is a series of loud blasts from the integrator interrupted her she said he wants to talk to us now the integrator sat on a highbacked and intricately carved chair by a table he was feeding his bodybeasts with meat and vegetables another honker was doling out live insects to the mossy oysterlike thing covering the shamans genitals somewhere in the mass beneath its thick greenish hair covering was a mouth at a gesture from the integrator jack and tappy sat down but the shaman indicated that he had meant for tappy only to take a chair she said sorry jack he says this is going to be a long talk more like a lecture actually he doesnt want to be interrupted by my translating what he says you wander around do whatever you want to do while he talks later ill report what hes told me dont forget to ask him about the model of the crater rings jack said i want to know everything he knows runner there thats his name runner tappy said indicating the male who had told her about the model will guide you you can go wherever you wish but hell see you dont go into dangerous areas jack bent over and kissed her forehead see you but he did not leave at once he stayed to watch the imaget snatch a tiny piece of meat from a dish near the edge of the table it had to move fast to escape the lunge of the snake thing jack paled it would be a terrible loss if the imaget were killed however the hatchling was the fastest creature he had ever seen its jump was a blur like a hummingbirds wings in flight in fact it looked as if it had zipped from this continuum into another and then immediately reappeared in this world that was a fanciful analogy which however might be true an estimated hour later he returned from his tour though he could not understand his guides language he had comprehended from the gestures that the many caves he had seen were a very small part of the complex part of it was a natural cavern network another part had been dug by others than honkers if he interpreted runners hand signs rightly and the honkers had extended the work of their predecessors many of the caves contained animals and insects these were obviously being mutated into species the honkers intended to use for their own purposes one great chamber particularly fascinated piers anthony and philip jose fanner him millions of green redspotted flies were in cages made of what seemed to be glass but this material was excreted by a horde of worms laid out in frameworks the stuff when dried could be used as glassy panes runner managed to impart the information that the flies were very poisonous another chamber was devoted to a fungus that ate metal and plastic the latter material jack guessed came from artifacts which the honkers had stolen from the gaol or picked up after they had been discarded when jack was led back to the council chamber tappy and the shaman were still at the table she was drinking a rubyred liquor from a strangely shaped goblet of cut quartz the integrator was sipping his drink from another curiously formed stone goblet jack took several seconds to realize that the container was made of bone not stone and that it had to be the skull of an upperclass gaol the shaman gestured for jack to sit down a honker brought him a stone goblet shaped like a hawk with halffolded wings its eyes were large emeralds the liquor smelled like wine and was wine it was too thick for his taste but the glow that came swiftly after swallowing it was pleasant i like it fine tappy said but you should know its made from insect blood if he had not swallowed so much of the liquor he might have gotten sick by now he didnt care if it had been made from horse manure this world wasnt such a bad place after all in fact he felt as if everything was going to work out in tappys favor the gaol would be utterly defeated and all would be well in the world while tappy related her conversation the shaman went to sleep some sudden honks and the wild waving of his hip tentacles indicated that he was having a dream or a nightmare whatd he say about that jack said pointing at die craterring model the shamans still have no idea what the crater ring is for it was there when their ancestors climbed the crater wall and came down onto the floor by the way their name for themselves can be translated as the latest nobody knows why theyre named that they do have myths about its origin anyway when the latest got here they saw the moving circle and of course its intrigued them and even become part of their the caterpillars question religion the original settlers thought that the images on the band were representations of the gods and the symbols were holy messages if deciphered they would bring permanent peace and plenty to the honkers other peoples too the more enlightened now believe that die ring was made by a species that came here from another planet ring the model shows three rings how do they know there are three youll know when we see a burial chamber of the people who made the rings the honkers call them the makers well see the chamber soon oh yes i almost forgot the honkers call the rings me generator generator of what the murals in the burial cave imply that the rings are a generator of some sort and what happened to the makers the honkers believe that the makers built the generator as a weapon against the gaol a lastditch stand but the gaol killed all of them before it could be used the gaol had no idea what the ring was for they consider it to be a great curiosity but not worth intensive investigation to them its some kind of religious artifact all those millennia and the honkers dont have the slightest idea what its purpose is or how to operate it despite his strong pleadings she refused to say more about it the integrator was absent during the following day jack asked tappy if she knew where he was hes gone ahead to the burial chamber were to visit he didnt say much about what hed be doing there except that he had to repaint some of the murals theyre so ancient they need retouching now and then i suppose hes going to prepare the chamber ritually for our visit the day after that they were awakened earlyor he thought it was early since there was no sun to go byand were given breakfast immediately afterward candy accompanying them they started their journey through the tunnels and the caves three lesser shamans led the way these lacked the implanted animals but the genitals of each were covered with the mossy oysterthing and each had a pale snakething coiled around his or her neck throughout the journey tappy was silent jack asked her what was depressing her she only replied that she had much to think piers anthony and philip jose farmer about and was trying to work her way through them would he please not be worried about her she would be all right soon after three meals the party came to a halt the integrator was waiting for them in a tunnel the luciferous pods growing on the vines on the wall showed two large packs a large canteen a chamber pot and a collapsible wooden ladder on the floor the integrator had camped here jack thought but why at this place it looked like every other tunnel the party had traversed except that one section of the wall was bare of the vegetation but the honkers including the lesser shamans were obviously awed all halted when they were thirty feet from the integrator bowed and honked softly tappy had spoken about the chambers during their trip nobody but the chief shaman entered them except for some highly placed shamans who repainted the murals when they needed it the integrator honking a chant over and over danced around the tunnel in a tight circle then he went to the bare section and pushed on it it swung out at one side and in at the other it was a door of stone on pivots jn its center musty air rushed out jack looked into the darkness within the shaman after some more incomprehensible chanting and dancing lit a pine torch the flame wavered slightly showing that the tunnel had some ventilation the shaman posed in the doorway facing toward tappy he honked at her genuflected three times turned and walked into the darkness tappy said you and candy are allowed too jack candy just behind him he followed the girl and the shaman for about twenty feet the tunnel began curving here after two hundred paces counted by jack the tunnel straightened out immediately a large arched doorway was ahead of them the shaman walked through it his torch lighting up the immense chamber he set that in a wall sconce then lit two more torches he had carried in a bag on his back he handed one to tappy and one to jack there were several fascinating objects seen dimly in the shadows deeper within the chamber but a mural near him caused him to stop and study it by the light of his torch it looked as if it had been painted yesterday in fact he could smell the paint he said i cant believe it above him was a painting depicting among other things a group of four people no change mat to three people and one weird being who looked as if it were half machine the human the caterpillars question beings were a young female a somewhat older male and a woman but a section of clockwork and wires was exposed in a hole in the womans chest that meant what that she was not really a human being she was an android and though the halfmachine did not look much like garth it portrayed a cyborg fitted with wheels to one side was another painting it was clearly the spacetime vessel in which he and tappy had taken refuge and found the androids in it squiggly lines around it represented he supposed the pulsations emanating from the vessel all the images had been freshly repainted jacks heart was clenching as if it were a hand desperately squeezing down on ectoplasm though he did not want to look again at the young female in the painting he forced himself to do so she did not have tappys features but she had that sweet expression tappy so often had and that wondering look like the faces of alice in wonderland and of dorothy in oz the artist had also managed to give a sense of both vulnerability and invulnerability jack had never seen anything to match the contradictory impressions in any work by an earth artist and he thought he had seen all the works of the great ones and the neargreats she wore a blue robe of some sort it was not a nightgown but it could easily have been used for that purpose a circular section in her breast and stomach areas was white representations of rays emanating from the central brightness shot through her body and several feet beyond her was that symbolic of the imago he looked more closely on her left breast was a vague tentacled shape through which the fabric of the robe could be seen the imaget the hairs on the back of his neck seemed to be standing up and cold raced over his skin the young male did not have his face and his clothes were not those of any terrestrial but he held a painters brush in one hand the four certainly seemed to represent prophecies or predictions of the coming of tappy jack candy and garth impossibleyet there they were and the young human female shone with the imago within her and she bore the imaget on her breast he stepped back lifted the torch higher and saw the image above the group it was of tongues of fire shooting above the piers anthony and philip jose farmer heads of the four persons above these were images of the craterwall rings and their figures and symbols from its interior sprang more tongues of fire and in their midst were upperclass gaol the ratcages some of them were burning how would the rings be powered the outer one had been rotating slowly for many thousands of years some kind of machinery had to be turning it the other rings too he supposed nothing in the painting indicated what that could be was there a vast engine deep under the crater floor what did it use for fuel a shaft plunging to the hot core of the planet a shaft which conducted the heat to the machine where the heat was converted to electricity or had the makers possessed means of which terrestrials had no inkling by now the integrator was bobbing up and down and whirling with an agility and endurance amazing for such an old person he was also honking loudly jack moved close to tappy and spoke softly this couldnt be just coincidence he felt numb but deep within him was a fiercely hot ball of excitement my god predictions cant be valid no one can look into the future and see whats coming not about what individualsll be doing anyway especially if they wont exist for thousands of years if true prophecies or predictions could be made wed just be machines rolling along tracks that were laid in the beginning of time thered be no free will past present and future would be fixed we wouldnt be responsible for anything we did good or bad no i just cant swallow that tappy looked as if she had just seen some horrible monster coming out of a wall she said i cant believe it either jack the integrator told me about this but he made me promise not to tell you about it it was all i could do to keep silent but i think i couldnt really believe what he said i thought we should see this before we got high hopes too high and then fell off the wall like humpty dumpty jack tried to dispel the numbness but failed when he spoke it was as if he were under water maybe someonewho i dont knowis trying to make this prophecy this prophetic mural come true like a selffulfilling prophecy thatd be the only rational explanation but who could be doing this if that is the case the caterpillars question im really confused tappy said me too she smiled though it was obviously difficult for her to do she said what difference does it make if we are programmed does it really matter if fate or someone has determined our lives or if we screw it all up by ourselves we think we have free will even if its a delusion we wouldnt believe it not if we had solid proof wed deny it so why worry about it rant and rail and curse the gods we can only act as if we truly were the masters of our destinies jack could only grunt but she was right and her attitude and her manner of speaking showed that she had matured far beyond her years perhaps the false experiences had had some effect after all i suppose he said that the brightness within the girl and the rays shining from it symbolize the imago thats what the latest believe thats why the integrator sent that honker to plant the eggseed in me the ability to do that make the eggseed i mean was within their powers long long ago they were just waiting for the right person to come along meand to do it theres another burial chamber miles from here that gives instructions for doing that its in the characters of the alphabet used by the makers but with it are images that indicate how to do it jack shook his head and he said too much too much i still think think what never mind it doesnt bear thinking about he chewed on his upper lip before he spoke again why didnt the honkers lead us into the underground refuge as soon as we entered through the bouldergate the gaol were too close besides it was evident to the honker spies that i was headed being urged to head for a destination north they assumed that it was the pulsating vessel that had suddenly appeared they tend not to interfere in certain situations when we showed up near their underground entrance the integrator decided it was time to hide us she drew a deep breadi also when you and i appeared with candy and garth they knew that the prophecy was being fulfilled it was time to take us in no matter what the consequences might be for diem anything else piers anthony and philip jose farmer i almost forgot the integrator said he thought i was attracted to the bouldergate on earth because it led to this crater the crater ring he thinks generates a weak field because its rotating slowly but the field was strong enough to attract me to it i mean attract the imago in me to it the makers theorized that the field or whatever should radiate from the generator would attract the imago like iron filings to a magnet and jack said and what that pulsating ship candy and the other androids manned why did it attract you more strongly than the crater ring and who made the ship and the androids were they prepared millennia ago too i dont know she cried theres just too much to know too many unanswered questions he embraced her and kissed her softly on the lips take it easy one thing at a time you may feel as if youre about to crack up fall apart but youre really tough tappy really strong just hang on he became aware that the shaman was silent he looked toward him and saw him gesture for tappy and him to follow him he led them out of the muraled room and into another that also had wall paintings several yards into it the shaman halted he genuflected nine times before stepping ahead again then he halted again and genuflected seven times when he went forward again he made only three steps the darkness shrank away from the lights of their torches not very far though the ceiling was so high that the lights did not touch them now jack saw placed on the floor ahead of them eleven twentyfoothigh globes made of some glitteriiig crystalline material when the shaman indicated that he and tappy should come nearer to them they got very close to the globes jack felt as awed and as seized with mystery as the archaeologists who had first entered king tuts tomb but this place was probably many thousands of years older than the tombolder indeed than the very first egyptian tombs or stonehenge each globe enclosed a body jack did not need to be told that each corpse was a makers they were sixlimbed beings quadrupeds with two arms centaurs he thought though not resembling much the halfman halfhorse of the greek myths their lower part the animal body the caterpillars question was shaggy with long red hair the four legs were long but quite beariike the upright torso springing from the front of the quadrupedal form was covered with bright golden hair some of the corpses were female the big round and thicknippled breasts made that certain the heads were so flat above the eyes and so narrow from a side view that jack deduced a similarity in this respect to the gaol like them the makers brains were in their bodies the eyes like the beardless faces were human but they had epicanthic folds which would have made their faces chineselike if their lips had not been heavily everted like those of west african blacks their noses were very large and hawkbeaked the eyes ranging in color from brown to blue seemed to be magnets drawing eternity and infinity into them the integrator brought eleven candles from his bag and placed them in their holders before the globes after lighting them he got down on his knees and began bowing and chanting while his right band weaved unseen symbols in the air the acrid stench from the candies made jack and tappy cough they walked away to the nearest wall and studied some of the murals there most of those showed the makers in their daily lifeor so it seemed to jack the vegetation and some of the animals depicted were not those of earth or of the honkers planet he was just getting started on his study of the series when the integrator suddenly quit chanting he quickly put the candles out placed them in his bag and gestured that the humans should follow him chapter they were in the cavern headquarters of the integrator two hours ago he had given jack and tappy glasses of a thick and dark purplish fluid to drink it was a mixture of berry juice and an amount very small of the venom of the fly called quickdeath by increasing the quantity every day they should be immune to the venom after twenty days meanwhile they could expect to feel somewhat sick during this period one bite will semiparalyze a person of our body mass tappy had told him two bites in rapid succession will kill the whole honker population has been immunized the drinking skull of the shaman came from an upperclass ratcage who had died from the quickdeaths bites the gaol ruling class seldom leave their ships when theyre on this worldin this area anywayunless theyre wearing heavy nets they send out their humans and lowerclass warriors to do the work the shaman says we were lucky we didnt get bitten while we were wandering around in the crater after swallowing the sweet but foulsmelling fluid jack and tappy resumed their study of the craterring model jack picked up the page he had been writing on but he put it down when a sharp pain struck his stomach a few seconds later he had a severe headache tappy who looked as sick as he felt said itll go away in an hour but we shouldnt eat anything until suppertime jacks vision blurred where there had been one piece of paper there were now two one overlapping the other by a few inches moreover his hands and feet felt numb both abandoned the study to lie down in their cave bedroom but as the shaman had said after sixty minutes they had recovered enough to go back to the model and dieir notes the caterpillars question so far he and tappy aided by a honker who interpreted the notes written by generations of honkers had plenty of clues too many but they had no idea what any of them meant in that case as tappy remarked how did they know the items were clues jack had replied that everything on the ring had to be significant so far though he had found nothing meaningful in the images and symbols on the ring or in their locations on it or their relationships to each other some of the images were of the makers some of the ratcagebodied gaol there were also representations of the pulsating inandout vessel in which he and tappy had taken refuge red wavyshafted arrows lipped by flames radiated from the ship maybe those indicate the magnetism which the shaman thought mightve drawn you to the ship jack said like you were a migratory bird following the earths lines of force he shook his head i just dont know our only explanations fof all this stuff are just theories not even that just hypotheses the craters magnetism drew me through the bouldergate she said that means that it somehow uh leaked through the gate even though this planet must be many many lightyears from earth but you wouldnt have felt the attraction if you hadnt come near the boulder that meansmight mean anywaythat your foster parents sent us there because they knew about the boulder i suppose so she said but if they knew about it why didnt they take me there themselves they mustve had a good reason why didnt they wait until i was mature enough for die imago to develop fully because he said they knew the gaol were getting close to finding out that you were on earth they had to get you away before the gaol went any further in their investigation they had to chance your finding your way to the boulder who knows what your foster parents did after i drove you away maybe they went through another gate to another world i dont know he was wondering though if her foster parents had been agents of the persons who might be working to fulfill the prophecy those people could be organized as a cell system each cell knew very little about the others the inferior agents worked in sotitude and ignorance except when they received orders from a piers anthony and philip jose farmer higher agent on the other hand the foster parents might be in the highest echelon a few seconds later a tall rangy honker ran into the cave he stopped before the integrator though winded he delivered a long series of honks the shaman rose from the moss pile on which he had been sitting and began honking at tappy his eyes were wide and he was gesticulating wildly his excitement infected the beasts on him the snake reared up and hissed the dormouse growing from his navel yipped and squeaked and waved its paws the hairy thing on his genitals split bilaterally closed split and closed it quivered violently the hip tentacles thrashed around tappy became pale her voice unsteady she said a gaol ship has landed in the crater its either the one that captured us or one just like it the best defense is offense that was a cliche but like most cliches it was often valid jack tappy the imaget the integrator candy and sixty honkers were deep under the ground the large chamber they occupied had been excavated by the makers one wall was composed of an immense piece of nickeliron a fragment of the meteorite which had formed the crater long ago many times during the threeday underground journey to this place the group had encountered large relics of the fiery falling star the integrator said that the gaols orbital geosurvey ships must have detected these and the cavern complex centuries or more ago if they had ever gone down into the subterranean system it had been so long ago that the honkers had no record of it now however they knew or thought they knew that the imago and its host were somewhere in the crater instead of trying to keep one step ahead of the gaol jack had decided to attack after a conference the integrator had agreed that that was the best policy the war party was now directly beneath the gaol ship that had landed several days ago sixty feet of earth and meteorite fragments were between the vessel and the chamber housing the latest and the others a report about the gaol had just been brought by a spy who had climbed down a series of ladders glued to the inside of a ventilator pipe its entrance was inside a hollowedout tree according to the spy the gaol had set up a camp inside the circle formed by the the caterpillars question landingsupport system beneath the ship it was composed so far of humans and cyborg gaol but the cyborgs had gone back into the ship for the night you can be sure the integrator said that a walking ratcage is in command this is too important to leave to mere humans and cyborgs jack wondered if malva was in the crew though his empathy for others had gotten even stronger while he was with the honkers it was not powerful enough to overcome his hatred for malva if he could get her neck between his hands he would squeeze until she died no way would he ever forgive her because he could feel the motives that drove her she was as evil as the gaol she worked for and she must die jack tappy said shearing off his detailed thoughts of the revenge he would inflict on malva the integrator says we should go up soon its after midnight not we you dont go with us you stay here where youll be safe tappy knew that he was right the imago was too precious to risk in battle despite this she had been urging jack and the chief shaman to take her along jack suspected that she was not so much intent on fighting with them as she was afraid of being alone though she had a bodyguard of four honkers she was alone if jack was not by her side looking determined tappy honked at the integrator there fouowed a short but savage conversation the honks could not convey emotion as a human voice could but her facial expressions and the vigorous gestures of both showed that they were getting hot under the collar as it were finally the shaman threw up his hands in a quitehuman gesture tappy smiled then turned to jack he says i can go if i dont leave the exit in the hollow tree dont you dare try to argue with me whatd you do threaten to rip his penis off instead of replying she put on a heavy closemeshed net over her bone helmet jack also donned a net and both slipped their hands into threeply leather gloves since both were still not immune to the quickdeathfly venom they had had to be protected their clothing was thick enough to protect against the bites you promise not to get into the fray jack said she nodded he hoped she would keep her promise piers anthony and philip jose farmer the integrator glanced around at the war party seemed to be satisfied with what he saw and blew three long blasts and one short one the war cry tappy said the shaman went into the next room jack tappy and candy in single file behind him the others followed a moment later the integrator began climbing the ladders set up by an advance party most honkers were armed with blowguns and poisoned darts bows and arrows flinttipped knives and short spears and flint axes jack and candy and two honkers carried beamers three of them and their batteries had been stolen over the years from gaol expeditions they were in soft thick bags strapped to their back if a beamer should be banged against the shaft wall it would make no sound jacks big beamer and the small one in his holster had been brought with him from the gaol ship captured before he came to the honker planet he would have preferred the weapon he had used against the gaol in their first encounter the shadowdeath weapon built into tappys leg brace during their flight from the gaol he had wondered sometimes about the persons who had installed the radiator in the brace also where had they gotten this weapon he had also speculated fruitlessly as usual on why tappy had muttered about it while sleeping how had the words gone alien menace only chance is to use the radiator in what way could this weapon be the only thing to vanquish the gaol he had asked tappy about her other dreambegotten phrase reality is a dream she did not know what either meant behind him were a dozen or so honkers with glass cages full of flies strapped to their backs behind them would be the rest of the party including some bearing more cages these would be swarming with insects with other deadly functions than poison and some latest were carrying boxes crammed with fungus air was moving downward over jack as he went up according to the shaman who was only guessing the ventilating mechanism was part of the shaft wall and had no moving parts something magnetic in the metal kept me air moving that was why the makers ventilation system never wore out but the integrator was great on magnetism it explained just about everything for him the shaft was dark not until jack got near the top of the shaft did he see illumination and that was dim when he was helped the caterpillars question out of the shaft he was in a large but crowded room the hollow interior of a huge tree the light was from the full moon but it came through a big hole far up the trunk he was pushed gently forward until he was out of the tree trunk and in a grove of trees he could see better now though the moonbeams were filtered by the tangle of heavily leafed branches overhead finally the last warrior came out of the trunk tappy was behind him in a low voice he told her to go back into the hollow and if things go wrong for us get the hell down the shaft as fast as you can i will she said softly she kissed him on the mouth god bless you may he keep you safe he hugged her quickly then turned away tears blurring his vision he might never see her again forget that he told himself concentrate on what must be done if shes going to be safe nobody except die humans had spoken it was difficult for the honkers to whisper if very soft honks could be called whispers but everything had been planned everybody had his or her instructions they could make all the noise they wanted to when bell broke loose straight in front of him he could see a slice of the gaol camp lights streamed from the windows of dark domed structures some of the light fell on a massive shadowy bulk some yards to the east of the camp that would be the landing structure a small section of it anyway he stepped out to a point just beyond two trees their branches kept him deep in their shade now he could see about thirty of the domes they were so large they must be barracks he could also hear human voices a door opened in one of the domes and a man stood in the doorway the light strong behind him he was smoking a pipe die pleasant but untobaccolike odor of which drifted to jack after a few minutes the man stepped back and closed the door a group of machines dieir function indeterminate at this distance was parked in the center of die camp unexpectedly the camp had no walls the gaol did not fear attack besides the landing structure a vast ring from which pylons rose a hundred feet to the main body of the vessel formed a very high wall no lights came from the landing structure or the spheroid body of the spaceship piers anthony and philip jose farmer the honker spies had reported that the gaol had not as yet sent out scouts or exploratory parties whatever they were up to they were taking their time probably the technicians in the vessel were probing with their cavity detectors and also with the instruments that assumedly could detect the presence of the imago the tatter instruments he hoped were directed outside of the radius of the landing structure they would never imagine that the imago and its host could be inside the structure if at the time of landing here they had probed directly beneath the ship they would have detected only a hollow beneath the huge meteorite fragments if that is their instruments could penetrate through the nickeliron pieces jack stepped out to the edge of the shadows of the trees honkers followed him then the integrator was standing by his side his hip tentacles waving languidly like seaweed in a current the integrator watched for a while then he bleeped softly and he moved out into the moonlight jack and candy and the two honkers ran swiftly to the doors of four domes near them each pulled out of a bag a small creature the bottom of which was a flesh suction pad a long tuft of hair serving as a handle for the warriors projected from the back of each jack stuck his suckerbug as it was called onto the center of the door using his beamer he cut a circular hole in the door when he was close to completing the circular section another warrior grabbed the creatures hair tuft he pulled it and the section away from the door as soon as jack had finished another honker stuck the front of a glass cage against the hole he pulled up a slide for a second or two then closed it at least two hundred flies maybe more had gone through the hole jack ran on to the next house while another honker put back the cut section and applied tape across it to hold it to the door meanwhile some honkers had gone to the parking lot they had to make sure that none of the motionless machines there were actually cyborgs in a few seconds the latest held clenched hands overhead that was the signal that all was well in the lot jack and candy and the two honkers worked swiftly already the first of the parties to enter the domes behind the cutters had made sure no one was alive in them now they were going into other domes and most of them were carrying beamers appropriated from the dead gaol jack was on edge he expected an automatic alarm to sound at any time or a gaol in his death agonies to scream out that did the caterpillars question not happen after an estimated fifteen minutes the last warrior had reported to the integrator he held one hand up turning this back and forth a signal that he had completed his assignment jacks beamer sliced through the thick outer wall of the curving landing structure three others also cut several large entrances near the one jack had made then a number of suckers were applied to the wall sections just before they were completely cut they dragged the pieces rather easily though thick they were of very lightweight material the perilous ways were open a dark corridor stretched before them if an alarm was sounding in the main body of die ship the war party could not hear it but the latest were going on the assumption that some would soon be activated jack was not so sure the gaol may not have thought it necessary to activate them the party was not in danger of getting lost in the vast maze of the ship garth had served on the same type of vessel through candy he had provided all the information needed to find the places to be invaded the honkers had made diagrams of the passageways and the control center and where the crew was stationed when on duty and where it slept while going through the tunnels to the chamber beneath the ship the war party had studied these everyone knew exactly where to go and what he must do and how many he would have to fight nevertheless as in any battle things could not only go wrong but doubtless would the caterpillars question chapter jack kept moving knowing that time was critical the gaol captain had to know that the security of the ship had been breached he would be ruthless in the defense of his command the honkers were following a meandering trail around over and through the trusses and pipes of the skin of the ship evidently seeking to lose themselves so that no guards inside could spot them this was no innocent camping hike yet now jack was suffering significant second thoughts doubts which had been nagging him were now threatening to overwhelm him it wasnt that he was afraid for his life though he was or that he was concerned that the odds were against this mission though he was it was that now belatedly the scattered bits of wrongness he had felt were coalescing into a more solid structure he was no longer vaguely concerned he was quite specifically alarmed he followed the honkers automatically while he put it together making sure of his notion because if he was right there might be worse trouble ahead than behind not physically but in terms of tappys destiny item tappy was the host of the imago an ethereal entity who could cause any living creature to have great empathy for all living things the imago could destroy the galactic empire of the gaol by causing all living creatures including the gaol themselves to have empathy for others instead of oppressing them therefore the gaol intended to capture tappy and lock her away in isolation for life so that the imago could not spread its harmony item tappy had led jack to the planet of the honkers who were only vaguely manlike and this planet had extensive ancient artifacts these had been constructed by the makers who seemed to resemble centaurs whose nonhorselike portions were bearlike rather than human some of these artifacts were enormous and seemed to be still operative such as the metallic band around the crater wail about fifty miles in diameter what had happened to the makers whose power must once have shamed that of the presentday gaol item a honker had somehow drugged both jack and tappy and planted the eggseed on tappys chest hormones or something similar from that egg had nullified the effect to the volition paralysis the gaol had used on the two of them so that tappy was able to get them free so that they could reach the agents of the imago and get help this indicated that the honkers were not the primitives they had at first seemed to be item the egg had in due course hatched producing the imaget a creature who could facilitate or enhance the qualities of the eggs host the imaget had the power to enhance or facilitate the powers of its original host so that the effect of the imago could be transferred in an hour instead of a day it also was a telepathic transmitter at least between creatures with whom it had had close physical association or whom it had helped convert item despite the empathy which had transformed him cyborggaol garth had gone to his former ship and slain its living guards equipment operators and truegaol captain he had shown no compassion rather the opposite becoming an efficient killer this could not have been because of reversion and loss of empathy in the absence of the imaget because both tappy and the imaget had been with him jack himself just minutes ago had participated in the honkers savage attack on the human minions of the gaol where was his empathy for those living creatures which were his own kind he should not have been able to do it only now in retrospect were his qualms manifesting this suggested that the imaget had another property the ability to reverse what it had enhanced it was a phenomenally potent little creature put these items together and what larger picture emerged imago makers honkers imaget all of them seemed to have powers beyond what first showed all of them were working together to oppose the gaol but what were they workingor it wasnt enough merely to say that the empire of the gaol was evil one empire was probably similar to another when it came down to it maybe it would be a better galaxy if every living creature in it had empathy for every other creature but it might also be anarchy now with this realization of what else the imaget could do jack realized that he might not be working for a future utopia he might be just another tool for some shadowy alien force whose ultimate piers anthony and philip jose farmer purposes might be just as nefarious as those of the gaol how could he be sure he was on the right sideassuming there was a right side that he and tappy were not mere patsies for some player in a galactic game of intrigue and power that their honker allies were their friends and not their enemies that they were not working for the restoration of the makers to power if any still existed regardless of the welfare of the galaxy but his thoughts were cut off by an outside event they had been walking through what appeared to be the space between the outer and inner shells of the ship there was surely an aperture to the main portion but the defenders of the ship must have located them and were now counterattacking there was a hiss of gas jack and the honkers quickly donned simple gas masks that die honker leader passed around these consisted of spongelike objects they simply held them in their mouths and breathed through them jack realized that these could be living creatures or could be infused with microscopic entities that detoxified the gas biologically similarly they plugged little pieces of sponge into their ears and nostrils and clapped flexible transparent shells over their eyes none of jacks senses seemed to be impaired by this then they brushed damp sponges over their bodies covering them with somewhat sticky goop that quickly thickened jack painted his face neck arms and ankles they were now completely protected against poison gasjack hoped they moved on breathing through their sponges jack found that the air through his was slightly flavored not unpleasant but his legs began to itch and then his crotch he realized that he should not have assumed that his clothing would protect him of course it wouldnt so he stopped to do what he should have done before he ripped off his clothing and jammed the sponge into all the itchy areas vigorously swabbing them the discomfort eased immediately the honkers did know what they were doing here but his pause had caused him to fall behind the honkers hadnt waited for him they evidently did not suffer fools gladly he would be lost in this labyrinth if he didnt catch up quickly he didnt have time to put his clothing on again so he settled for his shoes and wadded the rest up into a knotted ball naked he charged along the route he had seen them go for a while he feared he was lost anyway then he spied a honker waiting for him as he came up to it the honker loped the caterpillars question ahead showing the way to the others they had not after all left him to be lost that was nice since he was the nominal leader of this raiding party they came to a flat wall that might be the back side of a control panel many lumps and strands projected from it the wiring of the ship one honker brought out a little sac of paste he rubbed this carefully on the metal wall in a disk about two inches across the wall became translucent then transparent there the honker peered through it he nodded then brought out a thin strawlike tube with a bulb on one end he poked this at the transparent section and it penetrated the metal when it was through he squeezed the bulb there was a faint hiss of gas being forced through then there was a thump on the other side of the wall as of a guard falling to the floor gas was a twoedged weapon another honker did something and a panel swung open they piled into the ship proper jumping over the body of the guard or technician there jack saw that it was a human female halfway pretty but he felt no sympathy she was a minion of die enemy and realized that he could no longer trust his feelings he carried the imaget which seemed to be immune to the gas and it had reversed his emotion but now mat he realized that things were not exactly as they seemed he might be able to compensate regardless he had to take this ship because if he failed it would soon attack and reduce the honker defenses on the planet and tappy would either be captured or killed of the two capture was the worse risk so his understanding could have little effect on his immediate actions but perhaps much on his longer term strategy there were a number of creatures in sight but they paid no attention to the intruders apparently they were androids programmed for specific tasks not for defense of the ship however when the authorities realized that their gas attack had not succeeded they would send a more competent contingent to do the job the honkers had gone about as far as they could without direction they had breached the shell of the ship and gotten him inside now it was time for jack to do his thing he had had a foolish notion of carving his way through the ship with a giant curving laseredged sword protected by some kind of magic armor lopping the heads from any who opposed him but of course that was unrealistic the gaol had lost one piers anthony and philip jose farmer ship to a surprise attack and would not allow another to go the same way there would be attack robots marshaling right now to come and cut him down sword and sorcery was not for this realm there was a more subtle but effective procedure he was prepared in a less foolish less dramatic but more realistic way he felt in his bundle of clothes and brought out a tiny tightly sealed jar the honkers had given him he unscrewed the cap and lifted it off there was a little puff of dark vapor that quickly dissipated in the air that was all now find us a hole we can defend jack said around his sponge the honkers were already doing that the interior of the ship was a labyrinth of passages and tubes ranging from twenty feet in diameter to less than an inch and cables of many sizes twining like serpents through and between some seemed to be for air others for mechanized delivery systems and others for the passage of robots or living creatures but spread around in it were glassy bubblelike chambers evidently little command centers which could be sealed off most of them contained creatures but some were empty the honkers brought him to one of these bubbles sealed him in then dispersed this ship was jack realized like a giant living thing he had seen it or one like it healing itself after he and tappy had cut through its wall with the radiator now that he was inside it he thought of the tubes as blood and lymph vessels arid the tunnels as part of a vast alimentary tract and the cables as nerves that would make the robots and androids and living creatures serve the function of the cells of the blood circulating to every part of the whole this chamber must be a temporary storage place for blood so that it could be routed where needed in a hurry maybe antibodies were robot warriors with blasters now a screen lighted in the bubble the human woman malva appeared so it is you jack she said eying his naked torso he moved his bundle of clothes to cover what counted evidently the job of disposing of you was bungled so it seems he agreed he had to spit out his bit of sponge so as to talk clearly it didnt seem to matter there was no longer hostile gas here but you are now sealed into a containment capsule you will die when your air is exhausted the ship will die soon after me jack replied evenly the caterpillars question you are of course bluffing this ship has taken off and is now orbiting the planet your friends can not help you jack had not felt the takeoff but that meant nodiing the drive was inertialess i suggest that you put me into direct contact with the gaol captain immediately so that we can negotiate the surrender of the ship before it is destroyed the gaol do not surrender their ships nor do they negotiate with inferior lifeforms have it your way meanwhile let me clarify our threat i have released a funguslike cloud of spores which is circulating throughout the ship the spores first priority is to multiply which they do rapidly feeding on the elements of the air and the substances of the ship they are omnivorous with appetite for metals plastics and organic things everything except living tissue they even feed on poisonous things their effect is almost imperceptible at first but increases exponentially as their number multiplies their life cycle is complete in a matter of seconds they have a very high metabolic rate soon you will notice an impairment of the functioning of the ship as they festoon and clog the smaller channels later you will notice that their waste products are highly corrosive dissolving all the substances on which they feed indeed that is part of their mode of operation they dissolve things in order to feed on them the effect will accelerate until the ship is rendered inoperable and everything in it dies you and your party along with it she said yes so no threats will prevail against us we are a suicide mission only your surrender in time for the antidote will save any of us now put me in touch with the captain because i will not negotiate with you you have demonstrated your lack of integrity malvas picture was replaced by that of the ratcage that was the captain what is your offer the gaols words came translated so the gaol did negotiate when they had to the captain must have verified the effect of the fungus and realized that there was not time to bring an antidote from a far system assuming they were able to devise one of course he could not trust the captain any more than malva but he didnt need to orient he thought to the imaget convert suddenly jack remembered the body of the young human woman the honker gas had killed he had never known her in life but he knew she had been a living feeling creature who had done piers anthony and philip jose farmer what she had to do to survive if she served the gaol it was because they were the available employers not because she was a bad person in fact there were no bad people only differing agendas there were no bad living creatures everything deserved its chance he felt grief for all whose chances were denied the imaget had focused on the captain channeling its full power as jack had told it to it was bringing empathy to the gaol but that meant it could no longer serve jack and so the full force of his empathy for all living things had returned he had never lost it only had it temporarily blotted out so that he could perform ruthlessly just as the gaol cyborg had performed when taking over the other ship however he had to hold the captains attention while the imaget made enough of an impression to maintain the contact after a while the captain would not object to the conversion if he was even aware of it it hardly mattered what jack said as long as it kept the dialogue going surrender your ship to me then i will arrange to have the counteragent delivered so that the ship survives without crippling damage this is not acceptable make another offer wait it out then the ship will crash and all of us will die but you will not have the imago or its host and so your mission will be lost there is always an intermediary course make another offer i dont seem to be getting through to you jack said i dont have to dicker for terms i have the controlling hand your only choices are to surrender the ship or die i will let you live if you yield because he had empathy even for the gaol he did not like the idea of hurting any living thing but knew that he had to to win this encounter or many more would suffer i will demonstrate the intermediary course you will save yourself considerable distress if you issue a message for your associates to the effect that the situation is in order and you require the antidote immediately if you do not you will be captured and required to do so under duress fat chance ratcage this is negation right the screen faded to blank then fully mechanical robots appeared around the bubble using tool appendages to sever and seal off the various tubular connections it had to other parts of the ship the caterpillars question the captain had distracted him with the dialogue while he set up his attack on the bubble who had been fooling whom it was ploy and counterploy in a deadly game but the imaget was still oriented on the gaol how long would it take telepathically if they broke in and killed him and the imaget the fungus would still disable the ship but they did not intend to kill him they were going to torture him to make him give their message could he resist that the robots severed and sealed the last outside connection then they simply rolled the bubble to a larger chamber a coating of dirt was forming on the outside which was odd where would there be dirt in a sealed ship like this now jack saw that similar bubbles enclosed the honkers who had accompanied him ah of them had been captured they were going to have him out and under duress very quickly too quickly time was his ally but how much time did he need did the process of conversion take longer by telepathy how could he stall to get enough time the robots used what looked like lipstick applicators to mark lines on the outside of the bubble but when they completed a circle a panel fell out jacks protection was gone but he refused to give them any help when a robot reached an appendage in he knocked it aside it was a futile gesture but one that had to be made the robot swung its appendage back toward jack but slowly now he saw that it was encrusted with furry growths the fungus jack avoided the appendage and it was unable to catch him even in this confined region because the fungus interfered with its mechanism now he saw that the other robots were similarly overgrown they might be able to ignore fungus on their exteriors but it probably was growing in the joints too and inside wherever it could reach the same thing would be happening all over the ship now he realized that the dirt on the bubble was also fungus it was on the walls and floor too it was doing its job of spreading how long would it be before it interfered with the major systems of the ship bringing it down then another robot came this one was spraying something a fungicide it sprayed the other robots and they then resumed faster motion maybe there wasnt enough of the stuff to douse the whole ship but that wouldnt help jack then the motion slowed again the fungus was growing even faster he could see it appearing as a thickening film on all the piers anthony and philip jose farmer sprayed surfaces the fungus was now feeding on the fungicide but jack was not yet out of trouble human minions came fungus was growing on them too or at least on their clothing but they were functioning they spoke to jack in the highly accented english that seemed to be the classtaught second or third language here come out or we drag you out jack was about ready to come out anyway he climbed through the hole in the bubble now what he noticed that there was no fungus on him not even his inanimate portions such as hair and nails it seemed that the same paint that had protected him from the gas was effective against the fungus the honkers were not about to be hoist in their own petard but coated or not these human minions meant business one brought out what looked like a set of electric probes jack felt a chill that could be exactly what they were he knew that electric shock could make a lot of pain that didnt show he didnt know whether he could handle it so he made a break for it he shoved the man with the probes against the one beside him and charged through the gap in their circle this made he had no idea where he was going just so long as it was anywhere but here there was a faint flash then he lost his volition the honker paint did not protect against that device but why hadnt they used it before jack had stopped where he was not losing his balance just having no power to go anywhere on his own initiative he stood facing away from the other men turn a voice said from a hidden speaker jack turned to face the othersand saw that all of them were turning away from him what was going on the intruding human being only will respond the voice said then jack understood the flash had nulled the willpower of all of them that was why they hadnt wanted to use it it did not differentiate it affected any human being m the vicinity making them almost useless he had forced them to use it and that had been a reasonably good move walk follow the blue line a line appeared before him jack walked the line wound a devious course through the ship soon jack was lost he would never be able to find his way out on his own even with the good chart of the ship the honkers had provided not that he was likely to be given the the caterpillar s question chance there was a lot of walking in a milediameter ship but if he did get his will back then he could follow the line back to his starting point was there any way to break the hold of the nullvolition before tappy had been immune because of the imaget egg and then she had gotten him free of it by writing malvas name as a gaol symbol on a piece of paper and having him eat it he still wasnt sure how that worked but he couldnt do that now no pencil no paper no tappy but wait tappy had been free because of the imaget egg she earned surely the imaget itself had the same power so why wasnt he free because the imaget was otherwise occupied at the moment but when it finished that job it would revert its attention to jack and then he should be free probably he could get its attention with a strong thought if he had to so he had a secret weapon maybe meanwhile he followed the blue line at one point it spiraled up a curving ramp and he happened to see behind him the line had disappeared it faded out as he moved along it being clear only ahead so much for following it back however he also saw his footprints m the furry gray coating of fungus on the floor maybe he could follow them instead if they didnt disappear too rapidly under new growth finally he reached a region he judged to be somewhere m the center of the ship there was a huge bubble opaque because of its coating with an enormous number of connections it was as if this were the central cell of a living entity to which all others reported and of course it was he realized this was the abode of the gaol captain he was about to face his reckoning wipe a section clear a loudspeaker said jack realized that he was still carrying his bundled clothing he used this to rub on the available surface of the sphere it was like scraping snow off a windshield now a window of clanty appeared inside the bubble was the gaol captain for the first time jack saw such a creature with his own eyes from up close instead of by telepathic projection through other eyes the thing was homble all the details were as he had been shown before but now they were m sharp ugly focus the great external nb cage as if it had once been fleshed but now was piers anthony and philip jose farmer a carcass the sacful of body organs as if the guts had been wrapped in membrane and hung inside the stripped rib cage to cure the legs and neck projecting from die general region of that internal mass emerging from the cage what a monster yet perhaps it was in keeping with the spaceship the gaol used for diis huge ship had riblike projections reaching up to join at the top it was surely the kind of structure the gaol would feel comfortable with because of their own skeletal structure just as human beings felt comfortable with devices dial had their controls at die top and dieir propulsion at the bottom emulating the human head and feet maybe the nature of the originating species could be derived by inspecting their spaceships if one knew how to interpret the signals i did not know that the imago could strike at this range the speaker said it was obviously translating for the gaol inside die sphere jack did not repjy because he had not been directed to but he felt a thrill of excitement had the gaol been converted what is the mechanism now jack could speak but he did not have to speak because the null effect did not extend to his mind would he be better off to refuse to so that the gaol would not learn what was going on the null did not allow him to lie he had either to tell the truth or say nothing he decided to respond with limited candor the imagos power extends beyond its host this enabled the minions of the imago to take charge of the other gaol ship this one too but our tracers show the host of the imago to be on the surface of die planet and our experience of prior millennia indicates that the direct range of the imago does not extend to interplanetary distances and that of die imagos converts does not extend beyond immediate personal contact how has the imago reached me had the imago reached itjack assumed the creature was neuter for convenienceor was it merely saying so to fool jack into betraying critical information if he told of the imaget and the gaol had not been converted it could take the imaget from him and destroy it thereby achieving victory but if the gaol had been converted the imaget would be an even more useful tool for the conversion of other key entities aboard this craft giving jack the victory the caterpillars question jack decided not to gamble he remained silent we are at a temporary impasse die gaols translated voice said i control your actions and can cause you to be extinguished but you may be the only available creature who knows the agency by which the imago is reaching me if i do not ascertain this mechanism and abolish it promptly i will be subverted by the imago death is preferable however if i die without ascertaining the mechanism of corruption there is a significant risk that the imago will succeed in corrupting some odier gaol as it did our cyborg and that would put the empire at risk this is not desirable speak you are correct dial the imago is reaching you but i do not regard that as subversion i call it liberation i prefer to wait for your conversion to be complete before giving you information that might enable you to interrupt it i appreciate your point but at the present rate of progression my conversion will not be complete before the mold destroys the key mechanisms of this ship then all of us will die regardless who is ascendant this seems to be no more to your interest than to mine speak the fungus jack had forgotten about that the gao was right the ship was being destroyed while they talked if they all died so would the imaget depriving the imago of its most useful immediate tool it would also deprive tappy of jack and that was apt to be a disaster of another kind the gaol empire might very well succeed in prevailing if jack and die imaget perished together but the gaol captain by its own statement had not yet been converted he could not let it know about the imaget yet so what was he to do i agree diat we arc at an impasse i prefer to save the ship and all our lives but i can not allow the imago to be placed in jeopardy by trusting you what is your offer our loyalties are opposed i must ascertain the detail nature of the imagos direat and survive to report it to my authority you must subvert me so that you can eliminate the threat to the freedom of the imago that i represent we must come to a decision immediately i offer a trade give me the information so that i may relay it to my authority and i will free your will and turn myself and my ship over to you speak that was a considerable offer the empire would know exactly what it faced but this ship under competent command would be at me service of the imago that would allow a fair fight as it piers anthony and philip jose farmer were it was devilishly tempting but there was a flaw in it how can i trust you to keep the deal how can i trust you to provide accurate information the gaol countered it is evident that neither of us has a guarantee but that we can establish a guideline for action that will serve both our purposes this must serve in lieu of trust speak could he believe this jack wished he knew whether the gaol were creatures of honor presumably they would not be able to maintain an enduring empire if they were not consistent in their statements and actions but was that enough he flipped a mental coin and decided to gamble agreed the honkers provided the host of the imago with an imaget which facilitates conversion that imaget is now facilitating your conversion i restore your free will is this imaget the creature malvas projection perceived near the imago host jack found that he could move and speak on his own the gaol had honored part of the deal yes it was planted on the host by a honker and later developed and hatched it identifies with her and enhances her power which is that of the imago i will direct this ship as you command i suggest that you take it aground so that the antidote can be obtained or your life can be saved if the antidote is too late the gaol was honoring more of the deal do the four guard satellites have any living creatures on them none they are robot controlled destroy them a screen lighted on a nearby wall it showed the planet with its satellite guard stations suddenly all four exploded where is the imaget now and how does it reach me the gaol asked this was the critical point if all this was a lie and the satellites had not really been destroyed the captain could renege and jack would be lost but the gaol seemed to be playing it straight and jack had to do the same it is here on my body it has been broadcasting telepathically to you the ship is now descending to ground we were not aware that this creature operated in such manner perhaps its a new model jack said wryly where do you wish the ship to settle jack remembered how tappy was waiting in the grove hiding he wanted to be back with her as soon as possible right where the caterpillars question it was before then open the hatch or whatever so the honkers and i can return to the ground theyll get the fungus antidote the ship will be at rest at that site by the time you have followed the blue line to an exit i will hear any further directives you speak jack looked around there was the blue line again leading away good enough he followed the line it was not the same route as before but that could be because it was more direct they had entered via the landing structure and would exit from a regular portal he turned a corner there before him stood malva looking so real it was hard to believe she was a mere holograph he stopped he knew he should just walk through the image but she was in a dress which revealed so much breast and thigh that he was afraid to touch it even vicariously what do you want the captain has made a deal with you she said this places me in a precarious situation i do not wish to be subverted by the imago you dont have much choice all of the members of this ships complement will be converted i presume you will be useful in some way he did not bother to conceal his distaste agreed all will be subverted unless they arrange to avoid it that is what i wish to do agree to set me free in mind and body on the planet and i will provide you with significant information of interest to you no deal i dont trust you i may not trust you even after youre converted get out of my way she did not move please jack i am desperate you have done what i thought impossible and subverted the captain the victory is yours i will offer you anything you desire only guarantee my freedom no now he resumed motion intending to walk though her image as he should have done before but he collided with her her lush torso pressed against him from breast to thigh as he tried to recover his balance astonished she was here physically now he remembered that he was still naked he started to speak but she cut him off with a kiss i can be extremely accommodating if that is your desire she murmured glancing down i beg you to free me whatever the price of it jack got his hands up and pushed her away i dont want your body i dont like you or trust you i refuse to make any deal piers anthony and philip jose farmer she disengaged offering no resistance will you at least listen i believe you will find it worthwhile jack started scrambling into his clothing look the captain is listening to everything were saying you must be guilty of treason already trying to deal on your own anything you have to tell me ill learn when you are converted this is pointless the captain can not overhear us here i selected this place because i know it is between monitors our dialogue is private as for treason he became guilty of it when he made his deal with you i serve the empire not the captain i wish only to return to the empire and to continue my opposition to the depredations of the imago listen to me then decide whether the information is worth the price of my freedom isnt that fair jack sighed all right tell me and if i think its worth it ill free you you will be set loose on the surface of the planet and not pursued but if you make any attempt to interfere with the imago in any way understood here is my information though the imago you serve may be benign in principle the tool it is presently using is not the thing you call the imaget has no necessary affinity for the imago it was pressed into service by the honkers for a reason of their own i researched it after spying it before bear in mind that i was the only person present at that encounter who was not subsequently corrupted because i used the holo image i alone remained objective i discovered that the imaget has gone by many names over the millennia and that there is a pattern that is far from benign it has formed empires in the past now wait a minute jack exclaimed this little thing could hardly she glanced at his hair where the imaget nestled do you suppose that any creature in its hatchling stage is the same as it is in its maturity all babies are charming what do you think its powers will be when it has grown to a mass greater than your own she was making sense he had been suspicious of the imaget himself malva was independently confirming that suspicion go on the imaget by whatever name enhances the properties of other creatures so effectively that uiey inevitably become dependent on it it encourages this when they can not function without it the power passes from them to it and diey then serve the imaget only the imago has been proof against this and in the past it has been the imago who has brought down empires of the imaget as the caterpillars question it has brought down those of the gaol or other dominant entities it is an irony that the imaget is now serving the imago itself but perhaps the imaget has found a way to add the power of the imago to its own if so the empire that it forms this time will be truly impregnable jack was appalled i cant believe naturally because you are already subverted but you were subverted by the imago before you encountered the imaget so you serve the imago and may be objective enough to appreciate the danger the imago itself is uncorrupted and uncorruptible and this extends to its host perhaps the imaget will simply cast the imago aside when its usefulness is done or confine it in the manner the gaol wish to one empire is very like another in the acquisition and preservation of its power if you are prepared to risk the exchange of one master for another and all that implies ignore this threat jack was silent realizing that she had raised a question which he could not afford to leave unanswered still a single imaget could hardly when the imaget is grown it will reproduce by having its minions plant its eggs on converted creatures and these new hatchlings will ultimately serve the eldest one malva continued once that stage is reached enough jack said i will give you your freedom i will verify this by researching myself and act as i see fit malva smiled thank you may i take a weapon with me to defend myself from wild creatures when i go into the wilderness yes take it jack said absently the honkershow much did they know of this were they working for the imaget instead of the imago could the makers have been a benign empire overthrown by the imaget something like this was all too plausible malva stepped to the side and reached into a recess in the wall she brought out what looked like a twisted pistol and tucked it into her waistband then she followed jack as he resumed progress along the blue line it led to a nether portal with a ramp to the ground the honkers of his raiding party were already there waiting for him jacks dialogue with malva had delayed him fetch the antidote he told the honkers as he descended immediately one went to the ventilation shaft and picked up another small jar release it inside the ship jack said and the honker ascended the ramp and opened the jar piers anthony and philip jose farmer tappy emerged from hiding and ran to jacks embrace as he reached the ground you won she exclaimed joyfully maybe he agreed hugging her but he would have to do his research on the imaget soon because if what malva had told him was true they would have to get rid of the imaget he turned to malva you are free he told her as long as you do no mischief on this planet i think not she said there was a flash and jack lost volition malva drew her pistol and pointed it at jack and tappy you are of course a fool she said did you think that if i researched the imaget i did not share my information with my master we knew about the telepathy and were prepared the gaol captain simply compartmentalized his mind so that only one section was subverted while the dominant section remained independent it was risky letting you invade the ship but it promised to lure the imago into our control so we landed the ship as bait and waited for you to take it jack could not answer because she had not told him to tappy could tell him tobut she was covered by the pistol in any event mere words were pointless in the face of his disastrous misjudgment it hardly mattered at this stage but he wondered whether she had told the truth about the imaget it seemed like a pretty involved story to make up just to persuade him to accept her it had a certain ring of authenticity maybe it was both true and false true research false motive malva gestured with the weapon the two of you enter the ship she said jack started walking toward the ramp tappy followed the honkers remained unmoving he did indeed feel like a fool he should have known malva had never turned against the gaol she had been their agent throughout she had used the pretext of her seeming wish for freedom to lull him into thinking it was safe for tappyand now tappy and the imago were prisoner of the gaol again what a cunning trap they had even saved the ship from destruction by the fungus but if they had anticipated the raid they might have had it fungusproofed anyway and pretended to be suffering the effects so as to complete the deception it was obvious that jack was an amateur up against professionals but malva had forgotten the imaget whatever the truth about it longrange it served him and the imago in the short range the caterpillars question he concentrated reverting it to orient on him as he did so he lost his stasis it had nullified the null as it were he also lost his empathy for living things he acted immediately he grabbed malvas pistol and wrenched it from her hand as he shoved her back then he pointed it at her it had a trigger so he hoped he could fire it if it had a safety she had probably unlocked it since she was not the kind to bluff get to safety tappy he cried tappy hesitated he knew why she didnt want to leave him its no good malva said robots are coming they will obey me not you they will break your bones if the host of the imago does not obey me you forget that i have the pistol jack said then more urgently tappy get out of here tappy started to walk back down the ramp but malva went after her ill be destroyed anyway because of my contact with the imago but i can secure my mission you wont fire because of your empathy she brushed by jack there may be something you dont know about the imaget jack said then he fired the pistol at her chest a strike of lightning came from it it bathed malva in sparks then she fell her face a mask of astonishment jack turned and charged down the ramp after tappy but already the robots were arriving they were roughly humanoid except that they had three legs so that they didnt have to worry about balance they moved down the ramp in pursuit jack started for the ventilation shaft but already the robots were spreading out and forming a circle to close the two of them in jack fired at one and scored but the lightning had no effect on the metal the robots were not likely to hurt either of them just to immobilize them and carry them into the ship because the imago had to be alive and jack was still a living lever to use against tappy but how could the robots be avoided then he saw the stump of the ghosted tree the one that the radiator had destroyed but whose upper structure remained as a shadow outline the honkers had warned them not to go near that shadow but it was within the closing circle of robots and the alternative was to be captured by the gaol maybe it was death to enter it but it was their only chance the tree jack said into the shadow the two of them dived for the shadow chapter light dazzled jack as his head passed through the faint dark of the shadowtree it blinded him and filled his head and his body every one of their cells seemed to glow as if they were thermite and had caught fire he cried out with pain and terror as he fell forward and his hands and knees struck the ground behind him tappy shrieked he had shut his eyes but that did not help at all in making the light less intense he sat up and groped around encountering nothing until he put his hands on the ground since the gloves hindered his sense of touch he took them off and put them in a back pocket of the jeans given to him by candy the net over his head also went there the ground was fairly soft as if it had rained recently it was covered with a short thick grass at least the blades felt like grass but they were softer than that which grew on earth something moved along his cheek a gentle tickling thing which went down his neck then was gone it must be the imaget it had been on tappy but for some reason had just leaped to him then it had crawled down from the top of his hair to his shoulder now that his shirt was between the creature and his skin he no longer felt it or had it jumped back to tappy the imaget he supposed must be as blind as he unless its lack of eyes protected it whatever its state it was not projecting telepathically so that he could see the land around him if that is mere was anything surrounding him there might be nothing but this painful light here here a different dimension certainly a different world and one that might destroy him and tappy the warning the honkers had given them about the shadow had been short and simple do not enter that was almost all the information the honkers could give they had no idea of what would happen the caterpillars question if you did go through it but they knew that the few who had ventured through it had never returned the last one to do so had like jack and tappy used the shadow as an escape from deadly enemies that however had been over a generation ago jack opened his eyes briefly then closed them again though it made no difference in the brightness whether or not he closed his eyelids he could not keep them open his reflexes were ruling him he called out to tappy as he groped around for her he could hear his own voice within his head but it made no sound outside of it that swelled his fright but it subsided somewhat when his hand felt cloth and solid flesh beneath it he ran his fingers over the cloth until he felt a shoulder the net covering her head and shoulders had been removed when he moved his hands down to close over hers he found that she had also taken off her gloves a second later she was embracing and kissing him still in their sitting position they rocked back and forth their arms around each other her face held against the side of his cheek was wet with tears he tried to tell her to take it easy that they would be fine once they mastered their terror and confusion again he could hear his voice circle around in his head without moving the air outside his lips nor could he hear tappy though he could feel her body as it was shaken by sobs and when he released an arm to touch her lips he could feel them moving surely trying to talk to him after a while he got to his feet and pulled her up to stand by him he took her hand and pulled her along after him as he began walking he did not know where he was or where he was going but they just could not stay in one place they would die of thirst if they did and if there was relief from this light or somebody who could help them they had to lookthough look was not the right wordfor refuge and rescue that would be slow going since he had to slide his forward foot along and feel with its toe for dropoffs his face felt as if it were in sunlight though he was sweating no doubt from stress he was not too hot the air was a mild breeze and it slightly cooled him they had gone perhaps a hundred yards when he jumped and he swore a soundless oath something had flicked against his cheek it was soft and momentary but it had felt like the end of a finger the sensation was not caused by the imaget moving across his face it had been too solid to be that the imaget had piers anthony and philip jose farmer been like lightweight velvet sliding across his skin also its body had been too broad to be a fingertip tappy squeezed his arm and moved so close to him that she seemed to be trying to melt her cells into his she was no longer racked with sobs but she was trembling had she felt that soft touch too for gods sake he said whoever you are whatever you are speak to us it was useless to speak his words were imprisoned in his head he still had malvas beamerpistol stuck in his belt and the beamerrifle strapped to his back but it would do no good to fire blindly besides whoever had stroked his cheek probably did not intend to harm him if the toucher did he or she could have done so long before this on the other hand the person or thingmight just be biding his time for what it was then that he smelled a pleasant odor flowers wherever it came from it was carried by the breeze from behind him he turned around sniffing and then pulled tappy along in the direction from which the odor seemed to come i cant see he thought and i cant hear but i can feel and smell im not completely helpless brave words he was whistling in not the dark though this light was no better than complete blackness if he tried to whistle he probably wouldnt hear that the odor which reminded him of tiger lilies became stronger he shuffled on until his leading foot suddenly felt a change in level carefully moving the foot he determined that he was on the edge of a hill or a slight declivity he began going down the gentle slope after a hundred feet he stopped his left hand held out at a downward angle before him felt a stalk he moved it around and encountered many stalks the odor was so powerful that he knew he stood before a mass of flowersif the stalks had flowers they did his hand sliding up a stalk found the head it was sunflower size had nine big petals and a soft spongy center beneath the surface was a slight pulselike throbbing groping around he found others like it then he let loose of them as something long and soft too narrow to be the imaget slithered across the back of his hand an insect a caterpillarlike creature though he had been startled by it he was in one sense reassured a world that had flowers and insects could not be the caterpillars question entirely alien to him and his sense of hearing was not completely gone the rattling of the stalks as he moved them was clear he spoke again hoping that his voice would project beyond his head tappy can you hear me she could not do so the question fluttered around inside his brain and could not escape he patted her shoulder then took his hand from her and slapped his hands together he jumped his heart jumped the clap was as loud as if it had been made on earth there was nothing wrong with his ears except that he could not hear his voice or tappys the echo of the handslapping had just died away when he jumped again a voice spoke from an unknown distance it cried out help help and then the womanit was indeed an adult females voicebegan sobbing jack shivered from a cold not caused by the breeze my god he said though no sound issued from his lips his panic which had dwindled somewhat roared back he felt strange strange strange this could not be the woman who had cried out and was now weeping was malva it was her voice no doubt about that but malva was dead he reached out touched tappy and took her hand it felt clammy she must have recognized the voice of the recently slain woman he wished he could soothe her or at least talk to her then he turned to his right his left side brushing against the flowers his right shoulder brushing against her after some seconds of slow progress he could no longer detect the flowers except for the lessening odor behind him then he stopped malva was no longer crying out but he could faintly hear other voices they became stronger as he led tappy toward them but he halted once more silence had gripped his head again it seemed to be squeezing him i cant take much more of this he thought and tappy must be as close as i am to screaming with the pain of the brightness and a fear that tears the mind apart a screaming only we can hear inside us if this lasts much longer ill start running stumbling around in the light that blinds falling down letting loose of tappy losing her because im so terrified i can only think of myself and of escaping this pain but there is no escape piers anthony and philip jose farmer other voices weak and distant at first then stronger and closer were brought by the breeze blowing against their backs he stopped let them come to him it was pointless to keep moving they were going to die no matter where ihey were then an undercurrent to the approaching voices the sound of running water came to him that was followed by the splash of feet in the stream and suddenly more voices he waited though for what he did not know certainly the voices did not seem hostile they were low and murmurous again he trembled soft ringers had brushed against his cheek he felt tappy become rigid as if she too had been touched once more he quivered and his heart beat harder two hands had seized his face now they were running the tips over his face before they had withdrawn he became bold enough to reach out and do the same thing to the person who was tracing his lineaments the skin was almost as velvety as a babys and the bones below them were fine it had to be a womans then she spokehe could feel her breath issuing from her mouth onto one handand she said son mother jack said he almost fainted it was not only her voice that told him that she was indeed his longdead mother his fingers moving over her face had evoked an artists image it would if he painted it be a portrait of her but she was now a young woman when she had died she had been middleaged close to being old she had borne him when she was fortyeight her time of fertility almost gone the wrinkles and the sags he was so familiar with had disappeared a whisper came to him someone must be speaking very softly to tappy because she had suddenly begun shaking far more violently than before he could not hear her reply of course any more than she would have heard him say mother but she must have tried to utter something things went swiftly after that hands turned them around so that they faced the direction from which they had come they were pushed along past the clusters of flowers went up a long slope were on level ground and then began a long march jack was so numb with shock that he could not resist them what sense was there in doing so anyway yet yet he had met his dead mother he could not speak to her he was being sent away when jack and tappy became tired and slowed down or tried to halt they were urged by gentle but firm hands to pick up the caterpillars question the fast pace again he had no idea how much time had passed he became thirsty and wished that these people would give him water then he thought of the myths and fairy tales where the intruder from earth drank the liquid offered for refreshment and of what happened to the intruder after that he was doomed to live out the rest of his life in the domain of faery and to never see earth again it was better that he refuse water no matter how much he craved it or was he just seized with superstitious dread nothing superstitious about this place he thought it did exist so did its citizens thus he and tappy were in a supernatural or infranatural world the numbness permeating him was good for one thing it seemed to deaden the pain from the light and the pain of being united with his mother for a few seconds and then hurried off but he was not so inwardly frozen that he did not guess that he was being sent away for his own good abruptly the hands held them back since he had heard his mother he had heard no voices now the hands pressed on them and jack finally got the idea they wanted him to get down on all fours he did so feeling with one hand to make sure that tappy was with him for some time he had feared that she had been left behind but she was with him and also on her hands and knees hands pushed on his buttocks tappy stayed where she was for a moment he thought of resisting then he thought that if she were to remain here she would not have been made to get down on all fours he moved ahead until his head scraped against something hard a hand pushed down on his neck he got down lower and resumed crawling the grass was gone the floor seemed to be hard earth then became mud presently he had to go like a snake on his belly if he tried to raise himself his head bumped against stone or what seemed to be stone that did not last long all of a sudden the floor dipped and he was sliding downward on the soft mud then that was behind him and he was lying on hard earth something struck the bottom of his shoes and somebody gasped and then cried jack he turned over and sat up though thick mud coated tappys face it did not conceal her strange expression mother and father were there chapter j jack did not reply at once he rose feeling tired and looked around it had been night when they had plunged through the shadow now it was just past dawn the sky was bright and cloudless but the sun had not come up above the crater wall tappy sat in the mud like a statue shaped from it even the imaget crouched on her shoulder was a hunk of watersoaked earth he did not know where they were on the crater floor the gaol spaceship was not visible and there was no grove of trees like those under the ship nor was there any gaol camp he turned slowly while he looked at the great figures on the crater ring dim objects in the gray light after his survey two things caught his minds focus one was the faint shadow through which they had just exited a fanshaped pile of mud drying at its edge extended from the base of the shadow here had once been a huge boulder which a radiator beam had disintegrated no telling how long ago the crumbled rock was in a heap beneath the deathshadow the outline of which could be barely seen it was close to fading away entirely when it did jack thought that gateway to the other world the world of blinding light would be closed he noted that more than people could enter and then leave that lightfilled world on the other side of the darkness mud could also pass through the dark gate they had gone into that world through the treeshadow beneath the spaceship and they had left it through this bouldershadow they had been pushed back into the world to which they belonged but they had reentered far from the point of entry the caterpillars question darkness implied light there were no shadows without light and the deathshadow was caused by the blinding light at least it seemed so to him this place was comparatively close to where he and tappy had gone in probably it was the first time that this had happened he did not doubt that it had been no accident those people the dead who were not really dead had pushed them through this particular gate for a purpose what the purpose was he did not know but he wondered if the second object that had caught his attention was involved in the purpose that was a rosered cutquartz stone not sixty feet from where he stood it was the model of the tiny stone jack had seen centered in the model of the real craterwall rings the model he had seen on the table when he was in the underground complex a seat and a back a throne had been carved out of the desksized quartz according to the integrator the first honkers to enter the crater had found it though they did not know who had made it they assumed that it was the work of the makers but it was obviously designed for a honker or a human and not for a quadruped by then tappy had risen shakily from her sitting position her tears were washing the mud from her face her hands were clasped just below her breasts he did then what he would have done at once if he had not been so stunned he went to her and held her while she wept a few seconds later he was weeping also my mother she spoke to me and my father did too they only said my name but i recognized their voices my mother jack said she spoke only one word to me but i felt her face and you heard malva too what was that place she said some place where the dead live heaven for all i know he had never believed that there was an afterlife at times he had hoped that there might be but he had no faith that there was it was a fairy tale which rational people knew was a fairy tale but now how could we have gotten there she said her sobs were tapering off theres only one way to get there and we didnt die i dont know he said i could guess its possible that the radiator was designed to be a weapon but it had some unforeseen side effects unexpected byproducts one was that the shadows created by the radiator accidentally opened the way to what piers anthony and philip jose farmer do i call it heaven a parallel universe i dont know what it is but it exists if the makers made the radiators they would have ignored the shadows after a few of them ventured into the shadows and didnt come back not to their knowledge anyway they wouldve had no idea they had serendipitously opened the gates of heaven or whatever you want to call it anyway what good would it have done them if they had known except maybe the certainty dial death is not the end even that he thought is not certain what if the world into which we dived is just one that affects the minds of intruders its so alien to us that we cant comprehend it its physical structure or whatever is beyond human understanding so the mind constructs something that can be understood something it desires more than anything else an afterlife what the mind cant grasp it interprets as something else if this was so it would have to be an effect dial all humans interpreted as the same otherwise why would tappy have shared his hallucinations if they were such he was the everskeptical rationalist tappy however once over her tears was certain that she had been even if for a short time in the place where the dead lived perhaps she was right she might have a deeper rationality whatever deeper rationality meant in any event he was not going to try to invalidate her belief she took great comfort in it and she needed all she could get and his thought was interrupted by a coldness thrilling through him wait a moment just hold up how had he overlooked it but he had been numb still was somewhat and he could be forgiven for forgetting tappy he said your mother how could you be sure that that woman is your dead mother i was told by your relatives when i picked you up diat youd never known your mother didnt ask them why not i just took their word but if youd never known her if she died at birth or something how would you know her she stared at him then said i remember her now those fingers on my face her voice i knew nodiing of her until that moment then i remembered her it all came back i was three years old when i last saw her id been sleeping where was it our little house on the edge of the town called tappuah tappuah means the place of apples something like that i can still the caterpillars question remember that wonderful smell from the orchards the humans hat lived there had come from another place i dont know where tbere were many honkers too traders mostly but i played with their children and i learned their language i was happy there then one night i was awakened my parents told me to keep quiet i didnt know what was going on but i was frightened so scared that i didnt make a peep then i was being carried by my father through darkness i think it was the forest up in the hills by the town all of a sudden a great light from above shone through die big trees a very very loud voice mustve been from a loudspeaker in an aircraft said something about surrendering but my parents kept on running and then then she choked it was a minute or so before she could continue then there was a different light a scarletcolored beam that swept through the forest and cut through trees they fell with a terrible sound by then i was screaming despite my mothers commands to keep quiet then i heard shouts men yelling they must have been the gaol humans who were hunting us my father stopped and put me into a hole in a tree he told me to stand still and not move an inch otherwise id fall into the shaft behind me i was standing on a very narrow ledge and hanging on with all my strength to the edge of the hole the lights got brighter but the scarlet ray quit coming maybe it had been turned off and then my father turned to help my mother into the hole but she broke into a long and loud weeping jack put his arm around her and held her until she could talk again her face against his breast she said oh god then there was a glare and i could see that my mother had fallen onto the ground her legs were cut off her blood was spouting out of the stumps spraying my fathers legs i was still screaming then my father grabbed me with one hand and lifted me up by my clothes and got halfway into the hole he knew i suppose that the gaol wouldnt shoot at him while he was very close to me they didnt want to kill me and then have to start searching for the imago again my father held me in his arms and he jumped we fell down the shaft not very far i think and men we were suddenly in bright daylight he landed with his knees bentstrange how that little detail sticks in my mindand he staggered but he put me down and pulled a beamer from his belt and shot its ray upward i remember just glimpsing a ledge projecting out over the top of the cliff we must have dropped through a gate in the stone he blew piers anthony and philip jose farmer up the projection with the ray there mustve been explosives or something inside the shaft in the other world anyway it exploded and i suppose destroyed the gate the rocks and the dust rained over us but my father covered me with his body he was hurt protecting me though not bad enough so he couldnt lift me and carry me off i was still screaming with terror and with grief for my mother she paused doubtless to scan the memories that had surged up from the unconscious breaking loose through the barrier there then she spoke again her voice less quivery i remember now though its vague being in a great cavern complex before we went to tappuah maybe it was the same as the one we were in i dont know anyway its coming back part of it anyway it was there i first learned honkerese and english the english which humans speak on the planet after a while we went to tappuah maybe the pressure from the gaol was off and my parents thought it was safe to live with humans again they mustve been sick from being under the ground mustve longed for the open air and the sunlight i know now that my parents and a few other humans and some honkers were part of a secret organization dedicated to fighting the gaol plotting against them anyway she was silent again when she resumed speaking she talked with a low voice and in broken phrases it was as if she were sweeping the fragments of the life she remembered into a basket then was picking up the pieces from the basket without regard to order once i overheard my parents talking they were saying something about the light that glowed from me when i was born a light that lasted for an hour or so by that diey knew that the imago was inside me of course i didnt know what the imago was and i forgot all about it when my mother was killed that wiped out all my memory of my infancy and early childhood later i forgot my life from the time my mother was killed to the time the airplane crashed and killed my father and crippled me i could not talk after that my tongue seemed frozen along with much else that was frozen i lived but i was halfdead when you came along you started the thawing out i began to live again though not fully but i knew that you were the person id been waiting for to love me father mother and lover squeezed into my person jack thought also the knight in shining white armor who rode up to rescue her in reality the doubtful knight the caterpillars question he said your socalled relatives who raised you melvin and michaela daw were they part of the antigaol organization she nodded and she said they must have been i think theyre part of a very small band that went to earth they did so probably because they knew that id have to flee to someplace the gaol didnt know much about or care about the gaol have probably been aware of earths existence for some time but they didnt move in on it they think that overpopulation and pollution will soon cause the collapse of civilization on earth millions will die and the earthpeople will revert to savagery then theyll be easy pickings at least thats what i once heard my father say when he didnl know i was around anyway to get back to the couple taking care of me the daws they were in grave danger and they knew i was the host for the imago thats why they were not as loving to me as they should have been they couldnt treat me as if i were an ordinary child sometimes though they broke through their fear and awe and tried to love me but i was a terrible burden to them of course i didnt know that then still he said they knew that the chrysalis in you wouldnt become die imago until you were mature why did they advertise for someone to take you to that institution when you were so young he paused then said and why did they pick me to do that she pulled herself loose from his embrace and began pacing back and forth he smiled she carried the imago within her yet she looked as if she were the least likely vessel for such a great thing no not a thing an entity of unprecedented and unparalleled importance she was the very essence of the dirty and tattered waif of back alleys of the most forlorn and rejected type of human finally she said i think that the gaol may have been getting too close to the trail they had to hide me someplace else before they fled or i dont know not really they werent going to send me to the institution they knew that i didnt have time to mature the gaol would catch me before i did if i stayed on earth they had to take a chance send me back to this planet first though they advertised for someone to transport me to vermont i do know they interviewed at least a score of wouldbe drivers for me and they rejected all until you came by that is piers anthony and philip jose farmer why me the paintings she said halting to look into his eyes beneath the mud was a face almost shining with exultance or exaltation the paintings but he knew before she spoke what she was going to say the paintings in the makers burial chamber they showed a male youth holding a painters brush in his hand you you were a painter and you were a young man i think that they thought maybe were absolutely suretfiat you were the one the makers prophesied predicted anyway he snorted and he said prophecy prediction she shrugged before speaking it seems farfetched but who knows how much the makers knew or how powerful their predictions could be maybe they figured out something on a probability basis maybe they counted on someone fulfilling the prophecy maybe they could see into the future or maybe the paintings have been wrongly read they mightve meant something other than the antigaol honkers and humans thought it meant but the antigaols brought it about that what they thought had to happen did happen even if theyd misread the paintings after all what we think is a painters brush in the youths hand in the maker painting might be something else youve gone a long way since i first met you he said youve grown up fast no thirteenyearold i know could reason like you do im fourteen now she said not counting the pseudoyears you implanted in my mind he had many more questions based on the fragments shed muttered but they had to get going they walked toward a long double line of tall plants and found a creek between them though the water was very cold they plunged into it and did not leave it until their bodies and clothes were clean the image stayed in the creek only long enough to wash the mud off after that it waited on the bank until the humans spread the wet garments out in the sun and then sprawled naked in its warmth it crawled onto tappy and snuggled between her beasts after about twenty minutes all three were dry and beginning to toast jack was about to open his eyes and get up when he heard a honking he jumped up staring around tappy rose and stood by his side wed better find them he said the caterpillars question but wed better make sure theyre friendly she said there are traitors among the honkers just as there are among humans not many ive been told but we cant be too careful he listened trying to determine the direction from which the honking came halfway around in his turning he jumped with alarm a honker had stepped out from behind a tree tappy cried out with relief and welcome she followed this with a series of blasts the honker was the integrator but not in the condition he had been in at the gaol spaceship one eye had been gouged out one hip tentacle was waving wildly but the other was missing a bandage concealed its stump dark bruises were scattered over his face and body and his chest had long bright red rakemarks on it the snake around his neck bore a wound close to its head though this did not keep it from extending part of its body toward tappy and hissing loudly the navelbeasts mouth and paws were caked with dried blood the shaman had suffered grievous wounds during some struggle but he had not been defeated raised high in one hand was the severed head of a gaol he honked loudly and tappy murmured its the head of the gaol captain behind him came candy then other latest some limping or being supported by their fellows a moment later an aircraft a vessel designed to carry a score or more floated from the brush the caterpillars question chapter jack strode toward the shaman what happened he cried what happened the integrator of course did not understand him jack asked tappy who was behind him to interpret for him but the shaman dropped the gaol head hobbled to her fell on his knees and put his bloodied arms around her legs his head was bent back as he stared up at her and honked loudly she said hes dumbfounded how did we get out of the land of the shadow he says that no one who goes through the deathshadow ever returns to tiiis land he cannot understand it the other latest fallen silent listened while she told her story to die shaman then he got up to his feet somewhat shakily and he began to dance the others joined him jack waited until the jubilation had died down somewhat now he said ask him what happened back there she did so but first the shaman had the head brought to him while he issued a long series of blasts he waved the ghastly head around and his tentacle thrashed his one good eye glared and the snake and the navelbeast twisted frenziedly these two had aided the integrator greatly in his struggle with the captain and the shamans tentacles had spurted poison into him the gaol must have felt as if he had been attacked by five people not just one aged honker nevertheless the captain had fought well the other honkers interspersed their comments or encouragement while the shaman talked perhaps these were their equivalent of right on or hallelujah amen toward the end the shamans excitement swept through them and they began a war dance waving their spears stomping their feet mockfighting and whirling around and around the sun glistened on the fungusdeterrent grease they had smeared on their bodies their feet slamming onto the hard earth made a primitive beat which echoed in the ears and the blood even jack was not unaffected by it when the shaman had finished his warriors continued making a hullabaloo candy had come up to jack meanwhile but stood without speaking her right shoulder and left leg had been wounded but these were healing swiftly they saw us escape through the deathshadow tappy said however theyre too strongly conditioned against going through the shadows millennia of taboos keep them from even getting close to them plus horror stories about them they would die before theyd enter one and dying would go to that world anyway jack thought the airboat which the honkers had appropriated from the spaceship was speeding across the plain it contained only one person the pilot apparently it was simple to operate otherwise flic untrained honker wouldnt be able to handle it as soon as we jumped dirough the shadow they fled into the woods only two of them being hit one killed one wounded tappy continued when they got there they released the venomous flies they hadnt had a chance to let loose in the ship because the bubbles had enclosed them too swiftly then the three with beamers shot at the robots the flies injected their venom in the human gaol who followed the robots and the gaol dropped where they stood cyborgs came out too and the flies bit their metal coverings in vain but enough stung the few areas of exposed flesh surface to paralyze them too this discouraged the few surviving gaol candy and the latest could have gotten away down the shaft inside the tree but the shaman feared that the ships heavy rays would be used to excavate the earth and pursue the warriors until they were caught and wiped out so he gave the order to charge they lost a few but they got all those who had come out of the ship then the integrator had all the flies released inside the ship he thinks that the detectors in the ship werent set for anything which had a mass as small as the flies did or the detectors werent working because the fungus had gotten to them in any event the flies swarmed all over the ship barred only from entering rooms with closed hatches there werent many of those and none of the crew except the captain was protected then by a bubble but the captain still had his involition radiator jack said not by then tappy said she gave a short nervous laugh piers anthony and philip jose farmer the fungus was still working in some parts of the ship it caused malfunctions in the involition radiator mechanism it mightve been quickly repaired if the technicians hadnt been paralyzed or killed or locked in rooms with closed hatches the automatic mechanicalrepair devices were also malfunctioning but he did order robots to troubleshoot the circuits they mightve done the job in time to restore the radiator before the honkers entered but they had a big task because so much equipment and so many cables were impaired how did the integrator know that jack said id think hed have been afraid to venture into the ship he sent candy to scout it she isnt subject to the involition broadcaster why should she be the gaol had her programmed to do all they wanted her to do it never occurred to them when they made her that she would resist their commands they didnt figure on the imago empathy affecting her and and she went in and looked the situation over and then returned to report and the honkers stormed on in right but by then the captain who had been in the bubble had managed to get a gassupplier to him by a stillfunctioning robot i suppose i dont think he could have communicated with the robot by radio or whatever means he normallyused the equipment for that wouldve been impaired by the fungus he probably used hand signals or whatever to tell the robot to bring protective cloths and a gassupplier to him the supplier was some sort of scuba device according to the integrator the captain was protected against the fly bites by heavy blankets thrown over his exterior skeleton by gloves and so forth also brought by the robot the captain was out of the bubble and just about to operate the ship controls manually when the latest showed up the integrator said he doubts that the captain could have worked the controls because the fungus probably hadwrecked all the electrical circuits anyway the integrator attacked the captain in the control room instead of just shooting the captain who didnt have a weapon yet he tackled him with bare hands why jack said that was stupid not by honker standards its something to do with their honor and prestige anyway the shaman and the captain had an awful struggle while the other honkers stood by and watched theyd the caterpillars question been ordered not to interfere of course if the gaol won then the bonkers could shoot him despite losing an eye and a tentacle the shaman strangled the captain and then cut off his head as a trophy the honkers will sing a song about the epic fight for a long time sing they cant sing their equivalent anyway the latest were jubilant and should be they had from their viewpoint won a great victory but it was really only a very small battle which did not affect the course of the war the gaol empire was set back a trifle and it would not be long before their forces would be here if indeed they were not already here he looked at the sky only a few wispy clouds floated there however there could be hundreds of spacedreadnoughts assembled in a stationary orbit and he would not be able to see them tappy put her hand on his arm look he turned here came the airboat shooting across the plain though he could not distinguish individual figures at this distance from it he could see that the interior of the vessel was crowded with honkers something else had also been loaded into the airboat by the time that it stopped about forty feet from him he recognized the gaol cyborg garth it was partly exposed through the pile of honkers on it the canopy slid back honkers spilled out reminding him of the tiny circus cars from which a seemingly unending line of clowns emerged other honkers had unloaded a collapsible wooden ramphow had they crammed that into the vessel and had propped it up against the edge of the canopy garth rolled out of the boat on his wheels when it had gotten to the ground the honkers pulled the ramp away the integrator spoke to an aide and she hurried to the pilot and conversed with him then the canopy slid shut the boat rose turned and accelerated away garth came speedily to tappy it whistled a long series of dots and dashes when it stopped candy said garth says that it is ready to interpret for the commander of the fleet fleet jack said but he knew what she meant candy pointed upward he looked again at the sky and still saw only clouds garth has been receiving messages for the last half hour candy said piers anthony and philip jose farmer tappy spoke as if she were suddenly short of breath what did the commander say she wants to send down a negotiator hell come down in a small vessel and hell be alone and unarmed he just wants to present the empires demands i thought he wanted to negotiate the gaol dont know the difference between demanding and negotiating you should know that jack yeah know candy when does the commander want the meeting to take place as soon as possible tell garth to tell the commander shell get the time of the meeting shortly we have to confer about it first while the android was whistling at the cyborg jack swiftly considered the possible consequences of permitting the gaol to come down in the spaceboat why this facetoface confrontation why not just talk via garth it could not be because the commander wanted a close look at the situation she could see them as clearly through her instruments as if she were hovering just above them maybe she thought that her demands would be much more powerful if they were delivered personally issuing from a scarylooking creature with its ratcagebody its brutal face and its lack of brainpan the demands would have an impact that could not be matched by messages relayed via garth but then the gaol probably did not think of themselves as frighteningly alien and horrible on the other hand they must have observed that their appearance did nauseate the bipedal species they had encountered see a gaol feel like throwing up it was an anthropocentric reaction but it was natural the gaol would not wish to destroy the imagos host except as a last resort did the gaol believe that this situation demanded that tappy be killed he did not think so it had not developed to the point where they would say screw it and then kill her not yet anyway though it could jead to that it was not likely that the negotiators boat was armed or equipped with an atom bomb the gaol would not have to depend upon that to kill tappy if the commander decided that that was the only solution to their problem missiles launched from the orbiting ships could do that work much more effectively and with no warning at all the caterpillars question he told candy and tappy what he had been thinking the gaol boat might be equipped with remotecontrolled machinery he said controlled either by the negotiator or more likely from the spaceship by the commander she might have ideas about abducting you tappy i dont know how but im thinking of something like paralyzing gas sprayed from it then the boat opening up and scooping you into it and taking off the negotiator would be sacrificed but they wouldnt care they agreed and so did the integrator when they explained what they had been talking about jack told candy to send a message through garth the boat must land at least half a mile from us jack said the negotiator will walk to us just after he leaves the boat it will ascend when its at least a hundred miles above the surface the negotiator can start walking toward us tell the commander hat you have radar capabilities and can ascertain that the boat rises to the agreedupon altitude and youll know immediately if it starts to go below that height garth whistled candy said he says he doesnt have longrange radar the commander probably doesnt know that even if she checks up on the specs for garths type of cyborg and they dont indicate he has radar she cant be sure we havent installed the equipment in him the airboat had returned it was as packed with passengers as during the first haul they spilled out the number of males being the same as the number of females now that he thought of it the first load had been an equal division of the sexes that was strange because the warriors who had attacked the ship had been mostly male the women and men were covered with war paint black white and red stripes interspersed among these were stars and triple crosses the women bore crimson sixpointed stars and the men bore blue fivepointed stars the triple crosses were all purple edged with yellow the foreheads of both sexes were marked with three concentric circles the outer circle was white the next circle black the inner circle blue around the womens navels were three similarly colored concentric circles the navels were painted a bright rosy red the mens penises were decorated with three red wavy lines radiating from the longitudinal axis the same number of wavy piers anthony and philip jose farmer lines colored blue spread out from each side of the womens vaginas and across the upper thighs the second boatload had brought brushes and paint pots with them they proceeded at once in the midst of much honking and gesticulating to paint the first boatload what were they up to jack thought they certainly were not going to attack the gaol negotiator probably they were getting ready for some sort of magical ceremony though they were far advanced in biological science and technology they were otherwise primitives they believed in magic that at least was the impression he had gotten during his brief but intense experiences with them but he could be mistaken garth whistled when he was done candy said the commander agrees to your terms everything will be done as you wish the boat will land in approximately an hour ask the commander if we can get a preview of the offers thatll be made by the negotiator jack said we can think them over while were waiting for him in less than a minute the commanders reply was relayed by candy she prefers that the negotiator deliver the terms in person okay jack said we cant force her he wondered what the gaol were planning it would be nothing good for anybody in this camp and especially not for tappy during the hour allotted five more boatloads of honkers came the sixth was jammed with cooking utensils and food jack asked tappy to ask the integrator about the reason for bringing in all these people also she should ask him why diey were all painted by then the shaman had also been decorated tappy after a brief exchange widi the shaman said hell only say that this is all for uh she cocked her head as she did so often when thinking hard uh the best translation would be for the big showdown showdown jack said yes and thats all hell say how the hell could this be a showdown and how would he know it is he wont say anything more about it dont press him jack its not the honker way hed be offended he knows or thinks he knows much more man i do more than you too right tappy the caterpillars question yes i think so i hope so jack strode back and forth fuming and muttering to himself sometimes he believed that he was the leader the captain the man with the ultimate authority the integrator had let him make decisions and so deluded him into believing that he was the leader but when the shaman wanted to do certain things he just ignored jack tappy was looking even more distraught than when they had first come to this place in fact she seemed to be coiling in on herself she needed consolation moral support assurance and love he started toward her to give her what she needed garths whistles halted him he stopped and went back to candy by the time he got there the cyborg had quit speaking the android said the commander says dial the spaceboat will soon be in sight jack went to tell tappy and the integrator but the shaman was busy marshaling his people into three stillragged concentric circles which had the rosered throne as its center he was honking away and his aides were pushing and pulling their charges into their places everybody had a short stick with a gourd at its end these had come with the food and cooking utensils but had not been unloaded until a few minutes ago the commander viewing this scene from her spaceship must be as uncertain about this activity as he was jack thought then the entire group of latest blasted out a sustained sound while doing this they looked upward and lifted their sticks and rattled the gourds with a mighty noise jack also gazed upward the spaceboat was a black dot in the blue sky it swelled quickly and became a small needleshaped vessel the honkers went back to their preparations for whatever they were going to do chapter just to make sure that the vessel would land at the distance indicated a cross of stones had been laid out jack had not sent a message to this effect he had assumed that the gaol would figure it out but the spaceboat settled down at a spot one hundred and eighty degrees north of the cross either he thinks theres a trap prepared under the cross or hes just contrary jack muttered to himself it was also possible however that the negotiator was not as intelligent as he should be or that the cross symbol meant nothing in the gaol culture a hatch on the side of the vessel opened a ramp rolled out and the negotiator walked out the ramp slid back inside the hull the hatch closed and the vessel shot upward it soon disappeared about two minutes later garth whistled a message candy said the boat has now attained the agreedupon altitude if the commander is not lying then the gaol was walking across the plain waddling a little because of its turtlelike underplate his skin was much darker than that of the other gaol jack had seen he had much higher cheekbones and his eye sockets were square not round the gaol like humans must have differentiated into races during their evolution behind jack the honkers were still noisy as they organized the arrangement of the circles a few seconds later the integrator joined jack tappy candy and garth he had turned over the directorship to an aide jack saw the shaman out of the comer of his eye but when he turned his head toward him he was startled the severed head of the gaol captain lay at the shamans feet jack did not think that this defiant gesture was diplomatic surely the negotiator would be offended and so would the fleet commander who would be looking at the head right now the caterpillars question jack started to ask tappy to tell the shaman that he had acted antactfully then he closed his mouth why not show the ratcages hat they were not quivering with fear of them i wonder what the negotiator is going to say tappy said nervously her hands were clasped on her stomach and her face was even more drawn he hugged her briefly and said well find out its going to be okay tappy the integrator is planning something bad real bad for the gaol im sure of that the words were for her he did not feel as confident as he sounded presently the gaol halted a few feet from them he glanced at the head lying at the shamans feet if he was affected by it in any way he did not show it he lifted his hands above his head and locked the thumbs candy said that means he comes m peace and he plans no treachery with your permission ill reply for you jack nodded she imitated the gaols gesture the gaol lowered his hands and whistled for at least a minute candy interpreted ill condense his speech if it is your will much of it is bragging about the might of the empire jack said fine as long as you dont omit anything important he says that this business could have been settled long ago if we nongaol were not subject to irrationality but the emperor has taken this into account therefore since irrationality makes us delay the inevitable and we are procrastinators the emperor gives us more time than is necessary to make up our minds to accept what must be he says that we must deliver the imago to the commander of the fleet when we do that no harm will come to those who have fought the empire you jack may live here as long as you wish in fact the emperor in his magnanimity will leave this planet alone the gaol will stay away from it you will have four hours to consider the terms and to decide what a gaol would have decided within a minute the emperor is patient and what if we still persist m being irrational jack said harshly what if we refuse to surrender the imago candy whistled the negotiators expression did not change his speech this time was much shorter candy said he says that the emperor is patient but his patience is almost at an end this time the imago will not piers anthony and philip jose farmer escape even if they have to search every square meter of the planet on or below its surface they will do so and they will find it if in our irrationality we decide to kill the host and so release the imago we wil all be killed indeed all life on this planet will be destroyed it will be so radioactive and so fragmented nothing will ever again live here moreover now that the empire has become aware of the native planet of the hosts mate and it knows that there are gates to earth it will destroy earth too he says to think of that earthman before you defy the empire tappy gasped and she gripped jacks hand her hand felt very cold and damp the negotiator whistled candy said he says that the emperors terms have been delivered there is no use continuing the meeting he will be leaving as soon as his boat returns jack thought of telling candy to thank the gaol for being such an excellent negotiator sarcasm however would probably ricochet off the gaols thick skull presently the boat landed before walking the half mile back to it the negotiator whistled again then it turned and waddled away candy said he said that the four hours allowed us start the moment he enters the boat the integrator honked tappy replied the shaman honked again then she spoke to jack ive told him what we and the gao said he says that four hours should be enough if that is all goes as he hopes it will and if the gaol dont break their word that well have that time but itll be uh how can i put it after frowning for a moment she said itll be nip and tuck it also will be chancy iffy but we have to do it do what jack said close to snarling with frustration tappy shrugged and lifted up her hands i dont know and he wont tell me but he says itll be selfevident the way of the honker jack said the shaman blasted again at tappy then his body movements expressing impatience he took tappys hand and led her away jack candy and garth followed her by then he had become aware that the weather had changed the sun was suddenly blocked when he looked up he saw that grayish clouds covered it they scudded along driven by a wind whose force the caterpillars question was only beginning to be felt on the surface the gentle breeze here had picked up a bit and hinted that it was going to get stronger to the west beyond the crater wall black clouds towered lightning very far away flashed briefly and weakly but the menacinglooking clouds would soon be over the crater floor itself bringing with them the lightning he wondered if the gaols viewing instruments could penetrate electrical storms if not the honkers would be helped they could do whatever they were going to do without alarming the gaol by then the honkers had completed making three perfect circles they were standing still listening to their group leaders he supposed that they were still giving instructions or maybe a pep talk then several leaders and a number of people in the lines began honking loudly and pointing up and outward jack said my god the tops of the dark hemispheres rising above the crater wall startled him so much that he did not immediately recognize them for a few numbing seconds he was completely at a loss as they continued to rise their nature became evident he said again my god they were gaol spaceships he groaned but within seconds he was yelling at candy tell garth to ask the gaol commander whats the meaning of this he waved at the spaceships candy whistled at the cyborg while waiting jack turning slowly counted the vessels as if it made any difference how many there were there were fifteen each stationed about a mile apart from each other they had the same structure as the one which the honkers had invaded that they could be seen at twentyfive miles distance and in this pale light meant that they were enormous indeed the empire was showing some of its awesome muscle garth whistled then candy said the commander does not acknowledge the message but the ships did not move after they had risen in their entirety above the crater wall they were going to hover there until until when they might wait until the four hours are up jack thought they have to if we did intend to cave in to them and give tappy up theyd be screwing up by moving in now he relaxed somewhat piers anthony and philip jose farmer the integrator had quit staring at the ships now he was again leading tappy by her hand his obvious destination was the rosered cutquartz throne jack followed them when the two went through the three lines of honkers toward the stone he did the same behind him came candy and garth nobody tried to stop them the moment he was inside the inner circle however the lines began moving the latest in them shuffled along honking softly the group leaders had taken the places left empty for them until now jack counted the number of people in each circle ninety in the inner ring ninety in the next ring one hundred and eighty in the outer ring three hundred and sixty altogether a compass card had three hundred and sixty points the numbers of honkers in the circles were directly related to the compass card points thus since there were three hundred and sixty images and symbols on the craterwall ring there had to be some relationship between the dancers and the paintings the images and symbols were still visible though they would not be when the storm struck they moved with majestic slowness seeming to be as patient as eternity itself patient for what he thought they had not been set here without purpose the integrator had led tappy to the throne which faced west he made gestures that she should sit down in it before she had finished doing that a honker handed die shaman a tall conical cap topped by a stiff paper model of the three crater rings then he gave him a crooked wooden staff at the end of which was a carving of a makers face thus accoutered the integrator glared around him his empty eye socket seeming even fiercer than the other eye he gestured at jack and his companions when they came to him he pushed and pulled until candy was at the south end of the throne garth was at the north end and jack was at the east end though he was placed so he faced east jack did not keep his back to tappy he turned around to keep an eye on her the shaman did not try to make him face eastward again he was too busy dancing and honking and waving the staff in front of tappy meanwhile the people in the three circles had stepped up their pace a little the inner ring was moving counterclockwise the middle ring clockwise the outer ring counterclockwise the crater ring rotated counterclockwise if there were indeed two other rings as the models indicated then these probably rotated in the same directions as the two outer circles of honkers the caterpillars question jack thought what the hell is this magic a form of sym pathetic magic where things desired are simulated thus the primitive practice of trying to cause rainfall by pouring water in this case simulating the operation of the three circles would cause them to rotate but they were already moving at least the inner crater ring was moving and he assumed that the other rings were also rotating why then were they performing a sympathetic magical rite the pace was being stepped up again the stomping of feet was faster and louder the shaking of the gourds was faster all were honking the same chant of course jack thought theyre trying to make the great wheels set in the crater go faster oh god what a waste of time we should be thinking about ideas to get tappy away from the gaol but the integrator knew that his world and jacks would be destroyed if an attempt was made to spirit her away moreover there was just no way of escape for her none none at all what about a gate not the bouldergate to earth but another gate to another world no use even if they had one and surely the integrator would have told them about it if one was available the gaol would ruin forever the two planets and they would keep on hounding tappy until they caught her the integrator was using this magical ritual because it was his only hope to save the imago not to mention himself jack thought but the shaman might know somediing that he and tappy did not know and for some reason should not know just now maybe they were being kept ignorant because of the gaol if these did catch him and tappy they might gouge out of them the truth about the ringswhatever that wasand thus thwart whatever it was that the integrator planned jack just did not know and he was helpless to do anything but watch this useless ritual his mind was spinning like a centrifuge an empty centrifuge suddenly there was a silence the shaman had lifted the staff and shaken it three times at that signal the latest had stopped bodi their honking and their dancing the integrator spun around to face tappy jack could not see her face but he imagined that it reflected the terror and confusion she surely must be feeling piers anthony and philip jose farmer the shaman threw his staff up in the air bent over seized tappys blouse and tore it open one hand threw away the blouse and the other reached outhe did not even lookand caught the staff as it came down toward earth it had whirled three times while aloft tappy gasped then the honkers blew one long strong blast immediately they began dancing and chanting again stomping their feet more swiftly and harder jack could feel the earth tremble slightly beneath his feet the integrator reached with his free hand and touched the imaget which was almost invisible in tappys brownish hair it did not move he gently picked it up and placed it over her left breast at this the honkers not only moved forward faster they began whirling and their honking was so loud that it hurt jacks ears jack thought is this going to go on for four hours ill go crazy so will tappy then he cried out with horror the integrator had moved one step closer to tappy the tentacle had lifted and it had plunged its poisonous tooth into her breast it came out swiftly from the flesh but some of the poison had been injected tappy had not flinched when struck she sat as stiffly as before her head unmoving staring at the west jack came out of his numbness and started to crouch before jumping over the throne so that he could attack the shaman he meant to kill him but two very strong hands gripped him from behind a blast of air ruffled the hair on the back of his head and a blast of sound did deafen him for a second he struggled and could not move candy called out to him he could barely hear her he wouldnt harm her its all right its part of the ritual shes just partly paralyzed for a little while that makes her more open to the imagets channels candy must be guessing but what she said made sense he quit struggling after a few seconds the hands withdrew open to the imagets channels for what the shaman was bent over so that his headnose almost touched hers jack could not hear what he was saying but he would not have understood it anyway was the shaman speaking to her or to the imago through her whatever he was telling her his tense gestures made him look as if he were giving her instructions which he was repeating over and over if she heard him she the caterpillars question did not respond with any body movements but her lips might be moving the storm was coming closer the dark clouds overhead forerunners of the blacker and energyshot body were moving more swiftly the breeze was a wind now blowing his hair and tappys toward the east and raising dust clouds the integrator had lowered a chin strap to keep his conical hat from being blown off the rains had passed over the western wall of the crater their drops looked like a solid silvery plate with discolorations running down here and there the gaol ships hovering there had disappeared behind the rain he turned back to watch tappy he caught his breath she was shining the glow was bright about the strength of a dozen watt light bulbs but it was becoming brighter spreading out from her as if the windows of her flesh were slowly opening that glow came from deep within her he shouted the imago and then he cried out again but uttered no words the fleet above the eastern wall was moving slowly toward the center of the crater chapterq abruptly the row of spaceships was veiled as rain struck a few seconds later the vessels faded away entirely the downpour slashed into the center of the plain drenching the area around the throne the thunder boomed loudly as if it were a vast boulder rolling down a mountain a lightning bolt like the flaming crooked cane of a blind god slammed into the earth nearby a tree cracked into two parts one of which toppled over despite the drenching the thunder and the lightning the honkers kept on dancing and chanting jack had jumped when the bolt had hit the tree but he had been looking at tappys back when it happened she had not moved nor did she seem affected by the rain and the cold her brownish hair had turned black with the water that was the only change the light emanating from her was as bright as before the full rage of the storm it pushed back the darkness brought by the clouds and the deluge although he was shivering with fright and cold jack felt a tiny warmth deep inside him the integrator had done it somehow he had evoked the imago but he could not have done it until tappy had matured just when that had taken place he did not know nor did he know the definition of maturity somewhere along the line of time she had passed from girlhood into full womanhood it had happened very recently otherwise the integrator would have performed this ritual before now he had been waiting for the unseen moment to occur in fact he must have been very nervous because he knew that the gaol would be down on them like a lioness leaping on a zebra maturity had come to her as silently and as unseen as the moment when a peach ripened and was ready for eating yet the integrator had felt it or had he been so desperate that he the caterpillars question had started the ritual but had not known if she was ready for it it did not matter now she had passed from human chrysalis into human imago just as the imagowhich had really been a chrysaliswas now an imago jack the eternal questioner could not help wondering who had made the imago it seemed to him that the makers had done it they seemed to have been able to cross the bridge from the physical to the superphysical or the supernatural the infraphysical the deathshadow caused by the action of the radiator indicated that had the makers been trying to find a gate into other worlds which were not physical worlds as earthpeople defined such and had they accidentally opened a gate into the afterlife itself a gate they could not use had this experimental project also revealed that the makers could construct an entity such as the imago though it was artificial it was immortal and it could be used only under certain conditions either the imago had been made because of the challenge of the gaol or it been made before the gaol had risen like the temperature of a malignant fever to spread through the universe the latter event seemed more reasonable whatever the chronology the makers despite dieir vast knowledge had made the imago a little bit too late they had been vanquished not however before they had created a heritage that threatened the gaol empire that heritage had been preserved by the latest the seemingly primitive species whom the gaol did not fear they had passed on this heritagepart of it anywayto a few human beings and to who knew how many other species the honkers may have made the gates among many worlds so that the plot against the gaol could spread or they may simply have used what they found in the makers burial chambers the chamber which jack and tappy had seen was not the only one in the underground complex lightning smashed the ground nearby again though it was not as close as the treeriving bolt its flash seemed to light up a previously hidden thought in jack the prophetic paintings in that burial chamber had been recently repainted the integrator had told him that but what if the integrator had not repainted the ancient images what if the walls had been blank or he had brushed over old works then he had painted the images which the two humans saw they had been a piers anthony and philip jose farmer pious fraud a device to stimulate tappy into a state where the imago would manifest itself it was not so much physical maturity that had opened the gate in tappy and allowed the imago to be summoned it was a maturity of the psyche he could get the answers to his questions later if that is tappy and he and the others survived just now the gaol dreadnoughts were moving toward them through the storm why he could only guess but the commander must have been astonished to see them performing a savages ritual when they should have been conferring about her demands she may have decided dial the four hours grace was a waste of time for the gaol had she given the order to move in and capture he imagos host while they were deeply involved in their ritual or had she ordered the ships just to come closer to the group because the vast chaotic energies of the lightning were disrupting her observation capabilities but if she had seen the light issuing from tappy she must have known that the imago was about to manifest itself jack groaned and the tiny hot coal of hope inside him darkened ah the commander had to do to stop the imago was to order that all within the crater walls be destroyed at once he prayed to the god in whom he did not believe then he cried out in wonder though he had expected more wonders the brightness was a sphere extending from tappy to about ten feet from her it included himself candy garth and the integrator it did not touch the people in the three circles the honkers whose feet now struck the earth rapidly turning into mud with a mighty squishing sound but as suddenly as if someone had pushed a button the sphere shot out many thin rays at first jack thought that the sphere was doing it but a much more intense ray was shooting out laser bright from tappys left breast through the bright sphere it had to issue from the imaget upon her breast it fell upon each of the dancers as each passed into and through it in his and her circuit it made each of them glow as if each had swallowed a giant firefly or a saints halo their lights paled the darkness among them despite the suddenness of this they hesitated for only a second and dien resumed their whirling and their forward progress scarcely had jack cried out than he did so again now a ray shot out from each dancer into the black storm and toward the crater wall the beams angled slightly upward the caterpillars question if the gaol commander knew of this she must be whistling the equivalent of a human screeching into her communicator destroy them destroy them now the dancers were whirling faster and had also speeded up their passage over the circles described in the mud by their feet somehow despite die energy output that should have made them short of breath they were still chanting and their gourds were rattling even more furiously the thunder and the lightning had raced past the group the rain quit as quickly as if a giant stagehand had cut it off though the clouds were still black above the storm had quit for now a few minutes later the clouds took their darkness over the eastern wall the sun sprang out as if from ambush but the sphere of light and the ray emanating from the imaget and the rays shooting from the dancers were easily visible jack saw that the beams from the dancers were impinging upon the images and the symbols on the craterwall ring he did not know until then that he had unconsciously expected this he cried out a third time the figures on the ring flashed as each passed through a ray the ring was moving much faster though it was at least twentyfive miles from him and the figures were gigantic they could be seen now only as almost unrecognizable smears while he stood astonished he saw them become even more blurred the outer rings the two concealed within the crater wall must also be rotating at an incredible velocity the gaol spaceships were truly colossal now they were poised halfway between the throne and the wall poised not moving he turned to look westward the storm had hidden me fleet in that direction but now he saw that it was also hovering halfway to the ritualists in fact the entire array of vessels formed a circle around them the integrator blew a very loud and long blast after a sustained single honk the dancers became silent they stopped their frenzied motion and turned to face the wall quickly they broke up the circles and rearranged themselves in a long line facing the western wall their work was done the wheels no longer needed them to spin them and they were going to watch the results the ray from the imaget had ceased but the glow from tappy spread out and sped across the plain until it filled the crater its brilliance was not diminished by being diluted it was not however a photonic light glaring as it was it did not make jack piers anthony and philip jose farmer close his eyes like the glare in that other world reached via the deathshadow it seemed to fill every cell in his body but this light did not hurt or blind that other light had done so because he and tappy were in a place where they should not be soundlessly lubricated by an unknown substance or field the ring spun until the blur of the images and symbols became a single dark streak the air near the ring was agitated however it quivered and shimmered vague figures flew around in it as if they were birds in a mirage no jack said aloud he realized suddenly that he had been mistaken first he had thought that the weapon which left a shadow like a bad aftertaste in deaths mouth was what tappy had talked about in her dreams alien menace only chance is to use the radiator she had muttered then he had suspected that it was not the weapon but the iraaget but now he knew the truth the radiatorthe radiatorwas the craterwall ring the three rings rather they were pouring out radiations of empathy the empathy which would conquer the gaol no not just them the entire universe of sentient beings all gaol honkers humans the multitude of languagespeaking species which must be scattered throughout the single world made of many worlds if there was anything faster than light it would be the empathy waves these were infraphysical at least he assumed that they would be if they were going to affect a significant number of sapients also there were the gates such as the bouldergate he and tappy had passed through from earth to this planet there must be many throughout the cosmos and the gates on this planet would be transmitting the waves to earth and to gates on earth which led to other worlds and to gates on this planet which led to other planets the effect would spread much more quickly through them was it already affecting the people of earth god knows that that planet needed it but then every planet probably did the end of wars and of murder and of viciousness the lessening of hate and greed and ruthlessness the growth of love and compassion the spaceships had stopped in their advance toward the imago and its host he did not know but he was sure that the gaol in them had been overcome by an onslaught of empathy far more powerful than anything tappy had radiated before the caterpillars question the real radiator what the honkers called the generator had started to function its waves had reached up to the fleet in orbit and stunned the gaol in it and the waves were on their way directly or through gates to the rest of the empire and beyond it he got a flash of something then it was gone but it would be back for a second or two he had been in a gaol or maybe in every gaol he had been in the mind of a gaol in that fraction of a second of full comprehension and actually being a gaol he had been as frightened as he had ever been but now he also understood what drove them despite their repulsive appearance and behavior they were not unlike human beings what was ugly in them would change into beauty he was surprised that he had not had this feeling before now after all he was standing in the very center of the radiation but his location was similar to being in the eye of a hurricane all around him was a gigantic surge of the force that had been as it were bom and slain many times before it could get anywhere near full fruition now it was the mightiest force in the many universes compared to the combined energies of a trillion trillion stars the imago was a sun beside a candle he however was in a null area comparatively null that is once he went to where he would be in the full force of the empathy he would be as filled with it as the gaol now were the rays from tappys breast and from the maget were fading now their work had been done though they still lived and would again become as bright as angels if they were needed jack hoped that they would never have to be invoked again that their force would endure surely they would not have to be used in tappys lifetime but he could see on tappys face a golden aura faint but still evident evident to him anyway it was probably his imagination no one else could see it though he would ask others if they detected it it was an afterimage of the holy light yes the holy light though jack was an agnostic and would have felt uncomfortable calling anything holy he now would think of the aura as if not holy the echo of holiness tappy would be something to be worshipped by him would that interfere with die union of their flesh would he always be inhibited somewhat when they made love ora mundane thought but valid and realisticwhen they argued about the piers anthony and philip jose farmer budget or when they disagreed about disciplining their children would he always give in even when he knew he was right he hoped not but he would have to wait to find out they would have to get back to earth first neither he nor tappy wanted to stay here no matter how pleasant it might be despite all the madnesses and hideousnesses that stalked earth it was their home and now that the imago was flooding the souls of its people earth would become far better perhaps the earth that all sane people wanted it to be how to get back that should be no problem the honkers would know of a gate to it if they did not the gaol would he laughed whoever would have thought that he could ask the gaol to help him or that they would do so willingly even gladly there was still one question unanswered what had tappy meant in her sleeptalk when she had said reality is a dream later much later when they were living on an earth the societies of which were greatly changing for the better he asked her about the phrase she had to probe her mind for some time before she remembered where she had heard it so much was buried there and so much was still difficult to find my father she said he told me that several times i was so young i did not ask him what it meant or if i did ive forgotten his explanation anyway i did puzzle over it then i forgot about it so many bad things were happening dien but my unconscious evidently did not forget it i really dont know what he meant by it he must have meant that dreams shape reality jack said the makers had a dream of the means whereby they could conquer the gaol even after they the makers were gone hence the imago the honkers and the humans allied with them continued to dream the makers dream they made the imaget and they dreamed of how they could use it to let the imago come to full bloom dreams shape reality thus dreams are reality that must have been what he meant authors notes piers anthony this really started m back then i was a hopeful writer with one sale to my credit i was taking one year to stay home and write while my wife went out to earn our living and the year had started in september if i didnt prove myself by september i would have to return to the mundane grind and give up my foolish dream of being a writer as it happened i did sell two stories in that year for a total of so was technically a success but realism intruded when it came to paying the bills did return to mundane labor but in tried writing fulltime again this time doing novels instead of stories and that was the one that took it was after all possible to earn a living doing novels i have been writing ever since the details of my life and career are too tedious to go into here they are in my autobiography bio of an ogre what concerns me now is just one story written in that first year and the story of that story the story was tappuah i wrote it for god rather than caesar that is for love instead of money the name derived from the bible i am hardly a bible scholar but in a concordance or some such i had seen the name and learned dial it meant apple and it intrigued me the setting was the green mountains of vermont where i was raised the character turned out to be the first of a type i have explored considerably since a young and tortured girl critics accuse me of having nothing but luscious and sexy women tappy is the evidence that i tried other kinds but without success on the market in february i completed the monster story quinquepedalian and in march i would complete my farcical fantasy story e van piers anthony and philip jose farmer s between them i fitted in tappuah it moved better than anything else i had done up to that time i wrote just over words a day for three days and had it complete at words in february my favorite it had a fantasy theme tappy lame and blind nevertheless had an affinity for extinct creatures and they tended to show up i was then in touch with several other hopeful writers such as robert e margroff h james hotaling and frances t hall with al of whom i subsequently published collaborations i sent tappuah to them for comment they liked it they felt it was the best i had done that was my own sentiment i tried it on the market it bounced at playboy and at cosmopolitan ladies home journal redbook the magazine of fantasy and science fiction and fantastic evidently the genre magazines didnt want it either one of them sent a scribbled note suggesting that i try it on the straight market so i tried it on a mainstream literary magazine the atlantic monthly and it bounced there too so much for that seven markets had rejected it and i had to retire it for a while but i did not forget it meanwhile i went back to college to get my certificate to teach english and i became an english teacher it was a poor substitute for the real thing creative writing but i took advantage of the interim to show the story to my literature professor there wesley ford davis himself a published novelist intrigued he read it to one of his classes and relayed the students comments to me they liked it but felt that the human element of tappys situation warred with the fantasy of the extinct animals it might be better as one type or the other when i taught english at the admiral farragut academy in st petersburg florida i read the story to my tenth graders they liked it and offered thoughtful comments i hope that they profited from this examination of an actual piece in the throes of revision i was trying to teach them meaningful things as well as the required material so i rewrote it eliminating the fantasy element and put it in for comment when i attended the milford writers conference there were a number of comments there i remember harlan ellison advising me that women didnt talk the way tappys authors notes mother did condemning her crippled child damon knight criticized tappys leg brace thinking it was inconsistent to mention it once as being on her foot and another time as on her leg was it on her foot or her leg he asked it was on both of course apparently he had not seen such a brace gordon dickson had no problem with his critique but took time out to walk by himself in order to figure out how to present it in such a way dial i would not freak out that sort of thing makes me wonder just how i come across to others but i appreciated his sensitivity i dont remember the critique itself except that it seemed reasonable so i eliminated tappys mother and tightened the story up in various other suggested ways and clarified references then i tried it on the market again no luck knight rejected it in late and in so did good housekeeping playboy cosmopolitan redbook mccalls atlantic and mademoiselle tappy had now been rejected fifteen times but i didnt give up i included the story along with all my other rejected stories in a volume titled anthonology and tried that on the market in you guessed it that too was solidly rejected later i used the title for a collection of previously published stories and that was published in but its not the same volume unless you count two unsold stories i slipped in but tappuah was not one of diem she still languished then in late i believe i received a proposal from hank stein for a roundrobin novel titled lightyears it was to have ten or twelve established genre writers each doing one chapter a number of noted genre figures were interested such as foul anderson robert silverberg and philip jose farmer in fact this had the potential of being one of the most starstudded genre novels ever naturally i agreed to participate then early in the word came that i was to do the leadoff entry this surprised me i had expected to be buried somewhere in the middle i was of course jammed for timethis is a chronic condition with me perhaps typical of workaholics how could i start a novel which others would finish and do it rapidly and well then i thought of tappy i reasoned that to achieve bestseller status this volume should at least start in the contemporary mainstream later it would get into the deep space alien monsters universedestroying elements but it needed to have one or two main characters with whom the average mainstream reader could identify i remembered how the wizard of oz started with an piers anthony and philip jose farmer authors notes ordinary kansas girl then got into fullscale fantasy and was successful my story of tappy fit the criterion also and by no means incidentally i very much wanted tappy to have her place in the sun my characters are real to me and i hurt when they hurt i did not want to allow tappy to be as brutally treated by the market as she had been by her folks so i adapted the story in two ways first i changed it from first person jacks viewpoint to third person this was because i did not think it was fair to lock other writers into the first person mode i regretted the necessity because there was a certain cadence in first person that third person lacked such as the line my mind meanders when i paint that has a poetic beat and alliteration his mind meandered when he painted just doesnt do it i do write for sound as well as sight when i edit my material i often read it aloud but it had to be second i added back in some hints of the fantastic so as to give following writers something to work from i made it evident that there was more to tappy than her mundane existence i turned it in to the editor and he loved it in due course i was paid for it i had succeeded in rinding a place for tappy the second chapter was written by phil farmer and the following chapters by other writers but there were problems and the project foundered oh no once again tappy was cast into the street then charles platt who had been editorially involved with the project made a suggestion suppose i worked with phil farmer taking our first two chapters and continuing as a twowriter collaboration that way we could eliminate the major problem of the first attempt which was such a diversity of styles and directions that mere came a point when no other writers would tackle the later chapters the notion appealed to me for three reasons first i dont like to have anything i start go unfinished im ornery and dont quit readily as you may have gathered second i have admired phi farmers work since seeing his novel the lovers i am not alone in regarding it as a classic of the genre thats by no means the only significant writing he has done i believe it is fair to say that he is regarded as one of the outstanding figures of the genre i have done seventeen collaborative novels but never with a writer of phils stature i was eager for this chance to work with him third i wanted to save tappy and this was a way but there were complications the rights to the material in the lightyears project were not clear i finally clarified them the hard way i bought the project and returned the rights of the entries to the authors phil farmer and i had different literary agents i settled that with the finesse and politeness for which i somehow seem not to be known my agent will handle it i said refusing to negotiate i had reasons which made sense to me and phil being a nicer person than i am yielded gracefully we moved on with it at first alternating chapters thenwell if you can tell who wrote what more power to you but youre probably wrong our styles and notions meshed nicely and i think we have a good book it was of course impossible to have it absolutely smooth because each of us had to read the others latest chapter before deciding where to proceed this is the first collaboration i have done this way and i suspect its not the best way but it was set by its genesis we had alternated at the beginning so we continued there is a roundrobin story game done either verbally or in writing in which each participant tells a segment of the story setting it up for the next one person a may have boy meets girl but as they are indulging in their first kiss the barricade at the edge of lovers leap gives way and they plunge down a thousandfoot cliff now it is person bs turn he establishes that there is a deep lake at the base somehow not mentioned before the lovers plunge in bob to the surface finally break their kiss and realize that something is amiss so they swim to shore but are in a strange region uninhabited by man they make a fire and dry their clothing then spend the night preparing for an arduous trek in the morning but great eyes loom out of the darkness and an enormous hand reaches down to pick them up screaming oops its person cs turn and so on in a gentle contest to see who can mess up whom the worst naturally professionals such as anthony and farmer would not stoop to such oneupmanship or would they well maybe on a subtler level we had a mutual interest in having a good novel because we were not doing this for our health amateurs may write just for fun but professionals write for money fun too but the professional who does not keep an eye on commercial prospects does not remain professional long so we tended to be piers anthony and philip jose farmer conservative making sure there was a reasonable continuation when each of us forwarded his latest chapter to the other he also sent a few notes indicating what he had in mind and where he thought it might proceed and what baffled him thus had i been the one to drop my lovers off the cliff i would have indicated that there indeed was water below while allowing my collaborator the option of having them go splat on the rocky shore instead if he preferred as with chess you dont just wipe your opponents king off the board you announce your intention by saying check and giving him a turn to respond not that this was any contest we were going to win or lose together by the success or failure of the final novel still there was a current i hoped that phil would make contributions with the imagination and vigor of the lovers or one of his mother stories or maybe like the night of light in which good wars with evil in a religious setting and at one point the boy cracks the girls head open and a snake jumps out from the shell of the skull what he hoped for from me im not sure perhaps that just manage not to drop the ball before scoring so i did set him up with some brinks to hurdle which he neatly finessed and tossed back to me meanwhile it seems to me that our approaches melded nicely so that there really wasnt much jerkiness in the progress of the story thats one reason i prefer to be slightly ambiguous on exactly who wrote what so that armchair critics cant say its plain that we had one superior writer and one hack the farmer chapters are outstanding too bad he didnt have a better collaborator they are going to have to figure it out without merely checking off every second chapter we brought the novel to the halfway point and my agent marketed it it was just in time for what appears to have been the worst slump in novels sales and prices in a decade or two this is the inevitable luck of writers nevertheless two or three publishers were interested and we finally landed a satisfactory contract now all we had to do was complete the novel i mentioned the luck of writers well about the time we were heading into die home stretch phil fanners wife bette had to have surgery they went from illinois to california for two weeks to take care of it right it took longer than anticipated and phil was stuck for months without his notes prior text or computer as the deadline loomed he had to write out his material longhand authors notes and type it manually id hate to see the color of the air around his working place while he commented on the situation so he summarized what he had written for me so that i could start my section without waiting to receive his in this manner we moved it along despite his situation and so we completed the collaboration i think its full history is unusual even for a genre in which the unusual predominates the result will be for you the reader to judge meanwhile anyone interested in a source for my other titles or newsletter may call my trollfree number hi piers philip jose farmer my first collaboration was thirtyeight years ago up untii recently it was my only one that is its been that long since i wrote a story in partnership with a real person i have collaborated with some fictional writers derived from one of my schizophrenic personae the last one i think was with leo queequeg tincrowdor but thats another story other than piers anthony my only partner in the felonious deed of writing fiction was randall garrett if humankind has north and south poles randall was the south and piers is the north or vice versa im somewhere between the two a sort of equator or perhaps the tropic of capricorn inherently a loner ive never thought hey i feel like collaborating with someone when i did i did so because someone asked me to do it and it seemed like a good idea at the time randall garrett was residing with my family and me in when he talked me into writing a novel the ballad of hilary boone with him this was based on a poem which charlie tanner had written charlie was an oldtime sciencefiction author whose heyday was in the gernsback era his tumithak of the corridors delighted me when it came out in amazing stories in its still a good read he was also a master at composing satirical poems based on sf motifs hilary boone hero of charlie tanners song the ballad of hilary boone was a space pirate who foughti thinkthe evil empire of earth or maybe it was some vast monopolistic business corporation i cant recall the details one day while randall was authors notes singing the ballad and both of us had had too much beer he suddenly broke off and said itd be a great idea if wed write a novel based on charlies song so we did in those hoary old days stories about space pirates and individuals building their own rockets were believed by the readers and purchased by editors most of them anyway and randall and i were naive enough to believe in space pirates randall would write one chapter and id write the next so without really knowing where we were going except for the story outlined in the ballad we launched into the collaboration dont think our styles or approaches melded too well but we did have a good oldfashioned rousing story we sold it to startling stories magazine which intended to publish it as a serial if i remember correctly it would have been the first serial ever in startling stories we got paid but the magazine which had been around for years suddenly folded the novel was returned to us we sent it to a new agent i had just started with then she died and the ms was lost it might yet be floating somewhere out there or it might be lost forever probably the latter it was fun but it was no classic in fact its probably better that it was never published randall and i wrote at a breakneck pace however i still hope that it will turn up i might rewrite it and send it out again until piers suggested that we coauthor the work at hand i politely turned down the requests of various people that i collaborate with them in his authors note piers has told you somewhat of the circumstances of the roundrobin writing of the novel that procedure failed because those who followed us tended to go off in directions too wild they also did not develop the ideas piers and i had planted in the first two sections thus when he suggested that we do it as a twain i was enthusiastic piers is generally regarded as a sort of ogre in fact his autobiography is titled bio of an ogre however if youve read it you can see that theres far more to him than being an ogre hes a writer who wont take any crap from anybody especially certain publishers editors and agents he fights fiercely for what he believes is right he is very compassionate and honest he is also highly imaginative and inventive piers anthony and philip jose farmer i admire him as a person and as a writer there are many good writers around there are not many people who embody the oldfashioned but still viable principles of honesty integrity and high courage we melded wefl in style and inspired each other with challenging ideas and turns of plot at least i like to think so when the end of the novel was nearing i had to fight my inborn pessimism to conclude with a tragedy it seemed to me that the imago would take over tappy so completely that she would become alienated from jack as the host for the imago she would indeed become a goddess she wouldbe worshipped though tappy would resist that she would inevitably be a victim of this deification thus jack would lose her and have no hope of ever getting her back also the spreading of empathy throughout the universe would not be all good every good has its disadvantages and flaws and vice versa but thp extrapolation of the full effect of die imago and tappys sufferings is another story when the novel ends she and jack are happy and the good timr fnme to the sentients of all worlds let it end tiiere
