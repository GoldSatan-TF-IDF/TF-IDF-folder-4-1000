he shall not be shut in along with the souls which are fettered he shall have power to deliver himself wherever he may be and the worms shall not devour him chapter clxiv book of the dead prologue has it ever occurred to you reverend that you are a thief the small sunburned man spoke emotionlessly his features impassive in the shadow cast by the scuffed and grubby sunhelmet which was tilted over his forehead a dead cheroot adhered to his thin lower lip and bobbed up and down his companion stared at him squinted arrogance except for the tone of voice a statement of fact as suma saw it then you too are a thief suma the reverend mason stroked his thick grey beard his squat form hunched over the remnants of the campfire tomorrow both of us will go in through that door below if you are not a robber then at the very least you are an accessory im just a guide suma struck a match and attempted to relight his cheroot i do what im paid to do and nothing more i neither enter tombs nor remove anything from them all i do is show my clients where they are the natives do the digging so i have perceived the older mans tones were rich and gentle a veiled remonstration such as he might have delivered during the course of a sermon but i do not steal i do not seek to acquire wealth merely to take my finds to a place of safe keeping where they may delight an old man who attempts to understand the ways of an ancient civilisation take the british museum for example the exhibits there could hardly be referred to as stolen property the treasures belong to the dead suma stared into the fire stretched out a sandalled foot and kicked the charred faggots so that they showered sparks and burst into flame they have need of them in sekhetaaru the land of the dead one day they will return for what is rightfully theirs and find that their belongings have been stolen the clergyman refrained from an impulse to try and explain to suma that in heaven one had no need of material possessions it would have been a waste of time out of the corner of his eye he studied the other a strange little man whom one might almost have taken for a sunburned european at first glance part egyptian certainly part it was anybodys guess a wanderer of the wastelands a desert nomad they told you in cairo that suma was the best guide available if you could acquire his services sometimes he was not heard of for months at a time then suddenly he would be back in the city looking for work it was all according to his mood how much he charged some said there were times when he did not charge at all a hunter of tombs i shall not come to egypt again mason spoke sadly philosophically not just because i am an old man but because soon there will be nothing left to take surely the authorities must call a halt to it soon so far they have been too preoccupied with the aftermath of war but i fear that we are witnessing the end of an era this is surely my last expedition suma and maybe mine too the little wiry man smiled whimsically methinks i should not have brought you here reverend not to the tomb of dalukah and abaaner dalukah was queen of egypt apparently her tomb was overlooked by carter and other leading egyptologists not queen a descendant but by that time the royal bloodline had gone i shouldnt have brought you here reverend but there is still time to leave we have not broken into the tomb yet fortunately youve got cold feet suddenly suma why im not backing down now like i said i shant come to egypt again this is my last tomb and im going in there whether you like it or not that is up to you reverend suma glanced behind him as though he expected to see something lurking in the shadows of the cave as for me my job is done i have brought you to the tomb of dalukah and abaaner i have watched you dig the rest is up to you you need me no longer you have the natives and a truck enough to get you and whatever you ste take back to cairo i shall leave in the morning at first light dyou mind telling me why mason found himself peering into the shadows beyond the firelight his gaze coming back to rest on the guide a tiny shiver running up his spine it is not for me to say youre frightened arent you youre as superstitious as these natives they wont camp near the tomb theyve retreated almost half a mile into the desert how do i know they too will not have fled by dawn they might suma smiled wryly but they are poor the money you are paying them may well overcome their fear temporarily on the other hand it may not it is fortunate you have not given them any money so far otherwise i fear that they would have been gone by now youre all frightened of bogies spooks that dont exist except in your own mind there was a note of reproach in the old vicars tone i am a christian i believe in god he will not let anything harm me or those who accompany me i am not a thief the items which i take from this tomb will be used in the interests of archaeology to benefit mankind so that they may learn about an ancient cultured civilisation it is gods will that i am here we are all entitled to our own beliefs reverend however mistaken they may be suma yawned stretched himself a touch of arrogance this time now i am going to turn in for i must leave early in the morning before we break through into the tomb eh mason leaned forward youre up to something my friend youve broken into a dozen or more tombs before this one and rumour has it that you have a collection of relics that would grace the finest museum there are many rumours along the nile suma stood up his illfitting khaki shorts falling well below his knees laughable in any other place except this ancient burial ground i should not take too much notice of what you hear reverend but you expect me to take note of your insinuations yes the guides eyes narrowed his voice dropped to a whisper because i know but as i told you the decision is yours now ill bid you goodnight reverend sleep well mason watched the other walk away a kind of glide on those short legs until the darkness swallowed him up mason began unrolling his blankets on the soft sandy ground found himself glancing again into the shadows he shivered these desert nights were cold the wilderness burned you by day and froze you by night but tonight seemed exceptionally cold maybe he should keep the fire going a stirring of primitive mans instincts flames to keep the wild beasts at bay something scuttled across the cave hidden by the darkness and he started a rat probably these excavations were crawling with them but they were harmless not like scorpions and snakes he shuddered tried to throw off an indeterminable creeping fear there was nothing here that his own faith would not protect him from yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death his bedroll ready he dropped to his knees tried to shut everything else out of his mind while he prayed it wasnt easy that rat was running to and fro again scavenging for scraps of food a sudden gust of cold desert wind whipped up the sand drove it at him as though some venomous being out there was echoing sumas warning in its own inexplicable way youre a thief reverend a grave robber when he opened his eyes again the embers had died down to a dull glow allowing the shadows to move in on him black shapes that were alive and seemed to touch him with icy fingers there was a shotgun and some ammunition in the truck he thought about going and fetching it but that would only have been pandering to his own childish fears like the time when his parents had first demanded that he slept in a room of his own the sheer terror of those first few nights he would never forget them voices that whispered as he trembled beneath the bedclothes fingers stroking the blankets and when he jumped prodding him taunting him infantile fears that eventually evaporated until now he pulled the blankets right up over his head listening that rat had gone away probably tired of its constant search for food returning to its hole to sleep mason wished he could sleep suddenly he wasnt tired anymore perhaps he should go and fetch a torch and try to read but that meant going out there into the night voices like those in his infant years an indecipherable whispering as though demons hid in the shadows and were mocking him closing his eyes tightly trembling violently something made him open his eyes an awareness of light like when his mother used to check on him on her way up to bed he saw it through the blankets a penetrating golden radiance its brightness making him squint fear groping for a logical explanation the dying embers had blazed up he had to be sure breathlessly almost afraid to look he eased himself up and peered out of his bedroll the scene which greeted the vicar brought a grunt of amazement from his bearded lips dying away to a moan of terror it was impossible it could not be a waking nightmare in the midst of some desert fever an hallucination brought about by his mind dwelling on sumas superstitions the fact that the natives would not come near this place after nightfall he stared again tried to reassure himself that what he saw was a figment of the imagination the mental meanderings of an old man the cave had magnified many times or perhaps it had always been this size but hidden by the shadows but it was no longer a cave more of a huge chamber with plain walls a tomb such as the one which might lie behind that heavy door in the adjacent excavations the whole scene was lit by some radiating golden light as though the rays of a setting sun penetrated this gloomy place the reverend mason continued to stare saw that in the centre of the floor stood a small plain sarcophagus a childs coffin a thing of sadness that misted his eyes and blurred his vision held his gaze as though it had some kind of hypnotic power the temperature had dropped several degrees and the light seemed to die bringing back the surrounding shadows and even as he watched the tiny coffin lid began to raise as though the infant occupant had suddenly come to life or else had not been dead in the first place the reverend mason wanted to tear his gaze away to scream to rush headlong from this place of inexplicable death into the world outside but it seemed that all bodily functions were denied him that some unknown power commanded that he must be a spectator to the happenings in this place the horrors of some unearthly resurrection the sarcophagus lid was flung aside a white robed figure sitting up disrobing itself so that its features and its nakedness were revealed in its full beauty it was no child but a woman of exquisite beauty so petite in every feature her full red lips moving as she uttered mute words which the watcher did not hear yet understood a plea looking about her fearfully even as she spoke take me from this place o stranger and the one who loves me and is entombed back there take us back to your land and free us from the curse which has been put upon us i beseech you mason thought that he could make out another sarcophagus some distance away a larger one from which there was no movement but it could just have been a trick of the shadows like this one it is no trick stranger she seemed to read his confused thoughts which were still searching for a logical explanation for i am dalukah an enslaved high priestess of one whose name even now i dare not utter and there lies my lover abaaner the soldier and our crime is that we love each other free us i beseech you take us away from this tomb to another land while there is still time and before we are yet again put to the sword and entombed for eternity her voice was fading away the light failing and the darkness coming back again leaving mason lying there in the black solitude of the cave knowing that it was neither dream nor hallucination it had all happened there was no doubt about that suma was gone when the clergyman emerged from the cave next morning tyretracks leading off into the desert and when the drifting sands obliterated them it would be as though suma had never been just another legend that might or might not be true mason felt tired as though he had not slept the previous night a niggling ache behind his eyes which in all probability would increase as the day progressed again he saw that scene in the chamber the woman of unparalleled beauty pleading with him to take her away to release her from some ancient curse but how could he when she didnt exist anymore the cave had no recesses there were no coffins concealed in the shadows his troubled thoughts were disturbed by the appearance of the natives there should have been five but doubtless the others had left having conceded to their superstitions and cowardice an old man and a boy they might have been father and son but the clergyman did not consider it worth bothering to find out already the sun was up and the coolness of the underground would have been appealing to him had it not been for the memory of that vision others leave the wizened old man pointed back to the desert they follow suma he afraid too well im not afraid because theres nothing to be afraid of the reverend mason prayed that his lingering fears did not show in his expression now the sooner we break into the tomb the better with luck we can all be away from here before dark the outer entrance door was a greater obstacle than they had anticipated and it took them three hours work with crowbars and chisels before they finally broke through into a dry musty passageway mason stood there in the interior had the feeling that he was in a timeless void a chamber that bridged the gap between civilizations he held on to the wall experienced a sensation of vertigo in the dusty gloom he saw the outline of the inner door through which lay bad place the old man was clutching the boy to him very bad place see his voice rose to a pitch an extended finger shaking its only a painting the clergyman was aware how his own tone shook a kind of emblem on the narrow portal a doubleheaded snake with piercing eyes that would seek you out wherever you tried to hide t is the sign of set the old native was backing away dragging the boy with him this is an evil accursed place let us flee now before we are murdered as osiris was put to the sword as were dalukah and abaaner leave now and you get no money mason shouted his words echoing in the enclosed space money no matter look he moved with surprising agility for his age barred their way tm not going to have everybody running out on me when the goal is in sight ill bargain with you help me smash down this door and then ill pay you your wages and you can go i will go into the tomb alone the native sucked his toothless gums glanced back again at that painting on the door the boy was tugging at him crying and begging him to leave now all right well break the door for you but then you pay us quick and we go mason nodded gave an audible sigh of relief and picked up his crowbar now he was all alone the vicar listened to the padding footsteps of the retreating natives and wondered if he ought to follow them no not now he had come this far spent a large part of his savings in finding this tomb it was barely noon yet he would work for five or six hours take out as much as he could in the time load up the truck and be away before dark at all costs he had to be away from here before dark he drew a deep breath and stepped over the debris aware that this was the moment when he went back in time trespassed in the kingdom of the dead hollow shuffling footfalls a torch beam that shook crazily penetrating the dust of aeons kicked up by his every movement the reverend mason recoiled almost fled before fear deprived him of the use of his limbs the interior the simple undecorated chamber with the small sarcophagus in the centre so familiar that he recognised it instantly this was the place of which he had dreamed the tomb of his vision strangely his terror subsided as he stood there in the centre swinging the torch beam around him in an arc the chamber was no more than twenty yards square humble in comparison with others he had seen simplicity as opposed to grandeur a place where the dead could rest in peace or could they he had expected to find a second coffin it stood there on a raised stone platform a casket that was much larger than the first one with neither carvings nor paintings on its surface he swung the beam to his left started involuntarily as it reflected two pairs of glowing eyes set closely together an amulet depicting that doubleheaded serpent again sets malevolence glinting evilly beside it on the single shelf was an obsidian head the size of a cricket ball finely carved features nobility that eyed him proudly yet not hatefully strange he spoke aloud grateful for the sound of his own voice a tomb of this size and yet it is empty of treasures with no signs of robbers having been here before no food to sustain the kas on their long journey no wealth stored here although surely the dead were of a wealthy line he found himself approaching the smaller of the two coffins as though some force drew him as if his actions were not his own his fingers smoothed along the lid but found no fastenings of any kind merely a hinge which moved as easily as if it had been oiled yesterday it lifted noiselessly swung back and in that moment his terror returned for here lay dalukah who had pleaded with him only last night he didnt want to look wanted to slam it back leave this place and flee just as suma and the natives had done because now he sensed the oppressive evil the cold cloying unseen force those double eyes boring malignantly into him like laser beams the dust was thicker his torch beam fainter as he shone it down on the still form inside the sarcophagus saw her features staring up at him from amidst a mass of loose swathings as though somehow she had torn them from her because she was not really dead and needed to breathe such beauty unmarred by the passing of thousands of years eyes that had not dulled long dark hair that had not lost its sheen then the horror as he saw the wound an ugly incision below her left breast where a cruel sword blade had pierced and disfigured been wrenched free as she had fallen bleeding to the ground eyes that still saw and understood he held on to the sides of the coffin fought off a wave of dizziness saw those lips move and heard her gentle tones like the rippling of the tide on a deserted beach you have not failed me stranger now take myself and abaoner the soldier away from this place to your own land where we shall be freed from the curse placed upon us do not delay for every second that we remain here we are in danger there was no thought of refusal in the old clergymans mind just how he was going to manage the task of taking these two up above on his own but he knew he would make it somehow they were not happy here and possibly elsewhere they would be at peace the girl had pleaded and he would not fail her the mummy of dalukah presented no problem for she was no heavier than a child and he lifted her easily stumbled through the outer chamber and up the long flight of steps with her cradled to his breast without pausing for breath he returned for the coffin now it was the turn of abaaner the reverend mason felt the coldness of the tomb as he reentered it like an icy barrier trying to repel him yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil for thou art with me yet all he experienced was a sense of loneliness the man was tall a handsome specimen of his time his features fierce yet the eyes reflected an underlying kindness something more a deep sorrow muscular a fine figure spoiled only by that same sword wound that dalukah bore an ugly gash that went right into the heart a hiss it could have been the desert wind soughing down the open tunnel where it had been denied access from time immemorial mason told himself that that was what it was because the serpent on the amulet was an inanimate object those eyes just glinted in the torchlight because they were jewels and for no other reason this time he had to drag the body because it was impossible to lift it wincing as the legs caught on the rough stairs feeling every bump on his own body yet somehow he made it then went back for the coffin the sun was low in the western sky when the reverend mason made his last trip down below he didnt have to go he didnt know why he did some kind of compulsion or was it avarice because of the four jewels that scintillated in the double head of the serpent of set or because the obsidian head would grace his own collection fearful now breathless from the physical strain which he had undergone his tired muscles twitching the torch was almost gone in his haste he had forgotten to search the truck for new batteries yet down in the tomb his artificial light was superfluous an irridescence lit up the chamber with that same glow that had illuminated his vision the eyes of set alive now with the fire of triumph the amulet cold to the touch yet burning his fingers as though with frostbite clutching it to him grabbing up the sculptured head and running for the exit he fell banged his head felt the warm trickle of blood but ignored it fearing that the outer door might somehow have closed and entombed him in this devilish place it hadnt barely had he the strength to mount those steps for the last time thanking god that he had been spared to gaze upon the saffron evening sky and breathe in the dry hot air of an egyptian desert tired as he was he was determined to drive through the night and make it to cairo without a stop almost as though he feared pursuit and as he started up the truck listened to the battered wornout engine noisily ticking over he was reminded once more of his words to suma i shall not return to egypt now they were a vow he had no wish to come back here to this land of unexplained mysteries for in many cases it was better not to know the truth those things of yours in there are gettin a bit niffy reverend mason sighed mrs barker was renowned for speaking the truth and equally renowned for a lack of tact it aint right to my way o thinking she continued dusting among the objects on the ornate study desk with unerring accuracy giving the obsidian head a quick wipe with obvious contempt gives me the creeps them egyptian things do vicar them mummythings are just like bodies dug up out of their graves which of course they are mason raised his eyes heavenwards and wondered how he would possibly cope without his daily help a bachelors life wasnt as easy as some people were inclined to think there were so many mundane chores to be done i will admit he cleared his throat that they arent exactly fresh on the other hand they are valuable souvenirs of a civilisation which was more cultured a few thousand years ago than ours is today which is as good a reason as any for gettin rid of em mrs barker had moved on to the wide windowsill her back to the clergyman so that her expression was hidden from him my usband tells me theres a job goin up at the allshe paused rubbed energetically at a small stain e works there as you know maybe youre right the reverend mason fitted a new nib into a penholder dipped it in the inkwell and made a pretence of scribbling on the foolscap sheet in front of him ill do something about those mummies mrs barker dont you worry ill see to them theres no need for you to consider getting a job up at the hall as a matter of fact i was also considering giving you a small rise how would an extra two shillings a week suit you mrs barker smiled to herself she had always prided herself in being able to handle the vicar all that was required was a bit of tact a threequarter moon cast its ethereal silvery light across the spacious vicarage garden creating weird shadows amid the shrubbery and orchard glinting on the black sluggish water of the river which wound its way through the thick reed beds below the furthermost boundary a silent landscape even though the town was less than a quarter of a mile away the squat tower of st ediths church outlined against the clear sky the reverend mason donned his norfolk jacket a somewhat worn garment which had recently been relegated to the status of garden apparel and pushed his feet into his patched wellington boots for the ground was inclined to be muddy down by the river he went out to the shed found a spade and crept stealthily down through the orchard the thought of the physical work involved never daunted him for on several occasions when jakes the regular gravedigger at the cemetery was suffering with his back mason had done the job himself you took your time didnt rush it and in the end you finished the job maybe not with jakes expertise but nobody had ever complained a fitting site the vicar decided level ground adjacent to the dense trees the soil soft enough to dig without having to use a pickaxe and in a way it could be likened to egypt for was not that country once known as kami or qemt meaning dark in colour because of the black mud of the nile of all the places he could have chosen to inter this longsuffering pair who had died by the sword there was nowhere more suitable than here beside a wide reedy river in a way he was restoring them to their rightful place giving them an honourable and christian burial he worked steadily taking off his jacket after the first halfhour and hanging it on a nearby branch just the squelch of the spade as the soil became wetter deeper down thuds as he threw the sods up on to the growing pile a sadness misted his eyes as he finally completed the second grave it had taken thousands of years for dalukah and abaaner to be laid to rest in a proper manner and obviously god had chosen him to do it it was an honour the thought gave him the necessary strength to go and fetch the two mummies he stood there breathing heavily his back was hurting and he felt slightly dizzy the sweat chilled on his body and he shuddered found himself glancing around just as he had done that night in the cave after suma had left a feeling of being watched a sudden gust of wind the suspended jacket swung something jingled and for one moment mason saw a glow in the halflight as though he had inadvertently put a lighted pipe into his pocket and the material was smouldering that amulet of course the one with the emblem of set engraved upon it those serpents eyes glinted night or day as though they lived he found himself stepping back stumbled and almost fell into one of the open graves a gasp of fear escaped his lips this whole business was madness two mummies longdead people who had begun to decompose once they were away from the dry atmosphere of egypt that was logical so they had to be disposed of nevertheless there was something unhealthy about a secret nocturnal burial like that time during the war when two wounded soldiers up at the hospital in town had died from some kind of plague the details were never released but they had been buried after dark mason had objected but the authorities said it was best because otherwise rumours would have spread and they could have created mass hysteria half the population lived in fear of unknown diseases now it was the same all over again he took the man first wrapping him in an old bedsheet rolling him into the grave because there was no way he could lower him wincing at the thud so undignified one last glance down through misted eyes an indistinguishable whiteness it was impossible to see how the mummy lay now feverish haste again shovelling in the mud and soil the woman he didnt know whether he could go through with it there were no outward signs of decomposition the features starkly white and beautiful in the gentle moonlight maybe he should take her back to the house hide her in the attic where mrs barker wouldnt find her no that would have been sacrilege bury me stranger lay me to rest and free me from the curse as you have done abaaner the vicar heard the words clearly bent lower to see if those lips had moved but they were still rigid he had imagined it the whole business was playing on his nerves nevertheless he would not fail dalukah he would keep his word and carry out her last request he felt the impact in his own body as the mummy hit the bottom of the grave lay still he dropped to his knees was aware of a wetness on his cheek as he mumbled a short prayer crossed himself may god have mercy on her ka that glow came again seeming to spread out and touch him a cold fire that burned had him crying out with shock and pain pinpoints of blazing eyes like glowworms commanding his attention the wrath of set was very much alive bury me with dalukah my servant mason scrambled across to where his jacket hung fumbled in the pocket until he found the amulet a circular piece of icy metal no larger than the palm of his hand like that strange light it burned him with its coldness the doubleheaded serpents eyes flickering with the fires of evil an ancient hatred rekindled this time he did not kneel and look upon the corpse in its grave with remorse he flung the amulet from him clasped his hands to his ears as if anticipating the scream from below a piercing shriek of sheer terror and hopelessness a sound that hurt his brain had him moaning his own fear what have i done dear god what have i done he knew he must fill in the grave without delay panicking as he shovelled and pushed the soil back heard the rectangular hole filling up movements as though a desperate struggle was taking place down there those cries still ringing in his ears muffled as though they came from afar you have betrayed me stranger tortured me with the promise of freedom only to imprison me once again with my oppressor words that hung in the still night air like distant echoes unwilling to disperse at last the grave was filled mason leaning on his spade for support weak and trembling glancing around him as though the shadows hid lurking evil beyond his comprehension remorse at what he had done a secret which would haunt him for the rest of his days a judas who knew that his work could not be undone and as if to hide his shame a bank of dark cloud passed across the face of the moon it was some time later when the reverend mason made it back to the vicarage he had recollections of stumbling falling crawling the remainder of the way across the wide lawn muddy his waistcoat stained and torn fingernails black and cracked and that pain in his left arm which had nagged him throughout the return trip from egypt had travelled up into his shoulder and downwards there was not much time left somehow he reached his study pulled back the curtains and saw that dawn was breaking there was enough light to see by he found his diary just two pages left scratching with a bent nib ink that ran and blobbed because his gnarled fingers shook so that he could barely form the letters illegible perhaps but would it ever be read did it matter an apology to dalukah and her lover abaaner that he had condemned them to the eternal purgatory from which he had temporarily freed them the pen moved slower and slower ran out of ink and he had not the strength to reach across for the inkwell again and then came the explosion inside his chest an eruption in a sealed volcano trying to burst its way out blinding him with agony breathlessly he slumped forward knew that he would write no more but it was enough dalukah and abaaner would know that he had tried that he had done his best but in his foolishness he had failed them tortured screams bodies writhing and flaying in a damp grave because they were dead and yet lived crying out accusing him cursing him then silence except for the hiss of a venomous serpent that had two heads and four eyes from which there was no hiding place and somewhere close by the river lapped its reedy banks its slow deep current an eternal passage to the oceans of the world linking faroff lands another nile another egypt book one the living chapter one the buried mummies i hope you havent come inside in your wellingtons emily brown lows shout from the landing was habitual as though her vocal chords were operated somehow by the opening of the kitchen door a dominant bleat which she had practised to perfection with an everyday recital and always the same answer from below no george brownlow had long since dropped the dear theyre in the corner of the coalhouse and i havent put them on the carpet either rumours that the brownlows had a carpet in their coalhouse were not without foundation certainly not an axminster but the six by six square of material would certainly have graced more humble abodes than their detached house on river view remarkably that piece of chequered material was kept reasonably clean not due entirely to the fact that it was vacuumed once a week but rather that the coal was hosed down before being stacked inside by an uncomplaining george at least his wife never heard him complain george brownlow remembered to wash his hands thoroughly in the sink before wiping them on the rollertowel he was due to be reminded of that requirement shortly when his wife came downstairs he studied his reflection in the mirror while he dried his hands wrinkled his pointed nose in time with his constant nervous twitch that created the impression that he was winking he had to admit that he did not like what he saw a complexion that was dark red the veins standing out like contours on an ordnance survey map a mop of unruly greying hair that dictated its own style heavy rimmed glasses that gave his eyes an owlish appearance reflected a fanatical gleam an anger that boiled within him because where emily was concerned he dared not show it the nagging bitch she was driving him into his grave an early one at fiftytwo dont come inside in your wellingtons george dont dirty my carpet in the coalhouse bloody carpet in the coalhouse somebody had given the old cow a piece of secondhand carpet so well have it in the coalhouse george and if you wash the coal down before you carry it in we can keep it nice and clean in there not like those dirty old outhouses that some people have all part of keeping up with river view and trying to go one better he was getting roundshouldered too and there was a thickness creeping into his waistline he grimaced and twitched again put the kettle on george that meant that she would be downstairs in a minute then make me a cup of tea one sugar and just a splash of milk the way it had always been for the past thirty years except she had onjy started instructing him on it these last few months it was all this facade of an upperriver view image which was sending her round the bend he decided they were living a lie for the sake of being snobbish shed gone to the extreme to keep the fact a secret that shed won the place the ball competition in the mercury eighty grand and a car the week after hed been made redundant shed gone and pleaded with the paper not to publish her name no commoners wealth for emily brownlow she wasnt going to be labelled one of the nouveau riche who had come up out of the semis estate on the other side of town shed got it all worked out had spread the lies and both george and their two teenage children barry and sheila had been conned into going along with it george had not been made redundant shed told everybody hed started up in business on his own design work and he was working from home doing so well that theyd been able to move up to river view the kettle started to boil and george brownlow switched it off his wife would likely as not chide him because there was a film of condensation on the kitchen window ive told you before george switch the kettle off before it comes to the boil else you steam up the windows and i only cleaned them this morning and every other bloody morning for the past week theres a draught coming from somewhere george well have to do something about doubleglazing the evanss have got it you know emily brownlow came into the room instinctively checked that her husband hadnt actually sneaked indoors with his wellington boots on she remembered the occasion hed done it last winter she would not forget that for a very long time she had made him wash the kitchen floor again he filled the teapot glanced up at her not exactly unattractive shed got some of that weight off shed been threatening to lose for the past month some american highprotein fruit and veg diet her shoulderlength hair was black too black so you knew it wasnt its natural colour her features had hardened no sharpened blended in with all this bickering that made her look her age fortyeight maybe she was going into the change and all this nonsense was biological in which case it wasnt her fault except that she could get hormone treatment only shed never admit to the change not even to doctor home so it was all her bloody own fault and he couldnt muster a grain of sympathy theres something i want to talk to you about george whats that wincing and twitching there was always something emily wanted to talk to him about its about sheila i dont like that boy adrian he seems all right to me all right about sums him up you know where he comes from dont you the firs estate george found himself swallowing instinctive guilt when his wife started up like this because in the end it always turned out to be his fault theres nothing wrong in oh yes there is its a council estate council houses and you know what sort of people live in them no background george its letting us down neighbours notice things like that youve only got to look at the boy long hair that straggles all over the place jeans that are not only dirty but frayed my god you can almost see his knees through them and his accent theres no prizes for guessing where he comes from george brownlows left eye was twitching a shade faster than usual his mouth had gone dry and he found himself staring down at his feet wait for it any second and i get the backlash im surprised you havent done anything about it george do you always have to wait until i point the obvious out to you sheilas seventeen his lower lip trembled as he spoke and he hated himself for it a lot of girls nowadays leave home at that age get married or or go and live with some feller thats exactly what im driving at emily brownlows mouth curled into a contemptuous sneer the next thingll be sheila will be walking out and shacking up somewhere with with this yob him apart its immoral george had an awful feeling that he was blushing fortunately with his complexion it was difficult for an observer to be sure except emily she never missed a thing shes only been going out with him a few weeks which is all the more reason why it should be stopped now before they get too involved doubtless people are already talking i cant for the life of me guess what a daughter of mine sees in somebody like that times have changed he began to pour the tea it was sure to be either too strong or too weak you cant tell teenagers what to do these days or like you say theyll just up and walk out if we put pressure on them sheilas likely to do just that shes headstrong he refrained from adding and its no secret who she takes after well youll have to do it tactfully then emily sipped her tea grimaced want you to speak to her tonight george why dont you have a word with her it was the nearest he had come to open defiance for a very long time his cheeks were a bright flush a combination of anger and high bloodpressure his whole body tensed his fingers curling and digging into the palms of his hands talk to her emily woman to woman if thats what you want she started an expression of amazement on her features then her eyes narrowed and a white spot appeared on either cheek that is your job george and dont try to shirk it because im supposed to be the head of the family his neck was craned forward stretched out of his shirt collar so that the blue corded veins were visible you only want me to take charge when something difficult crops up his eye was twitching rapidly now the pupil seeming to bulge behind the thick lens george stepping back a pace a physical and psychological retreat george this george that he raised a fist and it seemed for a moment that he might strike her but he lowered it again tm getting bloody sick of this game youre playing just because you won a small fortune and youre scared that everybody might get to know that you did it in the least intellectual way possible you think our roles have been reversed george is working for himself these days a design something or other works from home what a load of crap im redundant like three and a half million other poor buggers in this country out of work on the dole call it what you will and im not ashamed of it and i dont care either do you want to know why i dont care emily come on tell me do you want to bloody know her head moved he didnt know whether it was a nod or a shake he didnt care because this time she was bloody well going to hear him out well ill bloody well tell you because before many more months are out nobody in this world is going to give a monkeys because none of us will have a job well either be dead or dying from radiation fallout dyou understand me emily theres going to be a nuclear war one way or the other weve had crises over afghanistan poland el salvador the middle east and a dozen other spots now its libya and any fool could see that was coming this last few months sooner or later that madman was going to get hold of a nuclear weapon it was only a matter of time and theres no prizes for guessing who supplied him with it americas warned him to expect the worst if he uses it and there are nasty threats coming from behind the iron curtain about what will happen if they intervene cant you see what will happen libya will blast israel off the map and the yanks will wipe out libya then in come the russians and hey presto its all started and thats the end of all of us youre mad her voice was a whisper an expression almost of fear on her pallid face its just a threat weve had threats hanging over us for the last twentyfive years libyas just another threat and thats all it will ever be a threat you poor fool he laughed harshly dyou think anybodys going to worry about your pedigree when the flashpoint comes of course they bloody well arent were all going to be the bloody same a dying classless society wiped out by one madman stop it she shrieked no i wont stop it he moved forward another pace youve had the power in this household because youve got the money but money wont be any good to anybody when the world goes up in smoke so im going to get myself something that will be and youll come crawling and pleading to me emily believe me you will whatever whatever are you talking about she was leaning against the sink unit now holding on for support are you feeling ill george oh dont run away with the idea that this is something ive just thought of because youve got me wild ive had this in mind for the last few months and tomorrow im going to make a start on it i might not have a job but im going to bloody well work eight hours a day seven days a week hard physical labour what what are you going to do george subdued now frightened glancing behind her as though judging her distance from the door and wondering whether or not to make a run for it but she didnt i am goinghe paused for effect to make a nuclear fallout shelter in that bloody big useless lawn which you keep nagging me to mow twice a week im going to dig it up have the whole place looking like an opencast coalmining site and ill enjoy every second of it she almost said youre mad again but thought better of it instead she muttered nuclear shelters cost a lot of money and even then theres no guarantee that they will be effective anyway if the worst does happen and i dont for one moment think it will but if it does then what is the point in trying to survive and face the aftermath george brownlow felt a sudden surge of elation she wasnt dismissing his idea out of hand no backlash of contempt she was stating a reason an argument albeit a negative one but he had known her long enough to sense those odd occasions when he actually had the upper hand and this was one of them well i am going to build a shelter he drew himself up to his full height whether you or anybody else likes it or not in switzerland they are compulsory in order to obtain building permission for houses we shall have one and i will make every bit of it with my own hands youre not the practical sort she appeared to have recovered some of her composure besides shelters cost a lot of money which you dont have and i am not financing this ridiculous obsession im not asking you to he smiled i have the necessary tools to dig it out and i shall construct it from the best materials i can lay my hands on theres some local firm advertising every night in the paper trying to get rid of a surplus of asbestos sheeting that demolition site in town is only too glad to sell off secondhand bricks and timber to clear the site dont you worry ive made my mind up on this give me six months ill have it habitable by winter you mark my words i only hope im in time whatever will the neighbours think frankly i dont give a damn what they think for once im going to do what i want to do you can tell em what you like tell em its a project in connection with my design work which youve put about youre impossible i she broke off heard the back door slam thatll be barry hes home early i expect old matheson has sent him home early so that he can get on with his studies more likely hell spend the evening tinkering with that damned motorbike at least he has a good class girlfriend emily brownlow retorted i only wish sheila would take a leaf out of his book ritas a real nice girl its just a pity that she has to work at that awful research laboratory ive never stopped worrying about her since that smallpox germ killed that girl in birmingham a few years ago more likely youre worried about yourself in case she brings some disease here george brownlow thought that was a freak accident it will probably never ever happen again hi dad mum barry brownlow came into the kitchen a smile on his freckled face his dark ruffled hair spilling down over the collar of his dark suit any tea left in the pot your hair needs brushing emily was already scrutinising him and your suit could do with a good pressing really barry it isnt fitting for somebody working in a solicitors office to travel on a motorbike whatever does mr matheson think about it he says he wished when he was my age he could have afforded a machine like mine barry grinned poured himself a cup of tea and ill bet you didnt tell him it was on hp she retorted icily the best thing you can do is to forget all about motorcycles get on with your studying and qualify as quickly as you can so youll be able to afford a respectable car you two been rowing again he sipped his tea god you couldve cut the atmosphere in here with a knife when i walked in you may as well know emily sniffed loudly a habit of hers when she was defeated on any issue your father has had a brainwave or rather a brainstorm hes going to dig up the lawn make an unsightly mess of the garden and build himself a nuclear fallout shelter good for him the youth sensed an opportunity to side with his father a chance not to be missed when his mother was in one of her moods reckon we might need it before long dont lets go into all that again mrs brownlow brushed some imaginary obstacle from in front of her an angry impatient gesture that signalled a personal defeat on some family issue i just hope rita will be able to make more of you than ive made of your father such a nice girl at least she doesnt waste her time and let us all down by working in a supermarket like sheila tack it in mum barry drained his cup rattled it down on the sink unit if youre not going on about her job at the supermarket youre running adrian down and hes a nice guy take it from me as a matter of fact hes coming round tonight to give me a hand with the bike youre all mad she raised a hand to her head drew her fingers slowly and meaningfully across her forehead think ive got a migraine coming on and its no wonder the way you lot carry on theres a salad in the fridge you can help yourselves im going upstairs to lie down whats got into her barry glanced at his father as they listened to emily brownlows rapid footfalls going up the stairs the usual i guess george brownlow sank down into a chair suddenly felt weak a sensation as though he ought to burst into tears and get the frustration of the last quarter of an hour out of his system shes going into the change for sure either that or shes really going mental these obsessions of hers are getting on top of her barry began unfastening his tie pulled it off in one quick movement i reckon a carpet in the coalhouse and washing the coal are about the limit shell be hanging oil paintings in there next the worst thing that ever happened to us was her winning that fortune now everythings geared to keeping up with everybody else on river view and trying to go one better which doesnt make for a very happy home are you really going to make a shelter dad yes a sudden tightening of george brownlows lips those hands clenching again if everybody else is prepared to sit around and get blown up then im not ive nothing else to do anyway you dont expect me to hang around the house all day and listen to that do you no but this family is getting obsessional its like living in a madhouse most of the time why dyou think i spend most of my time out with the bike why dyou think sheilas always down at adrians and he doesnt like coming up here then youll understand why im going to dig a shelter god almighty i might even go and live in it shut myself away and if there is a nuclear attack you lot will all come spilling down into my refuge what a brilliant idea of yours dad now keep the place tidy george we ought to have a carpet on the floor jesus christ almighty theres supposed to be some egyptian mummies buried somewhere hereabouts barry paused in the doorway shrugging himself out of his jacket at least if what that article in the tribune the other week said is true there used to be an old vicarage on this estate with a huge garden running down to the river the old vicar was obsessed with tombs and the like and he brought some of his finds back here the story goes that a couple of mummies started to go off a bit so he laid em to rest in a proper reverent manner mind you dont dig em up dad huh brownlow grunted when theres no local news worth reporting they dig up some old story and if they cant find one then they invent one makes you sick barry brownlow closed the door and mounted the stairs found himself tiptoeing past his parents bedroom the door was shut and he could imagine his mother lying there on the bed ready to put on her migraine act if anybody came in dad was just as bad except that he was kept in check by mother most of the time he entered his room closed the door and began to search for his denim overalls damn it that cow had been tidying up in here again put everything where she thought they ought to go eventually he located his overalls they had been washed again the second time this week the latest issue of his biking magazine protruded from the wastepaper basket and with a muttered oath he retrieved it aggro that was what it amounted to his lips tightened the best thing he could do was to look for a place of his own at least a bedsit somewhere however tatty would give him peace of mind a noise outside like metal striking stone attracted his attention and he crossed to the window below him the spacious garden with its immaculate lawns and shrubberies ran down to the edge of the river enclosed on all sides by a high wattle fence and in the centre of the main lawn was one pathetic shirtsleeved figure wielding a pickaxe hacking at the lush turf as though he bore some personal grudge against it was determined to take his revenge on it and destroy it barry brownlow gave a hollow laugh felt a little shiver run up his spine and goosepimple his neck it reminded him of that afternoon a few weeks ago when he and rita had gone for a stroll in the churchyard in a far corner they had come upon an old gravedigger just starting his excavations picking away at the grass just as george brownlow was doing now one more one less the fellow had given them a singletoothed grin spittle stringing from his lower lip the only certain thing in life boy is that this is how well all end up and for some reason barry brownlow couldnt get the story of those mummies out of his mind it was true what the old gravedigger had said there was only one place you were going to finish up chapter two the amulet of set george brownlow cursed paused to rest he could feel his heart pounding away inside him like a distant voodoo drum he was sweating heavily the perspiration cooling and chilling him and fleetingly he wished that he had not embarked upon this foolishness in a way it had been a kind of fantasy something to switch his mind on to when emily started nagging like some people dreamed of a robinson crusoe existence on a tropical island but carefully overlooked all the hardships and inconveniences life was all about trying to con yourself everybody was too concerned with living no that wasnt quite right staying alive survival but they did damn all about it governed by the system which dictated whether you lived or died in a variety of ways a political issue and you were suddenly at war a clash of major powers with no thought for human life so you had to do something about it yourself in the end you only had yourself to rely on he hadnt intended to make a start right away though certainly not tonight that had been emilys fault pushing him into something again go and mow the lawn george theres rain forecast for tomorrow and the garden shed needs tidying he had never liked physical work not because he was lazy but because it was all so boring you mowed the lawn and in a week it wanted doing again sooner if emily noticed it you got aches and pains tired yourself out needlessly nothing to show for it and now the enormity of his task was all too apparent too hasty he should have sat down and drawn up some plans taken a few measurements perhaps he should go inside now and make a start get something down on paper he almost dropped his tools and reached for his jacket only one thing stopped him emily again her migraine would undergo a miraculous cure the moment he went back indoors soon gave that idea up didnt you george youre not cut out for real hard work have you got over your little bit of bad temper worked it off eh youii be laid up for a week thatll teach you a lesson now you can darned well go and put the lawn back as you found it and when you ve done that you can mow it nuclear shelter indeed he swung the pick again gasped aloud as it struck a stone somewhere below the surface and jarred his arm and shoulder he tugged it free struck again and again this was one job he wasnt chickening out of hed no idea how to construct a fallout shelter but hed make something even if it was only on the lines of the world war ii dugout airraid shelters anything but he wasnt giving in and if it wasnt radiation proof hed use it as a den a refuge to get away from emily hed rig up a light and a heater of some kind find himself a comfortable old armchair from somewhere and make it into a cosy little house all of his own he would have to be more methodical though it was useless just hacking out lumps of grass and soil cut the turf out in squares stack them in a pile then scoop out the soil and stones heap them up like he was digging a gravel he shuddered it could become just that if he didnt get it right hed have to get a book on nuclear preparation from somewhere he remembered vaguely having seen advertisements in the newspapers for hmso booklets on the subject yes hed have to go into the matter more thoroughly but in the meantime there was no harm in beginning the initial excavations for emilys sake he paced out fifteen yards used the heel of his boot to mark the spot eight yards across that should be wide enough do the job properly get your lines straight he went up to the shed and found a garden line now he was working more systematically slicing out squares of lawn religiously following that length of taut string it was going to be a long job but he had until winter to get it finished and he wasnt going anywhere in the meantime the exercise and fresh air would do him good he had meant what he had said seven days a week morning till night if it wasnt so bloody hot george glanced up at the sky the sun had sunk below the western horizon but there was still an hour or so of daylight left the weather looked settled no sign of rain although nothing short of drifting snow would force him to abandon his project now come to think of it it hadnt rained much since the end of march and may was twothirds gone that was why the ground was so hard making digging difficult that long dry summer of had started this way christ it was going to be bloody hot hard work if there was another drought like that it wasnt likely though you only got a real scorcher every ten years or so a every couple of centuries if that all the same the authorities had imposed restrictions on the use of water no carwashing or watering the garden george laughed softly to himself that bloke three doors away had been caught using a hose on the car silly bugger it was some sort of sunday morning obsession wash the mud off in winter and the dust in summer and if the bloody car was clean then wash it just the same bloody masochism he probably thought a ј fine was money well spent it was the likes of threadgold who were making the country bankrupt but very soon it wouldnt matter anyway when libya pressed the button all the water in the world wouldnt douse the fires take each spadeful as it comes dont think about the next pace yourself youre not tired but your muscles need to get used to the sudden shock of navvying fiftytwos a dangerous age for men the time when youre likely to drop dead from a sudden heart attack dont think about it youre fitter than most that spot of bloodpressure last year was nothing that a few tablets couldnt clear up dr home said you were fine now needed a bit more exercise well this is just what the doctor ordered dusk was deepening another ten minutes and it would be too dark to see hed have to pack it in then im having an early night emily because ive got to be up and at it early in the morning you stop in bed and get that migraine better or do what the bloody hell you like a metallic clink his spade struck something below the surface something that wasnt just a stone mild curiosity cutting out another square of turf turning it up then he stopped and stared something in the soil flashed as though the sunlight was reflected upon it but there was no sunlight a harsh light that dazzled him briefly would have made him look away except that for some reason he could not remove his gaze from it like fire that burned died down to a dull glow then flared up again you had to watch it whether you liked it or not george brownlow stooped down scraped with his spade soil and stones were moved away and he was able to see the object clearly a disc of some kind roughly the size of a coffeejar lid except that its shape was uneven as though it had been roughly cut out of a sheet of metal with a hammer and chisel yet why was the initial workmanship so poor whilst the engraving upon it was undoubtedly the fastidious work of a master craftsman snakes god they were repulsive no just one that was silly because no reptile had two heads he reached down for the object shuddered and almost snatched his fingers away he didnt want to touch it it was vile you could almost see those snakes wriggling rearing up to strike at him with their fangs those eyes both pairs small and beady flashing hatefully seeing him a little cry escaped his lips as his fingers closed over the thing lifting it clear of the soil the coldness which emanated from it had his skin prickling his mouth going dry heaving tasting bile at the back of his throat he could feel those carved serpents wriggling in his grasp he wanted to fling them from him run for the house and slam the door behind him but he couldnt he was compelled to stand and stare at the object nestling in the palm of his hand feel an inanimate life four glinting orbs holding his gaze holding him prisoner and suddenly it was all over a trick of the imagination a tired brain succumbing to infantile terrors in the darkness the thing was cold certainly but it couldnt be anything else if it had been buried in the ground for god knew how long slippery with moist earth creating the hallucination that the doubleheaded snake moved and wriggled those eyes he wiped the mud clear of them gasped his astonishment aloud surely they were jewels they could not be anything else bemused he stood there in the darkness broken only by the glow of the streetlamps on the road more than fifty yards away it was unbelievable hed dug up some item of treasure a jewelled trinket that had somehow lain buried for perhaps centuries it might be worth a fortune his euphoria cooled as he remembered some law about buried treasure belonging to the state hed keep it then clean it up and hide it away his digging his tools were forgotten as he glanced back towards the house emily was still in bed she wouldnt be coming downstairs again tonight barry and adrian were in the garage tinkering about with that damned motorcycle possibly sheila and rita were in the house watching telly there was no bloody privacy anywhere he put on his jacket dropped the strange object into his pocket like a child that had discovered an exciting toy on a walk in the park guilty because it belonged to somebody else afraid that it will be taken off him and he will be punished hiding it seeking an opportunity to go someplace and play with it george brownlow went back indoors furtively sheila was in the kitchen a shapely fairhaired teenager dressed in tightfitting jeans and a sweater setting some mugs out on the table she smiled at him and he saw again emily when they had first met features that had not yet hardened with bitterness unscarred by the constant battle for acceptance in higher social circles which was to leave its mark in later life that hadnt happened to sheila yet does the navvy want a cup of tea she laughed goodnaturedly thanks he resisted the temptation to fling himself into the nearest chair his back ached lumbago pains which had left him untroubled for months suddenly protesting at this unexpected manual labour ritas in the lounge watching telly she began filling the kettle needless to say the two fellers are mechanicing again lord knows how long theyll be at it tonight hows mother he winced at his own reference to emily a sexless term that had grown up with the children shes got a migraine so she says sheila switched the kettle on you two have been rowing again so barry tells me not that i blame you dad shes getting impossible lately in fact im considering looking for a flat oh a sickening punch below the belt an awful thought that adrian might be moving in with her he still clung to the hope that his daughter was a virgin unlikely in this age of sexual freedom but sheila wasnt like thatshe couldnt be she was his daughter still his little girl i havent fully decided yet she was watching him carefully now looking for a reaction it all depends on mum we ought to try and persuade her to see a doctor i think maybe shes suddenly not able to put it into words going into the change he halfnodded glanced away how could any man admit that he didnt know without confessing that he and his wife had no sexual relationship a gradual process single beds next it would be separate rooms and when that happened marriage was all over clinging on to a facade of companionship and even that might die l cant stand much more almost a sob of pentup frustration she goes on and on about adrian every pernickety little fault she can find and tops it all up by saying what else can you expect from a workingclass background i try to tell her that thats what we were before she won that damned money christ i hope i never get like that but im not giving up adrian to pander to her little game of makebelieve dont go sheila it was a desperate plea a fleeting instant of panic in case she walked out and left him all alone i like adrian hes a nice boy as i said i havent made up my mind yet she filled the teapot draped a cosy over it but i will if i have to and ill go too he thought if i only move out to live in that shelter if i ever finish it hi rita glanced up from the television as george carried the tray through youve been gardening late tonight george got to make the most of the daylight he mumbled didnt want to enter into explanations it sounded silly digging a nuclear shelter without any plans an obsession that seemed frail in the company of ordinary people gaddafis told his people that israels for the chop rita pursed her lips her freckles seeming to dance in the moving glow of the television screen he hasnt even given the israelis an ultimatum its as though hes made his mind up to blast them anyway and tass are backing him its sheer lunacy hell never really go through with it surely he realises the implications unless he doesnt care the us president has been on american television telling the world that if libya does carry out her threat then there will be no holding back not just angry murmurings and trade sanctions like there were over afghanistan and other places our own governments giving the americans full backing and dont forget weve got american missile bases in this country but in all probability its all hot air and will blow over like everything else in a week or so hopefully surely one madman cant start a holocaust just on the strength of hatred and a whim her features had gone much paler and it wasnt due to the light reflected from the screen theres more behind it than that george brownlow searched for his glasses touched something hard and cold in his pocket and snatched his hand away theyve niggled one another for years now any time now one of ems going to overstep the mark then thatll be the end for all of us rita hendon regarded him with a quizzical expression short jetblack hair she had an air of capability about her a firmness around her mouth in a different way from emily brownlow determined yet not stubborn for the sake of being stubborn sex appeal because she was the kind who had to do everything well or not at all on a number of occasions she had turned george on but that he decided had as much to do with emilys shortcomings as ritas qualities she was six years older than barry but it was a match that would work because he needed somebody firm somebody to mother him because that was what he had lacked in his upbringing there was more to bringing up children than discipline affection played a part in it too george was aware that he was sipping tea and watching a television screen neither really registered abstract wondering how long it would be before the lads gave up their bike repairs for the night and everybody either pushed off home or went to bed now dont you leave any of them downstairs on their own george a stock instruction of emilys if she went up to bed before everybody else its not right putting temptation in their way if they want to do it theyll do it he had always longed to reply but had never got round to it because he was still trying to convince himself that his own children wouldnt do things like that but tonight he wasnt going to leave them to it because he needed the kitchen to himself damn these youngsters adrian would hang on until the last possible moment and then spend half an hour saying goodnight to sheila in the porch barry would see rita home and take about an hour over it damn the lot of them george brownlow was determined to sit them all out the evening dragged on eleven oclock the boys came back in emily would have gone beserk at them coming into the lounge with oil smeared on their hands and faces the roller towel on the kitchen door was probably black with it too go on get off home or go to bed but nobody was in a hurry because emily wasnt around finally the gathering broke up rita showed no qualms about going home on the pillion of barrys bike a fact which always astounded emily when i was her age i wouldnt have gone on your bike george no because i never bloody well had a bike perhaps i missed out on something and this snogging in the porch is getting disgusting it could lead to other things something else we missed out on but its too bloody late now for sure waiting the temptation was to get that thing out whatever it was begin polishing it slightly on a handkerchief drop it back in his pocket if anybody came pulses racing too risky he thought he felt a movement like something wriggling ugh all the same he couldnt wait to have a good look at it what the hell was it it was cold in here which wasnt surprising because emily had turned the centralheating off last month we shant need that again until the autumn george another sacrifice to assist her in keeping up a river view image kippers and curtains an old saying you ate kippers and kept the curtains closed so you could boast to your neighbours that youd eaten dover sole a door slammed footsteps going upstairs that would be barry a few minutes later george heard the muffled sound of a record it wasnt fair with emily ill if she was ill it was half an hour before sheila came in kicking off her shoes in the hall and going straight through to the kitchen a few minutes later he heard the kettle boiling a bloody nightly ritual as though going to bed was something to be delayed until the last possible moment neither of the children would come in here though they never did a kind of guilt complex they might be asked what they had been doing this last half hour but they wouldnt do anything like that george was certain he decided to try and put it out of his mind at last the house was quiet he glanced at the clock a quarter past twelve the brownlows never went to bed on the same day that they got up except emily of course his breathing was shallow and he was glancing about him nervously listening intently because somewhere a floorboard creaked it would be just like emily to sneak downstairs fling open the door suddenly her expression ready in case she caught him at the cocktail cabinet helping himself to the bottle of dimple which they kept specially for river view callers whatever are you doing sat there in your gardening clothes george anybody would think you objected to sleeping in the same room as me but she didnt come feverish haste scrabbling that thing out of his pocket so that it slipped through his fingers bounced on the carpet and rolled clinked as it hit the table leg and came to rest staring at him four venomous eyes glinting in the subdued lighting it really hated him he caught his breath was aware how his heart was pounding im sorry i didnt mean to drop you like that i hope you havent hurt yourself the snake eyes lost some of their fire those fangs could almost have been smiling pick me up then dont be afraidhe advanced stretched out a hand nervously touched the strange metal with trembling fingers almost dropped it again he crossed the room laid it on the flat top of the cocktail cabinet emily would go beserk if she came in now sod emily he examined it more closely used his handkerchief to wipe away some of the dinging mud those eyes following his every move there was no getting away from them no matter where you hid they would search you out it was an amulet he wondered why he had not realised that before probably because he had only seen it in the halflight old very old and very dirty it needed cleaning that was the first job and it had to be done right away he crept into the kitchen holding the amulet as though it was a piece of antique crockery laying it carefully on the table while he searched emilys cupboards for some kind of cleaning substance ah duraglit that would do fine he remembered using it in the army to clean his brasses it wasnt easy there was mud caked in all those peculiar little grooves and he had to use a pin to scrape them clean hieroglyphics that was feasible if indeed this was an amulet now how the deuce did this thing come to be buried in a river view garden a modern housing area where something flashed across his memory barrys words coming back to him like distant echoes in the mountains theres supposed to be some egyptian mummies buried somewhere hereabouts george brownlows scalp prickled and he looked towards the window for once the curtains were not drawn a sure sign that emily wasnt around outside there was the blackness of a summers night the darkness could have hidden anything he swallowed wondered whether or not to break off from what he was doing and go and close the curtains he had that awful feeling that he was being watched temporary relief mingled with his fear he was being watched all right by that doubleheaded serpent engraved on the amulet its eyes redly afire again blood red jewels which blazed an uncontrollable hatred for him it held his gaze he could feel its power numbing him like some potent drug shutting him off from the rest of the world just himself and thatl mumbled incoherent apologies for disturbing its last resting place for daring to clean it with some modern substance for treating it like some object of curiosity he promised to rebury it not to dig any more in case he came upon those mummies injured them with a pick or a spade knew hed said the wrong thing and caused offence by the way those eyes filled with the liquid fire of some terrible wrath you must dig and dig make this place which i have already commanded you to make george brown low nodded dumbly he didnt understand how the serpent knew about his plans but at least it approved of them he could not think why it was as though it could read his mind and that was a terrifying thought he finished cleaning the amulet wondered where he should keep it there was nowhere private in this house his wife was likely to go poking in the most unexpected places there was only one sure place on his person the eyes dulled he felt their force being withdrawn from him an almost physical sensation like something was being sucked from him allowing him to think more freely one last brief flicker from those eyes do not underestimate me i never sleep for i am set trembling violently george brownlow picked up the amulet felt once more its icy coldness the ancient life which emanated from it like some powercharged massager and he knew without any doubt that he was its stave committed to absolute obedience he must dig for he had been ordered to do so complete his shelter for some purpose besides his own instinct to survive the holocaust which he knew must come before long it was an unnerving thought george brownlow paused at the foot of the stairs rested his hand on the rail felt the sudden surge of exhaustion which until now had been checked as though by some psychological dam he needed to sleep his eyelids began to close flickered open again looking about him as though he expected to see some nameless horror creeping upon him some giant doubleheaded serpent with burning red eyes which hissed and commanded him to go out there in the stillness of night and excavate that shelter because his master had need of it cringing dragging himself up the stairs mutely pleading to be allowed a few hours rest so that on the morrow he might work all the faster stealthily easing himself through the bedroom door leaving the landing light on because he feared the blackness and the evil which it held he saw the outline of emilys body on the far twin bed by the window a still shape that might or might not be breathing and he did not care whether she lived or died because she did not figure in the plans of the one who called himself set george brownlow knew that he would not be allowed to rest that the snake god had ordered him to go out into the garden and dig had endowed him with a strength beyond that of the average man of fiftytwo would spare him the perils of pushing his body beyond its limits he swung the pick winced as his muscles became shock absorbers shovelled at the loose soil and stones threw them up on to the growing pile a kind of rhythm and once you eased into it your tiredness disappeared this way one could go on digging forever the big hole was getting deeper more moist too which was only to be expected so close to a river george wondered what time it was how soon it would be dawn but time did not matter he had to keep on digging because the serpent god would be very angry if he shirked his task silence except for the thuds of soil the trickle of small stones like a miniature avalanche now the hole was so deep that he had to reach right up to toss each shovelful clear the night sky above dark with no hint of the coming of a new day no stars like the entire universe was dead and george brownlow was the only remaining living being the sole survivor after some terrible catastrophe which had destroyed mankind he wanted to cry but the tears would not come just a burning sensation as though he too was dying from radiation poisoning but he was forced to keep on working until that happened and even when it did there was no guarantee that he would be granted the peace he craved still digging sensing the hopelessness of it all but working fervently because he dared not slacken a robot who had no control over his own actions stones were showering back faster than ever now he had dug so deep that it was impossible from where he stood to throw the earth far enough back from the hole he would have to climb out shovel some of that mountainous heap away and in that one awful instant george brownlow became aware that there was no way in which he could clamber out of the pit which he had dug for himself sheer terror at first whimpering and resigning himself to his fate trying to shout but no sound came cringing in a corner his back damp from sweat and moist earth then came the panic a desperation that had him jumping at the sides trying to claw a handhold slipping and falling back sobbing his foot kicked against something hard and a sudden ray of hope infiltrated his crazed brain the spade and the pick he still had them he could dig his way out it wasnt easy trying to swing the pickaxe in the confined space of that gravetike hole there was no room to manipulate it so he began using it as a lever gouging despair again solid rock and he had not the force to smash it the pick dropped from his hands crashed on to his foot but the pain went unnoticed he seized the spade stretched up with it and began loosening the surface soil perhaps he could move enough of it to give him a shelf which he could reach and haul himself up on to soil and stones began to shower back on him forcing him to turn his head aside he heard the avalanche before he saw it a noise like a tipper truck of rubble being emptied then the full force of the excavated soil hit him threw him back flung him to the floor in those few seconds his terror reached a peak his vocal chords functioned again but his scream was cut off by a mouthful of foul earth he fought against the tide knew he was buried beneath it and could still hear the rumble of falling soil feel the weight on his body becoming greater until surely he must be squashed and suffocated an instinctive gasping for air astonished that he was still able to breathe he tried to move his limbs but they were securely pinned down and all around there was unpenetrable blackness buried alive catalepsy how long would it take him to die now that he was immobile his brain was functioning logically torturing him nobody knew where he was normal people were asleep in bed emily would certainly never dream of coming into the garden to look for him if youre fool enough to dig in the middle of the night george then you can damned well stop out there and dont expect me to come bringing you cups of tea you should see the doctor doctor it was an undertaker george brownlow would need but if he was still alive in this grave then what was the point of burying him again oh god somebody cremate me let me die time passed minutes or hours he had no conception just lying there his mind a turmoil again maybe they would never think to look for him in here would not realise theyd list him as a missing person and wait for him to turn up and if for some reason he didnt die he thought he heard something it was impossible he was buried too deep his imagination was playing tricks on him again he held his breath if in fact he breathed or was he already dead and this was the stygian blackness of an eternal hell definitely he heard something a kind of slithering sound like a snake might make a doubleheaded one trying to shy away only he could not move not knowing whether his eyes were open or shut waiting trying to whimper his fear again something touched him oh jesus god it was vile cold and slimy easing its way up his leg as though whatever it was was feeling him out exploring him this time he was sure he screamed for he heard his own yell of terror now he knew without a doubt what the thing on his body was a human hand as cold as death itself pressing probing another one coming to join it his last attempt at a logical explanation before his mind snapped theyd found him dug down to rescue him but he knew he only lied to himself because those icy fingers were exploring him with obscene lusting pleasure broken fingernails gouging his flesh in their eagerness are you my beloved abaaner answer me my beloved for it has been so long since i last set eyes upon you that i fail to recognise you have you changed with the passing of time somehow george brownlow found that he could see in the darkness a strange radiance penetrated the gloom showed him the heaped earth interspersed with tunnels just wide enough to crawl through as though some giant mole had burrowed down here that was why he could still breathe because there was a current of air coming down from above if only he could free himself from the heap of earth that pinned him down and suddenly he saw it had a full view of the creature which knelt over him pawing at him with hands from which the rotting flesh hung in strips revulsion mingled with terror his brain unable to accept that such a thing could possibly live human in form at least it had a head and arms and legs the whole body swathed in dirty frayed bandages which unravelled as it moved revealing flesh beneath that was green with decomposition and giving off a stench of putrefaction a female because breasts sagged from it like empty pouches you are not abaaner disappointment and grief mingling in that harsh croak dont look at the face for gods sake dont look upon those features his crazed brain made one last attempt to save his sanity but he ignored it he could not hold back a cry which incorporated pity and fear as he gazed upon features from which the swathings had unravelled beautiful once but now they were horrific for the parasites of the soil had already begun to ravage things that wriggled and crawled as they feasted upon human carrion an eye dangled from its socket still living still seeing trying to twist its way round so that it had a view of the human who had trespassed in this place of the dead nostrils that bubbled some kind of yellow mucus wheezing as the frail lungs fought to hold on to life a creature that was dying only its willpower giving it the strength to crawl some strange obsession keeping the spark of life kindled within that awful body a mouth that had no lips just even white teeth wobbling in the shrunken gums as it spoke who are you stranger and what have you done with my beloved abaaner you have harmed him stolen his body as it was stolen once before by a holy man who did not keep his word george brownlow tried to shake his head in denial attempted to speak but the sound he made was unintelligible she was becoming angry he must convince her that he had not seen this abaaner whoever he was she gave a hiss of rage and he smelled the foulness of her breath an icy blast that had him retching now she was upon him puny skeletal fists beating at him pummelling his body in a frenzy of blows tell me where abaaner is set himself has sent you to steal him to take his body from me just as he was taken in life a denial was impossible against the windmilling arms bony fists inflicting pain her fury escalating as she attacked him he tasted blood tried to cry out that he would help her search for abaaner but nothing could penetrate that hurricane of inhuman rage the blackness came at him again as though that strange light had been suddenly extinguished leaving him a helpless victim of this strange woman in the terrible unending darkness george for gods sake wake up george brownlow writhed managed to get a grip on one of those wrists held it strangely it didnt feel cold anymore he twisted it was rewarded by a shriek of pain i tell you i have not stolen abaaner he screeched and i dont know who the hell he is now let me go suddenly the light was back again not the soft indeterminable glow this time but the harsh dazzling brightness of an electric bulb he still smelled that rotting human carrion fanned by her stinking breath but the flesh no longer peeled from her body harsh features certainly but they belonged to emily he relaxed his grip on her wrist and she snatched her hand away rubbed at the red weal he stared around his own bedroom lying on his own single bed the blankets a rumpled heap damp with sweat emily watched him carefully with narrowed eyes stepped back a pace and glanced in the direction of the door youve been having a nightmare george her tone was reproachful yet there was no disguising the relief what a din you kicked up i wouldnt be surprised if youve woken barry and sheila not to mention me just when my migraine was beginning to ease up tin sorry he was trembling with relief he could still taste that horrible cloying grave soil he licked his lip where it was bleeding never mind about being sorry just look what a disturbance youve created youre overdoing it george ive never had to say that to you in your life before but now youve gone barmy digging a nuclear shelter indeed as if you could make one the most youve ever been able to do is dig the garden and even that gives you lumbago this nonsense will have to stop otherwise im going to have a word with dr home about you i reckon youre going senile but george brownlow wasnt listening words echoed in his brain but they werent emilys what have you done with my beloved abaaner and he knew that tomorrow he must continue with his excavations a compelling inexplicable obsession for which the construction of a nuclear fallout shelter was but a facade he shuddered to think what he might discover deep down in that riverside soil chapter three the plague of frogs your old mans going round the bend adrian capper kicked a stone idly watched it skim along the narrow path and then plop into the river i reckon its the heat but if it isnt it soon will be digging ail day in this temperature its mum thats driven him to it sheila squeezed his hand found herself wishing that she didnt ever have to go back to her family that she and her boyfriend could remain in this peaceful river setting forever idyllic but one had to face reality youve no idea what its like at home nagging and bickering all day long i said to myself the day dad got made redundant that something was going to snap between him and mum she never lets up why cant we find a place of our own he slipped an arm around her pulled her close hell we dont have to get married and to hell with your mother id like to she was watching a group of water boatmen in a clearing in the thick reedbed which bordered the bank its just that well i dont like walking out on dad jesus christ hes old enough to look after himself he almost added too bloody old if you ask me hes got barry and rita adrian added pulling her close to him i know maybe ive been too indoctrinated at home adrian but i feel like im walking out on them i cant explain it but but theres something wrong im worried about dad dyou know what he said at breakfast adrian no but ill make an intelligent guess he grinned pass me the marmalade youre just being silly im sorry but i didnt mean it go on what did he say it was ever so queer mum was going on about a nightmare hed apparently had last night and telling him as usual that he wasnt cut out for hard physical work when suddenly he stared at us and said i am the one who has been chosen to lead you out of the wilderness we shall suffer plagues famine and drought but i shall lead you to safety i know it sounds stupid but i felt little shivers running up my back it wasnt just what he said it was his expression his eyes were all glazed as if he was in a trance or something lets sit down and have a rest adrian steered sheila away from the path to where a patch of springy grass still showed green protected from three weeks of burning sun by the overhanging foliage of a spreading willow tree its too hot to walk far i guess most folks have stayed at home usually this track is crowded on a summer evening they stretched themselves out on the grass so still so windless the sun already sinking in the west it was hard to believe that only a few hundred yards away stood the housing estate no noise except for the chirping rasping sound of grasshoppers and the croaking of frogs in the rushes a swallow swooped down after flies circled tried again then it too went away and didnt come back the heat was affecting everything and everybody adrian decided that was why old brownlow was digging his ludicrous nuclear shelter when the weather broke hed pack it in but according to the forecasters the drought was going on into its fourth week the experts had said that was a freak that it could never happen again the unpredictable british climate was doing its damnedest to prove them wrong i told dad i was thinking of moving out sheila turned her face towards his and he saw that her eyes were misty oh adrian i want us to be together i was hoping that maybe youd come back from the jobcentre with some good news today he wanted to say we could manage on your money from the supermarket but only his pride his selfrespect held him back perhaps i could find some casual work half the populations moonlighting as it is no i guess well just have to carry on as we are for a bit i could afford a bedsit though just to get away from home theres a limit to loyalty he kissed her was suddenly glad that hed brought her down here courting one of the brownlows wasnt easy sheila almost said stop it pandered to her upbringing as she felt his fingers unflip a button on her blouse move on to the next she felt her body go tense rigid tried to stop that repetitive bleat of her mothers intruding dontyou go making yourself cheap take it from me no man respects a girl who lets him do those sort of things to her oh god shut up mother weve already done it before twice defying emily brownlow in her own mind easing herself up so that adrian could pull her blouse right off assisting him with the clipfastener on her bra because he wasnt used to those sort of things you keep out of this mother closing her eyes because she felt embarrassed for him wanted him to view her nakedness without inhibition so cool without her clothes she heard him undressing squinted through halfclosed eyes curiosity she couldnt imagine mum and dad ever having done anything like this they must have though because of herself and barry the thought was repulsive she pushed it from her mind adrian was kissing her again she could tell he was apprehensive possibly her own nervousness rubbing off on him the first time the first time ever she reminded herself it had been like this she had tried to kid him that it had been great certainly it hadnt hurt as it was supposed to if one believed everything one heard but it had been sort of well negative it was a bit trying having it on the floor of the living room in adrians house with his parents in bed directly above them listening all the time not really paying attention to what they were doing she had faked an orgasm wondered if she had really fooled him but no way was she able to come like she did when she masturbated now her nerves were troubling her again suppose somebody came a casual stroller along the riverside exercising their dog oh god the shock the embarrassment fumbling to get dressed surely either herself or adrian would hear anybody coming listening again the grasshoppers had gone silent just the frogs a chorus from the bullrushes damn it she could hear her mothers whining voice girls who do things like that are likely to get themselves pregnant and just think what a disgrace that would be for us we should have to move out of the area god mother youre ruining this for me now im feeling guilty next thing ill be going to church again adrian was on top of her now she felt his lips brushing hers opened her mouth to receive his tongue a movement that was an invitation to him to go ahead damn it she was all tense again and that wasnt making it any easier for him i love you he whispered and i love you adrian oh god id love to get pregnant right now have your baby and to hell with mother and her prudishness and snobbishness a rhythm that slowed they both found themselves listening again the frogs seemed louder nearer a distraction it was almost dark now and somehow the night air seemed alive as though an electric storm was brewing but that couldnt be because there hadnt been a single cloud in the sky for days on end sheila tried to pick up the rhythm again but it had slipped away that tension had returned and now their lovemaking was purely a physical function that was no longer sensuous she wished adrian would hurry up and finish and maybe next time she would respond more eagerly emily brownlows voice echoed in her brain again always say sex is the most overrated thing in the world women only do it to please their husbands and i sometimes wonder if men get anything out of it i reckon they only do it to try and prove something damn it was all gone now and adrian seemed to be experiencing difficulties she wanted to say why dont we pack it up and try again another time but she was afraid in case she offended him blast you emily brownlow this is all your fault the night was noisy she wouldnt have believed that frogs could make so much din she shivered and her naked body goosepimpled repulsive little things so cold and slimy she would never forget that time when she was seven when barry had come home from a fishing expedition ive got a surprise for you she he had grinned close your eyes and open your mouth wide she had done so anticipating a sweet or something pleasant oh even now the memory of it made her retch something had popped into her mouth a tiny cold slippery thing that had jumped and almost gone down her throat shed been violently sick then fainted when shed seen that awful little creature attempting to extricate itself from her vomit a baby frog about the size of her thumbnail goodness they were making the devil of a row tonight are you ok she yes she opened her eyes again saw his outline as he knelt over her im ok just tired i suppose im not much good tonight it doesnt matter i wasnt much feeling like it anyway maybe we should go somewhere more secluded next time but i love you adrian i love you too he reached out groped for the scattered garments in the darkness lets get dressed and go back to our place for a coffee not your place although were in spitting distance of it he tossed her blouse across to her and even as she caught it something fell out of it landed squat on her bare stomach hopped and sheila brownlow screamed because she recognised the feel of a frog a loud shriek of sheer terror and revulsion and even before the echoes had died away the whole area seemed to come to life frogs dozens of them jumping squatting jumping again shut up its only a frog she was becoming hysterical leaping up treading on something soft and cold that burst beneath her foot oozing a slimy substance from the squashed flattened body another one she slipped and fell yelled as she fell among them she was up again screaming and running blindly adrian capper in pursuit two naked people who had completely forgotten their clothes scattered in the long grass headlong flight feeling the small reptiles being crushed beneath their feet out on to the path that ran parallel to the river trying to shut out that maddening chorus it was as though the frogs mocked them as they ran the gauntlet the track narrowed a steep bank on one side that went down to the river below dangerous if you missed your footing desperately adrian tried to catch sheila up his greatest fear was that she might fall into the deep sluggish current she had an inherent fear of water and the most he could swim was a length at the baths and he had only managed that because he had been afraid of the school swimming instructor wait for me sheila but sheila wasnt waiting for anybody her mind crazed by a nightmarish fear that had suddenly become reality ahead of her she saw the lights of the river view estate and only there would she be safe adrian trod on a frog slithered and almost fell into the river sheila gained another ten yards gasped her relief as she saw the outline of her parents garden fence prayed that her father hadnt put the padlock on in the glow of the orange streetlighting she saw the reptiles for the first time experienced a wave of nausea that had her slowing to a halt feeling faint they were everywhere hundreds of them a living slippery carpet that barred her way to safety theres no way through she screamed and would have turned back had not adrian caught her pulled her to him pull yourself together he shook her roughly theyre only frogs theyre harmless theyre horrible she was straining trying to break free there was no knowing what she would do if he didnt restrain her somehow they had to get back to the brownlow household all around them eyes glinted in the distant glow of the river view streetlamps thousands of orange orbs a myriad of revolting shimmering yellowishgreen evil the creatures hopped checked hopped again as though they knew sensed human fear and were bunching to surround the fugitives cutting off their escape route were going through them adrian stooped exerted every ounce of strength he could muster and lifted sheila cradling her to him no she screamed they cant hurt us she was struggling kicking and flaying her arms adrian no no for gods sake lets run theres nowhere to run to sheila except back to your house now close your eyes and hold on tight to me im going through that lot adrian had never before been frightened of frogs or similar reptiles suddenly they were repulsive to him those eyes watching him almost as though they anticipated what he was going to do jesus christ if only hed stopped to put his shoes on it wouldnt have been so bad try not to think about them dont look down keep your eyes fixed on that garden gate once youre through there youre ok youll be safe he dared not run in case he slipped a fast walk long strides something soft and spongy beneath his foot bursting ugh then another and another just keep going a carpet of them in front of him where the path narrowed he held sheila tight prayed that he wasnt going to throw up all over her it was like walking on pieces of waterlogged foam rubber the water squelching squirting up over his bare feet frogs blood if there was such a thing and that noise a symphony that filled the still night air more aggressive now stop them stop them stop them adrian capper wasnt stopping his feet skidded on the remains of flattened reptiles once he almost fell but somehow he kept going the gate was less than twenty yards away sheila experienced a wave of nausea felt again that tiny frog which her mischievous brother had popped into her open mouth its cold slimy texture and the way it had almost hopped down her throat she almost vomited heaved and tasted bile if adrian fell or dropped her it didnt bear thinking about he came to a halt she heard the metallic click of a latch and opened her eyes they had made it they were inside the garden but the frogs were here as well the big lawn appeared to move in jerky waves and the reflection from the streetlamps showed a shiny mass of tiny bodies eyes turned towards the newcomers seeing and understanding oh my god her fingernails gouged adrian dont worry its not far to the house his eyes were searching for a path through them a route where they were more sparse but there was none hold on were on the last lap now it was like wading through blancmange fresh from the refrigerator a sea of reptiles converging on the fleeing couple kamikaze frogs one died and another ten took its place up on to the patio kicking them aside to reach the back door feeling them hurling themselves against his bare legs a futile attack because in the end strength would win the day sweep them back from the step get the door open and slam it behind you then youll be safe only the door was locked adrian felt the frogs milling around his feet crawling over them he kicked them away felt another batch come at him for christs sake open up he screamed for the first time he felt helpless abandoned sheila was starting to panic again he drew back his foot drove it hard against the lower panel of the door gasped with pain where the hell was everybody frogs were hopping up the steps as though massing for a final assault a wave of cold slime which would overrun the cowering humans adrian remembered a film hed seen once on tv about giant maneating frogs in a swamp but these were ordinary frogs they couldnt hurt you mother always locks the back door after dark sheila buried her face against his chest theyre probably watching telly and cant hear us the croaking was growing in volume a vibrant noise that came up from the river and beyond deafening and then the fugitives heard a key turning in the back door adrian was pushing inside sheila clasped to him bundling a startled george brownlow out of the way the door slammed shut again oi whats going on brownlows astonishment turned to anger as he surveyed his naked visitors never mind that now adrian lowered sheila to the floor doubtless i can borrow a shirt and some jeans of barrys but dyou know whats happening out there george brownlows gaze was riveted on the lower half of adrians body disgust mingling with anger have you been doing something with my daughter ill get you some of barrys clothes adrian sheila made for the door gasped her alarm and embarrassment as she met her mother and rita coming in from the hall george whatevers happening whats going on emily brownlow shrieked dont open the door else those frogsll get in oh my god that boys naked just shut up for once mother sheila pushed passed her ran for the stairs theres a perfectly ordinary explanation sheila didnt know one right now but shed think up one she was trembling as she raced upstairs her legs suddenly weak and threatening to buckle under her but the frogs couldnt get them in here i wont stand for this in my house emily shrieked george get that boy out i wont have it dyou hear me but george brownlow was peering out of the window shielding his eyes against the reflection of the lighted room he pursed his lips whistled tunelessly where on earth have they all come from barry appeared behind rita grinned at the sight of adrian busily wrapping the rollertowel around his waist from the river george brownlows voice was suddenly low his eyes glazed as though an instant cataract had formed where else dyou think theyve come from out of the bulrushes that hid moses swarming in their millions the plague of frogs is upon us for we are the accursed have i not already warned you youre mad emily ventured into the room now that adrian had the towel around him her angry eyes picking out a couple of slimy bare footmarks just inside the back door youre all mad the garden is full of frogs and my daughter comes home naked its disgusting and i wont stand for it i want an explanation as to what you two have been up to why you havent got any clothes on dyou hear me the plague is upon us george brownlows features were ashen the frogs first but there will be others you mark my words the gods are angry with us silence nobody in the room spoke for everybody was listening to the growing cacophony of the frogs outside for once not even emily brownlow could dispute her husbands words the plague was certainly upon them chapter four the rod of moses george brownlow was up long before the rest of the household the following morning fearfully peering out of the bedroom window he gave a grunt of relief as his eyes searched the garden below there was not a frog in sight they had returned whence they had come a sign from the gods a warning tonight they might come again he dressed quickly and quietly and with a swift glance at the sleeping form of emily he went downstairs a slight headache due doubtless to the restless night hed had flitting nightmarish dreams that were gone before he could remember them leaving in their wake a growing depression he went into the kitchen poured himself a glass of fresh orange juice from the fridge it was going to be hot again today and tomorrow and the day after all the same he shivered for this was only the beginning of what he was but destinys pawn and all he could do was dig and dig george brownlow went outside looked around apprehensively the frogs had left little evidence of their coming just one or two squashed patches of unrecognisable morass that the early morning sun was already drying up on a sudden impulse he decided to check the river first they had gone back there undoubtedly to seek the cool of the rushes by day and tonight footsteps accompanied by a clanking and rattling of glass bottles a quick step and a tuneless whistling had him whirling round the milkman damn the fellow hed taken to bringing the milk round the back lately presumably to leave it in the patch of shade temporarily offered by the rear of the house mornin lovely morning yes george regarded the other impatiently the whole country is being scorched up looks like another mrs braithwaite has been tellin me about the frogs lowering the crate extracting three bottles suddenly dawdling gossip was a perk of an otherwise mundane job she reckons er garden was alive with the things last night she even ad to sweep em out of the ouse what dyou make o that nothing to get worked up about george brownlow spoke tersely he was in no mood to gossip with tradesmen its just the heat that caused it nothing else freak weather conditions do strange things to animals no different from when we had that tremendous thunderstorm last summer the gardens were swarming with frogs then and nobody gave it a second thought the creatures went back down to the river afterwards just as theyve done now they dont do any harm no i suppose not the milkman straightened up made as if to say something else but george brownlow had already turned away he was like most of the other residents on river view bloody snobbish beneath him to talk to the milkman bugger im bugger em all george brownlow listened to the others receding footsteps the way the gate slammed shut after him good riddance then his thoughts returned to sheila and adrian their story could just be true and to satisfy his own conscience he preferred to believe it theyd gone for a stroll along the river bank and the evening had been so sultry that they had been tempted to bathe ugh there was sewage in this river the water was always black and muddy sluggish uninviting and neither of them could swim properly points against them points for them down by the oxbow the water was shallow safe if you didnt venture too far out which meant it wasnt deep enough to swim there anyway so there was no need to strip naked but they might have done that because the evening was so hot yes that was it not that george brownlow approved because the sight of a naked body of the opposite sex could lead to other things but he believed them just a bathe nothing else because sheila wouldnt do anything like that cautiously he let himself out of the garden gate scrutinised the winding path that followed the course of the river a couple of crows flapped up cawed angrily they had been feeding on dead frogs a delicacy to which they would return in due course black wings outstretched they glided across the river perched in the branches of a dead elm watched him bale fully vultures he licked his dry lips vultures always came in the wake of a plague in the distance he heard the whine of the milkmans electric vehicle so mundane out of place he stopped listened intently grasshoppers chirping but not a sound of frogs they would rest by day and come again at nightfall harmless unless you got too many of them and then there was no knowing what they would do what the sideeffects would be on the balance of nature the touch of cold metal in his pocket brought with it a feeling of guilt he should be digging not wasting his time down here also he would have to find a safe hiding place for the amulet he turned began to retrace his steps and that was when something lying on the side of the path attracted his attention a dead stick nothing more he was on the point of ignoring it but his gaze came back to it ornate for such a trivial thing nature was truly a perfectionist greenishbrown as though some vestige of life still remained in this length of broken branch with a dark zigzag pattern running the whole way down its twofoot length curiosity a desire to examine it closer had him stooping down to pick it up and in that instant it came to life a rigid stick that his fingers closed over suddenly became a writhing spitting venomous thing securing a grip on his wrist by wrapping its body around it a head that turned on him with tiny flashing eyes and fangs that opened hissed terror not just because he was being attacked by a repulsive angry snake but because it had materialised out of a harmless branch he screamed fell back and cried out again with pain almost blacked out trying to knock it off his arm knowing that already it was too late because he had been bitten a sensation like a clumsy injection that had snapped the needle and left it in his flesh and then the snake had gone releasing itself and diving for freedom wriggling away into the scorched undergrowth with unbelievable speed leaving its human victim to nurse his wound george brownlow stared horrified at the swelling red mark on his hand the oozing trickle of blood oh merciful god it had bitten him injected its venom into his bloodstream a wave of dizziness engulfed him at the thought he might die he staggered to his feet swayed and almost fell maybe it was too late already something registered in his brain an article hed read in a magazine somewhere possibly one of those journals that you look at in the dentists waitingroom but dont really take the contents in because your mind is on what you might have to have done to you the fear of pain again snakebite a warning some advice on first aid suck the poison out of the wound his stomach churned god hed throw up spew or die that was his choice he closed his eyes pressed his lips to the wound somehow forced himself to suck a bitter taste tike iron he spat it out stared down at the blob of pink spittle in the dust almost fainted then he was retching vomiting that orange juice with incredible force he had to get help quickly if he collapsed here he would be dead by the time they found him dont run it makes your heart work faster pumps the poison round your system lurching from side to side staring intently at the bleeding snakebite wondering if he had the courage to suck it again he hadnt george brownlow slipped had to use his wounded arm to save himself from falling left a sktdmark of squashed frogs across the pathway the crows were still watching him cawed again as if mocking him flapped their wings vultures impatient to return to their carrion a red mist hovered before his eyes an illusion that it drifted in from the river he saw the gate gave way to a sudden fear that it might be a mirage almost shouted his relief aloud when he touched it and found that it was solid one fearful glance back in case that snake was following him but all he saw was a frog corpse and a pair of corvines gliding back down to finish their breakfast across the lawn barely glancing at his diggings he shouted as he reached the patio steps emily emily ive been bitten by a snake where the hell are you no answer a silent kitchen greeted him that empty tumbler on the table still with orange dregs in it and he almost vomited again mouthing curses they didnt care if he died his slothful family would lie in their beds while he writhed his last on the floor as he burst through into the hall he heard footsteps coming downstairs sheila her blonde hair in disarray her flimsy nylon negligee a reminder of how he had seen her last night whatever quick almost a scream ive been bitten by a snake oh what rubbish dad disbelief and annoyance on her pert features then her eyes widening as he held up his arm oh god she came closer paled ill phone for the doctor now sit down here on this chair his vision spun and he had to hold on to the sides of the chair vaguely heard her dialling and a distant phone ringing out somewhere brrbrrbrr like grasshoppers chirping any moment hed hear the frogs starting up sheila was sucking in her breath it reminded him of the way that snake had hissed he closed his eyes the rod of moses he george brownlow had performed that same miracle only the serpent had been angry and turned upon him he saw it again that snaking blur too fast for the eye to follow an evil spitting head that might have been two he couldnt be sure he shifted his position and the amulet in his pocket clinked faintly he almost felt it to be sure that it was safe but he didnt sheer revulsion at the mental picture of that repulsive carving at the first opportunity he would get rid of it throw it in the river no he wasnt going near the river again no way there were other places surely a feeling of guilt he had no right to dispose of it sheila was talking listening talking again her words didnt register he couldnt concentrate she dropped the receiver back on to its cradle doctor homes coming round right away youre to lie and rest on the couch until he gets here now take that dirty old jacket off or mother will go mad if you soil her best settee the amulet clinked again in protest as george brownlow shrugged his frayed garment off and he knew then without any doubt that he was not going to dispose of the amulet of set it would not let him youll be all right the greyhaired taciturn dr home permitted himself a faint smile and returned his syringe to his bag gave the dressing on george brownlows arm a final cursory check adder bites are rarely fatal in this country provided theyre treated in time your arm will be stiff for a day or two and youll have to rest please see that he does mrs brownlow hell rest emily vowed with smug satisfaction ill see to that doctor if hed stopped in bed until a civilised hour he wouldnt have been bitten in the first place would he beats me what he was doing down by the river at that hour i was checking on the frogs weak defiance that sounded trite brownlow closed his eyes felt suddenly very tired and his arm was throbbing worse than it had done before dr home had treated it a lot of frogs came up out of the river last night emily brownlow felt that some explanation was necessary for her husbands seemingly irrational statement the garden was alive with them and we had to keep the doors shut but theyve all gone now thank goodness home nodded he wasnt interested in frogs or snakes for that matter it was ten years since he had last been called out to treat a viper bite its the freak weather thats to blame adders are fond of basking in a warm place and their natural camouflage makes them look like a piece of dead stick theyre usually harmless unless somebody treads on them by accident people dont usually pick them up though anyway if the swelling and the ache hasnt gone in a couple of days pop down to the surgery and ill have another look at it dont call me out because doctors only give home visits in an emergency he added to himself before leaving i almost told him about this other business emily moved to the window waited until the doctor started his car up as though she was afraid he might overhear her the plagues of egypt indeed youd better rest up george and maybe youll feel better we cant afford any scandals the plagues have arrived he was lying back on the couch eyes closed his voice a whisper that was barely audible i have handled the rod of moses and it has spurned me yet i still have work to do for set has commanded me you stop where you are emily glanced around wished that barry and sheila did not have to go to work and leave her alone with george all day youve got to rest like doctor home says you have to there was no answer george brownlow might even have been asleep and for the first time ever emily brownlow experienced a fear of her husband a chilling sensation that had her skin prickling chapter five locusts look youve got to get a flat and get out of that mad household it was the first time sheila had ever seen adrian really angry his voice was raised and surely his parents in the bedroom directly above would come down to see what was going on it isnt safe and i can tell its playing on your nerves your old mans going right round the bend he must have been up to something else he wouldnt have got a snakebite at five oclock in the morning i cant just walk out like that she felt the tears welling up behind her eyes normally sensitive she would be crying soon you cant desert your family when they need you need you he shouted theyve never needed you before your mothers a right bitch and if she has driven your dad crazy then its up to her to do something about it if he wants to go and dig craters in the garden then thats his business but once he starts involving you then i reckon its mine and you know damned well your folks dont believe that yarn we spun them about bathing in the nude because it was hot and having to make a run for it when the frogs came up out of the river we look bloody stupid christ we shouldve thought of something more feasible than that well its too late now and to hell with them see this he picked up a folded copy of the evening mail indicated a place in the classifieds which he had pencilmarked this bedsit is cut out for you no palace but its warm and clean take it and give ourselves a breathing space to look round for something better jesus christ youve already hinted to your dad that you might be leaving home no she was having to fight to hold back the sobs now i wont because it isnt right and im beginning to think that you only want me for one thing thats a lie his cheeks flushed a blow below the belt which had really hurt ive never once pushed myself at you i was a virgin before i met you she glanced away picked up her handbag oh happy days anyway im very tired and im going home to bed ill give you a ring in a day or two what about tomorrow night a sinking sensation in his stomach they had never missed a night together ever since they had first started courting tin stopping in tomorrow night ill ring you thursday whatever youre not going home on your own im coming with you ill be all right she tried to shake him off but he was holding her too tightly i can look after myself adrian tightlipped turning her head away sure and what if the place is crawling with frogs again like it was last night she sighed knew she could not go through all that again i suppose so but im not changing my mind im not leaving home adrian they walked in silence across the recreation park a couple whose relationship had suddenly fused adrian glanced sideways at her saw her strained expression the way she kept peering into the shadows it wasnt just frogs it was a culmination of everything that was happening up at river view adrian had a strange sort of feeling about george brownlow the guy wasnt just going mad something was happening to him something that had taken place without anyone knowing and had changed his whole life that was how hitler had started an obsession that had plunged the whole world into war and cost millions of lives whatever sheila might say or do adrian capper wasnt going to be relegated to the role of a bystander listen he stopped still grasping her hand firmly they were on the river view estate now parallel to the river a quiet secluded culdesac of executive houses in which everybody appeared to have retired for the night there wasnt even a light showing from the brownlows sheila strained her ears picked up a distant sound like a throaty buzz low and yet the still night air vibrated with it its its the frogs again they sound a long way off and maybe they havent come up as far as they did last night anyway ill see you to the front door all right but no further promise he nodded sighed and led the way in through the drive the gravel crunching softly beneath their feet something darted into the shadows probably a mouse he felt sheila tense begin fumbling for her door key tomorrow almost a plea still holding on to her in case she suddenly rushed inside and slammed the door in his face i told you ill ring you thursday now be satisfied and dont pester a peck on the cheek and she was gone the oakpanelled front door clicking shut almost silently and leaving adrian capper outside in a lonely desolate world the moment the door closed behind her sheila brownlow gave way to her tears the sobs shaking her body as she stood there in the darkened hall oh god what was happening to her she wanted adrian wanted to be with him all the time yet something was compelling her to divorce herself from him her mothers indoctrination you cant let us all down by marrying a boy off a council estate sheila its making your dad and me ill emotional blackmail no it wasnt that something much deeper much more sinister something that was determined to chain her to the brownlow household she took off her shoes crept upstairs stood listening on the landing the sound of heavy rhythmical breathing from her parents bedroom they were both fast asleep silence from barrys but she knew he was in for the first time in months he hadnt switched on his record player a sense of foreboding had sheila tiptoeing away to her own room it was as though something was happening to the brownlows trapping them here on river view uniting them for an unknown purpose ostracising them from the rest of society and sheila brownlow didnt want to leave anymore not even for adrian he was an outsider barry brownlow lay for a long time staring up at the ceiling in the darkness of his bedroom so many things to worry about but right now his main concern was for rita she hadnt been well all week at first she had denied it trying to shrug it off maybe ive got a cold coming you know how nasty these summer bugs can be i do have a bit of a sore throat but its nothing really then tonight when he had called to pick her up she had smiled weakly and expressed a desire to stay in i dont feel too good really barry nothing serious that sore throat hasnt gone yet and ive got a headache it could just be because my periods due which was rubbish he knew it and she knew it so they had stayed at the hendons relaxing in deckchairs on the lawn twice rita had fallen asleep her cheeks flushed as though she was running a temperature youd better see the doctor tomorrow hed noticed how hot her mouth was when he kissed her goodnight maybe she squeezed his arm was virtually holding on to him for support it might just be the heat it might have been but it wasnt of that he was sure hed set his alarm half an hour earlier than usual for tomorrow he would give her a call before he went to work and dad was certainly acting strangely like the frogs and the adder which had bitten him george brownlow was the victim of some strange obsession and barry was sure it wasnt just because mother was always on at him he was half resigned to staying away from work tomorrow and keeping an eye on them then he heard sheila come in heard her sobbing downstairs and almost went to see what the trouble was probably some tiff with adrian and it was none of his business all the same it was something else to worry about eventually he drifted into an uneasy sleep rita hendon tossed restlessly in her bed threw off the single damp sheet her naked body was wet with sweat her eyes felt as though they were burning their way out of their sockets as she stared about her in the darkness of her bedroom she could not make out whether she was asleep or awake she concluded after a time that she was awake and very ill she tried to sit up but her strength failed her perhaps she should shout for her parents even though it wasnt fair to disturb them shed be all right if only she could get back to sleep and suddenly she got the feeling that she wasnt alone in the room a creeping fear all the greater because she was so helpless she could neither cry out nor move couldnt see properly either a shadow that was darker than the others seemed to detach itself and glide across to the foot of her bed she tried to swallow but her throat was too dry and her eyes were hurting so much that her vision was distorted now the shadow seemed to split to divide into two a man and a woman dressed in strange flowing robes embracing a sound like somebody was sobbing and the murmur of comforting words that were to no avail for the crying continued then they turned still holding on to each other and stared down at the bed oh abaaner is there no hope for our child the womans voice trembling and barely audible we must pray to set ask his forgiveness because only he can save her for are you not his high priestess dalukah i am yet he has failed me abaaner i am forbidden to see you because you are only a common soldier and now that i have conceived by you the penalty for us all is death myself you and already the curse of set is upon our child also we have nothing to lose now let us beseech horus to save us and our offspring no we dare not that is treachery sets treachery did he not try to murder horus horus is our only hope if we are to save the child dalukah whom have named with my own name so that she may carry on my work rita pressed herself back against the headboard it was as though her whole body was burning being consumed by an inner fire that was rapidly eating her away her terror was at a peak who were these people who were trying to make out that she was their child calling her dalukah it was madness she tried to shout wanted to call her parents but no sound escaped her parched throat i will not let you call horus the man known as abaaner was struggling with the woman and in that instant the room seemed to fill with dark shapes cries of anger a scream something glinted and even at the height of her fever rita recognised it as a sword blade saw it plunged deep into dalukahs breast the distraught girl slumping to the floor her attacker struggling to tug his weapon free whilst his companions held abaaner and in those few seconds it was all over for abaaner too blood pumping from his ruptured heart his dying curses filling the room rita wanted to close her eyes and shut out this awful scene it could not be happening it was but a nightmare brought on by her raging fever but she was forced to watch saw the murderers retreating fading into the shadows as though they feared retribution for their terrible crime it was darker now she could not even make out the corpses on the floor told herself once again that it was all a figment of her imagination and that it had never really happened yet somehow she sensed that she wasnt alone that something still lurked in the darkness suddenly she saw it a writhing angry shape materialising out of the blackness a thing that reared up at the foot of the bed a giant snake whose head seemed to split apart and grow into two four tiny eyes that glowed redly fangs wide in an expression of sheer malevolence she screamed at least she thought she did she felt the power of those venomous orbs scorching into her crazed brain knew that there was no escape that she would die as surely as dalukah and abaaner had because she was their child the vengeance of set is terrible and none can hide from it words that hissed like water being poured on to glowing embers dalukah and abaaner have paid for their foolishness and so must you my child for you have been conceived by one who sought to betray me the curse of set is upon you and your body will burn until you plead for the coolness of death but even after death you will suffer the agonies of a ka consumed by eternal fire from which there is no relief the plague of kami is as the sting of the asp alone now writhing in that damp sheet trying to extricate herself from it weakening by the second vague tortured memories the predictions of george brownlow and how the snake had bitten him too uppermost was the desire for water to slake her thirst to splash it on her burning flesh determination overcame her physical weakness momentarily and she flung off the sheet swung her feet to the floor somehow she made it to an upright position staggered towards the door she stumbled fell against the wall caught her foot against something heavy which sent her sprawling of course the bodies of dalukah and abaaner her parents she clutched at them moaned her grief and terror peering into theblackness of the room and wondering if that awful serpent lay coiled in the shadows mocking her but there were no glowing eyes nothing she groped around could not even locate the corpses now crawling dragging her naked body along the floor and out on to the landing sensing the nearness of water as does one who is lost in a desert wilderness a driving force that overcomes human frailty tongue swollen and protruding scrabbling frantically into the bathroom grabbing at the side of the bath and having to make several attempts to haul herself up falling into it struggling with the tap cursing a sudden gush of water her gasps of relief being drowned by its force as she twisted herself round got her mouth open beneath the jet it should have quenched her thirst cooled her fevered flesh but it didnt water and more water vomiting it back because her stomach could not take any more desperately splashing it over herself but it only seemed to kindle the fire within her the water was no longer cool turning tepid then warm hot so that it scalded her steam rising like a thick grey fog creating weird shapes before her eyes she saw dalukah and abaaner again writhing in their death throes feebly coming towards her and that serpent spitting its venom a liquid that burned and blistered as it hit her and rita hendon managed one final scream before she finally blacked out floating in an abyss where hot desert winds whipped her body and the wails of the damned rang in her ears and her flesh blistered and steamed george brownlow crept stealthily from his bed took his clothes out on to the landing to dress his hand still ached but the swelling had gone down hed be ok once he got the muscles working again hed be fine he had to get back to the digging yesterday was a day lost and he had to make up the time he felt slightly unsteady on his feet and had to hold on to the stairrail he felt weak but a day in bed always made you feel that way a drink of water at the kitchen sink he couldnt face orange juice again one brief moment of indecision perhaps another day in bed would help him to regain his strength and tomorrow he would be back to full fitness no there was no time to waste the amulet still in his pocket clinked faintly as though to urge him on commanding him hurry he went outside it would be hot again in an hour or two and it was best that he got started before the real heat of the day set in his movements were slow an unwillingness because his body protested demanded rest he stood looking at his excavations experienced a feeling of futility and hopelessness the area resembled an oblong of sunken garden with the squares of turf piled up around its perimeter no more than a foot deep at the most he would have to go down at least another ten feet and no longer would he be able to cut the soil out in chunks rock would have to be broken up with the pickaxe carried out in buckets and piled far enough back so that there was no chance of an avalanche oh god beads of sweat began to trickle down his forehead suppose there were mummies buried down there after all he had found the amulet and undoubtedly that was part of the legendary vicars egyptian treasures no the old boy wouldnt have buried the mummies that was all a rumour started by the locals he wouldnt be allowed to because this was not consecrated ground all the same it was a disturbing thought revolting like that adder definitely the thing he had stooped down to pick up had been a length of stick a rod instant transformation into a living entity a miracle that had to be seen to be believed it was all very well dr home going on about how adders were able to camouflage themselves so that they looked like a piece of dead branch but it had been an inanimate object before george brownlow had touched it the rod of moses the curse of set first the frogs had come something attracted his attention on the lawn beyond the shelter diggings he shaded his eyes thought at first it was a frog a dead one that the crows had overlooked no it was the wrong shape and colour a narrow dark body that had glassy wings interlaced with bright yellow fibres red eyes that reminded him of the serpent on the amulet watching him sending a tiny shiver up and down his spine he moved forward approached it warily whatever it was he wasnt going to touch it but he had to know its eyes followed his every movement as though it not only saw but understood like an overgrown grasshopper george brownlow stopped a yard or so from it pursed his lips in bewilderment in a way it was familiar an insect hed seen somewhere maybe in one of those geographical magazines that barry received by post from america or on television suddenly the computers in his brain clicked into action processed the data threw out the answer one that had him recoiling in horror and disbelief that creature squatting on the grass was a locust george backed away slowly the insects gaze following him dont make any sudden movement or else it might fly away he had to be sure and he had to have proof otherwise he was merely inviting the scorn of everybody else it was a locust all right and he needed to capture it he went inside the shed began to grope around with hands that trembled with haste god what a bloody mess it was if emily ever came in here for anything hed never hear the last of it clean it out george and maybe we can find a piece of carpet from somewhere to put on the floor youll never be able to find anything in here and just look at the filth objects slid and fell a tin of nails spilling all over the floor but he ignored them a pile of peacanes were propped untidily in a corner encased in cobwebs he began to sort through them ah muttered excitement and satisfaction unable to believe his luck an old fishing or butterfly net whichever you chose to use it for its mesh black with dirt but still intact he remembered buying it for barry a few years ago and emily had refused to have it in the house it had remained in here ever since searching again an empty jamjar he blew the dust off it the hunter was primed for action back outside the locust was still there eyes fixed on him unblinkingly george brownlow grasped his net purposefully any second the insect might take to the wing of course there would be more but he had to catch this one his proof to his family that yet another plague was beginning he took a step forward then another dont rush it take your time when he was within striking distance of it his breathing speeded up the fingers holding the cane began to tremble youll only get once chance make sure of it its tiny red eyes were fixed unwaveringly on him no hint of fear and he knew then that it wasnt going to make any attempt to fly off a quick swoop and the insect was pinned to the ground his grunt of satisfaction merging into one of revulsion so far so good but now he would have to handle it in order to transfer it to the jam jar the thought almost had him retching and he recalled again the feel of that snake as it had wrapped itself around his wrist the way it had wriggled and bitten and the sliminess of those dead frogs on the river path cold jellied blood tense his mouth dry his pulses racing easing his fingers beneath the net horrible little bastard got you no struggling movements no frantic flapping of those wings only the eyes regarding him balefully with an expression of almost contempt a sigh of relief as it went into the jar and the lid was snapped on suffocate you little bugger youre a locust alive or dead he held it up studied it through the thick glass noted the way it perched unconcernedly upside down there was a triumphant gait to his otherwise shuffling walk as he retraced his steps to the house he glanced at the clock on the kitchen wall am it would be another three or four hours at least before he could begin checking on his specimen a phone call to the ministry of agriculture they would know for sure one locust it could be the forerunner of swarms moving in to decimate a scorchedup britain of its sparse struggling crops and following in the wake of the locusts would come famine george brownlow went back outside returned to the scene of his digging there was no time to waste for surely the weeks were closing in on civilisation now and the amulet clinked again in his pocket as if in agreement chapter six the curse of set rita was dimly aware of movements around her a sensation as though her body floated in the air then alighted vehicular vibrations voices but she couldnt make out what they were saying and still the eternal torment as though wriggling fiery serpents devoured her body from within she remembered dalukah and abaaner more clearly now almost knew what their faces were like although they had remained in shadow when they had visited her the man reminded her of a greek god handsome and strong yet unable to fight against the power of the doubleheaded serpent the woman was beautiful and gentle prepared to die for her child and in the end her sacrifice had availed her nothing because nobody could win against set jumbled flitting recollections difficult to grasp because of the agony the way her body burned inside and out hands touched her in the darkness but she did not have the strength to push them away on fire as though she had bathed in sulphuric acid a wailing noise that would not let up a magnification almost of that hissing snake and in the blackness which enveloped her she saw the glint of its four eyes watching her the curse of set is upon you and your body will burn until you plead for the coolness of death but even after death you will suffer the agonies of a ka consumed by eternal fire from which there is no relief airborne again a sensation that would have been pleasant under different circumstances blinding white light beyond her closed eyelids so that she could no longer see the glare of those four red orbs and this was how it would be for eternity for surely she was dead and this was the living hell with which they tried to frighten you as a child it was real and rita hendon was very much afraid an ashenfaced julian hendon did his best to comfort his distraught wife the loneliness of a hospital waitingroom whitecoated figures coming and going a bustle of activity that might have nothing to do with you or on the other hand it might but they wouldnt tell you you were just a number not supposed to have emotions rose hendon stared at the wall redeyed biting her fingernails something which she hadnt done since she was twelve an instinctive preparation for the worst why does it have to be my baby whos in there why cant it be me at fiftyfive she was looking forward to julians retirement from his firm of accountants but suddenly her whole world was caving in oh god the shock of waking up in the middle of the night hearing those screams coming from the bathroom she would never forget the awful sight which had greeted her and julian as they had rushed in rita naked scalding herself in a boiling hot bath screaming not recognising them even trying to fight them off theyd got her out phoned for an ambulance but there was something else wrong with their daughter which bore no relation to her blistered flesh delirious almost impervious to the scalding because something else was causing her tremendous pain ranting about two people named dalukah and abaaner screaming her terror and babbling about some doubleheaded serpent you dont think she was trying to er you know julian hendon muttered as they had waited impatiently for the ambulance to arrive of course not i dont know how you could say such a thing rose was trying to rub nivea cream over her daughters growing rash of blisters but no way would there be enough cream in the tin to complete the job rita wouldnt commit suicide no matter what oh my poor darling whatever happened to you by the time the ambulance arrived rita was in a deep coma the hendons went in the back with her prayed in silence to a god they had almost forgotten mr and mrs hendon a wellbuilt man wearing a long white coat a surgical mask draped around his neck opened the waitingroom door his expression was impassive a diplomat who delivered news good or bad with habitual equilibrium he was just a number too the hendons came to their feet had to hold on to each other julian wanted to scream for gods sake tell us the worst dont just stand there but he didnt waiting trying to concentrate because they had to hear it right good or bad tm afraid weve transferred your daughter to the intensive care unit shes badly scalded but she is also suffering from some kind of infection that is causing a high temperature and considerable internal pain we hope to discover what it is and treat it as soon as possible in the meantime rest assured we are doing everything possible if you would like to remain at the hospital please do so shes shes going to die isnt she rose hendon whimpered for gods sake tell us shes very seriously ill the surgeon moved back towards the door this was the worst part of the whole job when you didnt know yourself whether a patient was going to make it another thing hed have to get a second opinion on the girl not all of those lumps on her body were blisters they were like open cancerous growths and had nothing whatsoever to do with the flesh being immersed in very hot water this was one time he really had to stall then he was gone a dignified cowardly flight leaving the dutynurse to fix up with the hendons whether or not they wanted to stay afraid to go back into that unit into the incubator with the girl hed seen her record card occupation laboratory assistant centre for research into tropical diseases and that was what worried him most george whatever do you think youre doing out of bed and whats this repulsive thing in that jamjar on the sink unit george brownlow straightened up dropped his pickaxe and glanced at his watch ten past eight damn it only seemed a few minutes since hed started digging and now emily was up and about the whole household stirring he drew his hand across his forehead he was lathered in sweat but he didnt feel shaky any more neither was his arm throbbing ive a good mind to ring doctor home right away and tell him what youre doing george how long have you been up just shut your bloody mouth the expression in his eyes had her backing away suddenly it seemed she wasnt the boss of this household any longer she turned away heard him following her into the house what is that he followed the direction of her pointing finger saw that the huge insect in the jar wasnt perched upside down now it might even have been dead but that didnt matter it is he paused for effect a locust youre mad youll see smug now enjoying this encounter as a matter of fact im just going to ring the ministry of agriculture about it doctor home said you were to rest doctor home is merely a gp george had the telephone directory in his hand began thumbing through it and i am not taking orders from him she stared at him felt herself starting to tremble he had never turned on her like this before she almost said dont forget im the breadwinner here and without me your dole money wouldnt go far but she thought better of it he wasnt well that was the trouble his back was towards her now so that she couldnt see his expression he dialled a lengthy number and she heard a phone starting to ring out at the other end was answered almost immediately id like to speak to somebody in connection with pests emily had never heard george speak so authoritatively before she found it quite disconcerting a pause then a mans voice the line crackling so that she could not hear what he said i have discovered a locust in my garden there may be more of them the other spoke for some time but the line was bad emily ventured a step closer thank you ill give them a ring right away what did they say her voice quavered nothing much just gave me the number of the centre for overseas pest research in london werent they worried no george brownlow was carefully dialling the digits which he had scribbled down on the jotter pad theyre only concerned with pests like rats and moles and rabbits he stuck a finger in his free ear an action designed to shut his wife out christ wasnt anybody going to answer maybe britain didnt have any overseas pests so nobody bothered centre for overseas pest research good morning a mans voice a slight cockney accent good morning momentarily feeling rather foolish i ive found a locust in my garden oh yes sir which area the midlands north of birmingham i see well in fact we have had quite a few reports of locust sightings already this summer and what are you doing about them they have all been investigated sir in normal british summers a sighting as far north as yours would have been quite remarkable but this drought is now becoming quite serious and we do expect a few freak sightings theres nothing to worry about at the moment because in this country theyre quite harmless one or two turn up in the south of england every summer the longest recorded flight by desert locusts was in from the canaries to the british isles a distance of over fifteen hundred miles but only a very small proportion of those that started the flight finished it in no way do they represent a threat sir but perhaps you would like to keep an eye on those you saw if they increase to any great extent then give us another ring and well get somebody out to you thank you ill keep a watch on them george brownlow dropped the receiver back on its cradle he sighed the pest research centre were trying to make light of it but he had detected a slight apprehension in the others tone you watch them for us sir but for gods sake dont start a panic because we dont really know so its not the catastrophe you hoped for emily folded her arms glanced back towards the kitchen where barry and sheila were washing the breakfast dishes god knows when well finally get some sanity in this household we are the chosen ones she retreated a couple of paces as she saw that vacant glaze over her husbands eyes again he was addressing her but staring past her at the blank wall whether the locusts are harmful or not is immaterial they are a sign from the gods just as the frogs were the land will be scorched to a bare wilderness whether by nuclear fire or by the power of ra and multitudes will die famine is nigh a soft thud on the hall floor had him whirling around the letter box clinking the morning paper had arrived skidding on emilys polished wooden tiles the headlines facing him as though they carried a personal message addressed to george brownlow esq libya warns israel time is running out tass says well back you the world watches and waits the writing is truly upon the wall brownlow whispered there is no time to be lost today i must dig throughout the daylight hours and pray that i am in time emily brownlow sighed knew that there was no way she was going to prevent her husband from going out there in the burning sun and working in his increasingly unsightly crater the thought of leaving crossed her mind but she dismissed it this was her home made possible by her money hers was the impression created among the residents of river view and she was determined that it was not all going to be destroyed in a moment of rashness see you later mum barry had his crash helmet in his hand sheila a polythene carrier bag containing the overalls she had washed yesterday evening both items were a snub to emily brownlows river view image i the phone rang shrilly interrupting her rang again a harshness an impatience that seemed to convey urgency and for some reason emily experienced a sense of foreboding did not rush to answer it as she usually did hanging back looking at the others a few seconds of indecision among the brownlow family as if they all sensed something and were afraid who can that be at this hour emily muttered felt the muscles in her stomach beginning to tighten and remembered that there was a huge repulsive insect which might be still alive in a jar by the kitchen sink life was becoming nauseating all round frogs snakes and now of all things a locust well theres only one way were likely to find out barry pushed forward suddenly pale and tightlipped grabbing the receiver it seemed to come alive like that adder which george had picked up twisting its way out of his trembling hands would have crashed to the floor had not the flex checked its fall he grabbed it caught it and when he spoke his voice quavered barry brownlow speaking a pause someone was saying something at the other end but none of the watchers could hear because the line was crackling and buzzing probably the heat george thought to himself it affects everything the television and barry lurched would have fallen had the wall not been there to prop him up his complexion a ghastly pallor mouthing words that would not come everybody was staring at him as though they too had been struck dumb turned into human statues of inexplicable terror the phone swung like a crazy pendulum bouncing and catapulting on its flex chattering insanely to a background of electronic interference screaming its own words over and over again so that in the end they became audible barry barry areyou there canyouhearmet george brownlows hand was stretching out to grab the swinging plastic mouthpiece but he had not the courage he remembered that stick which had transformed itself into a snake the rod of moses might have many shapes emily beat him to it caught the swinging instrument just as it went dead one moment of awful silence in which three pairs of eyes were fixed questioningly on the swaying barry mutely asking what they dared not put into words finally barry spoke an anticlimax because he did not scream or whisper flat expressionless tones that conveyed the full horror of his expression shes dead ritas dead then he slumped forward hit the floor with a sickening thud and sheila brownlow began to scream hysterically ten days of blistering heat that went unnoticed by the brownlows and the hendons a kind of countdown to grim finality that was to have its climax in the stark drab ness of the crematorium days that seemed years the autopsy and its findings a rare tropical disease the first of its kind in britain maybe the research centre would be reprimanded maybe not just a tightening of security but everybody who worked there knew the risks you experimented with bacteria and you accepted the dangers it was a one in a million chance of it ever happening but that chance was always there so rita had died there would be compensation but one thing the scientists could not do was to create life out of death and rita was dead a pathetic group that sweated and wept a chaplain who appeared unmoved by it all and overacted his mourning tones because for him it was the third funeral service today and he was succumbing to boredom in the oppressive heat he didnt even know what the girl had died of that wasnt his business emily brownlow made a pot of tea in the kitchen the lounge was too formal too sombre sheila redeyed stared out of the window at the scorched lawn and its mountain of rubble a blackbird was idly pecking in search of insects but the soil had baked too hard and in the end it gave up and flew off to the shade of the shrubbery george had loosened his tie his ruddy features shiny with perspiration a vacant expression which might have been interpreted as shock and grief so far nobody had spoken they had expected barry to go straight up to his room he would not be coming downstairs again today they had no right to do that george brownlows lips barely moved the words so faint that they were no more audible than the constant buzzing of a bluebottle on the window right to do what emily began to pour the tea it was weak needed to mash another minute or two but she had to do something anything nobody would notice anyway to cremate her shocked silence the two women staring at him in disbelief emilys lips slowly moving into an expression of contempt what a horrible nasty thing to say george its a good job barrys not here to hear you they had no right a deeper flush to brownlows cheeks the beginning of anger but the harm is done now it cannot be undone or if it can i know of no way what dyou mean dad sheila swivelled round to face her father we all know that it was best for for the body to be cremated after that it matters not the body is of no consequence it is the ka which matters now it has been left to wander aimlessly for eternity unable to depart this earth for sekhetaaru youre mad sheila snapped and im not going to have you talking about the dead like that except that rita is not dead george brownlows knuckles showed white where they gripped the edge of the table because they have bungled it do you know what she died of sheila passed a hand across her forehead felt the way her temples pounded as her headache raged she ought to go to bed do we have to go into all this you know as well as we all do she had a rare type of galloping cancer which is one way of putting it brownlow rose to his feet had to hold on to the table for support the authorities have conspired to hide the facts it is no coincidence that rita worked in the laboratory of the research centre for tropical diseases and that a cancerous cell maybe a bacilli somehow got into her system not contagious in itself but deadly to the direct recipient this is all stupid supposition wo it is the curse of set which is upon all of us one by one we shall be struck down unless we obey his commands for gods sake shut up dad sheila leaped to her feet slopped some tea on the table i cant stand anymore of this im going upstairs to bed she ran out of the room slamming the door behind her and they heard the vibrations of her feet pounding up the stairs its most unfair of you george emily said at a time like this too have you no feelings ill go and get changed ive got work to do surely youre not going to dig today show some respect for the dead george but george brownlow did not reply time was running out for all of them it was the living who mattered chapter seven ritas return george brownlow worked steadily until darkness fell not hurrying but pacing himself in the heat a human robot controlled by his own obsessions ritas fate worried him the fools the bloody fools they did not realise set had destroyed her for some purpose and they had played into his hands by cremating her now her khaibit was his destined to do the doubleheaded serpents bidding just as george brownlow was compelled to do in life georges mind went back to that afternoon he had spent among the archives of the towns castle library a week ago the day of ritas autopsy god why hadnt he thought to go there before the rumours about the reverend masons mummies the old curator swore they were true see here mr brownlow almost all of these egyptian relics were brought back by the reverend mason in the early s that obsidian head a fine exhibit and these trinkets of lapis lazuli and that green schist amulet all willed to the castle by one who gave his lifes work for the town and its people now my mother used to clean for the reverend and i can remember her telling me how he had a couple of mummies that he brought back from his last expedition they started to go off a bit and mother complained threatened to leave the old boy the next day they were gone but we couldnt say what hed done with them only jenkins the gardener reckoned there were two fresh graves in the garden and putting two and two together mother reckoned the old chap had given those mummies a proper christian burial and that about sums up the reverend mason but do you know anything about the mummies george brownlow insisted who they were for instance well ive done some research myself barker stroked his pure white moustache smiled proudly always have been interested in egyptology now this obsidian head came from the tomb of two people called dalukah and abaaner according to the reverend masons notes this dalukah wasnt the dalukah queen of egypt but only a distant relative about whom little is known except that she forsook the worship of horus for that of set george started felt his skin prickle anyway barker went on its all a mixture of legend and supposition but the story goes that this dalukah became a high priestess of set and got involved in human sacrifice and all that sort of thing then she went and got herself pregnant by this fellow abaaner one of the queens soldiers and a commoner the cult discovered this after the birth of the baby also named dalukah just to confuse everybody the curator grinned high priestess and soldier were put to the sword and their baby developed some kind of plague and was shut up alive in the tomb with the corpses of her parents the proper rites werent administered so the souls of the unfortunate would remain close to the bodies becoming khaibits sort of shadows of the sahus condemned to a prolonged haunting george brownlow stretched out a hand steadied himself against a cabinet of exhibits as the room started to spin that whirling obsidian head seeming to smile mocking him it knew if nobody else did are you all right mr brownlow yesyes everything slowing down the big wheel shuddering to a halt just a little dizzy doubtless its the heat there had to be a connection somewhere george decided as he threw another shovelful of soil up on to the pile just suppose those were the mummies which mason had buried then they would still have their khaibits with them like rita hours passed late evening eased into dusk dusk to darkness only then did george brownlow haul himself up out of his growing crater shuddering as he recalled that cataleptic nightmare the hole was so deep now that it could just happen scrambling clear with a hint of panic as some small stones avalanched he squatted there sweating and trembling the digging was almost done another weeks labour at the most and then he would have to find out something about the construction of fallout shelters george didnt want to go indoors yet emily would be depressed and start bitching maybe she would have an early night with barry and sheila already in bed he made his way across to the shed flicked on the light and flooded the tiny wooden building with the yellow glare from a dusty sixtywatt bulb a pair of eyes glinted seemed to focus on him but that was impossible because the locust in the jamjar was almost certainly dead by now and he hadnt seen any others they would surely come though in spite of what the man from the centre for overseas pest research said oh god theyd all come locusts frogs snakes famine disease all leading up to the end of civilisation that was why he had to get a move on and finish the shelter one of the reasons anyway the amulet he pulled open a drawer had to force it because the wood was warped he scrabbled among the contents eagerly pulled out a hard flat object wrapped in tissue he could sense vibrations like the panting of a hunted beast about to spring on the hunters now that it had lured them into its lair the sweat was chilling on his body trembling more afraid than he had ever been of it before the light bulb swung slightly flickered and dimmed four tiny eyes shone redly through the thin paper cold hellfire that burned had him muttering his subservience tearing off the tissue because it was angry at being wrapped the serpent writhed hissed and he felt its freezing vapour smelled its evil dry mustiness of an ancient tomb something else the stench of death a numbing of his brain an understanding that could not be put into words dalukah and abaaner had fled their prison tomb their stolen corpses rotted in the damp soil of a foreign land but their khaibits had not been freed from their mortal bodies it was still possible to entomb them their child also who had died of a terrible plague they must be reincarnated slain again as before george brownlow understood nothing except that on the morrow he must dig again with renewed energy for set was becoming impatient and very angry george brownlow found himself back in the house he could not remember leaving the shed and walking across the lawn but he was here so he must have done exhausted his eyelids threatening to close he must sleep the sleep of the dead tonight for tomorrow he must work harder and longer if set was to be appeased for only then would he and his family be saved he began to mount the stairs came to a halt as voices reached him from above found himself straining his ears to listen a low virtually inaudible buzz of conversation like bees swarming in a chimney pot certainly not emilys whine tiptoeing on to the landing that incessant spate of words slightly louder now but he was still unable to make them outcomingfrom barrys room george pressed himself up against the door his son was speaking continually a flow of words that speeded up slowed conveying an alternate mood of urgency and sadness desperation and pleading still he was unable to pick out a single word and when realisation came he straightened up with disbelief barry brownlow was conversing in some foreign language that was totally unrecognisable which was crazy because the boy had not passed o level french had not even studied german greek or latin what is it whats going on george whirled blushing with the instinctive guilt of an eavesdropper emily stood in the doorway of their bedroom a housecoat clutched about her as though she feared her husband might catch a glimpse of some intimate part of her body through her nightdress her features pale and strained edgy shh he raised a finger to his lips its barry she advanced a couple of steps tilted her head to listen spoke in a hushed voice hes having a nightmare and no wonder after what hes been through these past ten days its no nightmare georges expression was one of incredulity listen hes laughing now hes talking gibberish no its a foreign language rubbish he doesnt even know french he cant be but he was a spate of words in a deep nasal accent a pause as though he was listening to a reply a short laugh speaking again well have to wake him it isnt good for him to get all worked up like this emilys fingers closed over the doorknob hesitated as though she instinctively sought her husbands approval was afraid to go into that room alone nohe grasped her wrist leave him in peace in peace hark at him now hes getting all worked up it could do him untold harm her nostrils suddenly flared whats that smell george brownlow smelled the odour for the first time tried to identify it knew that it was only too familiar like the strains of a catchy tune that you knew youd heard somewhere before but couldnt quite place it musty like dry rot so pungent that you found yourself coughing as though you had suddenly stirred up a cloud of dust and then he recognised it knew without any doubt that it was the odour he had smelled in that cataleptic nightmare the stench that had come from that awful entity the same cloying one that had assailed his nostrils the time he had found the amulet the smell of ancient death whatever is it george are you sure youre all right fear in emily brownlows wide eyes suddenly afraid that her husband might be about to suffer that sudden heart attack which dr home had hinted at that time he had treated him for high bloodpressure maybe wed better check him reluctance hoping that emily would go into that room first we dont need to wake him just make sure hes ok go on then take a look she was hesitating again barrys voice was louder almost shouting what are you waiting for emily she closed her eyes momentarily knew that she had no choice grasped the knob and triedto turn it it resisted her the door was locked from the inside its locked george he wanted to shout it cant be you havent turned the knob property but he knew she spoke the truth george whatever are we going to do he couldnt think of an answer didnt want to barry was old enough to lock himself in his room if he wanted to it was no business of theirs thousands of youths barrys age had left home married with families of their own it was an invasion of his privacy to burst in on him in the middle of the night excuses because he was frightened of finding out what lay on the other side of the door what was causing that stench maybe wed better leave him alone he said weakly we cant hes in distress theres no knowing what he he might do we cant break the door down no but we can bang on it wake him up again she hesitated as though willing him to strike the first blow george brownlow clenched his fist felt suddenly inadequate like the time when barry was a small boy and he had locked himself in the toilet because he was in a tantrum it had taken them half an hour to coax him out george checked the impetus of his intended blow rapped meekly on the woodwork with his knuckles his voice no louder than a whisper barry barry are you all right unlock the door paternal habits died hard fifteen years had elapsed since the last time oh god if it had only been possible to go back in time a moments silence then barry was talking again slow sad tones interspersed with sobs and the dry smell of putrefaction grew weaker or perhaps they were becoming used to it and hardly noticed it now barry wake up its us your mum and dad emily screeched began thumping with both fists as though she needed to get her frustration out of her system its all right its only us open the door please barry open the door the talking inside the room went on staccato words now as though barry was asking questions and being answered which was ridiculous because he was alone in there a shadow fell across them had them jumping round what is it sheila stood there still clothed in the dark dress which she had worn at the funeral crumpled and creased because she had not bothered to undress before flinging herself on the bed dried salty grief stains marked her cheeks her eyes were black rimmed george and emily stared at her trembling with relief both tried to say something and failed whats that awful smell she glanced about her i dont know george brownlow looked back towards the door experienced a sense of futility barrys locked himself in his room hes having a dream hes talking to somebody sheila breathed suddenly clutched at her fathers arm oh dad theres somebody in there with him george brownlows flesh went cold every muscle starting to weaken and tremble he made as if to deny her statement but knew that he would only lie there was somebody in there with barry but who three frightened people staring at one another trying not to look at that locked door their brains refusing to accept that barry could not be alone in his room the nature of that low rambling conversation defying logic then silence so sudden and so terrifying they wanted to turn and flee rush out into the mundane sanity of a lighted culdesac gulp the balmy night air into their lungs in an attempt to rid themselves of that cloying smell of evil a slight vibration such as modern floorboards make when walked upon an awareness that somewhere somebody moved the three of them bunched together instinctively seeking protection in numbers bracing themselves for the metallic click of a knobrelease the doorknob beginning to turn the door easing open on welloiled hinges barry sheilas gasp that was a combination of relief and terror relief because it was her brother who stood there in the doorway terror because of the expression which was stamped on his pallid features grief had left its mark a frail body where the flesh had wasted away rapidly in less than a fortnight hands that shook uncontrollably eyes wide and staring out of black sockets lips that were fixed in a smile moving uttering soundless words barry emily backed away pulling the others with her oh my god look at him theres something terribly wrong he stood there but did not appear to be aware of their presence a vacant gaze that met their frightened stares without seeing starting to talk again that strange dialect so chilling in its inexplicable ness barry sheilas piercing scream a javelin of sound that seemed to strike her brother visibly throw him back his eyes rolling clearing seeing rita where are you rita he searched about him his gaze flicking over his mother and father hesitating for a moment on his sister before moving on grief and desperation rita dont leave me please dont leave me emily rushed forward caught him but he did not seem to notice her encircling arms wildly roving eyes darting all around its all right my love it was the first time emily brownlow had demonstrated compassion since ritas death unashamedly beginning to sob shes not here barry you know that shes gone no she hasnt he spoke calmly that smile crinkling the corners of his lips once again i thought shed gone but i was wrong she came back to me tonight as lovely as ever asked me to go somewhere with her but now shes disappeared how can i join her if i dont know where shes gone you must have seen her lets get you back into bed emily signalled to her husband to help her you just lie down and take another of those tablets which the doctor left for you then youll go to sleep and when you wake up youll feel better no sudden anger a physical resistance i wont let you drug me because rita needs me my god you dont realise what theyve done to her his voice rose to an hysterical pitch theyve taken her to be one of their priestesses because theyve lost somebody named dalukah they want her they want me all of us weve got to go to her george brownlow stiffened felt a blackness closing in obscuring his vision dark choking dust clouds that stank of ancient cloying evil so that he gasped for breath felt consciousness slipping from him his legs finally weakened and buckled throwing him to the floor in a faint and for the third time that night sheila brownlow screamed chapter eight pestilence im afraid hell have to stay in hospital for a while dr home meticulously wiped his glasses looked through the lenses wiped them again a nervous breakdown but nothing that a good rest and the right treatment wont put right mrs brownlow does he have to stay in that place doctor emily brownlow licked her dry lips felt that she might be sick i mean we could look after him here in his own surroundings mental hospitals arent like the old lunatic asylums home smiled wanly hopefully reassuringly a lot of people go inside for a rest nowadays you know quite ordinary people there isnt the stigma attached to them that there was twentyfive years ago you leave it to us mrs brownlow a week or two and hell be as right as rain or a month or two in a few days youll be able to go and visit him emily stood in the bow window watched the doctors departure an expression on her lined features which blamed him for barrys stay in that awful place what on earth were they going to tell people to explain his absence from home a lie was easy enough but somehow these matters had a habit of coming to light she had a vague recollection of somebody down at the other end of river view having a relative in shelderton this was something that would have to be thought out very carefully crossing to the opposite end of the long lounge she was afforded a view of the rear garden her expression hardening at the sight of that huge mound of soil and rubble george had stated at breakfast that with a bit of luck he would finish the excavations today what then what other foolishness was he about to embark upon in order to construct a nuclear shelter she seriously contemplated speaking to dr home about her husband george actually believed what barry had said about rita but she could not risk the shame of having her husband in shelderton as well his mind was made up on these ludicrous matters and nothing she could say would deter him in which case she winced at the thought perhaps it would be better to humour him at least shed give it a try everything else had failed she went outside stood on the patio earth and stones showered up as though some giant mole was digging frantically beneath the lawn a scraping sound more debris the neighbours must be aware of it by now must be gossiping emily advanced slowly picked her way through loose earth and stones testing each foothold before she put her weight on it she peered over the brink gasped with amazement so deep surely it was ten feet down to the bottom a pair of stepladders propped up against one side to enable george to clamber in and out she regarded him with contempt he was wearing just a singlet and shorts a pair of old scuffed sandals on his feet scraping the bottom with his spade using a spiritlevel as he strove to level the surface that meant he wasnt digging any deeper he had nearly finished hows it going george she squirmed inwardly at her own patronising tone gave him that same smile which she reserved for the unexpected river view caller emily he almost dropped his spade in amazement you startled me i am not forbidden to gaze upon your handiwork am i i thought id come and take a look my goodness youve put some work into this you can say that again whats the cunning bitch up to now ill have the excavations finished today then i can begin the construction you youve got it all planned out then of course i have in fact most of it is going to be built from junk youll be glad to see the back of that old door thats propped up behind the shed will come in useful and ill need all of that polythene sheeting which came off the new lounge suite theres enough timber on that pile at the bottom of the garden which the builders left behind and most of it is good enough to use in fact i dont think ill have to buy much in the way of materials at all thats nice particularly as you dont have anything apart from your dole money to buy them with and im not contributing to this foolishness im going to make a cup of tea in a minute good he scraped some more loose soil i could do with one if you can manage to bring me one out she sighed nothing was going to lure him out of that hole all right by the way doctor home says barry will have to stay in shelderton a week or two hes mad no he isnt just a breakdown loads of people have them these days i thought you said you believed that story about about rita anyway i dont mean barry doctor home theres nothing wrong with barry apart from grief he saw rita all right ill bring you a cup of tea she turned away didnt want to go into all that again she might with an effort humour george over his shelter but certainly she wasnt going to kid him that she was idiotic enough to believe all that tripe once you were dead you were dead and she paused didnt know why a kind of awe like when you tiptoed into a cathedral and everybody spoke in hushed voices as though god himself was there and they feared they might disturb him an uneasiness had her looking around her a feeling that she wasnt alone the silence that was it no not quite silence rather an absence of artificial noises that gave the impression of being very close to nature an environment that might have existed a million years ago when river view was heathland or forest and the occupants lived in caves grasshoppers a medley that grated on her nerves like an orchestra of miniature violin players who were getting tired and slowing down an old record losing its momentum on the windup gramophone because the spring was getting weak eerie she found herself stepping back a pace searching the scorched lawn in front of her in case she trod on one of the tiny insects and squashed it remembering that dead locust in the jar now that was downright cruel of george leaving it to suffocate like that the sort of thing the rspc a took people to court for and the sort of act that might make hordes of insects come looking for revenge she gave a little laugh at her own stupidity and in that same instant the entire lawn seemed to heave up she stared it must be the heat playing tricks on her no there it went again a steady swell the grating insect chorus rising and falling with it brown stalks that werent dried and burned grass but thousands of tiny bodies that were almost identical replicas of that locust and with that realisation emily brownlow screamed george scrambled up the ladder pulled himself over the brink of the dugout what the hells up look she turned and he saw her anguish an expression which he was becoming used to these days the whole lawn is alive with with grasshoppers he scrambled across to her saw that she spoke the truth there were grasshoppers everywhere hordes of them that squatted and sawed away to produce that melancholy music every one of them seeming to watch the two humans and if you looked long and hard you thought you recognised minute expressions of malevolence ugh emily brownlow reached for her husbands arm theyve cut us off from the house george no he tried to sound flippant theyre harmless you mustve walked through them on your way out not noticed them her stomach churned she wanted to examine the soles of her shoes see if any squashed dead insect bodies adhered to them but she didnt because she didnt dare to look the very thought was revolting frightening i i cant go back through them youll have to carry me george he stared at her dumbfounded he hadnt picked emily up since their wedding day when just to pander to the familys conventional sense of humour he had carried her over the threshold of their twoup twodown somehow it went against the grain just suppose somebody saw them hed be the laughing stock of river view hey guess what i saw today old brownlow carrying his missus into the house tike theyd just got married theres no need for that emily just follow me ill see you safely back into the house george i demand to be carried i cant stand creepycrawlies and you know it i might have a fit or something angry but he tried not to show it he didnt want her to start screaming or else the neighbours might come round a godsent excuse to come and poke their noses into his shelter its all very nice mr brownlow but youre wasting your time because nobodyll ever dare to start a nuclear war haha he stooped down swung emilys weight clear of the ground staggered a couple of paces to get his balance something crunched under his sandals like tiny twigs cracking and he had a vision of locustlike bodies being crushed out of all recognition an urge to vomit in a way it was worse than slimy frogs or wriggling snakes because the hordes just sat there waiting to die like lemmings try not to think about it take your time and dont look down the plague of pestilences is here and theres nothing you can do about it emily stared up at the sky screwing her eyes up because of the suns brightness this was not natural there had to be cloud and rain before long to bring things back to normal but there wasnt so much as a single fluffy white cloud in sight they were within a yard of the patio steps when george felt his right foot start to skid a dry slipperiness that had him lurching even so he might have regained his balance had not his burden suddenly shifted grasped at him in panic and despair yelled george look out falling hitting the ground with stunning force emily clawing at him gouging his skin a kaleidoscope of colours breathless as she landed on top of him instinctively he tore himself free from her pushed her away she screamed as she landed face downwards on the dry grass a sensation of hundreds of insect bodies crushing beneath her the survivors panicking and jumping for safety landing on her crawling all over her frantically she beat at her body tried to sweep the revolting little things from her but they dug in with ther legs resisted her lying there wideeyed watching them not just grasshoppers other insects as well ants that stung with sheer hate harmless ladybirds now awful in their bright red polkadot shells tiny greenflies that seemed bemused by it all different species of insect life suddenly finding a human being at their mercy some stung others just crawled to satisfy their curiosity george slapped at his bare legs squashed a greenfly and a ladybird something flew at him a divebombing commandotype raid zoomed off again a bumblebee sometimes they attacked humans like that for no apparent reason almost as if their radar had gone beserk emily had somehow got back on to her feet she was flaying her arms wildly trying to get something out of her eye george grinned in spite of his own predicament serve her right shed been asking for this for a long time leave her to her fate a flitting temptation but now she had seen him was staggering towards him with outstretched arms he grabbed her pulled her up on to the patio oh my god george emily brownlow wiped at her eye again smeared a black streak down her cheek lets get indoors quick inside the kitchen slamming the door a loud buzzing greeted them black houseflies and a bluebottle swarming on the window pane as though madly trying to get out well have to leave this place she began to sob move somewhere else no it wouldnt serve any purpose there is no escape from the plague of pestilence the whole of britain will be crawling with almost every species of insect life before the week is out just as egypt once did oh for gods sake shut up about egypt i will not for their ancient curse is now ours dalukah and abaaner will be reborn and will die again because they were removed from their native land and almost escaped from set yet none can escape him in the end both you and i sheila and barry we are his chosen ones we have a duty to perform during the last few weeks before civilisation is destroyed do not forget that we shall be saved when millions are dead and dying if we remain loyal to the serpent god and do his bidding emily brownlow forgot all about the insects stared at her husband and was suddenly very frightened there was a strength of purpose about him that transcended fanaticism an obsession that would not be swayed his eyes she felt them boring into her confusing her whatever do you mean george whats all this about set whats he got to do with it dont speak of him flippantly emily lest we feel the power of his wrath they who were entombed by his priests to everlasting damnation were freed and brought to this country to this very place even then they might have escaped him but set had foreseen such a happening and had put his own watchdog to mount guard over their wretched bodies his amulet charged with his own power so that whoever stole the mummies stole it also that damnation would follow dalukah and abaaner whose child had been shut in the tomb with them while it died from a plague now we are faced with events beyond our control the fools burned ritas body and she is now one of his priestesses her restless khaibit already having been seen by barry should any of us die during the coming holocaust we must not allow it to happen again the ritual of embalmment must be carried out something which i must learn before it is too late she had moved back to the window was staring out across the desecrated lawn as though she had not heard him even the buzzing flies were still now the bluebottle lay on its back on the sill perhaps they had killed it there doesnt seem to be that many grasshoppers on the lawn now she spoke expressionlessly as though her thoughts dwelled elsewhere in fact there doesnt seem to be much happening out there at all george he moved alongside her she was right like the frogs the insects had bunched and dispersed it was probably a warning he spoke softly yes her voice still held that vacant tone it was a warning george there can be no doubt about that what are we going to do he tensed wished she would turn around so that he could see her expression but she didnt he felt his pulses quickening that dryness in his mouth again she should be spitting her contempt lashing him with her tongue at the very least disagreeing with him id better get back out there he scraped the chair as he stood up ive wasted enough time as it is i was going to make some tea dyou want it here or shall i bring you out a cup youd better bring it out to me now that those insects have gone i dont have much time none of us has he went outside closing the door behind him the atmosphere smelled heavy almost thundery but he knew it wouldnt rain the drought would not break before the end came and after that it wouldnt matter george brownlow had found an old camping lamp in the shed and had managed to make it work now that the actual digging of the shelter was completed it would be invaluable in assisting him with night work and no longer would he be restricted to the hours of daylight the walls had to be braced with timber and some of those lengths of three by two which those wasteful builders had thrown aside had to be sawn to fit then the polythene membrane had to be put in place like a kind of dampproof course there was an awful lot still to do the skilled worker was about to replace the labourer slower work now requiring a much greater degree of concentration time passed unnoticed didnt matter anyway tiredness blended into fatigue passed its peak and freshness came again a continual cycle through the nocturnal hours a body that for a few short hours needed neither sleep nor food generating its own power controlled by unknown forces and subservient to them george brownlow sensed that he wasnt alone a feeling that had him glancing back beyond the lamp into the furthest recess but he saw nothing if the gods watched him then he must be seen to work he positioned another upright began to hammer in a fourinch nail cursed because it slanted and he had to bend it back yet his concentration was broken his thoughtwavelength scrambled we must soon be together again george words that came out of that patch of darkness soft gentle tones marred by remorse and sadness george brownlow listened sensed a slight drop in the temperature a force not necessarily evil but projecting itself at him a distress call loaded with futility rita they have parted us george just as they parted dalukah and abaaner who were my parents in another life now again they seek to destroy us beware the serpent with two heads for it wilt destroy my barry as surety as it will destroy you all do not speak against set george whispered the serpent has eyes and ears and is everywhere you seek to betray him although you are his priestess i am his unwitting slave and i care not for myself only for my beloved who is also your son spare him i beg of you do what is right george for otherwise he will rejoin me in eternal purgatory and far sooner would i have us parted so that his soul can travel to sekhetaaru perform the rites and protect him from set promise me this beseech you for soon he is to die i dare not i am not ready yet you must do you not care for your own son a wave of dizziness flooded over george brownlow and he recognised it as a mixture of fear and fatigue words of betrayal from his own lips were demanded by ritas khaibit a trick by the doubleheaded serpent to test his loyalty searching the shadows but seeing nothing only sensing her presence hurry for i dare not linger promise me this one thing for your own son s sake i promise he breathed clutching at the wooden framework for support oh god what had he done no answer he did not hear her go but he knew she was gone and that he had given his word he stood up shaking wondered if he had the strength left in his body to climb out of this pit and make his way back to the house frightened not just because he had made a vow against his master but because he knew without any doubt that barry was going to die chapter nine the outcast dusk was falling when adrian capper walked down the sloping road that led into river view a furtiveness about his movements almost as though he feared recognition his features were strained where a fortnights anxiety had left its mark upon him desperation now fear because he had to know the worst whatever he had to speak to sheila he saw the house and it hurt twisting his stomach up in knots brought on a feeling of nausea nostalgia gone sour her mother was to blame for all this had put pressure and more pressure on sheila worn her down in the end you cant let the family down by marrying a boy off a council estate what dyou think all the people on river view will say and its making your father ill given him high bloodpressure and now its preyed on his mind so much that hes been digging a nuclear shelter its all your fault sheila if anything happens to him itll be on your conscience for the rest of your life anger now as adrian pressed himself back into the shadow cast by a willow tree last week and the week before he had made several trips to the supermarket to try and speak with sheila but she hadnt been there one of the assistants had told him that she was away ill but she didnt know any details ritas death was sure to have upset her but not to that extent now somehow he was going to see her he wasnt leaving river view until he had and if the worst came to the worst emily brownlow was going to have a piece of his mind they were ruining his life as well he tried to formulate a plan of action it wasnt easy the obvious approach was to ring the front doorbell only there were no lights showing at the front of the house and in all probability mrs brownlow herself would answer the ring in which case he would be sent packing so he had to think of something much more cunning it was almost like breaking and entering he tried not to be angry with sheila she had promised to ring on that thursday but she hadnt he could not understand it because she had never let him down before a call however hurtful and abrupt i dont want to see you anymore adrian this is goodbye would have been preferable to not knowing he walked forward looked furtively about him the side gate was unlatched halfopen perhaps if he went round the back knocked on the rear door a kind of psychological advantage he would take them by surprise a sense of guilt it was like committing a felony sneaking in like this but he had to know once and for all if sheila told him to clear off then at least he could retire to lick his wounds let time be the healer there was a light on in the kitchen the curtains partly drawn he edged his way up to the patio had to force himself to peer inside the room was empty the remains of a meal still on the table now that wasnt like emily brownlow she insisted on every plate being washed and dried before you left the room it was all very odd so uncharacteristic eerie adrian stood there undecided surely they hadnt all gone up to bed and left the lights on a movement attracted his attention had him glancing behind him something jumped squatted jumped again a tiny body glistening in the ray of light which shafted out through the window a frog there was another one on the edge of that patch of shadow both of them were watching him and he could almost feel the intensity of their hatred the little bastards knew that he was frightened of them maybe they were survivors from that amphibian invasion three weeks ago and they remembered you killed some of us and now were going to kill you his breath quickened and he looked away insects were pounding the lighted window pane venomously a concerted attack as though they were determined to break the glass and force their way in hardshelled flying beetles that might be capable of inflicting a nasty sting he swallowed almost turned and ran the atmosphere was so oppressive a hint of thunder but the rain wouldnt come it would never rain again ever nature was rebelling strange forces plotting to overthrow civilisation destroy an artificial way of life man had brought about his own undoing gone too far challenged forces beyond his control a sound the sort of noise adrian might have made himself the scuffing of a plimsoll on hard ground or clothing brushing against some obstacle he stared into the darkness could just make out a shape on the lawn a whiteness that moved and was still again watching him his skin prickled and he stepped back trod on something that burst into a slimy morass a flying beetle whipped against his cheek zoomed on its way like a harrier jet in search of another target moths and midges vying for any area of exposed flesh he ignored them found himself walking towards that figure on the lawn as though obeying some irresistible force a mute pied piper calling him a silhouette standing by that huge mound of rubble a shapely female form ghostly in appearance because it wore some kind of semitransparent garment as though a mist was rising in an attempt to shield its nakedness becoming familiar with each step he took until finally he recognised the other sheila brownlow sheila words that trembled were an apology for trespassing in these grounds the confrontation for which he had longed these past weeks he suddenly found frightening adrian you shouldnt be here what have you come for the same soft tones yet they lacked the kindness which he had come to know her eyes searching him out she clasped her flimsy nightdress to her in a gesture of embarrassment you never phoned me his voice was husky loaded with tension he didnt want it to sound like a reprimand no i didnt i didnt think it really mattered ive been to the supermarket to try and see you but all theyd say was that you were ill the last time i saw you was at the funeral we are wasting our time a halfsob which she tried to hide you know nothing will ever come of our relationship adrian it was doomed from the beginning but of course it will ill do anything for you please dont its better if we end it right now i thought we had already done so but apparently i was wrong but why sheila for gods sake tell me why ive already told you were wasting each others time your mothers behind this shes finally got you where shes been trying to get you ever since we first dated adrian could not keep the contempt out of his tone his lower lip curling into a sneer its nothing at all to do with mother gods truth it isnt he stared at her in hurt amazement knew that she spoke the truth and in the faint light from the kitchen window he saw the way her eyes were misted up how pale and distraught she looked as she wrung her hands together in obvious anguish nothing at all to do with your mother echoing her tones of sadness and finality a wave of nausea sweeping over him then why why because its best that way for your sake as much as mine things have changed here adrian because of ritas death noooo she glanced away back towards that digging almost as if she expected to see somebody there in the shadows eavesdropping on them an expression of ear its just that that things are going to be different from now on youve got somebody else voicing his worst fear that some boy off river view more eligible than himself had stepped into the breach the brownlows would really like that no theres nobody else i promise then what you told me wasnt true you dont love me silence her gaze dropped for the first time stared down at the parched grass didnt even appear to notice a frog which had moved in close to her feet suddenly the night air was filled with their croaking as though they had come up out of the river and waited for this very moment those same two humans who had escaped before were here again sheila was trying to hold back her sobs cant we just leave it at that adrian no because i think youre covering something up if you dont want me anymore thats fair enough but at the very least i think im entitled to an explanation im beginning to think youre ill and thats whats worrying me ive been sick a lot lately mostly in the mornings he tensed stared in disbelief and said weakly shakily its probably the heat and all the upset over no its not im pregnant adrian adrian capper swayed on his feet barely noticed another flying beetle ping against his cheek a mixture of shock and euphoria what sheila said was virtually impossible theyd been so careful but if she was pregnant then she couldnt just throw him out like that hed have to face the brownlows but hed survive in a way it couldnt have happened at a better time all the same she had to be making a mistake maybe she was distraught seeking refuge in fantasy youre not sure though i havent had it officially confirmed if thats what you mean but take it from me i know its all a question of knowing what to do about it you know ill marry you she shook her head again smiled wanly and his hopes faded cruelly again no i meant what i said dont make my life anymore complicated adrian please just leave me atone its also a big worry about barry why hes in a mental hospital mothers doing her best to keep it all hushhush but itll get out eventually the irony of it all is theres nothing the matter with him he saw and spoke to rita or rather her khaibit dad knows more about that than any of us because this last fortnight hes been studying egyptology as though hes going to take a degree in it but already hes learned such a lot about it and hes teaching mother and i adrians first inclination was to laugh instead a tiny shiver ran up his spine and spread out on to his scalp george brownlow wasnt the type to do things just for the hell of it he always had a reason for everything he did but this time his reasoning was illogical barry in a mental hospital george soon to follow and it was quite clear that there was something terribly wrong with sheila she needed help but in order to do that he would have to humour her have you seen rita sheila he asked no but im hoping i will soon because we got on so well together and i miss her terribly tears began to trickle down her cheeks ive got to help dad finish the shelter because there isnt much time left if only barry was here to give him a hand it would probably have been finished by now theres not a lot left to do though maybe i could help adrian was watching carefully for a reaction his hopes plummeting when she shook her head slowly no dad wouldnt like that because he says this shelters a kind of personal thing and he doesnt want anybody except a brownlow touching it id like to see it just a quick look please sheila a right she smiled faintly peered past him towards the house but only a quick one mind dad would go beserk if he knew id let anybody see it hes gone up for a bath but hell be back shortly to give it a quick inspection before he goes to bed an obsession that had got out of all proportion adrian decided however he was curious to see how george brownlows idea had worked out just a bloody big hole in the ground lined with a polythene membrane and sandbagged no doubt if emily was in on it she would have a carpet on the floor a mirror and a doormat so that visitors didnt carry mud down there on their shoes thats it now dont be long adrian please adrian capper stared at the dark mound of soil and nibble no longer was it just an untidy heap it had been levelled shapedthe top a kind of miniature pyramid whatevers your dad shaped it like that for his mouth was dry his voice a whisper he refers to it as the pyramid of dalukah and abaaner if only she had laughed made a joke of it his spine wouldnt have tingled like it did like i said everything in this household has to have an egyptian flavour these days i think its rather a sweet idea dont you the ancient egyptians were such a cultured race the atmosphere didnt feel balmy any longer adrian sensed that same tension an electrification only it was too cold for thunder a sort of icy heaviness and when the faint breeze rustled across the garden it was like dead fingers touching you he didnt want to see what lay beyond that old door fitted into the mound maybe sheila was right and he should just walk away and forget everything while he still could hurry up adrian dad might come back any minute she wanted him to go in there now moved behind him as though deliberately barring his escape route go on what are you waiting for his fingers stretched out clicked the latch the metal was icy cold the door swung open as though wafted by some breeze from down below but that was impossible he stared into the interior could just discern a flight of steps going down a wooden rail to hold on to it wasnt totally dark a kind of gloom like a vestige of dusk before it blended into full darkness perhaps the reflection of polythenelined walls was causing that theres a lightswitch just by your hand sheila touched him a gesture that was almost a shove had him instinctively clutching at the rail oh god i dont want to go down there but he knew he would instant artificial light came up the steps to greet him a lowwatt coloured bulb of some kind why the hell didnt george brownlow fit a decent light this was merely an extension of the previous gloom and the smell damp musty earth that cloyed nostrils and lungs like foul catarrh he heaved thought for a moment that he was going to throw up dont bloody well want to go down there but he did staccato movements ducking his head to avoid catching it on the roof sheila holding on to his arm and whispering its nice isnt it airless like an exhumed grave trying not to draw breath but being forced to tasting that odour he reached the bottom of the steps and stared in amazement oh god all this was sheer madness the product of a crazed mind the shelter was roughly the size of the livingroom in the cappers council house except that the roof was lower a stout timber framework supporting the earth walls and the weight of the soil above a polythene lining thick but transparent probably gauge thickness lighted by a single orange bulb unfurnished except for whats that adrians whisper echoed as though a thousand invisible demons had taken it up mocking him whats that that that tha t a kind of box structure stood against the far wall draped with some kind of frayed material that might once have been a tablecloth it reminded adrian of the plain altar in the methodist church where his mother used to take him each week to sunday school when he was a boy frightening in its simplicity because you knew it was something to do with god but you didnt understand and you were afraid to ask something was propped up on this structure a kind of polished metal disc that shone and glinted in the dim light an emblem which incorporated a pair of snakes no it was one but it had two heads both with shining red eyes that glittered and gave you the impression that they were capable of seeing and were actually watching you its an amulet sheilas voice sounded dreamy far away something that dad found when he was digging this place out he says it has to be kept down here because of dalukah and abaaner she paused he heard her intake of breath i like it funny how these trinkets can get so that you cant stop looking at them i could stay down here all day and just gaze at it it gives you a sort of warm feeling inside adrian shivered the amulet was having exactly the opposite effect on himself those orbs were burning with a fire of sheer hatred boring into him you have no right in here boy begone its set isnt it the words just seemed to flow from his mouth another echoing whisper hissing all around him set set set set however did you know that surprise and admiration in sheilas voice then her eyes narrowed suspiciously i dont know i just know it is he spoke expressionlessly couldnt take his eyes off those malignant serpent faces the fangs appeared to move it was becoming angry id better be going yes dad will be back soon he hasnt finished in here of course he says he still has quite a lot of work to do putting the finishing touches to it adrian found himself backing away caught his foot against the bottom step and almost fell turning he scrambled up the roughhewn steps in a desperate flight an awful fear that the door might have swung shut and imprisoned them both in that dreadful place but it hadnt he pushed his way out gulped the night air down into his lungs it had turned much warmer again a temptation to spit to try and get that taste out of his mouth are you all right sheila was watching him anxiously im ok he was sweating profusely i guess i just found it a bit claustrophobic down there i got that way the first time i went down but you get used to it get to like it in fact its cosy you can think of it as a snug little house which protects you from the rest of the world he grimaced there was definitely something wrong with sheila the brownlows indoctrination had got through to her at last he couldnt just walk out on her like that look he spread his hands in dismay if ive got you pregnant then im determined to do something about it go and see the doctor make sure and if your test is positive then well talk again you just forget about it she was aloof again folding her arms as though she feared lest he might be afforded a view of her breasts through her thin garment now go because if dad finds you here well both be in trouble an awful moment of heartbreak and indecision for adrian capper a nightly farewell that was suddenly final devastating in its weirdness an instinctive leaning towards her in search of a kiss that would burn as coldly as the eyes of set in that underground chamber only to be repelled by an upraised hand rebuffed mutely pleading go quickly she snapped and dodging his grasping arms she ran for the patio he stood there watching her saw the frogs crowding on the lawn sheila did not appear to notice them twice she trod on an unfortunate animal with her bare feet but her pace did not slacken then she was gone in through the door slamming it shut behind her adrian capper slunk off into the darkness a bowed figure that found its way back out into the lighted culdesac of river view and sought refuge for the second time that night in the shadow cast by the huge willow tree he was badly shaken could easily have been sick a feeling of acute despair jesus christ the horror of that shelter and the vile amulet it housed would remain with him forever hed never get the stench out of his lungs the taste off his palate with an effort he pulled himself together began the long walk back home the brownlows had become a house of madness and he feared for sheilas safety she had told him to go at a time when she needed him most possibly he was the only person in the whole world who could help her and now he was an outcast from river view by the time he reached the ring road he was crying unashamedly and he was also very frightened sheila brownlow hadnt expected to find her parents sitting in the kitchen when she came in from the garden the sight of them jolted her nerves had her blushing with a flood of guilt this was how it used to be at the old house when she was fourteen a date with a boy and when she got back they were waiting for her a thorough interrogation that overlooked no detail we sat on a bench and talked nothing else you didnt hold hands did you youre sure youre telling the truth because if you arent somebody will surely have seen you and well find out now some strange timemachine was trying to rob her of her womanhood a force that wilted her determination was making her subservient to her parents again and she couldnt do a thing about it what were you doing out there sheila george brownlows eyebrows knitted reminded her of some kind of hooded bird of prey i have been to the pyramid of dalukah and abaaner i just wanted to look at it again i see george appeared to accept her explanation but you werent alone we heard voices you were talking to somebody yes it was pointless trying to he and anyway she hadnt invited adrian here furthermore she had sent him away it was adrian i told him to leave and never to come here again silence sheila felt herself cringing wanting to pour out promises pleas total subservience and deep down somewhere she despised herself for it her mothers features were tired and strained looking to her husband as though she constantly needed his approval for her own presence in the kitchen sheila swallowed tasted something rancid weve heard you being sick in the mornings george brownlows eyes reminded her of those on the amulet in the shelter you read the question before he asked it but you would not lie to him are you pregnant sheer psychological terror a blurring of her vision a wave of blackness spotted with red that had her holding on to a chair then sinking down on to it because otherwise she would have fainted nodding crying by that boy a sudden lessening of his severity more anxiety than anger even gloating curiosity i i dont know what dyou mean you dont know have you gone with him nodding again like a string puppet whose ventriloquist master had suddenly been struck dumb then it must be unless youve been with anybody else no almost a shout i havent but i dont know for sure if im pregnant or not george brownlows eyes seemed to glaze over as though cataracts had suddenly formed his tone a recitation of words learned but the expression omitted you are pregnant my child for what is written cannot be changed dalukah of royal blood gave birth to a bastard child by a commoner named abaaner they were punished yet temporarily escaped the curse of set when their bodies were taken from their tomb to another land but set is allpowerful and it is decreed that dalukah and abaaner must live again so that they shall not escape their punishment another life another death even though the whole world is in its final hour words that were suddenly no longer meaningless to sheila brownlow the blackness came back at her with the hissing and roaring of a desert sandstorm whipping her into unconsciousness she slumped forward fell from the chair chapter ten the tomb sheila and emily brownlow had remained in the kitchen for most of the afternoon just waiting they had not spoken since george had gone outside no sound except the steady hollow ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece it was as though they were prisoners until his return once the telephone in the hall rang but neither of them made a move to answer it and eventually it stopped they did not glance at each other their thoughts elsewhere indeed they might have been oblivious of each others presence that call could have been from the hospital about barry your son is very much better mrs brownlow we think a spell at home would be good for him im afraid we have some bad news for you mrs brownlow your son threw a fit in the night suffered a major stroke as a result hes in a coma could you come as quickly as you can please mutual concern but they would not answer the phone if it rang again a sort of telepathy that saved them the trouble of conversation rita barry had seen her all right they did not doubt his word perhaps very soon they would see her too at least they hoped so it was funny how things had changed brought about a closeknit relationship in a family which hitherto had gone their separate ways emily was glad to relinquish her position as head of the family she hadnt wanted it in the first place only george had needed somebody to motivate him drive him it had worked and now he was at the helm making all the decisions they would not question him furthermore they would obey him sheila could not get adrian out of her mind sadness and guilt gnawing at her like the beginning of some cancerous growth he was so kind and thoughtful but he really did not fit into the scene now he always queried everything had to have facts to substantiate facts no way would he accept things as they were everybodys gone mad she and i want to get you away from them a bedsit will be fine until i can get a job and afford a decent place for us oh the fool albeit a lovely fool he didnt understand and he never would so the only solution was to get rid of him hed find somebody else as mother would say one of his own kind emily permitted herself a faint almost unnoticeable smile sheila had seen sense at last thank god she hadnt done anything stupid like running off with that boy her features hardened paled but there was no getting away from the fact that her daughter was pregnant even if it had not been officially confirmed yet george was quite apathetic about it though almost as if it was bound to happen that he wanted it to had willed it destiny he called it one cannot control ones fate that was all very well but who was going to look after the baby when it was born emily brownlow winced at the thought she couldnt go through all that again a continually crying infant nappies hung on the clotheshorse in the kitchen because it was too wet to put them out on the whirligig and most important the shame of it all there were lots of things you could cover up in life but there was no hiding an illegitimate child a bastard she squirmed turned sideways to look at sheila who was staring vacantly at those flies buzzing on the window in spite of all my warnings you made yourself cheap after all blushing with embarrassment because there was only one way a girl got herself with child disgusting so primitive mating like a wild animal shed never have thought a daughter of hers would ever do anything like that your father and i never did anything before we were married i certainly wouldnt have let him even if he wanted to but he had more respect for me than to try anything a sudden fleeting memory of something that had almost happened that sunday afternoon when they had gone for a stroll down the fields a moment of impetuous passion on georges part nothing serious by todays socalled enlightened standards they had been sitting on a grassy bank outside a small fir wood so peaceful so remote so romantic just the place for a kiss and a cuddle and then george had spoiled it all by attempting to slide his hand up her dress even thinking about it now had her going cold and rigid shed frozen with shock and he had almost got his fingers on their intended goal before she had slapped him dragged herself away from him that had nearly been the end of their engagement and at first she had refused to accept his profuse apologies eventually she had relented and it had all been smoothed over but not forgotten it never would be even on their wedding night emily had demanded respect of course she expected george to want to do that the moment they put the bedroom light out but she was not standing for a lot of playing about it wasnt decent she had hoped she had brought her children up like that but evidently she had failed somewhere along the line with sheila where emily had said no to george sheila had quite obviously said yes to that council estate boy it was heartbreaking but when she had spoken to her husband about it he had acted very strangely and replied in a flat expressionless voice one cannot alter destiny what daliikah did once she is bound to do again it couldnt have happened that first night the frogs came up out of the river in their thousands or if it had then sheila had already conceived emily was trying to work out dates in her confused mind it was all too complicated for her and in the end she gave up she hoped that sheilas pregnancy was just the result of one moment of madness that she and that boy hadnt done it before or since anybody could make one mistake and now the girl must pay for her folly the brownlows wouldnt involve adrian because that was inviting a scandal her thoughts switched to rita brought a burning moistness to her eyes now rita wouldnt have let barry do anything like that she would act exactly as emily had acted that sunday long ago if barry succumbed to temptation a girl to be proud of and yet she had to be snatched away from them all in the midst of life it wasnt fair there were dozens of hussies plying their trade unashamedly in town most nights so why couldnt the lord have taken one of them she shuddered as she recalled george brownlows answer to that question it wasnt the lord who took her emily his eyes resembled those on that snakething in the shelter it was set because he had need of her in the same way that he has need of all of us set she closed her eyes saw four burning pinpoints of fire in the darkness heard the hissing of that wriggling repulsive twoheaded snake somehow that amulet had been the beginning of georges dominance over the family had given him some kind of power she felt it so did sheila maybe it was responsible for what had happened to barry she began to panic in her own mind surely the thing was easy enough to get rid of she could sneak down to the shelter when george wasnt around take it and throw it into the river at the bottom of the garden nobody would ever find it then it would remain in the mud and sewage forever a hissing unaccountable noises in her head which had her clutching her hands to her ears writhing in her chair oh god she wouldnt do that because she dared not touch it had not that same snake bitten her husband sweating she smelled that awful musty underground stench again changing to her own body odour as she opened her eyes staring fearfully around the room sheila was still engrossed with those flies on the window pane maybe if the window was open they would all fly away or else more would come inside to join them but neither herself nor sheila was going to get up and open the window still waiting waiting for george brownlow because he held the key to everything he was the master today his work would be completed the final touches put to the shelter then they would be shown it the clock on the mantelpiece showed five minutes to five the temperature seemed to have risen considerably and the chest freezer was labouring to keep pace with it the floor vibrating as the motors changed up a gear the flies were noisier a lot more seemed to have joined them and emily found herself wondering how they had got in because all the doors and windows were shut lately they had to be kept like that night and day a few nights ago the interior walls had been crawling with all kinds of repulsive nocturnal insects the worst had been those hardshelled flying black beetles which seemed to be imbued with a desire to attack anybody or anything that moved homing in like miniature spitfires emily cringed closed her eyes just thinking about them anticipating a stinging facial impact bracing herself for the sudden sharp pain footsteps the kitchen door opened and closed sheila started halfscreamed as she was jerked out of her reverie george brownlow stood there dressed in a soiled singlet and shorts his features sweatgrimed a film of dust covering his glasses and giving the impression that the sockets were black and empty he smiled a hideous stretching of dry lips it is ready words that carried the impact of a physical blow seemed to throw the two women back in their chairs emily didnt want to go down there into that awful claustrophobic shelter of georges where a doubleheaded serpent writhed in the dim light and watched their every move with a malevolent stare where it was deathly cold on the hottest day and the stench of sheer evil almost suffocated you a week ago it had been a bare underground room since then george had done something to it and she was afraid to go and look no a weak protest emilys lower lip trembling you must you shall georges head was thrust forward the veins on his neck standing out it is for all of us emily rose shakily to her feet saw that sheila had also stood up was hanging back come on he was impatient now eager this is a great day in our lives particularly in mine you said everybody said that george brownlow was not capable of constructing this shelter but i have proved you all wrong come now and see for yourselves they followed him outside the concrete unpleasantly hot beneath their feet even the lushest and most resilient foliage in the adjacent shrubberies was beginning to wilt a solitary blackbird regarded them from a branch chirped at them because the birdbath was dry and the birdtable was bare it had been accustomed over the past months to being provided for but suddenly it seemed that the humans didnt care anymore in its own way it feared starvation that mound of earth and rubble had certainly been tidied up emily reflected levelled so that it resembled a a huge grave no it was her morbid imagination playing tricks more like a bunker on a golf course an ordinary everyday heap of soil a barren parched landscape all around them surely the lawn would never recover the shrubs would wither and die only yesterday the public had been urged to do everything possible to conserve water reservoirs were dangerously low rivers were well below their normal level the country could just run dry if it went on like this george reached the door pulled it wide the other two wrinkled their noses anticipating that awful smell rising to greet them he ducked his head began to descend the steps knowing that they would follow emily first because it was her duty as a wife to accompany her husband then sheila because some compelling force other than curiosity was luring her down below that same dim light only this time it showed up every detail possibly because now there were details to discern whereas before apart from the amulet on the altar the place had been bare cries of amazement came from the two women gasps of terror because the stark reality of george browntows project was now presented in its entirety dexion shelving covered both long walls fixtures from the garage which unknown to the others george had dismantled and reerected down here packed shelves tinned and dried foodstuffs on one side personal possessions on the other resembling a small overstocked supermarket thats thats my jewellery box emily pointed to a square black object opposite i it should be in the bedroom no georges tone was firm his hand restraining her from reaching out for it its rightful place is here like everything else books clothing food to sustain us on our long journey journey sheila stared aghast but dad were only twenty yards from the house even if the worst comes to the worst we dont have to stay down here for more than a fortnight that is where you are mistaken my child he stood facing them at the far end of this strange room one hand caressing the amulet those eyes appearing to glow with pleasure in the manner of a contented feline beast it was a trick of the light which had the serpent seeming to move for this place the result of weeks of toil is the focal point of our destiny when the end comes the brownlows must all be together but isnt the idea of building a shelter to survive a holocaust emily asked to survive the follies of man he laughed a frightening sound that echoed had the others stepping back in alarm is one of the aims but life is so temporary at least in the form we know it whether we survive or not is a matter for conjecture but even if we do the world as we know it now will be gone forever what is there to remain here for except to rule supreme over burnedup continents smouldering wastelands no there are far better places awaiting us look upon this humble edifice as a ship that will convey us across the waters to a land where ra will smile gently and kindly upon us a place that is called sekhetaaru the land of the dead sheila clutched at her mother fought back her scream wanted to yell were not going to die george brownlow smiled a facial movement intended to convey an expression that was halfapologetic halfreassuring please dont be frightened softer tones now almost a whisper what is death but an extension of life the chance to live again perhaps we shall survive perhaps the great powers will back down before the ultimate confrontation only the great set knows that and he will not impart such knowledge to his humble servants we shall only know when the time arrives he stepped forward an orator aware that the climax to his speech was near drawing himself up to his full height if perchance we are fated to perish then we must be certain that we go to sekhetaaru and that our khaibits do not wander in eternal darkness such as happened to poor rita maybe we can even save her we are in the hands of the great god set were going to die then emily breathed but you forget one thing george as a family we are not united for barry has been taken from our midst he will be returned to us brownlow smiled set promised me that in a vision last night and i know that our son will come back to us but in the meantime we must make our preparations for the journey if we are called upon to make it will be a long one and we must carry food to sustain us and our most treasured possessions to grace our new home when we arrive sheila experienced a feeling of faintness the underground room darkening tinged with red reflected from those glowing orbs the stench was overpowering the atmosphere thick with the smell of ancient decay dust that had her coughing and in those last few seconds of consciousness came the terrible realisation george brownlow had not worked for weeks in the unrelenting heat simply to construct a shelter to protect them in the event of a nuclear war he had built a tomb in which to incarcerate them a prison that was also his own temple to the serpent of evil book two the dead chapter eleven scorpions aubrey houghton had worked at the council offices ever since he had left school twenty years ago for him success was a challenge the smallest promotion a cause for euphoria a slow process hiding his frustrations yet they had left their mark upon him thinning hair narrow features that were pallid from an indoor occupation and tines that had been etched by his hopes and disappointments nervous to the point of being neurotic disliked by his colleagues and superiors alike he had finally progressed to the planning office at everybody elses expense he implied to his associates outside his place of appointment that he was assistant planning officer not wholly a lie because certainly he assisted mr millichip took the brunt of the chiefs roastings found himself landed with innumerable menial chores in addition to his routine paperwork and if the boss didnt have faith in him he wouldnt have been continually lumbering him with these irksome tasks aubrey decided smugly staff came and went were promoted to other councils elsewhere so his own best policy was to sit tight become the planning officers devoted and trustworthy henchman and in time the job could just be his houghton stroked his dark moustache with obvious satisfaction and determined to pursue this route to promotion examinations were not his strongest point never had been but so long as he showed willing by attending evening classes and reminded mr millichip frequently that he was doing just that perseverance and hard work would do the rest it was easier for a bachelor because he didnt have the ties and distractions of family life aubrey houghton was toying with the idea of taking up golf wondered if he could afford it often business success was achieved on the course and mr millichip took every wednesday afternoon off for that purpose in spite of what some of the others in the planning office hinted at now if somehow aubrey could worm his way into that same club ive got a job here for you aubrey the bulky shape of the planning officer loomed over aubreys desk had him tensing swallowing instinctively the use of his first name by the boss was usually an ominous sign oh yes sir a sickly smile as he looked up into those craggy features pale blue eyes that made you glance away anywhere so long as you didnt have to meet them overweight but it suited the boss gave him a sort of strongman image like some tough new york cop who was capable of pulling out the punches when it mattered most nobody argued with chip a living legend in his own area theres some bloody nonsense going on up at river view and wed better look into it the planning officer waved two pages of handwritten paper but obviously had no intention of passing them over to his clerk for perusal a complaint from one of the residents the brownlows at number twelve are sneakily building something in their rear garden what the hell it is ive no idea but wed better find out according to this anonymous complaint theyve been digging out some kind of footing for weeks youd better get up there and take a look dont stand for any nonsense and if youre refused admittance well get a warrant theyre funny people by all accounts leave it to me sir aubrey stood up buttoned his jacket ill soon sort it out youd better go up and see whats going on and let me have a detailed report in the morning aubrey houghton experienced a desire to run from the room a schoolboy with an unprecedented opportunity to appease his headmaster fetch me some tobacco from the corner shop boy and don t be long about it and i wont cane you for your next minor misdemeanour wont be in this afternoon wednesday of course so leave your findings on my desk and ill deal with it first thing in the morning bureaucracy was a fillip to houghton a delegation of authority which he would use to its fullest capacity something which they did not teach you in the classroom at night school the public were mindless morons and they had to be reminded of the system from time to time somebody stepped out of line so you made an example of them today aubrey houghton was the planning officer deputised to investigate the brownlows and he would make an impression on river view they would remember him for a long time to come yes sir he would let them know that he was around he made a deliberate effort to check his excitement as he crossed the expanse of tarmac which served as a car park behind the towering block of antiquated council offices he saw himself as tall and rugged a figure that instilled instant unease into any who saw him coming millichips mercedes shimmered in the fierce sunlight a symbol of prestige and success aubrey allowed himself a brief fantasy a direct course towards it before changing direction and heading for the battered mini which was parked twenty yards beyond it that was the moment you came down to earth remembered your own lowly role a small cog in the mighty council wheel that was the difference a mercedes or a mini the gulf that stretched between houghton and his boss the interior of the mini was stifling the seat burned his body and he was compelled to wind both windows down the starter motor whined fired and rattled the bodywork a puff of black exhaust fumes a grating of gears and aubrey houghton was easing his way out of the car park and into the flow of traffic he did not drive right down into river view when he had progressed to a mercedes he would make regular calls in that exclusive part of town but in the meantime he would leave some conjecture concerning his mode of transport council officials sometimes travelled by public transport for a variety of reasons there were moves afoot to pedestrianise the town centre and an example had to be set by somebody leave your car at home and travel by bus a deliberate destruction of status aubrey parked in a side road adjoining river view hurriedly locked his car and tried to disassociate himself from it a selfinflicted personality change in which there was no place for a mini an expression and posture of officialdom head high looking neither to the right nor the left an umbrella because you were undressed without one even in an unprecedented heat wave an air of contempt that increased as he turned down into river view an inborn hatred for capitalists but their day would come just as the brownlows already had he slowed his pace studied river view carefully number twelve wasnt any different from the others except that it occupied an end position and its garden ran down to the river at least he thought it did he would soon find out a few moments of final preparation straightening his tie which was nearly strangling him in the heat sweat pouring down his face eyes smarting blurred vision as though he was dizzy he swallowed mopped at his features with a handkerchief damn this heat it didnt inspire confidence a determined mental effort and he was the planning officer again the chief not his assistant arrogance replacing that momentary indecisiveness stepping forward on a direct course for number twelve the place looked deserted now that would be a real letdown im sorry mr millichip sir but there was nobody at home oh all right houghton ill pop up there myself this afternoon maybe its best that i go in person anyway no bloody fear an impressivelooking oakpanelled frontdoor with a polished brass knob and letterbox aubrey searched for the bell finally found it set in the brick surrounds it felt spongy as though the pull wasnt attached to anything probably the wire had snapped listening silence except for the buzzing of insects flies swarms of them appearing suddenly as though they had been forewarned of his coming and had lain in ambush in the bushes he swatted at them but it had no effect so undignified standing there in the middle of a cloud of flies as though something about him was attracting them christ almighty where was everybody if that blasted bell wasnt working then they wouldnt know he was here a sudden spasm of anger had him bunching his fist thumping on the door it was solid just made a dull sort of noise that wasnt likely to attract anybodys attention he stepped back a few paces took a good long look at the house again he experienced that envy of capitalism this place was sure to be worth seventy grand all the curtains were drawn that could have been because of the heat or it might be because they had something to hide he took a deep breath swatted at the flies again he couldnt just stand here all afternoon it was too bloody hot anyway maybe he should go back to the office and try again this evening i didnt hang about mr millichip because theres always work piling up in the office so i went back after tea no i dont want to book overtime or mileage its all part of the job isnt it money doesnt enter into it aubrey houghton was on the point of turning away and retracing his steps when another thought struck him the brownlows could just be in the rear garden snoozing the afternoon away in the shade of the willows down by the river it was the sort of thing fat idle capitalists were likely to indulge in on hot summer afternoons a quick glance down the side showed him a high wicker gate between the garage and the house it was worth taking a quick look trepidation now he had no right to do this he was trespassing on the other hand he was the planning officer and if the brownlows were up to something then there was only one way he was going to find out it would certainly be a feather in his cap if he uncovered something he eased the gate open a steady creaking if they were in the garden then they would surely hear him excuses apologies started to cram his mind but he pushed them away it was the brownlows who would need to fabricate aubrey wiped his eyes again clawed at the flies which had followed him the rear garden stretched away before him a large gently sloping lawn that resembled an area of compressed straw then his eyes alighted on that mound of soil sent a shudder through him in spite of the temperature this was what the neighbours had been complaining about and no wonder it looked like the brownlows had buried somebody in a huge grave he approached it looking all around him there was nobody in sight so perhaps they really were away for the day in which case he had all the time he needed to investigate flies crawled all over him unheeded as a host of possibilities presented themselves to him just suppose that thing really was a grave that meant that somebody was buried in it it was big big enough for a dozen bodies oh god his legs had gone weak and there was a tight ball in his stomach gripping him and threatening to make him vomit it was like a grave mr millichip well was it or wasnt it didnt you take a close look no i didnt why not because i was shitscared sir and i messed my pants spewed all down my shirt as i ran vomited my promotion all over the lawn he pulled himself together it couldnt be a grave otherwise it would have been hidden away somewhere therefore it was something else and youll only discover what by going and taking a closer look he spat some flies off his lips thrust at them with his rolled umbrella realisation that he had a weapon in his hand it gave him the confidence he needed to creep closer primed to run if he discovered some nameless horror if his legs were strong enough a door he stared at it in disbelief felt a sudden surge of relief graves didnt have doors looking back towards the house again a curtain at one of the upstairs windows appeared to waft slightly it must be his imagination to hell with the brownlows if they were skulking indoors watching him the door swung open at his touch delicately hung on welloiled hinges a rush of stale air that even had the flies scattering christ it didnt smell very healthy down there maybe the brownlows had constructed some kind of septic tank they had to be bloody crazy when they had mains sewage he propped the door open with a large stone checked that it couldnt swing shut and imprison him in there he stooped moved to the top of the steps tried to peer down into the darkness whatever was down there didnt actually go down mr millichipt sir you didnt go down and look his hand brushed against something flicked the switch even as he recognised what it was and pale yellow light flooded up the steps to greet him he stared down puffed his cheeks out at that awful smell well there was no going back now a quick look enough to enable him to file a report of some kind from here it looked like some sort of workshop brownlow was running some kind of business on the side avoiding rates dodging taxes that was what it was hed have to make sure though aubrey houghton reached the bottom of the steps turned to his left and grunted his amazement aloud some kind of foodstore more than that like a wellstocked corner shop that was short of floor space what the hell was going on something attracted his attention seemed to draw his gaze away from the loaded shelves a compelling frightening force that created within him a sensation of helplessness he could not hold back a little cry of fear recoiled as he saw the writhing snake its two heads bobbing from side to side like tulips caught in a gale bloodred eyes that saw him glittered ruby hatred fixed him with their stare a pendulum that you found yourself watching until eventually you couldnt drag your gaze away you felt the full force of its power houghton stood there transfixed aware that this underground room was growing darker as though the single bulb worked off a dimmer switch he couldnt make out the shelving any longer details slipping from him until finally the only thing he could see was that awful monstrosity bathed in the glow from its own eyes timeless terror how long he had been here he had ho idea cold so that the sweat chilled on his body had him shivering like he used to do as a boy when the swimming instructor was being bloodyminded and kept them all standing about on the edge of the baths a vibrating noise that jarred his brain began to hurt after a time he realised that it was the chattering of his own teeth he had dropped his umbrella he would never find it again its some kind of snake with two heads which the brownlows keep down there mr millichip youre mad houghton stark raving mad yes sir im mad and i wish i was dead maybe i shall be soon movements he wanted to turn his head and look behind him but even if he had been able to do so then he wouldnt have been able to see anything in the darkness a rustling sound too heavy for flies mice rats aubrey houghton wanted to scream tried to but no sound came from his lips then something brushed against his foot began crawling over it making his flesh crawl with it oh god almighty what the hell was it the reptilian features were suffused with the glow from those burning orbs fangs flicking from side to side in escalating fury mouthing a hiss that fused like cold water being poured on to hot embers infiltrating houghtons brain and becoming words trespasser in the temple of set death should be your reward but it would be too easy behold all about you is another plague come to scourge a dying land the plague of scorpions is upon you and your kind and in that instant aubrey houghton knew what it was that crawled about his feet and over them giant poisonous spiders scorpions he was rigid with terror wanting to scream wanting to die his crazed brain conjured up vague pictures of scorpions as he remembered them from hazy television programmes one sting was fatal an agonising death a screaming fit that would last until the end came he could hear them dozens of them circling him closing in oh jesus something was crawling up his leg inside his trousers sharp feet that gouged holds like a rockclimber hacking his path with a pick up and up sensations that shrunk his testicles into a compressed ball around his thighs creating shivers up his spine and following them on up and all the time he was forced to stare into those hateful lusting red eyes which mocked him anticipating the fateful sting if only he could faint bring it all to an end but unconsciousness was cruelly denied him that hissing voice it reminded him of millichips sarcastic gloating have you discovered what the brownlows are up to houghton yes sir theyre breeding scorpions in a dugout then let me have a full report i cant sir im going to die but aubrey houghton didnt die the unseen spiders crawled and scratched his flesh but did not administer the sting of death he was slowly going mad he could feel their sharp claws digging into him anticipated the fatal sting which never came and suddenly he found that he could move again a frightening anticlimax the four red eyes had died down to a dull glow almost as though that repulsive reptile slept this time he managed a scream a hoarse sound that echoed back at him lingered in the confined space as though it could not find a way out flee run while you still can he turned banged into a section of shelving and almost fell something hard crunched beneath his feet and he almost vomited he had trodden on one of the scorpions crushed it the others would surely kill him now then came the terrifying realisation that he had lost all sense of direction was totally disorientated in this stygian blackness feeling his way along the walls afraid of what his fingers might touch canned foodstuffs avalanched rolled he trod on something else which split and crushed but he couldnt be sure what it was something still crawled on his back inside his shirt but he dared not try to dislodge it those eyes were no longer glowing indeed he thought that reptilian monstrosity had gone having squirmed its way into some hiding place and left him to his fate movements all around him in the darkness as though the giant spiders could see were watching him torturing him with some obscene game in which the losers prize was death stumbling one way then another god he must find the exit soon surely something caught against his shin with jarring impact threw him forward and even as he fell he knew that he had found those steps and sobbed his relief aloud he clawed at them tasted blood in his mouth as he pulled himself up his hand brushed against something that moved and he snatched it away scrambling on all fours crying with fear and pain his shin might be broken but he didnt care as long as he made it up there and out into the daylight unscathed daylight a tantalising oblong that might have been a mirage because it took him so long to reach it fearful that at any second it might be blotted out by that terrible blackness again youve gone the wrong way aubrey go back and try again but it was real blazing sunlight on parched grass an emaciated blackbird squawking in alarm and taking off at his appearance leaving behind the remnants of a huge grasshopper on which it had been feeding aubrey dragged himself clear of the opening lay there with his eyes closed didnt dare glance behind him his head throbbed and his crazed mind could not yet come to terms with the outside world a noise that increased steadily in magnitude a tuneless orchestra of minute violins tuning up for some awful symphony of death he lay there wondering if that scorpion still crawled inside his shirt and if it did how he was going to remove it but he couldnt feel it any longer and in the end he concluded that his terrible host had left him he sat up began unfastening his shirt it clung wetly to his body and when he tugged at it the material tore frantically he pulled shredded it anything to get it away from his body a sigh of sheer relief escaped his lips as he discovered that the scorpion wasnt there anymore perhaps it had all been in his imagination no he could still hear them down there scurrying about he should have slammed the door behind him but he wasnt going near it again blood it trickled sluggishly from his nostrils in thick twin rivulets that congealed in the heat before they reached his lips he rolled up his trouser leg saw a bloody gash where he had banged his shin on the steps his umbrella was somewhere down there but he wasnt going back for it he wiped his smarting eyes stared across towards the house there was no sign of movement the curtains were still drawn the brownlows were definitely out and that was someing to be grateful for because he had no wish to meet them he rose shakily to his feet swayed as a wave of dizziness hit him what the hell was that noise it seemed to be coming from all around him a discord that filled the air so that there was no way you could shut it out and even as he stoodthere the burned lawn seemed to move a crazy shifting that might have been his own giddiness grasshoppers they were everywhere millions of them miniature violinists who sawed their bows and stared malevolently up at him with minute pinpoint eyes which were reflected in the glare of the sunlight aubrey houghton gave a strangled cry backed away felt dozens of tiny bodies crunching under the soles of his polished office shoes and this time he vomited bent double his vision cleared seemed to be drawn back to that open doorway beyond which those steps led down to hell itself he screamed a weak noise that was lost in the cacophony of insect music for coming out of that entrance were huge spiders a dozen or more that moved jerkily then stopped as though the intense heat had suddenly sapped their strength but they werent scorpions aubrey didnt know much about spiders but he knew these creatures were huge dark brown multilegged varieties similar to those which wove their silky webs in the dark corners of most households only very much bigger loathsome bloated bodies overfed but still hungry hunting for food the music changed instantly a million fearful insect screeches mingled into one waves of grasshopper bodies suddenly thrown into a turbulent wave of retreat scattering in all directions aubrey felt their movements over his feet a rush of tiny bodies crushed them by the thousand as he broke into flight the patio raised ground that offered a sanctuary from this lawn of seething revulsion he grazed his shin again on the steps but barely noticed the pain a door oh god he knew it would be locked because the brownlows were out banging his fists on the woodwork until his strength ran out yelling for somebody to open up and let him in but nobody answered his call and when eventually he looked back towards that lawn it was still and silent no grasshoppers no spiders just a square of parched land that might have been an area of desert wasteland anywhere in the world except on river view finally he moved away a hunched trembling figure in a sweatgrimed vest and town trousers face smeared with dried blood glancing fearfully behind him until he was clear of number twelve then he broke into a run and how did you get on up at river view houghton oh it was all a load of nonsense mr millichip sir blown up out of all proportion by the neighbours the brownlows have dug themselves a nuclear shelter nothing to do with us or anybody else a bit unsightly but once its grassed over you wont know its there but we cant interfere with it the leaflet that was sent round a couple of weeks ago the one about not interfering with any nuclear shelter digging by members of the public sir well with this libya business scaring half the population theres going to be an awful lot more of this sort of thing happening and you cant really blame folks only nosey neighbours who report them somebodys wasted council time but not to worry sir because i was intending to work over for a couple of hours tonight anyway no shant be booking overtime aubrey houghton did not even notice the stifling heat as he climbed into the mini certainly he wouldnt wind the windows down until he was well clear of river view the brownlows were mad but that was ok by him because he wasnt going back there again for anybody not even mr millichip and he would ensure that a return visit wasnt requested chapter twelve madness barry brownlow was not sure how long he had been at shelderton life had embarked upon a new course of apathy for him an almost lazy existence like cattle on undulating meadowland drifting aimlessly to and fro he could not even remember much about rita she was gone and that was all there was to it he did not need her maybe he hadnt needed her in the first place like a dream that faded with waking and eventually you forgot all about it you just waited for the next dream and hoped that everything would be all right those early days here had been unpleasant but he was learning to forget them as the tall man in the white coat had promised him he would vague recollections of a bare room with white walls and each time his visitors came in they hurt him a lot in the early stages he had struggled but there had been too many of them strapping him down and attaching some kind of strange machine with innumerable wires to his body sheer agony that left him weak and trembling but strangely contented but now they did not do that to him anymore they said there was no need and that he was getting better one of these days they assured him he would be allowed to go home barry wasnt sure that he wanted to go home it was nice here they fed you they gave you a comfortable bed and they werent everlastingly pestering you about the need to study for examinations shelderton was the sort of place you could happily spend the rest of your life in he wondered why mother hadnt been to see him but if she came she would only nag the whole time she was here so it was better if she didnt visit him just take each day as it comes let everybody else do the worrying he concluded he was getting better because now they were quite happy for him to wander about the grounds spacious gardens that became a wilderness of neglect away from the main buildings the part where visitors never went four bells a day breakfast lunch supper and bed a matronlylike figure conducting her own rollcall in the dininghall and checking your room last thing to make sure you were in apart from that you were free to mooch anywhere within those two acres bordered by a high pleached hedge almost like an open prison where nobody wanted to escape one day was much the same as another and barry had mentioned to the doctor that life was becoming a bit boring the greyhaired man had frowned scribbled something on a slip of paper and that night his tablets were changed only a slight difference red ones instead of green ones but the next day wasnt monotonous at all so much to see grasshoppers that plaintively bemoaned the scorched grass especially a giantsized one that regarded barry steadily from the bough of a wilting rhododendron bush the insect reminded him of the one dad had caught that time the cruel bugger had kept it in a jar with the lid screwed down tight and in due course the poor thing had suffocated and died he ought to have been reported to the rspca for all the good that would have done barry studied the one perched on the branch for some time and it seemed to return his stare masticating the whole time with a kind of brittle crunching sound eventually it appeared to become bored with his company and flew off there was an abundance of all kinds of insects the tangled rosebeds were thick with greenfly which in their turn were being devoured by an increasing army of ladybirds nature was cruel he decided and moved on down to the pond at the furthermost corner of the grounds more cruel than dad in fact so peaceful here the croak of frogs from the thick rushes reminded him of the river at the bottom of their garden frogs were perfectly harmless sheila and adrian had panicked that night he grinned at the memory of their naked homecoming and in due course his thoughts returned to rita oh god why did she have to die like that morose now staring at the black muddy water between the rushes remembering how it had been that night ritas flushed features the dry soreness of her throat and how hed felt the hotness of her breath when hed kissed her that last time he felt it again now a burning in his own mouth a dryness that demanded moisture and brought with it a sense of unreality as though he was merely a spectator to his own actions water suddenly it was an obsession his overheated body screaming out for it he would never make it back to the hospital like a desert wanderer who had pursued a mirage relentlessly throughout the heat of the day and was now suddenly unable to go any further desperation took control water was within yards of him cool natural water that flowed from an unseen spring a headlong rush took him to the edge of the pool his feet squelching in the soft ground stirring up mud and putting a fleet of water boatmen to flight he flung himself headlong his dry tongue starting to lap tepid water that tasted cool and sweet no longer dark and brackish heedless of particles of dirt and algae that made him cough he drank thirstily oblivious to everything about him the frog chorus changed note the shrill triumph of the hunter who has lured his prey to the water hole gloating barely time to raise his head and draw breath drinking again greedily his thirst unassuaged clouds of insects homed in on him midges that settled on every area of exposed flesh and bit deeply in their eagerness for the taste of human blood a mutual seeking of satisfaction man and insect but neither fulfilled their desire barry brownlow felt the water coming back up from his stomach in a rush raised his head and vomited violently drank again a process of liquid regurgitation and somewhere a bell was tolling a distant clanging but he ignored it he could not leave the water he could not live away from it sometime later his body seemed to cool with the coming of evening shadows lengthening across the reedy surface of the pool and turning the water to an inky blackness he raised himself up coughing and spitting out algae and drowned flies so weak he wondered if he would be able to make it back to the hospital he set off using the overhanging branches of trees and bushes for leverage and support tottering across the burned lawn the crazypaving of the big mossy terrace hot to the soles of his flipflops so there you are there was relief and remonstration on mrs howes lined face as barry walked into the hall grey eyes that scrutinised him closely noting a flush that was more than just the continual heat wave you didnt come in for lunch and suppers almost finished now i was on my way up to ask mr bale to go and search for you i wasnt hungry ive been resting down by the pool barry thought his voice sounded a long way away and his vision swam so that momentarily mrs howe had two heads like that snake amulet of his fathers you dont look well im fine honest i am i reckon the heat is getting me like its getting everybody else well theres still some supper left in the diningroom youd better go in and get some she watched him closely he almost snapped im not hungry but that would mean telling her how he felt and that could have unpleasant repercussions like having nasty painful things done to you and being kept in his room for days on end ok he smiled i feel fine now so ill go in and get something to eat im starving and im also dying of thirst she watched him cross the hall and enter the diningroom it could just be the heat but shed keep a careful eye on him check how he looked first thing in the morning barry brownlow closed the door behind him leaned up against it the room spun swam in a sea of kaleidoscopic lights and when it steadied he saw that it was empty just a trestletable at the far end that served as an evening supper bar a pile of dirty plates and cups some sandwiches and a battered tea urn in that instant the thirst hit him again had him staggering across the room the milk jug first it had maybe a couple of pints left in it he lifted it to his mouth began to gulp the white fluid down his throat slopping it as he did so then he was sucking on an empty jug biting the rim in his frustration if anything his thirst was worse now and he moved across to the big urn thrust the empty milk jug beneath the tap he could not wait for it to fill swallowing the thick brown lukewarm liquid while the untended tap still flowed tea splashing and running on the quarry tiles the urn was almost empty it spluttered was reduced to a steady drip barry brownlow grunted rattled the jug back on the table there was nothing to stay here for the weakness hit him again and he had to cling on to the door as he eased it open and peered out into the deserted hallway thank god mrs howe was gone she was always tittletattling to the doctors a good nights sleep that was all he needed in the morning he would be fine maybe he would be better off at home surely they had to release him soon only for christs sake dont go and be ill and prolong the stay in here he thought at first that he wasnt going to be able to make it upstairs it was as though his limbs had suddenly become jellified his legs threatening to throw him to the floor a concerted effort spurred on by the thought of being confined to that small bare room again and another session of electric shock treatment had him pulling himself up by the stairrail one step at a time sweat poured from him had his eyes smarting so that his vision was blurred or he could have been dizzy or both confused now so that when finally he reached the landing he had to work out which was his room walking on the balls of his feet in case he disturbed somebody and they went and fetched mrs howe he made it slumped down to the floor knew he had to rest before he tried to crawl across to the bed his throat felt as though it was loaded with redhot embers that needed to be quenched instantly but he could not do that because there was no tap in his room the nearest was in the bathroom at the end of the landing and he would never make it that far he lay there on the floor in the darkened room for some time before he attempted to reach the bed it was a slow process but eventually he managed to pull himself up on the iron bedstead and roll himself on to the coverlet that would do it was too hot to cover his body anyway and he didnt have the strength to get undressed if only he had a drink liquid of any kind would suffice but he didnt and there was no way he was going to get one logic interspersed with feverish thoughts in the manner of a childs waking nightmare theyd said in the beginning that he was mad and theyd been right a nervous breakdown was just another way of saying youd gone out of your mind this was all part of their plan to keep him here forever give you a little bit of freedom kid you that you were on the mend and any day you might be going home they plugged it so that in the end you liked it here and didnt want to leave but when you finally decided you did you couldnt crazy barry brownlow didnt really understand it himself but there again he wasnt supposed to he was a victim of the system but he was going to fight every inch of the way one touch of home down by that pool oh jesus theyd set it all up so cleverly gone into every tiny detail the grasshoppers the frogs had even found a locust from somewhere you loved it so much that in the end you had to drink that water foul stagnant water covered with algae gallons of it so that it made you ill so ill that you wouldnt be going anywhere mrs howe knew as soon as she saw him was already gloatingly informing the others brownlow will be staying because he cant leave like we planned helpless rage that had him crying real wet tears that he caught on his fingers and sucked salty so that it made his thirst even worse they knew so he might as well call them at least theyd give him water or would they his anger subsided to be replaced by fear just what the hell were they going to do to him it was a frightening thought like dad was doing to the family he hadnt built that shelter just to protect them from a nuclear war oh no there was something much more to it than that that snake amulet was the key to it all and no matter what they tried to say rita had died because of it a sequence of events that might have led to her picking up some hideous germ in the laboratory at work but it was all part of a plan dads or his thoughts were jumping now like those grasshoppers on the lawn at home and in the grounds here hed been sent to this place to keep him out of the way dad didnt want him around because it interfered with his plans whatever they were for the same reason that he didnt want adrian around he tried to sit up fell back god it would be easy enough to escape from here you just walked out through the front gates if you had the strength and they made bloody sure that you hadnt weeping his frustration licking at his tears again then lying spent just staring up into the blackness maybe he slept he didnt know it was difficult to differentiate between waking and sleeping but rita wasnt really dead she couldnt be because she had come to him in his room that night after the funeral she had been different though so aloof she refused to let him touch her had evaded his intended embrace they had talked for a long time mum and dad had heard them banged on the door but they couldnt get in because it had been locked he was worrying now desperately trying to recall that conversation it had been important rita had impressed that upon him a warning of some kind something he had to do to prevent something else happening but they had ensured that he didnt remember by giving him that hellish shock treatment a kind of hysterectomy of the mind that removed almost everything but left you with the basic original thinking functions like starting all over again whatever rita had said to him they had made damned certain he wouldnt remember already it might be too late he shivered it had gone suddenly cold and the lather of sweat had chilled on his body he was awake all right now and the thirst wasnt so bad perhaps he could make it as far as the bathroom and there was somebody in the room he had not heard the door open and close now he could see a silhouette between the end of the bed and the small barred window he thought at first it must be mrs howe but it wasnt bulky enough slim somebody young definitely female because he could make out the delicate curve of her breasts as she stood sideways barry soft husky tones that he would recognise anywhere rita surprise and hope fear of the disappointment brought by yet another willothewisp dream followed by a shiver that was not wholly due to the sudden cooling of the sweat on his body my darling is it really you it is me she laughed a little sadly i had difficulty finding you indeed i have been searching since that night when we last spoke but you are ill its nothing he stared hard tried to discern her features but her whole body was bathed in shadow i have been ill so they tell me they gave me shock treatment to make me forget everything you said to me set works in many mysterious ways she whispered and even the wellmeaning people at a hospital such as this may find themselves his pawns but it is necessary for you to return home your fathers plans are almost complete and it is imperative that we rejoin your family what has he done what is that underground place for it is a tomb such as the one in which i was incarcerated when i was dalukah child of dalukah oh my god then we must stop him before it is too late no for it is not necessarily an evil place or it need not be depending upon the forces which control it it is up to you and i to ensure that it is not evil also it is the only place in which we can be rejoined as we were in life im im going to die arent i he spoke softly a whisper that was both a realisation and a resignation to his fete a fear of death that came and then evaporated almost instantly yes she said i am afraid you are going to die barry in the same way that i died the victim of a deadly plague that was rife in egypt at the time of dalukah and abaaner it is fate and we cannot alter it he lay there in silence numbed by her words knowing that she spoke the truth this then was really the end for both of them you must return home she said tonight i i dont have the strength i cant even manage it across to the bathroom you can there was a determination an insistence in her voice now you will have the strength to return to river view go now under the cover of darkness go back home go to your bedroom and remain there make them take you down into the tomb and eventually i will join you my mother will ring the hospital and ill be brought straight back here i dont think so she was facing him now and he could make out her features pale and beautiful in the starlight which shafted in through the window fate cannot be changed even your parents cannot alter it it is decreed that we shall be together for eternity my peace can only be assured if you join me only then will i be able to cross over to sekhetaant he did not doubt her words and when he looked again and saw that she was not there he did not show surprise she had said they would be together and that was how it would be rita had gone on ahead and he must follow he swung his feet to the floor waited for the dizziness to pass physically he felt stronger now and the thirst had left him he stood up swayed slightly began to walk across the room a lowwatt bulb was always kept burning on the landing barry brownlow paused outside the door of his room listening just the sound of rhythmic breathing from the other rooms his heartbeat speeded up and his pulses raced as he began the descent of the stairs one or two boards creaked alarmingly but nobody stirred and his confidence soared he clicked back the yale lock on the front door closed it softly behind him and experienced a rush of euphoria freedom they would not catch him now and even if he died it would have been worth it just to walk unhindered on this warm night the stars showed him all he needed to see a dark avenue of tall trees that led down to the entrance gates and out on to the road from there it would be a matter of a couple of hours walk back to river view he felt slightly heady and his throat was sore but he knew he would make it now only once during that long walk did he have to step back into the bushes to avoid being spotted by the twin headlight beams of an approaching vehicle so serene a land that was natures domain for a few hours while man slept and was absent from it so humid though an atmosphere that was alive it touched you stroked you so that your skin prickled and you kept glancing behind you you knew you were being watched a selfconsciousness that bordered on fear had you wanting to run to lock yourself indoors until daylight that primitive fear of the dark and much more he began to walk faster barry was soon out of breath had to rest awhile to recharge his strength but all the time he was getting weaker and that burning sensation was back in his throat and lungs he was wheezing fighting for breath relief surged through him as he saw river view below him a silent cluster of houses as he approached his ears picked up that sinister orchestration frogs vibrating the still night air with their ceaseless rasping croaks against a background of insect noises clouds of moths fluttered against a glass porch where a hall light had been left on kamikaze divebombing against the glass hardshelled flying insects pinging against it like missiles from catapults he stumbled almost fell as something struck the back of his neck and viciously buzzed off into the night so weak now that he feared he might collapse within yards of his own home he fumbled in his pocket and found his key the one item they had not taken from him at shelderton the hall was stifling suffocating as though emily brownlow still had the central heating running he gasped for breath and the burning and thirst returned instantly he had been given just enough strength to return home now he was ill again and he was going to die leaning back against the door instinctively trying to shut them out but it was futile because they were already in here unknown mysterious forces which fingered his sweating body in the darkness whispered their evil in his ear so that the sound vibrated on his brain had him wanting to flee only there was nowhere to go no escape he was at their mercy somehow he managed to crawl up the stairs and into his room dragged himself up on to the bed his dry burning eyes searching the darkness looking for rita but she was not here yet he was not alone for he sensed their presence and now he waited for death as that agonising inner fire began to burn and consume his body chapter thirteen homecoming emily had gone down into the shelter shortly after breakfast a kind of calling that preyed on her obsessions a fear that she fought to overcome because of her duty the place had to be cleaned made habitable george would ignore such details it was up to her that awful smell made her feel sick at first but somehow you became accustomed to it after a time and didnt notice it and that doubleheaded snake watched your every move although it wasnt malevolent like it had been at first powerful certainly but once you gave subservience it would not hurt you all it demanded was total obedience she went down the steps slowly negotiating a mop and bucket with some difficulty george hadnt considered when he built this place that it might need cleaning she reached the bottom stared in disbelief at the untidyness canned foodstuffs and packets littered the floor and somebody had trodden soil all over the place anger directed at george because only he had been down here in the last twentyfour hours an uneasiness that had her peering into the corners suppose it wasnt george who had done all this inevitably she found her gaze drawn towards the amulet those four eyes flickered into life as though they had been closed in sleep and she had disturbed them a film that cleared flickered saw emily brownlow experienced a sensation of instinctive embarrassment did a halfcurtsey almost crossed herself in the manner in which she had been indoctrinated as a child whenever she came into contact with an altar her mouth went dry and she licked her lips nervously found herself mentally apologising for this intrusion your son has been returned to you those awful mouths moved something which she had always attributed to a trick of the light like the eyes but she no longer sought logical explanations no that isnt right hes in shelderton he might be coming home in a week or two though he is home he is ill beyond help and he will die of a plague that was old when egypt was young do not send for help you must hide him and wait she felt her breathing quicken barry was going to die there had to be some mistake perhaps she ought to go and check ask george she had never been in the habit of asking george for anything in the past but now her life revolved around him a kind of symbolic worship like set cleanse this place for there has been an intruder but he has gone and will not return she began to brush the floor a jar of coffee had shattered and she swept the broken glass into a small heap next time she came down here she must remember to bring a dustpan those eyes had dulled closed she must not interrupt again moving silently as she went about her work muttering apologetically when she dislodged a tin of beans and it crashed to the floor glancing half fearfully at the thing that was set but the amulet did not stir a movement behind her that she sensed rather than saw halfturned and almost screamed when she caught sight of the spider a huge bloated thing its body the size of a fivepence piece legs thick and strong like bent pipecleaners watching her she straightened up backed away she had had a fear of spiders ever since childhood a good housewife had no place for them in her home she had once told a friend some argued that spiders caught flies well there were plenty of flykillers on the market nowadays so that was no excuse spiders should be exterminated until they became an extinct species her grip tightened on the broom one swift blow and she could crush it sweep its squashed corpse into the dustpan along with that glass slowly carefully she began to lift the brush just enough to give her the necessary impetus to stop do not kill it for scorpions are sacred to the temple of set words that hit her with the force of a physical blow had her dropping the broom so that it clattered on the floor and with surprising agility the spider reversed disappeared beneath a section of dexion shelving so that it might never have existed except as a figment of her own imagination emily brownlow was sweating and trembling very much afraid as she turned back towards the amulet just in time to see a fading dull glow like embers that had finally burned themselves out set slept yet he was ever watchful she began to sweep the rest of the floor her heart pounding and her flesh goose pimpling keeping well clear of shadowy corners relying on the length of the brush to drag the dirt back towards her scorpions it had looked like an oversize spider to her not like those scorpions she had seen on the wildlife programme on tv nevertheless it was a repulsive looking thing and needed to be kept at brooms length in fact emily did not like coming down here on her own but set would protect her suddenly she had unquestionable faith in that doubleheaded serpent like she had once had in god it was twenty minutes to one by her watch when she finished sheila would have prepared the lunch by now salad the whole nation was living on salad but if the rain didnt come soon there wouldnt be any available even if you could afford to buy it there would be food shortages famine at the bottom of the steps she turned back almost bowed set was watching her all right even if his four orbs were dull lifeless metal a quick glance around but there was no sign of that spider she shuddered and almost ran up into the blazing heat of the day she paused on the patio and turned back to survey the garden that part of the shelter which was above ground looked quite neat you would hardly notice it once it had grassed over that stupid blackbird was still trying to unearth a worm in the baked soil it didnt seem interested in the hordes of grasshoppers anymore too much of a good thing emily decided just like the ladybirds didnt seem to be bothering with the masses of greenfly on the rosebushes or the blackfly which were resolutely demolishing the remnants of that row of broad beans natures last line of defence had been breached only rain and a return to normal would save civilisation now george would be in the lounge tuning in to the one oclock news three plates and some cutlery adorned the scrubbed pine table in the kitchen a bowl of wilted salad was the focal point lettuce leaves that had browned around the edges she swilled her hands in the sink thought she heard sheilas voice upstairs in that case george was up there too she ought to speak to him about that spider not that there was anything they could do about it if set had declared it sacred all the same it was unnerving sheila came in seated herself at the table began to load lettuce and cucumber on to her plate a habit learned in the brownlow household that unless you engrossed yourself in something you were inviting an interrogation wheres your dad sheila i thought i heard him upstairs no hes in the lounge watching the news things arent looking good dad says its cuba all over again only this time the russians wont back down i heard you talking to him upstairs no that was barry barry suddenly for emily brownlow the whole room was spinning sheila upside down and still spooning salad out of the bowl the crockery threatening to avalanche on to the floor and smash like that jar of coffee down in the shelter and then a huge spider would creep out from under the sink unit the room came to rest again sheila was hunting for a quarter of tomato with the wooden servers it slipped away from her and hid beneath a lettuce leaf but she caught it at the second attempt did you say barry sheila yes hes up in his room but hes very ill cold fingers like those down in the shelter clutched at emilys heart and she fought for breath as though she suffered an attack of asthma movement wasnt easy her limbs seemed to be weighted her thinking muzzy your son has been returned to you do not send for help you must hide him sheila seemed apprehensive glancing at her mother as though she feared she might make a dash for the telephone moved her leg as though she would trip her up if she did so td better go upstairs and see him emily moved slowly pale and trembling knocked the table and rattled the salad bowl as she pushed past a glance through the halfopen lounge door as she passed through the hall george was hunched in the armchair the television screen flickering away in front of him he might have been asleep but she wasnt going to bother checking she paused at the foot of the stairs almost afraid to go up shed heard how rita had looked when they took her to hospital oh god a stair at a time having to pull herself up forcibly on the rail that night came back to her in detail the expression on barrys face she would never forget it that was why she hadnt been to shelderton to visit him she didnt want to see him now because it wouldnt have changed but she had to it was another of her duties she stood in the doorway clutching at the lintel until her fingernails began flaking some of the paint off not sure that it was her son trying to tell herself that those emaciated flushed features tying back against the pillow belonged to somebody else and that smell it made her want to vomit she recognised it the same odour that lingered in that that tomb not just the stench of dry dusty staleness but a smell that was nauseating like rotting meat flesh that was decomposing while it still lived gangrene mum a whispered croak from the bed an arm that began to move but couldnt make it and flopped back on to the coverlet youre ill barry he knew and she knew so there was no point in trying to hide the obvious yes an attempted smile that made a hideous mask of those features tin ill and im going to die but youve got to hide me and you mustnt send for help promise i promise her skin crawled as she remembered sets words he had spoken the truth then he had to be right about that spider being a scorpion she shuddered we look after you i cant stay here in this room cracked tones his lips blistered and oozing blood and a trickle of yellow mucus they will have missed me by now this is the first place theyll look ill speak to your father about the shrill ringing of the telephone interrupted her a brainjarring sound that made you want to scream ringing and still ringing christ there were two of them downstairs and they were both too bloody idle to answer it no that wasnt quite right they were frightened to answer it the angry ringing suddenly petered out but you still heard it as though its echoes could not escape from the house that will be the hospital checking barry gave a laugh coughed up some pink phlegm which trickled slowly down his chin theyll be sending somebody round any time now we wont let them take you away again emily brownlow experienced a rush of maternal instinct which she thought had died out years ago she would protect her offspring at all cost sacrifice her own life for him if necessary even if he was going to die and she did not doubt that for a second is there anything we can get for you just water he grabbed the plastic beaker off the bedside table sucked noisily at imaginary dregs in the bottom the thirst its not as bad as as it was that time at the pool i thought i was going to drink it dry would willingly have drowned in it you drank out of a pool horror on emilys features then then you could have diphtheria a plague that was old when egypt was young no its something else but hurry youll have to hide me down in the the shelter that dad made they wont think of looking for me down there there isnt much time theyll come soon she turned away tripped and almost fell on the stairs in her feverish haste george was still hunched in that chair facing away from her there was a weather chart being shown on the television screen sunny and very warm outlook similar why the bloody hell didnt they just admit that it was never going to rain again ever she shook him roughly hated him for those few seconds his head came round an expression that was blank his eyes glazed reminding her of the amulets orbs when they werent glowing redly but they still watched you george there isnt much time i know a week at the most this madman isnt bluffing he means it he wants to start a nuclear war and not just to wipe israel off the map if he dies then he doesnt care because he will be destroying what god almighty created one human wiping out the lot at the press of a button and thatll make him big those few hours of life he has left will have made it all worthwhile for him and suddenly the whole world realises that its more than just a possibility that leaflet which was pushed through the letterbox this morning the government one on what to do if there is a nuclear war thats proof enough theyve been sitting back too long and saying it could never happen that no nation would dare to start it but now we have a maniac who wants to do just that for a lot of people it will be too late but were all right our shelters virtually ready i dont mean that i mean barry weve got to get him into the shelter before they come looking for him if they find him here theyll take him back to shelderton he stood up his eyes clearing and revealing a determined glint defiant and obsessive well do it now this very minute ill need you and sheila to help me and well have to trust to set that none of these bloody neighbours see us the calthorpes were up at their bedroom window with binoculars most of last week ill bet theyve been ringing the council trying to put the shit down for us you know how ill he is dont you george like rita was hes going to die but the doctors cant save him nobody can i want him to die in there with us his hand found hers squeezed it gently the first time he had shown her any affection for years a kind of mutual sympathy now that the chips were down lets get moving george brownlows complexion was a dark flush it might just have been the stifling heat they wont take him back i promise you that emily set will protect us all have faith in him for we are his chosen ones sheila came through into the hall still chewing on some dry indigestible salad none of them spoke there was no need because they understood chapter fourteen the deathwatch it was midafternoon before the expected car drew up in front of number twelve river view emily brownlow watching from behind the curtains experienced an acute sense of relief she had begun to believe that they would never come that barry hadnt escaped from shelderton that it wasnt her own son lying down there in that improvised curtained alcove in the shelter that they had all made one big terrible mistake but now the men from shelderton were here she let them ring twice before she went to the door two men one of them was dr home looking strangely nervous meticulously cleaning his glasses the other was short and stocky with eyes that reminded her of a fishs or a frogs we er tried to ring you mrs brownlow home put his spectacles back on adjusted them there was no reply we were she almost said in the garden but checked herself in time the last place she wanted to admit to having been in was the garden instead she muttered out doing some shopping im afraidthe tall medical man began picking specks of imaginary fluff off his sleeve im afraid that barry has left the hospital left the hospital acting now hoping it looked authentic holding on to the doorpost whatever do you mean doctor just that home let out a deep breath relief now that the hardest part was over he just got up in the night and walked out just like that but but dont you havent you any idea where hes gone i was hoping that perhaps you might be able to help us with that home stepped forward a pace we thought perhaps he had come home in his state of mind it was the logical place to run to but apparently he hasnt may we come inside she stepped back let them push past her saw that george had emerged from the kitchen there was no sign of sheila obviously she was still lying down in her room gone george brownlows flush gave the appearance of indignation dont they operate any security system at shelderton doctor home yes the doctor was uneasy once more if a patient needs it we lock him in his room for the night but barry had progressed so well that we didnt think it was necessary hes had the freedom of the grounds by day for the past week and if he was going to run away then logically he would have left then we were hoping that you would have visited him before now that could be the reason why he ran away like an adolescent in his first term at boarding school who feels abandoned needs his parents george brownlow was tightlipped they were trying to pass the buck now that they hadnt found barry safely at home but he doesnt really need to stay in shelderton does he doctor you said yourself how much better he is i mean it isnt a prison is it we could have had him back home if we had insisted yes and no home glanced at his silent companion as though seeking moral support we would have done our best to persuade you not to take him away because he is receiving a course of treatment which isnt completed yet as it stands now we are obliged to inform the police and every effort will be made to he just stopped himself from saying recapture him find him and what is his mental state george craned his neck forward its difficult to be precise he has certainly responded to the treatment but he has become morose reluctant to converse with the other patients but mrs howe the senior matron informed me this morning that when she saw him last night he looked flushed and far from well that is one of the reasons why we want to recover him as quickly as possible what can we do to help georges expression was one of despair and anguish almost overacting it there is every chance he will come back home that is usually the first place which patients head for so i think that the best thing you can do is stay here if he turns up give us a ring in the meantime well notify the police home took his glasses off again put them back on and turned back towards the door i will be in touch with you again shortly anyway emily closed the door after their visitors she was sweating heavily and it had nothing to do with the heat well thats got rid of them theyll be back out of the comer of his eye george saw sheila coming down the stairs and we can expect a visit from the police soon as well from now well begin using the er shelter as our home but well have to take it in turns to remain in the house to take telephone calls and receive callers it wouldnt do for the police to come looking for us in the garden would it sheila brownlow stood at the foot of the stairs her hair was awry matted and unbrushed her jeans and blouse crumpled where she had lain on her bed in them her features were deathly pale a factor which brought fresh concern to emily are you sure youre ail right sheila i she was going to say im ok but a sudden feeling of faintness had her sinking down on the bottom step holding her head i havent been very well i guess it was the heat and and struggling to get barry down into the shelter its because youre pregnant george brownlows voice was terse chiding the bastard child of a commoner is growing fast in your womb george emily snapped how could you be silent he turned on her and she saw his expression felt her stomach tightening into a hard ball experienced a fear of her husband which was almost as great as her terror of the amulet indeed for a brief second his eyes seemed to glow with that same unholy fire she tried to tell herself that it was a trick of the sunlight which slanted down into the hall from the small window on the first landing but she knew that she lied george brownlow was surely a man possessed of set im going to see doctor home first thing in the morning sheila was close to tears i havent had a test yet but maybe its a phantom pregnancy emily was still clinging to vain hopes lots of women have them stupid woman george whirled on her and for a moment she thought he was going to strike her the girl is with child because she has mated been fertilised by the sperm of a commoner dad do you deny it are you going to lie to me girl have you or have you not mated with that boy come on answer me and do not let the ears of set hear a lie yes a stifled sob backing away up the stairs in an ungainly crablike retreat sheer terror on her face i have mated with him as you put it three times and now im going to have his baby does that bloody well satisfy you or do i have to put it all down in writing your admission of guilt is sufficient his voice was low and menacing now go to your room and rest and you will not visit doctor horne for we cannot tolerate the interference of outsiders from now onwards you must rest now i shall go to the temple for the deathwatch must commence there is not much time left for any of us he turned walked through the kitchen and out into the dazzling sunlight a strange silence seemed to hang over the garden even the multitude of grasshoppers on the dead lawn was silent a heat haze shimmered appeared to be concentrated over that oblong of excavated soil like some transparent entity hovering there and for a few seconds george brownlow experienced sheer terror a numbing of his brain that almost had him fleeing back indoors and locking the door cowering and babbling under the table then it was gone and the harsh chorus started up again a rasping that for once was sweet music to his ears he walked steadily across the lawn cared not whether he trod and crushed the insects beneath his feet for they were expendable a pestilence that would die eventually just as they all would he opened the door felt a rush of cold air greet him then that awful putrefying smell it was stronger more pungent than ever had him recoiling and gasping for breath sets own odour and something more the stench of a rotting living body at first george brownlow thought that barry was asleep a naked pallid motionless body whose chest barely rose and fell on the frail camp bed then an eye flickered open two seeing but not recognising staring vacantly george approached the bed timidly almost vomited festered sores that wept their pus a rash beginning to spread out from groin and armpits you almost saw it move water breath as foul as a stinking marshland mist a dribble of thick phlegm that he tried to spit out george lifted a twogallon plastic container from the floor unscrewed the cap and slopped some of the water into a mug held it close to barrys lips the youth sucked fiercely spilled most of it the moisture seemed to revive him started a wheezing in his chest like an ancient motor that stuttered into life after years of neglect he took some more water coughed rita a whisper vocal chords stretched to their limits is she here she will come george stole a glance at the amulet as though seeking confirmation but those four eyes were dull and lifeless she promised silence he moved across to a chair seated himself on it and crossed his legs the deathwatch had begun night or day it made no difference down in the underground shelter a single bulb that flickered every so often threatened to go out dimmed came back on again just as barry brownlows eyes opened and closed periodically they should not have burned her the fools george spoke softly as though talking to himself angry words that were scarely audible now her khaibit cannot cross over to sekhetaaru it is too late to save her but we must not make the same mistake with you my son i have the knowledge to carry out the rites no sudden strength enough to bring barry up on to an elbow anguish on his wasted fevered features not without rita please she promised that i would join her in death and you would willingly enter into purgatory a lost soul condemned to wander forever chained to this earth which will soon become a burning wasteland a veritable hades anything to be with rita barrys eyes closed and he sank bank on to his pillow fool i will not allow you to do this when the time comes i shall embalm you myself and your mother and sister will become the bodywatchers they shall act as the kherheb the sem priest the sameref the tcherauur the tcherausheraut the menhu the amasi and the amkhent it shall be the burial of osiris again and there will be no mistake this time we shall need a living sacrifice but of all the gods only set will be addressed you will be committed to his care for the duration of your journey to the land of the dead barry was mouthing protests but the words would not come only bubbling mucus desperation as his strength ebbed a mental battle projecting his waning willpower at the man who was now the high priest of set the one who used to be his father george brownlow closed his eyes it had been a terrible strain an actor who somehow had spoken his part in the very throes of stage fright an inner force that had taken over his body and brain he was a puppet afraid of what he had to do frightened because when the time came he might not be strong enough now he sat in fearful darkness his eyes closed feeling sets power all around him that evil stench so strong and foul that he could scarcely draw breath he sensed a presence was aware of its hostility towards him an icy draught as it moved not set because the serpent god burned him with those fiery eyes and this was like a breath of arctic wind somebody or something had infiltrated this hallowed place was strong enough to defy the power of set and did not fear him george brownlow trembled squinted through narrowed eyelids terrified of what he might see at first he saw nothing the light had been reduced to barely a glow the shadows moving in to obliterate details just outlines a bed he started a figure was bent over it and at first he thought it was his dying son in the midst of a miraculous resurrection from neardeath but no the figure was female shapely familiar but his bemused brain was incapable of recognising it instantly again he turned to set a hiss it might have been his imagination for those four orbs remained lifeless and he heard only that which he made himself hear save me master for there is evil in our midst he recoiled as recognition came once carefree features that no longer smiled dark eyes that smouldered their hatred for him rita so you would sacrifice your own son to everlasting purgatory give him to the snake god so that you alone might rule in sekhetaaru like a lap dog at sets feet her face was pallid corpse flesh which had not yet begun to decompose the living dead again george brownlow looked to the altar but it was dark and lifeless no fiery pinpoints glowing their anger at this sacrilege set had sentenced the child dalukah to everlasting hell on earth thousands of years ago and now he had no control over her beyond that original curse you will not save your son george brownlow but merely make him a slave of set as i once was have merely exchanged one hell for another ensure his safe passage to sekhetaaru by all means but administer to him the rites of horus promise me this i beg of you for myself it is too late and i must suffer for eternity george brownlow reeled beneath her words light where before there had been darkness and evil a glimmer of understanding and his fear was all the more terrible for this knowledge because he had passed the point of no return his lips moved his head went back to nod his agreement but in that awful moment he heard a hiss like a deflating tyre behind him and froze he felt the force of a terrible slumbering power aroused its fury like the beginning of an electric storm lightning capable of shrivelling one to a cinder an unrecognisable nothingness child you defy me even as your mother who was also named dalukah did you have dared to challenge the wrath of sett dared to mention the name of his accursed brother in this temple you cannot harm me set for you have cursed me beyond your own power the girl drew herself up proudly her slim body rippling sensuously beneath the transparent shroud which she wore i have loved briefly in yet another life and now that is over but you shall not have this boy for he is not of the line of dalukah and abaaner he will die of the plague and his death will be yet another cancer on my conscience but you shall not have his ka begone child return to the wandering dead four eyes blazed their hatred two fangs spat their venom in the land of osiris my power is challenged only by one he whom you have already named but i still rule the places of darkness you are a child in your last life you escaped me for a few years because of the protection of my brother but now that is no more herein the temple of set i can destroy you through this festering mortal who craves to be allowed into sekhetaaru the kingdom of osiris now his life is done and you are a child again racked with the plague of your time so be it george brownlow tried to scream but the shriek of terror came from the thing that purported to be rita hendon who was in turn dalukah babe of the nile he saw her stiffen her flesh suffused with a fiery radiance that shrivelled the frail garment on her body her whiteness blackened as though she had been electrocuted by a high voltage current slumping to the floor a crumpled hairless heap shrinking before his very eyes limbs so small and frail gesticulating with pathetic futility those screams turning to infant wails the tender skin rippled bubbled like molten lava throwing up hideous boils that burst with stinking pus the writhing babe stretched out its festering arms and for one awful moment george brownlow almost went to it something held him back the eyes of set which were now focused upon himself fool would you risk your own ka for one who has yet again betrayed me the child was growing weaker its cries now barely audible whimpers of pain and terror its body visibly decomposing even in life emitting that same stench that had come from the dying youth on the bed gangrene the living death and suddenly she was no more wasting away into the shadows until they too faded and made way for the artificial light from the gently swinging bulb george brownlow sat and stared tried not to believe it but in the end knew that it had all taken place and set had retired to his somnolent posture almost smug in his vengeance george moved half afraid to approach that bed upon which his own son lay but knew that he must the head lolled to one side those rivulets of foul mucus no longer trickling beginning to encrust eyes wide and staring static terror which had come with the plague and remained for barry brownlow was dead george brownlow sighed a sound which incorporated remorse and relief because it was all over for his sons mortal body now the real nightmare was about to begin set had demanded a ka and it must be given to him ritas futile attempt had failed because the child of dalukah by abaaner was fated to fester for eternity and the course of fate could not be changed and george brownlow was a cog in that wheel he had a part to play whether he liked it or not he must obey the force which controlled him wearily he mounted the steps shielded his eyes from the dazzling sunlight outside nothing had changed except perhaps that the grasshoppers sawed with less resolution than before their orchestration slow and mournful some of them looked much bigger than the others but it was difficult to be sure among the hordes they just might have been locusts emily was sitting in the kitchen when george entered in all probability sheila was still upstairs in her bedroom he did not speak went to the sink and swilled his hands under the tap as though he needed to wash some effluvium off them he turned back to the rollertowel on the door met emilys gaze her eyes were redrimmed although if she had been crying she was finished now dry grief the kind that hurt most and lasted longest i felt him go her voice was flat just stating facts a kind of burning that got so hot you couldnt stand any more then suddenly it cooled but hes not at peace yet can tell youve seen rita havent you george yes he replied i saw her but shes gone now and wont be coming back i see maybe she did what do we do now theyll still be looking for barry who will the police well they wont find him and in the end theyll stop looking another listed missing person except that before many days are out the whole of civilisation will have gone missing i pray that well make it to sekhetaaru in time the deathwatch was shorter than even i believed it would be now we have a lot to do and i must not be disturbed sheila must remain in the house to deal with any phone messages or callers she can tell them quite truthfully that mr and mrs brownlow have gone in search of their son he almost laughed at his own unfunny joke but it would have been a sacrilege i shall need your assistance emily and what we have to do will not be pleasant but it must be done what what are we going to do her voice was weak almost inaudible reminding him of the whimperings of the dying dalukah the deathwatchers have completed their task his words seemed to echo hollowly in the stifling atmosphere of the closed room and now it is the turn of the bodywatchers chapter fifteen the unborn sheilas rage had simmered as she lay on her bed a buildup of frustration that was unable to come to a head and burst like a blind boil agony that it was impossible to alleviate a child in a tantrum determined to spite itself masochism an inexplicable helplessness she wanted adrian she needed him here right now because he would not have pandered to dads obsessions or would he it was impossible to tell all her life she had rebelled but suddenly when it mattered most she was giving in being swept along by a tide which she had suddenly given up fighting run away no that was impossible like she was physically chained here suddenly she was having to obey her father she shuddered his eyes that was what it was similar to those of that amulet down in the dugout you didnt want to look into them but you had to and when you did you were glad as well as frightened in some ways it was a sexual experience like the first time she had let adrian do anything to her resistance at first that grew weaker reluctant enjoyment that escalated into sheer ecstasy and when you hit your climax you were a trembling slave to an overwhelming burning passion and youd do it again and again even though you knew that youd end up pregnant dad the amulet did the same sort of thing to you you were frightened but it was thrilling little shivers running up and down your spine seeking excitement of some kind but you didnt know what curiosity hooked on some strange mindblowing drug that sapped you mentally and physically robbed you of everything except that unknown desire if only dad would agree to adrian coming here to join them to be with them at this triumphant yet terrifying time a breathtaking thought that was interrupted by a sudden stabbing pain in her abdomen which had her clenching her fists stiffening almost screaming out aloud her unborn child writhing in agony that was akin to orgasmic ecstasy groaning as she remembered that night when adrian had first taken her feeble protests which echoed emily brownlows warnings girls who do those sort of things find themselves with babies which they dont want i do want it she clutched at her stomach thought she felt a movement from within tiny hands and feet trying to batter their way out but that was impossible because it was too early a sudden contraction as though she had gone into labour you must bear the child of a commoner because fate has decreed it you cannot alter destiny she stared apprehensively around the bedroom thought for a moment that her father had sneaked in had whispered his contempt hissed it like she thought she had heard that repulsive twoheaded snake hiss once it was all in her imagination nevertheless it was so real she lay there trembling felt the pains dying away her eyes closed and she became drowsy her thoughts flitting from one thing to another barry was going to die they all knew that but somehow it wasnt so terrible as she had at first thought it wouldnt be like ritas funeral the body sliding down that ramp to be burned destroyed forever they would keep barry he would always be with them she didnt know how but he would because nobody knew where he was dad had dug a special kind of family grave and when their time came they would all be together if only adrian could join them before the inevitable nuclear war broke out the room seemed very much darker she struggled to open her eyes the curtains had been drawn to try and keep out the heat but perhaps it had clouded over outside like good friday now what made her think of that she found herself looking at the alarm clock on the dresser but she was unable to discern the figures and the hands appeared to have lost their luminous glow a feeling of depression utter hopelessness then for one fleeting instance she saw a face it did not seem to have a body appeared to float in the air up towards the ceiling features which she recognised instantly barry sheila sat up made a despairing clutching movement towards him mouthing soundless words dont go barry dont leave us no answering smile his expression one of sheer terror as though he fought against some invisible force which was trying to pull him back his lips moved but it was all a mime of some kind a warning which he was trying to shout but his vocal chords were not functioning for some reason a desperate struggle between brother and sister but there was some barrier between them which denied them contact forbade them to speak to each other anguished eyes barry was becoming fainter a slide show which has suddenly been destroyed by harsh lighting a mirage fading as you approached it then it was gone she could move now standing up on the bed groping the air but finding nothing sobbing sinking back down on the cover she lay there for some time numbed and frightened it was as though barry had been on his way somewhere a brief final farewell and a warning that she did not understand that was the most terrifying aspect of all and she knew without any doubt that her brother had died after a time she got up let herself out on to the landing the house was hot and silent and she could hear flies buzzing crazily on the windows only the double glazing prevented her from hearing the grasshoppers outside revolting things almost as bad as the frogs their multitudes increasing daily her mother was still in the kitchen wheres dad she knew but she had to say something out there i dont know when hell be coming back im going to talk to him dont emily brownlows features were even more pallid than usual i dont think you should go down there barrys dead an emotionless matteroffact statement how how did you know that emily half started up out of her chair but slumped back a mixture of fatigue and despair i just know mum thats why i have to talk to dad he wont like being disturbed hes begun the bodywatch i see she didnt really understand but her confused brain could not cope with explanations i dont think hell mind barry certainly wont i wont be long anyway sheila she was almost at the door when emily spoke again cant you tell me nobody tells me anything its about adrian she dropped her gaze felt suddenly guilty i thought that well im having his baby and i think he ought to be here with us youll have to ask your father not angry just noncommittal it all depends on him like everything else these days we have to obey him now you know its our only chance sheila went outside closed the door behind her it seemed hotter than ever there werent many insects on the lawn they had probably withdrawn to the meagre shade offered by the shrubberies the lawn was sharp to her bare feet but she ignored it and went straight across to the shelter she hesitated at the top of the steps suddenly afraid to descend the place had an atmosphere like a church prior to the start of a service you were late and hoped that nobody noticed creeping furtively inside suddenly wanting to cough and fighting to control it guilty because god was in here everybody praying with their eyes tightly shut in case they caught sight of him civilisation was just a race of controlled puppets everybody had to obey something or somebody who is it george brownlows voice terse greeted her from down below a weird echo what do you want its me sheila what do you want i i wanted to talk to you dad silence as though he was thinking it over taking his time reaching a difficult decision then youd better come on down she descended nervously wishing now that she had not come seeing barrys face again trying to lipread that stark vision vainly attempting to interpret that warning she reached the bottom turned and almost screamed at first she thought that it was not her father instead some impostor who hadnt got the likeness quite right the thick head of hair had completely disappeared just a dark stubble on a shaven skull flushed cheeks that gave the impression of burning with some fever dilated pupils that were not wholly caused by the thick lenses overall more imposing more frightening and when he spoke she knew that it was george brownlow who stood before her for some reason he had shaved his head this is the place of the dead tones that boomed it is vital that this body is watched over you too will have to take your turn sheila for eventually i shall have to sleep but not just yet now what is it you want to speak to me about nothing frivolous at a time like this i hope she almost turned and ran possibly she would have fled had not her fathers gaze held her rendered her a prisoner down here by the sheer projection of his own willpower i i was wondering if well it would be nice if adrian could join us dad after all i am carrying his baby she winced expected an outburst found her eyes drawn towards a still form on the camp bed barrys naked body and stamped on his features was that same look of anguish which she had seen in her vision that warning frozen on his dead lips george brownlow fell silent pursed his lips a few moments of deep concentration his eyes never leaving her the whole time yes he smiled mirthlessly in fact i think we shall need him why had it not occurred to me before dalukah and her child albeit an unborn one but we cannot appease destiny without abaaner can we amazement and suspicion registered on sheilas face words of apparent madness yet they carried the message which she had not expected to hear in her wildest imagination you may go and fetch him sheila i i could telephone no brownlows shaven head was thrust forward that you must not do go and meet him secretly and lead him here after darkness do you understand she didnt but she nodded her head all the same such a concession by her parents was not to be spoiled by further argument over petty matters good go and get adrian tonight now leave me to my task she turned away gave one last glance back down into the interior as she reached the steps three expressions which seemed to be focused on her the amulet an inanimate thing which was fired by some kind of inner force now had its four eyes glowing lustfully her fathers had narrowed into a look of cunning and barry brownlows staring eyes which still blazed their warning except that she could not interpret the message dead orbs screaming at her when she reached the surface she scrabbled in panic to open the door broke into a run once she was outside but she knew she would go back down there soon and she would take adrian with her together they would embark upon a bodywatch adrians unease slowly infiltrated the euphoria of receiving a telephone call from sheila there was definitely something odd going on he decided as he made his way into the big recreation park it was almost dusk the atmosphere humid after what surely must have been the hottest day on record and tomorrow would be even hotter an air of desertion the playground empty all the children having gone home to the discomfort of stifling bedrooms a courting couple on one of the benches beneath the big chestnut trees the girl swatting at relentless clouds of midges the climax to their evening turning into an anticlimax adrian paused glanced about him nobody else in sight he checked his watch ten oclock he was a quarter of an hour early fretting like he had on that first date with sheila here the same nervousness except that now anxiety had crept in so odd that phone call that had hauled him from the very depths of his depression he could recall almost every word of it it had fetched him in from the garden where he had been lying in a small square of shade cast by a length of precarious council fencing the bleeping of a call box the person at the other end having to put a ten pence coin in again because it had passed right through without connecting the line and in that split second before she spoke hed known it was sheila adrian yes i now listen and for the moment just answer yes or no are your parents within earshot no theyre down at uncle freds good that makes it very much easier i want you to meet me this evening in the park at tenfifteen down at the bottom end by the lake where we met the first time we went out together you remember dont you yes of course i do now this is bloody silly as if i wouldnt remember and anyway whats wrong with you coming here even if i cant come to your place because your mum thinks im common ill be there she hold on now dont want you to tell a soul where youre going dyou understand sure if you insist i do can you get out of the house before your mum and dad get back they wont be back till eleven theyre all going to the farmhouse for a meal because its auntie glads birthday and you and i could have gone as well then that makes it even easier be there at tenfifteen its very important count on me and the receiver was dropped back leaving him with just the dialling tone a sound like angry insects swarming that could turn into imaginary noises in the head if he didnt take a grip on himself his first reaction was a sense of unparalleled ecstasy he wanted to run back out into the garden to yell out to the whole estate shes phoned met im meeting her tonight everythings going to be ok but he didnt because everything wasnt ok he tried to work it all out logically sheila was pregnant so she needed him her folks wouldnt have him there so she had to meet him out somewhere adrian had not informed his own parents of sheilas plight yet and maybe she didnt want him to but it would all come out in the end anyway and what the hell did it matter if they knew where he was going tonight he shook his head in perplexity maybe she was panicking wanted him to run away somewhere with him not that he was bothered about that hed go he didnt have a job no ties and all he wanted in life was sheila brownlow it was getting dark that courting couple had gone and he had the park to himself perhaps this was all some joke designed to pile on the heartbreak sheila hated him because he had taken her virginity given her a child shed thrust the knife into his guts now she was about to twist it tug it about have you no i dont yes i do no i dont adrian he jumped stared into the shadows cast by the huge chestnut trees his heart missed a beat his stomach churned it was sheila all right her pale skin showing up in the gloom dressed only in a bikini amazement a faint sense of arousal over which he had no control wanting to run to her fling himself prostrate at her feet im glad you came adrian she sank back on to the grassy bank stretched herself out like she had that first time here when they had sat and talked eagerly fantasising about a future which had all come to nothing i was worried in case you didnt turn up you knew i would he lowered himself down beside her god i wouldnt have broken this date for anything subservient humbling himself putting himself at a disadvantage but why why here and all this secrecy she was staring at the saffron sky above an expression on her face as though she had not heard him was suddenly divorced from this place lips moving mouthing soundless words that he tried to catch by leaning over her and failed she are you ok she sighed loudly im pregnant nearer than even i dreamed my time is approaching thats silly you cant have missed more than one period your figures still superb and does it still excite you she turned her head and her eyes seemed to narrow boring into him searching out his innermost thoughts her whole bearing having matured decades since he had last seen her yes he gulped could feel himself becoming aroused made one halfhearted effort to check himself because there were more important issues at stake transfixed momentary unease that turned into an overpowering urge her body so sensuous just the same as it had always been and nobody but himself had ever lain on top of it picked up its rhythm and shuddered with it to unbelievable peaks of sheer ecstasy sheila brownlow laughed a staccato unfamiliar sound that sent a little shiver up his spine in spite of the heat almost a snarl like a shebeast playacting some rigmarole in the mating season that was all part of natures unexplained courtships her hand came up flipped behind her shoulder blades in a deft movement an elasticated twang that had the bikinistraps slackening the cups slipping from firm aroused nipples flaunting them at him again her movements were so perfectly coordinated the downward sweep of both hands taking the brief lower garment with them tossing it nonchalantly aside naked so alluring so commanding eyes that had him wilting with a thousand inexplicable inhibitions that had not existed previously with trembling fingers and arms that had suddenly weakened he tugged at his damp tshirt somehow got it over his head fumbled at the fastener on his frayed jeans felt something tear and then it came free unable to remove his gaze from hers almost overbalancing as he got free of the denims stood there a naked trembling servant in a state of full arousal she came to her feet in one lithe movement stood there arms akimbo breasts swaying delightfully from side to side so sensual and powerful he found himself sinking back as though physically pushed down into the sharp dry grass lying there on his back and watching her approach a brief moment of terror stabbing into his heart for this beautiful seductress was far removed from the young supermarket girl he had seduced aeons ago she stood astride him legs wide forcing him to stare up into the blackness between moist flesh that was bathed in shadow a temptress sapping every last vestige of willpower that remained in him i want you adrian she whispered for you are my abaaner my lover we have been separated for so long and perhaps this is our last chance to be together for eternity he nodded swallowed did not understand only that she would not leave him now because she needed him you will come with me wherever i go yes i will i promise good her body sank down so lightly so weightlessly on top of him that he was not aware of physical contact until he felt her warm moistness swallowing him up she leaned forward slightly supported herself by gripping his shoulders her lower half beginning to gyrate he closed his eyes but he could still see her the purposeful movements the rhythm which he strove to match two bodies in unison hers a silent domination except for a slight quickening of her breathing his own breath coming in gulps his hands brushed aside when they instinctively groped for her as though her smooth milky flesh was sacred guilt because he could not get their past matings out of his mind the sordidness of love on the floor of a council house livingroom the lust of that night when the frogs of the river had come to lobby their own contempt and now amends must be made a new love had to be born in the same way that sheila would give birth to a child amid the ancient pestilences which had returned to plague mankind adrians mind and body became engulfed in a storm of passion that destroyed all else trivial thoughts and past fantasies were obliterated his very soul seeming to be sucked from him in that final eruption the mindblowing ejaculation that had him flaying his limbs frantically and then reduced him to a trembling nothingness sheila was moving about retrieving her scattered twopiece and clipping the bra back into place with an expertise that had an air of finality almost abruptness about it he crawled searched for his tshirt and jeans wondering if he had the strength to put them on humiliation knowing that she watched his every movement but enjoying it oh dalukah i am your servant and your lover now where the devil had he heard that name before wed better be going her voice was soft a whisper in the darkness where to his garments were damp with sweat and he half wondered if it would have been ok to leave them off in the dark clothing was yet another way of pandering to convention back to our place she took his hand a firmness that would not be denied an order which he must obey a courting couple going home now that their lovemaking was over tired bodies that needed each other for support the girl the stronger of the two she dominated now just as she would in future years a seductress who had had her way and would continue to do so youre sure you didnt say anything to your folks about where you were going and who you were meeting there was an implication of reprimand in sheila brown lows voice a veiled accusation how could i when they were already out when you phoned and probably arent even back yet he answered anyway does it really matter if they know we cannot tolerate outside interference at this stage she spoke haughtily you and i must share what lies ahead a chance to repair a past failure perhaps before long you will understand adrian his brain could not cope he made no attempt to figure out the seemingly unending riddles in which she spoke suffice that they were together nothing else mattered if she left him again he would kill himself for there would be nothing else to live for wherever she went he would follow blindly unquestioningly right or wrong in sanity or madness all the same he experienced a sense of foreboding when they came into sight of number twelve river view some instinct deep inside him had his step faltering almost drawing back but she tightened her grip and tugged him forward with her he made no further move to resist even when they walked down the drive of the brownlow household went through the side gate and entered a parched land that seemed to be cut off from the rest of the world where the insects played an incessant mournful symphony of death a wilderness of no return chapter sixteen ancient rites adrian followed sheila down the steps and into the dank bowels of the shelter the mustiness which had greeted them at the top turning thick with a stench that had him fighting not to retch recoiling when he saw the body the colour draining from his features trying to turn his head away but it was irresistibly drawn back to that still form on the campbed barry brownlows skin seemed to have darkened almost a semitropical complexion but not quite a kind of discoloration like meat that was starting to go had how how long has he been dead adrian capper barely recognised his own voice a hoarse whisper that echoed in the stillness of this chamber like the grating of insects somewhere behind the lines of shelving today she answered him emotionlessly sometime this afternoon i dont know exactly but but he began to stammer a habit which he thought he had conquered in his early teens you you cant keep him here why not well its against the law what law he swallowed hard so confused now frightened too it is according to the law of the ancient ones sheilas lips moved uttered words beyond her own comprehension but she spoke them fluently the deathwatch has been completed now we must mount the bodywatch until it is time for the ancient rites father has taken his turn and now the watch must be changed i must go and rest you must take the next watch adrian his senses reeled and he clutched at a section of dexion for support his whole body beginning to quiver with a mounting terror no he wasnt going to be left down here alone with with that this hellhole had become a tomb you must and you shall her voice was low menacing i have brought you here so that you shall be with us all when the end comes now you are objecting to a small but vital duty betraying us all in our hour of need again his resistance slipped away and he knew that he had no choice other than to obey he nodded tried to avert his gaze from her scathing stare but something else caught it held it a doubleheaded snake that flicked its fangs malevolently sent his brain reeling again you will obey she was gone he hadnt heard her go but when he looked round there was no sign of her he was all alone his fear was bordering on panic the urge to flee but he knew he couldnt he was a prisoner as surely as if he had been shackled and chained to the wall once more he glanced at that amulet but it was still an inanimate object that neither moved nor glowed he tried to tell himself that it had all been a trick of the light but he knew he lied death something he had feared throughout his life partly because it had always been treated as taboo at home you didnt talk about it soandso had passed away or gone never died adrian felt sick he had never seen a corpse before not quite that time a few years ago when that accident had happened on the junction of the estate and the main road hed been first on the scene had screamed at what hed witnessed but nobody appeared to have heard him at least nobody ever mentioned it a motorcyclist travelling at speed had gone into a van that had pulled out without looking the biker had been catapulted up into the air almost vertically had come down head first on the tarmac oh jesus christ the poor sod couldnt have been anything else but dead there and then although the newspaper report had said that the lad was found to be dead on arrival at hospital adrian had hoped fervently that the guy had still been alive when theyd put him in the ambulance because that way he wouldnt have been looking at a corpse a crumpled bloodwashed virtually headless object which adrian had tried to tell himself was mostly blankets that they had wrapped the victim in so that you couldnt really see what was what deep down though he knew had woken up sweating several nights later after a dream in which he had seen a face spouting and coughing blood trying to scream but the thick scarlet fluid had reduced those horrific yells to choking gurgles but this was far worse death a stark silent motionless reality the same barry that he had helped tinker with motorbikes those goodnatured smiling features reduced to to something else adrian wanted to look away but he couldnt dead orbs watched him that was impossible any second now those lips would move say something the youth clapped his hands to his ears because he didnt want to hear for gods sake shut up youre supposed to be dead your duty here is that of a body watcher he whirled round but there was nobody there just the amulet a polished metal lifeless thing turning back to the corpse seeing that expression again lips frozen into words that had never been uttered eyes that mirrored a terror which even death could not destroy a mute warning flee before it is too late cant im a prisoner here just like you but youre the lucky one because whatever they do to you it wont hurt those eyes seemed to bulge as though they were filling up with some invisible fluid bubbles that would surely burst before long bodywatching you sat there with the dead for company guarding a corpse to make sure it didnt what a movement had adrian flinching cringing as something flicked against his ear and this time he managed a terrified gasp which turned to a grunt of temporary relief just a fly a huge bloated bluebottle which must have got in from up above possibly seeking refuge from the heat so precise landing on barry brownlows upturned face squatting there seeing adrian and almost taking off again so alert so wary so revolting adrian capper felt anger towards it hated it for its contempt of the dead an idea crossed his mind to swat at it but he dismissed it almost immediately hit or miss his hand would slap on dead human flesh make a sound like a fillet of wet cod being dropped in an empty sink the squashed fly blood and excreta smeared across the dead face he nearly threw up just watched the insect wondering what it was going to do halfguessed it began to crawl a purposeful reconnaissance across an eye down the bridge of the nose watching him all the time it paused by the nostrils made a halfhearted attempt to squeeze itself inside but the cavity was too small and it withdrew hesitating as though it was rethinking its intended plan then it saw the halfopen mouth and moved quickly eagerly across the upper lip back along the lower one hesitated again deliberately mocking its audience tantalising the lone watcher dont you bloody dare dont you go but the bluebottle was already inside the mouth lost to adrians view his stomach churned oh god he could hear it buzzing away somewhere inside feeding time passed just an incessant drone which was playing on his nerves his eyes riveted on barrys face the agony the revulsion there was no mistaking it that mouth doing its utmost to move and spew the intruder out another movement much slower this time a shape that shambled in an ungainly crablike manner coming out of the shadows on the floor scaling a leg of the campbed with ease hauling itself up on to the dead body via a stiff outstretched foot a creature that dwarfed the bluebottle a thousand times more repulsive as it became motionless watching adrian almost challenging him a spider shudders convulsed his body he had always had a fear of spiders so much so that in early infancy his mother had had to stop reciting little miss muffet to him because he had had gone into a screaming fit each time he heard it now he cringed again would have fled if it had been physically possible the spider was a big one bigger than any he had ever seen before it had a face too and if you looked long and hard enough you thought you saw a similarity between insect and amulet the eyes it was mocking him he sensed it began to cringe his mouth dry and his bottom lip trembling for one awful second he thought it was going to come towards him then suddenly the spider seemed to lose interest in him and moved on an upward course that took it over the flaccid genitals as though its route was an intended insult to the dead it did not look back it knew that the sole spectator to its ramblings would not intervene because he was afraid of it the buzzing of the bluebottle was fainter as though it had gone deeper into the body and adrian capper tensed as he saw the spider pull itself up on to those lips pause a moment as though trying to determine which inner route its intended prey had taken then it too was gone scuttling across the halfprotruding tongue until it was lost to sight adrian sat there in that same chair which george brownlow had occupied for the latter part of the day hands clasped to his ears in a futile attempt to shut out that awful buzzing trying to prevent his bemused brain from visualising the grim game of hideandseek which was going on deep inside barry he didnt want to hear to see something hot and sharp burned the back of his throat and he hiccoughed bile but no way could he shut out that revolting insect sound louder more persistent as though the bluebottle was screaming with terror then without warning it stopped the silence seemed to come at him in a wave of nausea knowing full well what had happened inside there just as he had known that day what was the fate of that motorcyclist death in its most horrible form strong spider jaws munching and squelching on a helpless body dribbling bluebottle blood down barry brownlows lungs the stench of putrefaction was much stronger again adrian retched at the thought would have vomited had he eaten that day but lately food had become of minor importance to him just watching those dead lips seeing them strain as though they too were going to throw up and then the spider came back into view looking even more bloated than before this time it did not linger a shambling multilegged thing that took the quickest route to the floor and scuttled back beneath the dexion and the scorpions shall devour those who attempt to defile the bodies of sets own adrian capper hunched forward resigned himself to an eternity in this chamber of death for the vigil of a bodywatcher was surely a long one and no harm must befall the corpse which belonged to set for his vengeance was terrible to behold im afraid theres no trace of your son to date mrs brownlow detectiveinspector plant spoke to emily brownlow you always addressed the mother in cases of missing sons affected a sympathetic tone and didnt let on that thousands of people went missing every year and never turned up again mostly you found escapees from headfarms though because their movements were generally more predictable barry brownlow was obviously an exception oh dear emily closed her eyes principally because she didnt want to give anything away was afraid of making this policeman suspicious she hadnt cried yet maybe that would come later but somehow it wasnt like losing a son they still had him and wherever he was going they would soon be going there too she had long resigned herself to that inevitable fact im surprised he hasnt rung you or tried some form of contact plants gaze shifted to george brownlow thought jesus christ this buggers queer too shaving his head like a bloody mohican or maybe hes got nits the whole damned familys ninepence for a shilling if you ask me perhaps he will emily had her head back and was intent on staring up at the ceiling anything so she didnt have to look at that damned policeman he was a loner as a child never seemed to need our company youve got a girl too havent you yes george brownlow cut in half afraid what emily might say im afraid shes taken it rather badly since barry was admitted to shelderton shes asleep upstairs in her room it is rather late you know of course the inspector stood up and picked up his hat it must be a trying time for all of you anyway ill be getting along now and as soon as we have any news ill contact you in other words dont ring us well ring you maybe it looks like the kids scarpered and put as much distance between himself and shelderton as possible theres definitely something odd about the whole family well with luck we shant be hearing from him again george brownlow muttered after the policeman had left in fact theres nobody likely to trouble us from now on we shall be busy and we dont want to be disturbed he went through into the kitchen and emily followed him wondering mildly to herself why her husband had torn most of her best linen into fourinch wide strips had rolled them up like bandages why he had sorted out a selection of carving knives and tupperware bowls with snapon airtight lids and why he had meticulously shaved his head even taken his eyebrows off so that he looked like some comicbook caricature except that there was nothing humorous about him there were an awful lot of things she pondered on these days but she kept her thoughts to herself because it was not her place to speak out she had been wrong to do so in the past but hopefully george had forgiven her even her thoughts might not be her own for georges eyes had become much more penetrating and powerful and that was not an illusion caused by the removal of his bushy brows you could feel them boring into you making you weak and wanting to please him to obey him like that metal snake thing down in the temple yes it was a temple because you got a sort of churchfeeling when you went down there wanted to humble yourself felt guilty about all sorts of things the need to worship a deity set and george was surely a disciple of set i need to rest george brownlow paused at the foot of the stairs bowed his head with weariness and sighed softly adrian will bodywatch through the night hours adrian sheila fetched him tonight something that had completely escaped me until today for we shall need him why what for he fixed her with a stare that had her backing away a pace her hand going up to her mouth as though to stifle a scream of terror are you not aware emily that we have a body on our hands and that there are ancient rites which must be carried out if our sons khaibit is to be able to cross over to sekhetaarul set has commanded it is waiting to receive him and we dare not keep the great one waiting i shall need your help sheilas and adrians too for they have an even greater part to play when that task is completed she watched him mount the stairs and only when she heard the bedroom door close behind him did she sink down on the bottom step and bury her face in her hands utter despair engulfed her shook her with sobs of sheer hopelessness for she knew that whatever george ordered her to do she would carry it out for she was his slave just as he was sets chapter seventeen the ritual of embalmment it was stiflingly hot down in the dugout emily and sheila huddling close together as though they sought refuge in each others closeness they stared at the naked corpse on its canvas bier adrian capper sitting silently beyond it a vague expression on his pallid features as though he did not understand what was happening blackringed eyes were evidence of a sleepless night his body bowed with weariness his eyelids lowered had to be forced open again seeing but not fully understanding george brownlow had constructed a trestle workbench adjacent to the campbed piling it high with the impedimenta which had occupied the kitchen table on the previous evening knives strips of bedsheets and plastic bowls he glanced at the amulet as though seeking a sign but the four eyes remained dull and lifeless the time was not right yet they must wait this was something which must not be rushed the stench of rotting flesh was overpowering george was on one knee by the bed he might have been praying to set his mind flipped to and fro a series of unrelated events that moved on before he could grasp them properly a news flash it might have been earlier today or yesterday or the day before a grimfaced newscaster who probably knew more than he had been instructed to say libya had issued its final warning to israel the mad colonel would go ahead whatever lies all lies george brownlows brain was numbed as though it had been injected with a mild local anaesthetic so far he had been guided by set a vision that had been indelibly imprinted on his mind at the time but which was beginning to fade bandages four containers of water to sprinkle around the corpse bowls for the intestines their removal was not repulsive to him in any way just a job which had to be done efficiently he did not doubt his capabilities as a boy he had gutted snared rabbits prepared them for the oven this would be the same but on a bigger scale nervousness because everything had to be done right and the sequence worried him the opening of the mouth and eyes they were open now perhaps he should close them he stretched out a hand the fingers trembled one second of revulsion but it passed one lid it moved easily like a minute shutter he wondered if it would spring back up but it didnt then the other now the mouth it was rigid immovable jaws that refused to budge a silly rather frightening thought suppose they snapped closed suddenly bit his fingers no barry wouldnt do that using two hands now trying to lever and push at the same time sweating cursing beneath his breath giving up it wouldnt move george sank back down to a kneeling position it was his own fault he should have closed the mouth immediately upon death now that part of the ceremony would have to be symbolic emily watched expressionlessly vaguely wondering what her husband was attempting to do it was all beyond her she regarded him steadily saw how his hairless cranium shone with sweat in the light cast by that dusty bulb just a pair of khaki shorts nothing else hed even removed his sandals his body looked so much more lithe and muscular than she had ever known it perhaps all that digging had done him good after all it had certainly removed that spare tyre which always bulged around his middle he looked so much younger and even handsome so capable that you no longer felt frightened down here because he was in command those snake eyes werent glowing anymore perhaps they would not come alive again because george had taken over set had delegated to his new high priest sheila felt slightly sick and faint it was due to the heat and her condition she felt guilty real guilt for the first time a moment of weakness and temptation and she was pregnant out of wedlock now she saw the whole thing in perspective it was right what her mother had constantly drummed into her she had let them down the brown lows had risen in the world a stroke of sheer luck a fortunate cross on a coupon had given them a new status a magnificent home in an executive area and she had to go and grovel back in the council estates her eyes misted burned with tears that wouldnt come it was all adrians fault and she hated him for it edged a few inches further away from him he had persuaded her to have sex she hadnt really wanted to hadnt enjoyed it one little bit and now she was paying the price for her folly her place was here with her family adrian was an outsider a commoner he had no right to be in here with them yet suddenly dad had wanted him here they were all going to die civilisation had but a few more days perhaps hours left her baby would never be born anyway oh god she wanted to die now and wipe out her shame adrian glanced sideways wondered if sheila was all right were any of them all right inner panic trying to work out why he couldnt just walk out of here take sheila with him it was as though some strange compulsion to stay gripped him a sort of mental state like morbid curiosity wondering what the hell old brownlow was going to do the bugger was breaking the law could get put away for messing about with a corpse like this and jesus how that body was stinking it was going bad decomposing by the hour like corpses did in tropical countries where they had to be interred within a few hours of death there was something awful about barrys death it wasnt natural like ritas something to do with that research laboratory a bug which had escaped and the authorities were swearing that it wasnt contagious because they were covering up some kind of plague that could spread but they knew everybody was going to die within a few days so it didnt really matter he stretched out a hand to take sheilas but she stiffened shrugged him off christ this didnt make sense she had fetched him here said she needed him and now he was being rejected but he still couldnt leave he something was happening the light flickered dimmed so that those around him were merely silhouettes they might have been statues a kind of fiery glow was replacing the harsh artificial light coming from those four serpent eyes set had slumbered and now he was awake tiny jewelled pinpoints that scintillated saw in all directions at once adrian felt their force a kind of gammaray that burned into you had you wanting to mumble your subservience to a living god knew that there was nowhere you could hide george brownlow was on his feet leaning across the corpse muttering incoherent incantations doing something to the eyes gently pushing the lids back so that barry stared up at the ceiling once more pulling at the jaw a click that made you wince the mouth seemed wider than before and he was attempting to stuff that lolling tongue back inside but it flopped out again like a dead snake he had some kind of glass vessel in his hands a sort of miniature decanter was sprinkling liquid all around and over the naked body still muttering a smell strong but pleasant trying to overcome the stench of putrefaction adrian sniffed recognised it perfume musk sheila used it when they went out together it brought back memories her beautiful naked body stretched out on the carpet of a council house livingroom floor trembling with nervousness his own insistence doing things to her which made her agree to go the whole way selfishness that had got her a child had ended in all this guilt those tiny red eyes had singled him out his thoughts were no longer his own did it deliberately i confess i got her pregnant so that she would be mine so that nobody could take her away from me george and emily brownlow were staring at him now accusing you little bastard you dared to do that to our daughter she has conceived by a commoners sperm youll pay the full penalty for thist along with her for you are both guilty his lips moved in a mute incomprehensible apology pleading for both of them but there was no mercy in those expressions george brownlow was moving again arms upraised facing set the temple has been made pure he muttered we are ready now to help the dead one on his journey to sekhetaarul adrian tensed felt a rush of air like a dry desert wind whipping his face with particles of sand threw up his hands to protect himself but no way could he shut out those penetrating eyes of fire then the gust was gone and it was calm again george brownlows features were tense his glasses reflecting the fiery glow of the amulet his expression fearsome are we all here a booming deafening voice speak to your kherheb let him know that you are present sem priest do you hear me another rush of hot desert air that seemed to whisper i hear you kherheb sem yes adrians lips moved he heard his own voice somewhere far away a frightening experience a sensation as though his whole being had been taken over sameref tcherauurand tcherausherautt we hear you kherheb a whispered chorus that came from everywhere yet nowhere in particular menhu the slaughterer a reply that came in george brownlows own tones yet his lips did not move amasi and amkhent a distant rumble which might have been thunder outside slowly dying away the metal shelving vibrating the shelter darkened temporarily and then the dull red glow came back we are all here george turned back towards the amulet began sprinkling more strongsmelling perfume the temple and the dead one are now purified and i am ready to begin adrian felt his bowels move his stomach muscles tighten into a hard ball tasted bile in his mouth oh christ he guessed what brownlow was about to do anticipated it even before the long knifeblade scintillated redly he didnt want to look didnt want to hear but he had no choice steel sank into that flat abdomen squelched and grated on bone you could almost see the vile vapours of rotting intestines rising up their stench a physical body that spread out and came at you a deep incision the kherhebs hands pulling at slippery offal stringing it into one of the tupperware bowls clicking the airtight lid shut more intestines yards of them another bowl filled adrian wasnt trying to hold his vomit back any longer spewed bile down the front of his tshirt still compelled to watch as george brownlow dug and hacked for the dead heart sets priest worked steadily and competently as emotionlessly as a doctor carrying out a postmortem examination transferring the severed heart to a separate small container then looking to the amulet to seek its approval the light brightened dimmed again almost immediately as though the watchers had been afforded a brief glimpse of the mutilations and now they must see no more adrian managed a glance at the two women they were watching emotionlessly hypnotically and there was no sign of the revulsion which he felt he wanted to scream dont you understand what hes doing to your brother your son you cant embalm him because hes decomposing already with some vile disease that were all going to die of but he didnt because that feeling of guilt came back again as though it was all his own fault i ought to be lying there being gutted because i deserve it your time will come george brownlow was struggling with the swathings strips of linen becoming entangled and having to be unravelled beginning with the feet one leg then the other up on to the torso something gurgled followed by a long expel la lion of air as though the corpse still clung to a vestige of life now only the head remained features still transfixed with that predeath terror still trying to shout that warning it was too late now because bandages were being bound tightly over the mouth pulled flat on to the contours of nose and forehead a mummy george brownlow stepped back to admire his handiwork but was interrupted by set a shaft of ruby light arrowing on to him a rebuke for his vanity may the dead one cross over to sekhetaaru and may we soon follow our son to the land of the dead george dropped to his knees uttered a sound which might just have been a sob let our son enter the kingdom of osiris silence two women fought to hold back their sorrow and one youth suffered the agonies of his own terror a feeling of hopelessness because he had been a part of all this struggling to retain what sanity remained to him we commit our son barry into the care of set george brownlows priestlike mumble that he may take him for his own in sekhetaaru and a scream cut through the semidarkness and the suffocating stench left by the disembowelment a shriek of unearthly fear that came from the depths of a tortured soul and there a yard or so above the crudely mummified thing the watchers saw the unmistakable head of barry brownlow hovering those same white agonised features only now the mouth moved spat out those words which had hitherto been frozen in death you fools wide eyes blazed hatred and remonstration do you realise what you have done to me you have transported my khaibit into the land of darkness beyond the void in which my beloved wanders and now i am an eternal slave of the doubleheaded serpent god who is known as set you have condemned us all to this because in your folly you did not address horus and thoth an angry hiss a flicking of venomous fangs and barry was fading trying to scream but it was no more than a dying whisper darkness emily and sheila were sobbing holding on to each other george brownlow was slumped against a chair silent with his own thoughts adrian just stared into the blackness his mind having failed to cope had become a void it needed to switch off and recharge the bulb came back to full power with stark reality revealed the true horrors of what had happened it was no nightmare the bandaged body a shape that only vaguely resembled human form a monstrous anonymity that was lifeless and soulless the stinking pots of offal beside it a gruesome token of ancient egyptian emulation the room reeking with the stench of a longforgotten plague which terminated in gangrene and death the amulet slept metallidded eyes that needed to rest after their exertions the snake mouths smug and gloating a thing that had fed and was temporarily contented george brownlow looked at each of them in turn with huge distorted eyes behind the thick lenses his lips curled in contempt when his gaze finally rested on adrian capper this is all your doing boy and yours he glanced at the cringing sheila between you you have brought plagues and death to this land and it is not finished yet the suffering and strife has only just begun dont dont you think we should go back to the house george emily spoke weakly you and i yes he laughed a malicious sound that had adrian cringing again for we must wait again until the time is right until set is ready and menhu the slaughterer for dalukah and the commoner abaaner must pay the penalty for their betrayal the wheel of fate has turned another full circle adrian watched them go heard the outer door grating being forced shut he stared at sheila saw her glance away there were a lot of things he wanted to say but this was neither the time nor the place and he doubted his physical capability of being able to put them into words the two of them were trapped in here as surely as if george brownlow had locked them in a dungeon they had witnessed the fate of barry the living decomposition the agony of afterdeath now it was their turn and set would keep them waiting until he was ready to call upon menhu the slaughterer chapter eighteen dalokahs child alone in a tomb that reeked of gangrene and death a plague that still lived and devoured the flesh of a mummified body watched over by an amulet that slumbered but could come to life at any moment and if it did it was terrible to behold adrian forced his brain to work a machine that grated and stuttered threatened to cut out facts first a combination of coincidences the drought had brought the frogs and the grasshoppers an odd locust or two nothing to get excited about in due course the rains would come and everything would revert to normal unless the americans blasted that missile ship to kingdomcome in the meantime but in all these crises somebody backed down started a long session of talks that eventually ended in some sort of compromise but down here in the temple there would be no compromises george had let his obsessions get the better of him and that was where reality ended all this was tied up with some powerful ancient curse that had come over from egypt with those mummies which an old clergyman had buried right here somewhere in the garden of number twelve river view and adrian had got caught up in it all escalating madness that had led to a corpse being mutilated and subjected to mummification rites there was no knowing what was going to happen to himself and sheila if they didnt get out of here fast he looked at the amulet again just a bit of metal it couldnt hurt you on its own all this business was some kind of hypnotic influence engendered by george brownlow and if you let it get to you it was like a psychic force controlling you it was all in the mind adrian capper decided sheila was sitting on the floor her back resting against some shelves loaded with canned foodstuffs eyes closed she might even be asleep so exhausted by recent events that she would submit to anything her father came up with she at first he thought she hadnt heard him then her eyes slowly opened regarded him with a vague expression looked as though they might close again she didnt speak she we have to get away from here we cant yes we can weve been hypnotised but i think ive shaken the effects off now let me help you a mental struggle fighting all the way sheer exhaustion threatening to swamp him your dads crazy hell kill us both your mum as well no a hoarse cry a flicker of terror in her eyes we have betrayed them once we dare not risk it youre coming with me tightlipped he took a step towards her swayed slightly as a wave of dizziness hit him and in that instant she moved with incredible speed a bound from her sitting position that took her across the room as far as the bed on which the mummy lay grabbed something and brandished it above her head that longbladed knife which george brownlow had used to disembowel his own son a string of entrails still adhering to it dont be a fool adrian checked his advance backed off a couple of steps ill kill you if you come any closer a hiss that was reminiscent of that foul serpent ll swear it he took a deep breath knew that she meant it all right if you wont come then you wont come and i cant do anything about it but im leaving right now while i still can im going to get help im going to bring the police back here and i just pray that ill be in time before that crazy father of yours does anything else she lowered the knife held it at hip level poised and ready to strike but she made no move towards him she didnt speak didnt need to because the expression in her eyes said everything her hatred for him because of what he had done and what he was about to do a fanatical gleam in those pale blue orbs which might have belonged to george brownlow himself adrian capper backed towards the steps watching her the whole time fearing a sudden rush forward and a frenzied attempt to stop him leaving but she did not move he reached the steps turned moved quickly almost ran up them the door oh god hed almost made it once he was outside they wouldnt be able to stop him hed run all the way to that telephone kiosk at the far end of river view dial tell the police what had happened to the missing barry brownlow then his fingers had closed over the latch were in the act of lifting it when he heard sheilas scream a sound that seemed to come up from the very bowels of the earth an embodiment of the ultimate in physical pain and mental stress a cry that died away to a dull groan then a thud the unmistakable noise of a falling body for a second or so adrians brain was fogged again seemed to cut out and prevent him from thinking clearly an inbuilt device by nature which spared him blinding mental agony then he was turning back holding on to the rail with trembling hands descending those steps knowing in his heart what he was going to find in her desperation sheila brownlow had taken her own life his mind almost snapped at the scene which greeted him she lay there writhing groaning clutching at her stomach the knife lay beside her an instrument of death and mutilation which had claimed yet another victim in the name of set despair panic an instinctive desire to pick up the weapon plunge it into his own heart that way they would both die together deprive menhu the slaughterer of his liked with their dead bodies but sheila brownlow wasnt dead yet moaning softly gripping her abdomen rolling from side to side he grasped her wrists pulled them away anticipated an ugly gash pumping her lifes blood away instead there was nothing no wound no mark no tear in her tightfitting jeans shock turned to anger you little bitch he breathed it was a trick to stop me from adrians words died away there was no doubting her expression the pallor on the screwedup features the way she shuddered and whimpered eyes closed as though she was on the brink of unconsciousness desperately ill he knelt over her shook her gently she sheila what is it adrian the convulsions steadied her clammy fingers clutched at him adrian ive gone into labour contractions im going to to have the baby he stared in sheer amazement relief surging over him again suspicious that it might be a trick of some kind instinctively checked that the knife was not within her reach thats absolutely ridiculous a sudden desire to laugh his relief aloud youre nowhere near you cant possibly be having a baby yet i am she whispered oh god i am i know it i can feel it coming and at that very moment the bulb above them spluttered plunged the whole shelter into pitch darkness adrians first thought was that this was death the black nothingness into which barry and rita had been condemned to wander for eternity then he heard sheila moaning clawing at him calling for him im here my darling he experienced a moment of peace a lull in the strife until her fingernails gouged his arm and brought it all back again oh help me adrian its starting to come fast helpless unable to see not knowing what to do even if he could do anything he knelt and slipped an arm beneath her he tensed she felt somehow different her clothing instead of blouse and jeans was soft and silky voluminous so that it flopped and fell away from him beneath it he felt her nakedness a belly that was suddenly rounded and moving her body shuddering in the latter spasms of labour that smell it was no longer putrefying more of a dusty dryness like somewhere that had been shut up for years strange surroundings but he could not see them only sensed them she was crying softly murmuring her love for him gasping at the sharp pains and even as he knelt there trying to comfort her he became aware of a difference about himself his own clothing gone were the tshirt and jeans in their place a skin of some kind a furry garment that enveloped his body down as far as his thighs a tail flapping in his wake this was all sheer madness the room was growing lighter but not from the suspended electric light bulb above them rather a faint red glow that was becoming brighter all the time four tiny pinpoints of fire giving out an ethereal radiance like a rising sun showing itself gradually above an eastern horizon adrian cried out aloud as he saw his surroundings for the first time in this strange illumination the shelter but all the shelves had gone just four bare walls with strange pictures and designs painted on them and in the centre of the floor stood a raised coffin an identical smaller one beneath it frightened he looked slowly around in a recess almost hidden by the shadows stood another coffin much larger than the other two cold fear clutched at his heart but he still kept looking of course the amulet would be here because it was impossible to escape from it four burning serpent eyes that lighted this chamber the snake body seeming more polished burnished and glistening beside it stood a carved head a black shiny skull the size of a tennis ball with a start he recognised it remembered where he had seen it before the castle museum so strange that he should remember it those obsidian features sinister in the halflight forbidding as though they resented his presence here a kind of guardian of the amulet though surely set needed no keeper adrian saw but he did not understand during those moments of blackness it was as if he had been transported to another place another chamber where everything was so old and sheila he stiffened wondered for a moment if it was indeed her her hair was longer several shades darker her skin dry and cracking as though desert sand was ingrained in it she wore a long flowing yellowish garment her stomach ballooning up into it quivering with the strain of an impending childbirth but it was sheila all right help me abaaner she whispered managed a faint smile any minute now he nodded glanced down at himself rubbed at his bare arms and legs as though the duskier rougher texture of his skin might be removable some kind of dried greasepaint but it was real enough just as the worn and frayed leopard skin garment was the tail swinging and brushing against his legs he gave up trying to work it all out look abaaner look for a moment the girl seemed to forget her contractions snatched her hand free from him and pointed behind him see it is a sign from khepera he turned saw where she pointed a small black beetle scurrying across the floor checking darting one way then another like it was lost finally making it to the shadows where it was seen no more do you see it abaaner there was exultation in her tone oh surely you see it just a beetle it was no ordinary beetle that was a scarab did you not notice its rich metallic colours it has been sent here by khepera the god of creation a sign that a birth is nigh a new creation is imminent she broke off gave another gasp of pain it is here his mind was spinning and there was no time to think logically he must help her deliver the baby adrian grasped her dress tore it and tore it again strips and squares of material that would be needed soon water there was none he must manage without relying on an ageold instinct when man and his mate delivered their offspring in a barren cave and the children survived amid the filth she was pushing hard now straining and crying out gripping him and cutting into his flesh with long fingernails the baby he could see it hear it but he was afraid to touch it in case he injured it it seemed to be coming well its head was free but the tiny features were bathed in the shadow of those pushing thighs and he was unable to see them one final scream a shriek of sheer maternal pain and the infant was clear of the womb a wriggling crying thing on a square of torn silk still dark and featureless adrian bent to lift it clear reaching for that knife to cut the cord he found the knife saw that it was different an ivoryhandled shortbladed dagger but the edge was keen and that was all that mattered give it to me abaaner is it a boy a mothers hope for a son and heir she cradled her still wet baby to her bosom felt at it in the darkness oh abaaner it is a girl sheer despair the sobs shaking her body i prayed to khepera when i saw the scarab that it would be a male child but even he it seems cannot alter the course of fate dalukah has once again given birth to another dalukah and there is no hope for any of us sheila pull yourself together sheila and who is this sheila you refer to abaaner you know i am called dalukah he nodded he did not know but any name would suffice i wish we had some water dalukah it does not matter i am drying her on my torn clothing she will be all right she is she stiffened gave a sudden cry of anguish almost dropped her baby look abaaner do you see its features its skin the babe is barely a few minutes old and yet it already has the accursed plague adrian paled recoiled and at that very moment the four eyes of set glowed brightly cast their red light upon the tiny creature which hitherto had been hidden by shadow a face that might have been that of a monkey rough and flatfeatured eyes that seemed to understand glinted with a malevolence towards the mother who had given birth to it mutely asking to be spared the misery of a misshapen existence pleading for mercy euthanasia it was the only answer but no parent would have the courage the skin was blistered wet with pus from the festering sores oozing yellow rivers dripping and forming their own sea on the floor flesh that burned and decomposed in its first few minutes of life gave off that putrefying stench which had its mother holding it away from her her screams drowning its own cries of pain it vomited scalding bile tried to fight its way back to those full breasts but the girl known as dalukah could not bear its closeness if necessary it must starve what did it matter when they were all going to die was not menhu the slaughterer due back at any moment adrian covered his face with his hands peeped through splayed fingers for one brief moment he saw the baby girls face an instant of recognition that had to be a lie sent to torture him a cruel trick by the amulet which gave light or darkness according to its mood it could not be his imagination was adding to his own awful inexplicable terror for in that split second he saw a tiny replica of rita beneath the running plague mucus the agony of one beyond mortal help who writhed in everlasting purgatory then she was gone and the wriggling shape held in dalukahs outstretched hands was once more a diseased child afforded an awful temporary life she set it down on the carpet of filthy cloth grateful that the radiance was fading again and she would not be able to gaze upon it it screams were louder and she found herself edging her weakened bleeding body away from it groping the blackness for her lover seeking the protection of his body in case her offspring came after her adrian felt her go limp lowered her gently to the floor the light was gone now and the blackness had returned the cries of the infant growing weaker as though already she was succumbing to the dreadful burning plague then silence except for faint scurrying sounds the heavier ones might have been rats the fainter ones beetles or spiders his skin crawled as something brushed against his bare foot and moved on in the distance he thought he could hear that awful familiar cacophony an orchestra of grasshoppers and the deeper vocal chords of hordes of frogs preparing to leave the reed beds dalukah was unconscious he stroked her fevered face gently bent forward and kissed her lips they were burning hot her breath stale but at least she still lived he fumbled around trying to find the knife again but it had gone snatching his hand away as he touched something small and hard that darted away in fright if he had found the weapon he would have used it cheated the forces which mocked them in the blackness but he did not and they still lived the living death this was it he was certain he wondered if they would see barry and rita perhaps it was better if they didnt after that one fleeting likeness which had materialised on the newborns face the muffled noises from outside were louder now the frogs had left their daytime refuge to conquer the land the insects greeting them joyously a multitude of pestilences joining forces against man there would be locusts out there too like the one that george brownlow had imprisoned in a jamjar and left to die from suffocation just as adrian and sheila were dying now if they were not already dead a vibration on the stone floor adrians tortured senses picked it up felt it gathering strength heavy footsteps somebody was coming menhu the slaughterer had arrived chapter nineteen dead scarabs emily brownlow sat staring at the patterns on the kitchen wall experienced a kind of afterfuneral feeling numbed shock that gradually turned to relief funerals were therapeutic a climax to grief and afterwards you felt better that had been the case after both her parents had died the same with rita now she had to condition herself once again the consolation this time was that everybody was going to die death was but a process of change a transfer to another life sekhetaaru but she was changed already different and it was all rather frightening so much so that she deliberately tried to work out those patterns on the wallpaper over the unit her confused brain fighting to adjust to something mundane squiggly lines that could have been anything and the more you studied them the more difficult it was to determine exactly what like those lines and symbols in the opticians that you squinted at trying to make up your mind which ones were level and which were thicker and eventually you finished up with eye strain anyway so they sold you a new pair of lenses they were like insects that was it smug satisfaction now that she had come to a positive decision tiny dots that were flies on the wall motionless because they were caught up in the crisscross sections which couldnt be anything else except spiders webs and you wondered how on earth you had failed to spot the spiders themselves big fat lecherous insects that squatted waiting they were in no hurry because their victims werent going anywhere she started her heart missed a beat changed up a gear and accelerated like george he was the spider they were the flies sheila adrian herself barry and rita had already been devoured she sat up gripped the arms of the chair a sensation as though she had been manacled shackled for a long time and suddenly for no reason at all her chains had loosened and fallen from her a wave of sheer horror hit her almost threw her back into a semicomatose state and she had to clutch at logic it almost eluded her but not quite a willothewisp but she caught it and dragged it back shock again but not the same she was not numbed any more like a mindless zombie could actually reason oh god it all had to be a dream it couldnt have happened less than an hour to zero hour she hadnt heard her husband enter the room because he moved almost silently on bare feet libya isnt backing down israel will be blasted to hell and thatll be the signal for the americans to trigger off their armoury maybe we wont even make it until tonight the prime minister is addressing the nation at seven a lot of good thatll do she didnt reply didnt want to look at him george brownlow was dead months ago this thing was an impostor not even much of a physical resemblance any longer something created by that devilish metal object in the shelter or was everything all in the mind no it was real enough a nightmare that was reality george was standing staring out of the window as though transfixed out there in river view a quiet upperclass suburban backwater people were starting to panic one heavily laden car was already being backed out into the road the luggage on the roof rack precariously tied with string the vehicle seemed to groan under the weight next door a transit van was in the process of being loaded up loose items being flung in through the open rear doors there was no time for suitcases and so it would be at number sixteen and number eighteen everybody was fleeing but where to george smiled smugly to himself running was no good you had to go underground and sit it out it gave him a sense of superiority did you hear what i said a touch of annoyance in his tone an edginess that hadnt been there before fanaticism bordering on panic i heard does it really matter maybe and maybe not but we need time not a lot just enough so that menhu can finish his work but set isnt ready yet if they bomb us first it could be too late and then wed never make it to the kingdom of osiris but set will not be hurried what about sheila and adrian staring again at the wall patterns the flies not even struggling the spiders not hurrying they will wait just as we have to they wont be going anywhere she stiffened hoped he didnt notice how her flesh crept and goosepimpled he spoke the truth sheila and adrian would stop in the shelter because they had been brainblasted too imbeciles who didnt even have the minds of children she wished george would go away go and lie down on the bed upstairs for a while his presence was starting to fog her mind again destroying that sudden flash of logic the door closed and she heard his bare feet on the hall blocks a sort of slithering noise that sent a shudder up her spine just one creak on the stairs told her that he had gone upstairs maybe he was going to rest for a while her pulses were racing alarmingly and she wondered if she had high bloodpressure it was quite likely silence proper silence it was unnerving something which rarely ever happened if you stopped to think about it there was always noise the drone of cars in the distance those damned grasshoppers never letting up frogs croaking so that you couldnt shut them out because they got on your brain so much you heard them anyway flies buzzing on the windows now silence real silence emily brownlow swallowed strained her ears in an attempt to hear something but there was nothing something was very wrong the flies were all dead she saw them lying on the windowsills on the sink unit all over the floor not one was buzzing they were all dead every one of them it was illogical she tried to tell herself the way her terror came back and once again she was engaged in conflict with her own brain run no im not scared yes you are because everywhere you look theres death but theyre only flies a flys lifespan is only a day or so maybe but nature ensures that they breed rapidly so that there are always flies but there arent anymore they re all dead grasping at logic a masterstroke by a frightened and confused brain somebody had sprayed the kitchen with flykiller that was why they were all dead emily expelled her breath in utter relief tried to shut out that argumentative little voice inside her then why arent hordes of them mobbing the windows on the outside trying to get in maybe they were she crossed to the sink unit oh god there wasnt a fly to be seen only thousands of dead ones littering the patio outside that would need to be swept up with a broom a bucketful at least she trembled held on to the sink thought about sheila and adrian again more positively this time bringing in a new dimension anger she opened the door into the hallway stood listening that same awful silence but not quite a distant faint kind of intermittent humming as though a generator somewhere was struggling in the heat almost cut out but managing to hold on emily tried to dismiss it crept towards the stairs mounted them one at a time stepping over the fifth step because that was the one that always creaked barry had said so once her eyes burned hot and dry at the memory she reached the landing fought to overcome the urge to flee back downstairs to fling herself into that kitchen chair and try and count the number of flies caught up in wallpaper webs on tiptoe easing open the bedroom door a crack just large enough to see through then she almost laughed her relief aloud george brown low lay on the bed stark naked mouth wide giving off a staccato snore which terminated in a grunt that almost woke him up before he began to snore again a human generator struggling to cope with a heatwave oh god he looked pathetic without his shorts and glasses it was a long time since she had seen him like that dirty too and with his head shaven he reminded her of a little old man nearing the end of his days nothing to be frightened of just repulsive senility the end product of an obsession that had burned him out a sense of shame wondering how he could have dominated her like he had not really knowing sets servant a vessel that had been used for a purpose and now that it was empty had been cast to one side jesus how she hated him her knuckles whitened the remaining colour drained from her features she thought about that knife down in the temple no the shelter there were others in the kitchen not so big but they would do what she wanted her rage boiled came to a head george still had a slight potbelly shed slice through it pull his guts out like tripe out of a butchers bin dig and hack for his heart then shed with an effort she pulled herself together later the children first she had to get them out of that vile stinking grave get them to safety before she took her own revenge she turned away resisted an urge to dash downstairs forgot about the fifth from bottom step it groaned loudly gave a slight crack she stopped listened that generator was still working picking up momentum thank god back in the kitchen that wallpaper didnt look like flies and spiders any longer just meaningless crisscrossed patterns and dots they had all died becoming a nothingness on the wall like the real dead flies on the unit and floor she felt them squashing beneath her feet experienced a sense of satisfaction deliberately crushed some more a reluctance to go outside agoraphobia she paused had to make a mental effort then struggled with the door george had locked it and the key was stiff had to be forced using both hands so that it bent almost snapped the heat again she edged the door open peered fearfully through the open gap so still and silent and the sun wasnt shining anymore black clouds a bank of sheer depression so menacing as though ordering her to go back inside traitor you are betraying the master she trembled hesitated another idea the phone was in the hall three digits the police would come she left the door partly open crept back the way she had come squashing more flies on her way she almost dropped the receiver had to dial a second time because her finger slipped out of the hole and the nine sprung back as though it was deliberately trying to thwart her nine nine nine waiting listening to her pulses roaring halfthinking that she might be boiling up for a heart attack or a stroke struck down by the awful set who had brought darkness to daylight in his terrible wrath still nothing she didnt replace the receiver just left it dangling on the end of its cord because like everything else around her it was dead she knew she had to make herself go back out there there was no other way lowering skies black shapes that became giant multiheaded serpents massing as though to attack she almost ran back indoors no she had to go through with it now that she had wrenched herself away a noise had her starting looking about her with frightened eyes thunder a long low rumble that suddenly had every nerve in your body tensing mans oldest fear emily shielded her eyes searched the skies but there was no sign of lightning yet it would come though she trod on something felt it split like a dry hazel nut her weight crushing it into a fine black powder she looked down grimaced there were dead beetles everywhere dozens of them mostly lying on their backs on the patio about the size of a thumbnail black shelled but with a sort of metallic hue as though somebody had meticulously polished them all dead every one of them there had been numerous beetles out here when she and george had returned from the ritual of embalmment scarabs hed pointed at them laughed softly khepera has sent them as a symbol of creation the birth of dalukahs child is imminent she hadnt been listening property her numbed brain recording his words but not interpreting them throwing them back out now scarabs no they were just ordinary beetles the kind that you found almost anywhere at least she thought so whatever species they were they were horrible creepy crawlies like the grasshoppers were all dead too there was no doubt about that the lawn resembled a parched area littered with piles of tiny dead twigs something larger from which feathers were strewn as though somebody had made an attempt to pluck it and had abandoned the idea that blackbird the one that lived in the shrubberies and had been feeding on the insects this last fortnight now it was dead too everything was dead not so much a movement as a presence had her glancing up giving a cry of fear as she looked into two yellowishgreen orbs it was a bird a big one perched on an outstretched branch of next doors rowan tree so still it might also have been dead except for the eyes moving slightly as they fixed on her some kind of a hawk she couldnt be more exact because she had never been interested in ornithology at first she thought it might be a golden eagle but it wasnt big enough some kind of harrier maybe cruel sharp yellow talons that would hook up an unsuspecting victim rip it to shreds glancing again at the dead blackbird that area of exposed and torn flesh the cluster of fluffy feathers emily threw up her hands instinctively to protect her face but the bird never moved just continued to watch her she ran heard the insect corpses cracking and crunching beneath her feet thunder like distant cannonfire the black sky tinged with streaks of yellow any moment the heavens would be ripped asunder with jagged stabbing forked flame and the rains would deluge on to a parched landscape emily brownlow found herself at the door of the dugout a frayed and peeling piece of panelled wood which had lain behind the shed for years and was now of vital importance to her a matter of life and death to her children she seized the latch lifted it and pulled felt an immobile strength resisting her frenzied efforts had known all along that the door wouldnt open that it would foil her just as that useless telephone had done there was no lock so it had to be stuck she tugged again but it didnt give panicking kicking and banging on it looking for a padlock or a bolt with which her husband might have secured it but there was neither just a door that refused to yield because its task was to imprison adrian and sheila sheila sheila can you hear me adrian open up open up its mum im your mum now adrian and i dont care if you only come from a council house home i love you i love you and the baby youve given my sheila there was no answer not even an echo nothing oh jesus theyre both dead too i know they are oh god let me die she fell to her knees let her tears come with full force another storm that had to burst sometime a sudden fear that george might have heard her come running from the house menhu the slaughterer in full fury she didnt care all the same she glanced back that hawk bird it was still there watching her huge yellow eyes that belied the ferocity of those devilish talons if you took the trouble to look at them long enough pity maybe it knew how to cry too had a lost mate to weep for emily made a determined effort forced herself back up on to her feet they werent necessarily dead in there probably just in a bemused hypnotic state like she had been this past ohgod she didnt know how long time had lost all meaning to her she just knew that she had to get help quickly turning away the sky beginning to spit its wrath at her heavy spots of rain that felt icy cold one last look back at that hawk bird perched on the branch its very presence seemed to give her comfort then its eyes narrowed a warning run while there is still time she was running blindly raindrops splattering all around her like enemy bullets attempting to mow her down treading on dead things a slug that squashed and left a black skid mark behind her a frog that burst like a child blowing bubblegum sobbing for breath struggling with the latch of a gate like everything else so far it wouldnt work it would be rusted and it clicked the gate swung open and as it did so she gave a cry of despair in her panic she had fled in the wrong direction this wasnt the side gate leading out into river view it was the rear one at the bottom of the garden which opened out on to the river bank emilys scream was drowned by an overhead clap of thunder followed immediately by a flash of lightning which shimmered across the sheeting rain a deluge bouncing on the hardbaked ground like invisible demons trying to bar her way attempting to drive her back to the kingdom of george brownlow high priest of set but she wasnt going back she would sooner die out here in the open there wasnt any need to die though there was a way back into river view along the river bank for about three hundred yards and take a path leading off at rightangles it was steep but it brought you out at the bottom of the culdesac by the telephone kiosk muddy water splashed up her bare legs as puddles formed in seconds indentations in the ground filling up with water dead insects and frogs floating in them dead things everywhere she was forced to slow her pace gasping for breath the thunder was incessant now so dark that it was impossible to see more than a few yards ahead except when the whole scene was eerily lit up by wicked prongs of earthbound fire she thought she could smell burning somewhere but it would be impossible for anything to ignite in this she stopped again looking desperately about her an avenue of willow branches beaten down across the narrow path soaking wet tentacles that tried to encircle her and pull her back you shall not escape the vengeance of set i shall a sudden fear that she had missed the track panicking in case she had to retrace her steps in this awful flood of death unrecognisable objects floated and lodged against her ankles dead bodies that might have been grasshoppers or spiders or scarabs fighting those clinging branches hurling them from her so that they sprang back and whipped her viciously across the face she tasted blood spat a deafening explosion that had her staggering back with hands clapped to her ears staring skywards fearfully it was night surely such blackness could not happen at any other time the sky above her swirled a maelstrom of angry clouds forming into a shape that was unmistakable an elongated body that wriggled and writhed with seething fury a point that grew from it and parted became a double head with four flashing eyes embers that were fanned into flames by the rising wind so that they glowed with evil twin fangs jagged forked fire that swished from side to side venomous thunderbolts of burning death that singled out their cowering victim on the flooded river bank and struck with unerring accuracy and power emily brownlow knew that she was going to die even before the doubleheaded serpent spat its crackling fiery venom fell to her knees in one last gesture of humility a plea on her lips that sheila and adrian might be spared that her own sacrifice would be sufficient she felt the impact slumped forward into a spreading pool of water heard a hissing which might have been her own scorched body or it might have been the serpent mocking her instant pain that faded so that her numbed body appeared to be floating in a black void faces all around her but they came and went before she could recognise any of them mutely screaming for sheila and adrian barry and rita but only a hissing answered her and once she thought she heard georges voice angry and shouting then silence and some distance away a huge hawkshaped bird flapped its wings glided from the topmost branches of a towering oak tree and fought its way back through the lashing storm towards river view even in the buffeting gale it was graceful and majestic a purposefulness about its flight the snake shape in the sky spat fire again but the hawk was gone chapter twenty menhu the slaughterer the electric light was back on again in the shelter so unexpected that it had adrian shielding his eyes blinded by its artificial glare those vibrations were deafening now a pounding of fists on the door up above for christs sake it isnt locked what the hell was george brownlow playing at then as suddenly as the noise had begun it died away silence adrian capper squinted through halfopen lids waited while his eyesight adjusted to the brightness closing them again because he was frightened to look didnt want to sec in case he saw that awful festering baby dying from a plague before its life had begun screaming in agony he couldnt hear it though perhaps it was already dead he hoped so it would be kindest that way a merciful release and sheila or dalukah as she had suddenly taken to calling herself where was she he smoothed his hands down his thighs an instinctive action to remove the wet sticky feel of afterbirth from them was suddenly aware that something was wrong again he looked down let out a grunt of disbelief no longer was he wearing a rough leopard skin garment with a hanging tail but he was clad once more in his old working jeans and grubby tshirt the way he should have been hey she oh jesus sheila brownlow was lying on the floor halfpropped up against the shelving her jeans tugged down to her ankles her bare thighs smeared with bloodstains and on the floor beneath her was a small pool of scarlet blood my baby she groaned opening her eyes but they swiftly closed again where is my baby adrian glanced about him there was no sign of that horrific newborn creature with its weeping sores although its shrill cries still rang in his ears gone was the bare chamber with its atmosphere of dry decay and its sinister coffins replaced once more by the brownlow dugout and its crammed metal shelves the mummified form of barry with its putrefying stench he didnt understand made no attempt to you havent had a baby his voice was firm insistent youve had a miscarriage no she screamed opened her eyes and stared about her in panic my baby is here somewhere and shut up he slapped her hard the flat of his hand striking her cheek and throwing her head back so that it hit a steel upright with force pull yourself together youve aborted at a very early stage and if you see a doctor quick theres probably no harm done but weve got to get out of here before your father comes back weve both been the victims of some strange hypnotic force and for the moment ive managed to throw it off now if you can lean on me i can maybe support you i dont want to risk leaving you here while i go for help he glanced at the motionless bandaged form on the campbed and grimaced no way was he going to leave her if necessary he would stay behind with her his gaze moved on up to that amulet the eyes were still closed and lifeless set slept but for how much longer we cannot go we have to stay she whispered it is written in the book of fate dalukah and abaaner must die and their child with them in this very tomb this is ridiculous adrian capper wondered if he had the strength to carry her up those steps and out into river view we can escape if we go now we cant desert barry and rita theyre dead gone the words hurt but he knew he had to speak them no they have not gone her fearfilled eyes became glazed as they looked into his they are cursed to wander forever in the darkness for my father is set in human form the ritual was sets not the revered rituel de lembaumement as written on the original papyrus for barry was committed to sets power and horus was ignored not called upon can you not call horus perhaps if he humoured her she would accompany him willingly i dare not i do not have the power for once i was a high priestess of set and i must pay the price for my folly accepting your love abaaner bearing your child i am a traitor too in the eyes of horus mayhap the hawkheaded god elder brother of set would take vengeance on us too i dare not risk it adrian hesitated glanced at the amulet again but there was still no life in that repulsive serpent body those eyes were still dull a rumbling vibration somewhere above made the cans on the shelves vibrate glass jars rattled theres a storm brewing outside perhaps the drought is over if it is then it is the end for all of us for it is prophesied that after drought plagues and famine the world will end lets go he bent to lift her saw that she was still bleeding the sticky flow heavier now she closed her eyes seemed to go limp opened them again narrowed orbs that now reflected the cunning of a beast from the wild all right she whispered but youll have to help me up he nodded her hand went behind her as though to seek the support of a shelving stanchion to heave herself up on but instead found a heavy can of tinned fruit grasped it she paused got her balance then without warning her arm shot forward adrians reflexes froze in that split second a moment when everything was reduced to slow motion but he was powerless to take evasive action a hurtling object he even saw the label a cluster of yellow cling peaches no way could he dodge it braced himself for the impact pain and kaleidoscopic lights a bizarre firework display that lit up the darkness all around then gradually petered out and the blackness came in at him he was unconscious even before he hit the floor george brownlow came out of his deep slumber with a start hauled himself up to a sitting position the room was dark and his first thought was that he had overslept that night had come and set was already angrily awaiting his arrival in the temple but no it wasnt night because you could still see the tops of the withered trees down by the river it was raining hard a cloudburst the sheeting raindrops spectacularly illuminated by a downward plunge of forked lightning a rumble of thunder like an overhead bursting bomb had the walls vibrating a moment of fear he covered his face with his hands and then that flash of primitive terror was reduced to a feeling of unease foreboding this was it the prophesied hour was nigh civilisation was at an end and his presence was needed down in the temple dalukah and abaaner must pay for their treachery he pulled on his shorts ran barefooted from the bedroom down the stairs and into the lounge a trembling finger pressing the control knob of the television something he had to know the screen was distorted shimmering lines across it so that you had to try and work out the picture behind it a face vaguely familiar like your own reflection in a fairground hall of mirrors a newscaster features grim staccato vocal sounds that were almost drowning in the crackling and buzzing report that the missile carrier been sunk by a missile fired from submarine hope to have further details very soon we the explosion a shattering blast of thunder that seemed to rock the set itself a blinding flash that blacked out the picture left a greyishbrown screen which still hissed its agony dead like everything else would soon be he turned away experienced that feeling of foreboding again knew he would find the kitchen empty even before he opened the door he looked around saw the empty chair where emily had been slumped in a daze he stared at it bewilderment and anger trying to will her to appear but she didnt em ily a croak grasping the chair rattling it shaking it finally throwing it over on to the floor youve gone just when i needed you most a hissing sound that might have been the television in the other room a cry of electronic agony from a dying symbol of mans ingenuity which was frail and useless when pitted against the forces of nature or it might have been set the amulet demanding his presence at the final hour a rumble of angry thunder the kitchen lit up by a dazzling flash of lightning he crossed to the door opened it looked out on a flooded dancing patio the steps down to the lawn a raging miniature waterfall that carried tiny dead bodies in its rushing current frogs locusts scarabs the ultimate plague had arrived death he stood there the torrent up to his ankles water cascading off his shaven head impervious to its coldness emily emily comeback i need you there was no answer even if there had been it was doubtful if he would have heard it indecision would set grant him just a few more minutes to find emily where had she gone oh god he needed her now more than he had ever needed her before he set off on an aimless shambling course across the flooded lawn tiny bodies floated everywhere and he felt them being squashed beneath his bare feet she wouldnt have gone back to the temple on her own she wouldnt dare she had fled blindly panicked when the storm had started he should not have left her he must find her george brownlow could not see more than a few yards into the deluge and the gloom shapes that taunted him had him rushing towards them only to grasp the sodden boughs of bushes cursing them for their trickery a sudden movement above his head had him cringing a bird of some kind a big one with heavy wingbeats but it was gone before he could identify it he came to the lower garden gate saw that it hung open and knew instantly that this was where his wife had gone oh the fool she did not realise emily emily noises that swamped him sounds that came out of the storm like the cries of the damned the lightning now almost incessant he stepped out on to the path floundered in the thick mud almost slipped and fell the river would be rising it would burst its banks before long an unprecedented flood that would sweep the river view houses away with it but that would not matter because there would be nobody left to live in them which way had she gone left or right panic looking up into the storm as though seeking guidance but there was nothing but unending blackness and lashing rain help me words that he might not have uttered might only have existed in his tortured mind but they were heard and answered the sky seemed to converge the black clouds concentrating together mushrooming upwards like a pall of smoke from burning rubber merging into a giant shape that twisted and writhed as if in agony a monstrous serpent that grew a double head flicked its fangs angrily spat jagged fire that was reflected in the malevolent eyes go back menhu for death is your business brownlow tried to cover his eyes but he could not shut out the blinding light heat that seared his brain had him crying his terror aloud vowing obedience he turned slipped and almost fell on a morass of unrecognisable dead things fighting his way back into the garden through a wind that was reaching almost hurricane force the driving rain now hot and burning his flesh water everywhere puddles spreading into larger pools the dead lawn a black take and still rising he wanted to run but it was impossible glancing back fearfully at the sky behind him but the serpent had slipped back into obscurity it was still there though he could feel it watching him angry with him because of his human frailty his concern for his mate he reached the shelter groped his way along to the door the water had risen above the broken slab he had used as a step and he could hear it cascading down the steps inside there wasnt much time left for any of them again something attracted his attention even as he lifted the latch and he cringed a shape in the dark sky hurtling down at him he screamed instinctively threw up an arm to shield his face felt the rush of huge wings and shrieked again as talons raked his bare forearm the bird hit him and was veering off again affording him just one glimpse in the darkness of a huge hawk that screeched its fury and disappeared into the darkness a vivid flash of lightning illuminated the flooded landscape vicious prongs of live fire that shrivelled the tall rowan tree reduced it instantly to a blackened skeleton george brownlow fell inside slammed the door behind him wondered if it was strong enough to keep that bird out a faint ruby glow emanated from down below a familiar radiance which would give him the light he needed to do what he had to do set was here and ready george trembled his mouth sour and dry the rainwater was flowing down the steps forming a spreading pool at the bottom before long the whole shelter would be flooded he laughed to himself he had provided a dampproof course against rising water but nature had beaten him found a way in from above he picked his way down carefully holding on to the rail he didnt want to go down there was afraid of what he might see suddenly aware of the task which must be carried out in the name of set a highpriestess called dalukah had betrayed her god thousands of years ago she had been punished but an old clergyman had freed her and her lover abaaner from their eternal purgatory but set was omnipotent had followed them into exile and now they must be punished again as they had been before only then would the cycle be complete brownlow reached the bottom stared in horror at the scene which greeted him adrian capper lay unconscious on the rough floor blood pouring from a jagged wound across his forehead a bloodied sheila cradling his head on her lap weeping uncontrollably she looked up screamed as she saw her bedraggled father standing over her menhu the slaughterer had been summoned and now he had arrived chapter twentyone horus sheila backed away knew that it was now too late oh god she should have fled with adrian while there still had been time she had wanted to go but some inexplicable force had dominated her made her strike him down dad she shouted tried to make herself heard over the noise of the raging storm and the pouring water dad dont please dont a feeble plea which she knew would be futile dalukah you must die his eyes were bloated behind the rainsplashed lenses his mouth an awful black cavity where he had forgotten to replace his dentures your treachery is exposed you must die abaaner too and your bastard child my child is dead she screamed ive had a miscarriage but he didnt appear to hear her moving slowly and deliberately across to the bed on which the stinking mummified corpse rotted picking up the longest of the knives which lay beside it holding it in the manner of a sword he hesitated turned back towards the amulet on the crude altar as though seeking guidance bowed straightened up again the twoheaded serpent seemed to writhe as though at any second it might free itself from its casing burning red eyes glowing fangs flicking to and fro hissing words that listening ears were compelled to interpret you are here at last menhu i have been waiting for there is not much time left where are the other priests and priestesses of set george brownlow was mumbling his reply trying to tell set that emily was lost maybe dead in the raging storm that there werent any others i summon the others they dare not disobey a sudden burst of thunder shook the underground room toppled some cans from a shelf a glass jar splintered into fragments across the floor sets glowing eyes flickered threatened to extinguish like some damaged electrical appliance spluttered as the shadows moved back in george brownlow covered his eyes had resigned himself to death or worse was already anticipating the next burst of thunder but it never came and the ensuing silence was a thousand times worse that same illuminating glow tit up the interior and at first he thought it was some trick of the strange light the shelving the furniture they were gone he stood in an almost empty chamber saw the amulet and a carved head of some kind which was vaguely familiar in the centre of the floor stood a small sarcophagus another larger one over in the far corner almost hidden in the shadows he experienced a sense of sadness that was stronger than his terror heard the weeping unrelenting sobs that grew in volume and then he saw the girl his own daughter except that she looked somewhat different in those long flowing robes both her skin and her hair several shades darker she was kneeling beside a prone figure clad in some kind of tunic made from the skin of a wild animal george brownlow licked his lips tried to work out where everything had gone why he could hear the storm no more why this place was so dry and dusty and the rainwater was no longer pouring in there were others in here too a multitude which kept to the shadows were whispering to one another but he couldnt understand what it was they were saying waiting for what these two are traitors menhu they have betrayed me put them to the sword for their treachery then seat this tomb and begone and never dare speak the names of dalukah and abaaner again panic and terror knotted his stomach he glanced down saw the blade which he held in his hand no longer was it a carving knife of forged steel but instead a sword which scintillated in the ruby radiance its hilt jewelled and sparkling he tried to hold back but his feet were already moving slow purposeful strides towards the centre of the chamber the sword raised a human robot being sent on a mission of death dalukah screamed tried to drag her unconscious lover away but he was too heavy for her she sprang to her feet with a cry her features a mask of defiance her eyes flashing you are too late menhu for i have already borne the child of abaaner kill me if you will but i will not plead for mercy i have no regrets george brownlow fought to overcome the power which controlled him he tried to step back instead his feet moved forward he wanted to drop the sword kick it away but it came up poised delicately menacingly in his hand i cannot murder my own daughter dalukah you must die whispered applause for his words filled the chamber echoes that were reluctant to die away kill her menhu abaaner too abaanertoo too they were all screaming at him now she faced him her dress falling away to reveal smooth naked breasts that were perfect in every way her head was held high and the smile on her features was one of contempt kill me then my father and may it be on your conscience forever as my blood will be on your hands i am not your father i am menhu the slaughterer and you are dalukah of whom i have heard but never seen before now die he struck tried to close his eyes but they refused to close everything before him was happening so slowly the point of the sword taking its time piercing the soft flesh below her left breast penetrating going deeper and deeper until it grated on bone she sagged held upright like a skewered joint of beef from which the blood seeped then spurted that contemptuous smile still on her face fighting to hide the pain slowly she fell to the floor her weight dragging her free of the blade rolling over on to her back still looking at him with accusing sightless eyes you have murdered me father he wanted to scream heard the shouts of the assembly in the shadows well done menhu the traitoress is dead now kill abaaner and let us be gone from this place of death adrian stirred his confused brain trying to work out who was shouting and what they were shouting for he opened his eyes vaguely recognised this place of ancient death sheila was lying a few feet away from him shed hit him with something off one of the shelves he rubbed his head shook it oh jesus christ almight the blood there were pools of it everywhere thick sticky crimson rivers that were slowing would soon be congealing he stared aghast at sheilas mutilated body there was no doubt that she was dead her capacious clothing ripped open showing a ghastly wound a bloody incision that surely went right into her heart her mouth still wide her eyes still open frozen in an expression of defiance there were other people in the chamber clusters of them standing back in the shadows watching gloating and it had to be george brownlow standing only a few feet away at least there was a resemblance a wildeyed human shape lathered in sweat splashed with blood wielding a dripping sword muttering whispered incantations still wearing those stupid heavy glasses with the lenses misted up so that they gave the appearance of huge sightless eyes you too must die abaaner everything seemed to stop like a still photograph taken from some awful movie a moment of timelessness which bridged the abyss between life and death except that adrians brain was working not understanding any thing except that sheila was dead and this madman intended to kill him next you bastard he breathed you filthy murderer do not defile the sacred temple of set with your foul cursings george brownlow advanced a pace raised his sword set demands that you die that you are sacrificed to him so that your soul may serve him for eternity even now dalukah has gone to him the amulet it no longer seemed to be an object of metal a captivated serpent chained to its frame it writhed spat flicked its wicked fangs reared itself up on the shelf alongside that awful obsidian head adrian felt the power the revulsion that motivated the creature that was brownlow had the hidden watchers murmuring their subservience to a mighty power kill abaaner menhu and in that instant adrian saw dalukah not the bloodied corpse lying on the floor but a shimmering translucent shape that hovered on the opposite side of the chamber close to the larger sarcophagus her expression one of anguish trying to attract his attention struggling as though invisible hands were pulling at her trying to drag her away before she could speak to him her lips formed one word said it over and over again until finally there was no mistaking her mute message horus horns call horns abaaner for now there is nothing more to be lost suddenly she was gone vanishing as though she had never been had only existed in his own mind die commoner adrian saw the sword go back the point of the bloody blade aligned on a course for his own heart heard the chorus from the dark shadows kill him in the name of set somehow adrian forced his stricken vocal chords to function a whisper to begin with growing in volume until the words were both a plea and a shout of defiance horus horus save me before it is too late george brownlow checked as though he had met with an impassable physical barrier and even those glasses wet with condensation reflected his terror his toothless mouth opened a croak of fear desperately looking about him the twoheaded serpent was now a living thing no longer part of the amulet hissing its rage slithering forward and dropping to the floor with a soft thud eyes of fire anger and hatred but if you looked closely you saw a tiny flicker of fear in them as it looked about brownlow screamed and his sword clattered to the floor he tottered back fell sprawled across the dead body of his daughter clung to it as though begging forgiveness sobs shaking him and in that instant the raging thunderstorm seemed to penetrate this underground chamber a vivid flash of fire which blinded a rumble that shook floor and walls adrian felt the ground heave up beneath him stones splitting a rush of hot wind tearing at him threatening to pick him up and sweep him along like a dead autumn leaf he saw a vision that might have lasted a few seconds or several hours it was impossible to tell the scene stark and terrible illuminated by crackling streaks of fire set was reared upright like a snakecharmers exhibit his double fangs spitting fire and venom as he attempted to drive off the attacking bird which swooped and veered raked with its talons gouged with its wicked curved beak stabbing slashing a conflict in which there would be only one victor the serpent climbed for a better advantage wriggled itself up on to the still charred body that had once belonged to its servant menhu the slaughterer one head was damaged a jagged wound that oozed a vile stinking dark fluid the fangs hanging down limply even the larger of the combatants the huge hawk had not escaped unscathed feathers billowing from its plumage and being whipped away in the wind back and forth a duel of fang and claw that was terrible to behold as serpent god and hawkheaded god battled out their fraternal hatred on each other adrian lay there halfblinded by the flashing forked fire felt the rush of wings time and again then darkness a thousand times more terrible because the battle still raged but it was impossible to see how it fared adrian lay there covered his head with his hands listened to the fury of it all and knew that his own life his very soul depended upon the outcome perhaps he slept he did not know only that some time later he awoke to a stark black silence utter darkness but he knew it was the brownlow shelter because of that awful putrefying stench instead of the ancient dry smell his outstretched hand touched something and he snatched it away caught the sob in his throat because he knew without any doubt that it was the body of sheila who had been slain for the sins of dalukah in distant times so hot and stifling his entire skin seeming to smart as though it had been sprinkled with acid he struggled to draw breath oh jesus if only he could die but he had been granted life because he had beseeched horus to let him live he began to weep screamed that he wanted to die but the huge bird did not return it had answered his call and was gone forever there was no sign of the serpent either perhaps it lay dead somewhere in the darkness adrians flesh prickled with revulsion all around him was death a tomb in which only he lived dying like dalukahs child thousands of years ago its skin festering and weeping like ritas and barrys had done he found that he could move and sat up was aware that where previously there had been shelved walls now there were just piles of rubble dust that had him coughing and retching and the atmosphere was so hot his eyes hurt so much that he shut them in an attempt to alleviate the pain it didnt help but he could not see anything in this pitch blackness anyway crawling groping snatching his hands away every time he touched something that was cold and soft eventually he found the steps at least he thought it was the exit a slope of rubble that slid and avalanched with every movement so that he had to take his time easing himself up on allfours grazing his legs and arms bleeding the door was smashed and he tried to see beyond the debris perhaps it was night because through the split woodwork he saw a dark dusty swirling fog his whole body smarted as though it was on fire and he barely had the strength to rip away the jagged panels eventually he was forced to rest he dozed with exhaustion perhaps he slept he didnt know but when he looked again it was lighter outside the fog having thinned considerably he stared the house should have stood twenty yards or so immediately opposite but there was nothing just rubble that smoked and gave off that burning fog all around there was nothing but a smouldering landscape the rancid stench of death he began to claw his way out gave up after a few minutes what was the purpose in going out there everybody was dead just himself left to suffer the agony of a smoking hell hed fought for life and in the end he was the loser day blended into night once more and after an eternity morning came again at least it might have been morning it was difficult to tell that grey smokehaze creeping in getting thicker and hotter and still he couldnt die his chest hurt and he was spitting blood now eyes swollen so that he could barely see out of them crouched by that hole in the door waiting scanning the swirling grey fog in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of a huge fierce graceful bird with a ragged wingspan but there was no sign of it he waited because there was nothing else to do the eddying smoke creating strange shapes raising his hopes dashing them taunting him horus wouldnt return because the curse of set had been fulfilled dalukah had died by the sword and only abaaner was left and soon he would be dead too the cycle was complete
