chapter one west baling is a suburb to the west of london and keith stewart lives there in the lower part of no somerset road number is an unusual house and a peculiarly ugly one a detached house standing in a row but in a fairly spacious garden four storeys high if you include the basement a tall thin slip of a house it was built in the spacious days of when west baling stood on the edge of the country farmlands and was a place to which indian civilians retired after their years of service but it was built of a particularly ugly yellow brick now toned to a drab grey at a period when english suburban architecture was going through a bad patch the years have not dealt kindly with west baling the farms are now far away most of the big old houses have been split up into two or three flats as keith stewart had converted no he had bought it when he married katie in the middle of the second war that was soon after he moved down from glasgow to the london area to work as a toolroom fitter with stone and collinson ltd who made subcontract parts for aeroplanes at perivale it was of course the first house that katie or keith had ever owned and they were very proud of it they contemplated quite a family so that they would need quite a house the upper rooms for nurseries and childrens rooms and playrooms while the garden would be a nice place for the pram when after a few years it became evident that that was not to be they had separated the two top floors from the remainder of the house and let them off as what the agents called a maisonette retaining the ground floor and the basement for themselves on the ground floor they had a bedroom in the front the living room and kitchen at the rear overlooking the garden and a bathroom at the side in the basement they had adapted what had once been the scullery as a small spare bedroom the whole of the rest had been taken by keith as his own domain here he made models and here he wrote about them weekly for the miniature mechanic a magazine with a considerable circulation in the lower ranks of industry and with a growing popularity among eccentric doctors stockbrokers and bank managers who just liked engineering but didnt know much about it all his ufe he had made models little steam engines little petrol engines little speedboats little locomotives little diesels he was a considerable horologist in his time he had made many clocks with motions of antiquarian interest and had written full directions for constructing them always in the miniature mechanic he had made little beam engines which would have delighted james watt and still delighted those who are fascinated by such things he had made little jet engines which would have delighted frank whittle he had made pumps and boilers and carillons that played a tune all in the miniature scale he was a quick worker and a ready writer upon technical matters and he delighted in making little things that worked he had now so ordered his life that he need do nothing else all through the war he had written about his hobby after the long hours of overtime in the toolroom the coming of peace had given him more leisure for his models and his articles about them and two years later he had taken the great plunge of giving up his job in favour of his avocation it had not benefited him financially he would have made more money in the toolroom progressing up from chargehand to foreman he would have made more money as an instructor in a technical college he would not have made more happiness than he had now attained he was a very serious and wellinformed student of engineering matters though he would have been amazed to hear himself described in such terms he read about techniques for pleasure one morning each week he would spend in the baling public library browsing through the technical magazines slightly oppressed by a sense of guilt that he was not working on fridays he always went to london to deliver his weekly copy to the editor of the miniature mechanic and arrange about the blocks and being in london he would take time off and sneak away for three or four hours to the library of the patent office for a period of interest and pleasure before going home to catch up with his work he worked normally till eleven or twelve each night he called the front basement room his clean workshop and this was his machine shop here he had a sixinch herbert lathe for heavy work a threeandahalfinch myford and a boley watchmakers lathe he had a senior milling machine and a boxford shaper a large and a small drill press and a vast array of tools ready to hand a long bench ran across the window a tubular light system ran across th ceiling and a small camera and flashgun stood ready for use in a cupboard for it was his habit to take photographs of interesting processes to illustrate his articles the other room which once had been the kitchen of the house was considerably larger he called this his dirty workshop but it was in this room that he had his desk and the drawing board for it was usually free of oil here he did what small amount of carpentry and woodworking might be necessary for his models here he welded and brazed here he tempered and hardened steel here he did steam trials of his steam engines so that it had been necessary for him to fit an extractor fan into the window it was in this room that he stood talking to his brotherinlaw commander dermott the red leather jewel case in his hands the copper box that he had made stood on the bench before them the rectangular sheet of copper that was to be the lid loose beside it ive left room for packing this asbestos card all round it keith said ill braze it up with a small oxyacetylene flame but im afraid its going to get a bit hot inside im afraid it may scorch the leather even with the asbestos i dont think that matters said the naval officer it wont set it on fire keith shook his head the top is a good fit and ill clamp it down all round while im brazing there wont be enough oxygen inside to support combustion im just worried about the look of it when you take it out it could be a bit brown that doesnt matter keith shook the case it was fairly heavy but nothing raided he glanced at his brotherinlaw whats it got in it all jos jewels john dermott told him youre only allowed to take so much out of the country this is going somewhere in the yacht the other nodded somewhere where nobodys going to find it keith said no more but took off his jacket and hung it on a hook at the back of the door he put on a leather apron that covered his body from the neck down and turned on the gas at the cylinders picked up the torch and went to work he never questioned anything that his brotherinlaw said or did they came from different worlds john had been a regular naval officer and keith was a modest little man his sister had done a good job for herself he reflected as he brazed the seam when she married john dermott it had turned out well in spite of the social disparity jo had been a pretty child with good scots sense she had been fond of dancing and at the age of twelve she had become one of the tiller girls her first part was one of nine elves in the magic wood in pantomime she had stayed with the organization and had played in theatres and music halls all over the british isles with occasional runs in london it had been partly upon her account that keith had left glasgow and come down to work in the south to see more of his only sister it had gone on till at the age of nineteen she had been in the christmas pantomime at portsmouth she was playing a small speaking part by that time as the widow twankeys maid more noticeable than in the chorus she had gone with a party of show girls and young naval officers to the queens hotel after the performance she told lieutenant dermott that she was going to see the victory next day he took her there in pouring rain which neither of them noticed he followed her to london six weeks later in the palm house at kew gardens he asked her to marry him and she accepted it wasnt till nearly a month afterwards that she learned that she was marrying the nephew of lord dungannon inevitably she had drifted somewhat apart from her brother keith the toolroom fitter in the factory at perivale she had the makings of a good actress in her she was observant and could project herself into a part it was no effort to her to take up the part of a young naval officers wife abandoning her renfrew antecedents with the tiller girk she had learnedlo abandon or assume her scots accent at will she married lieutenant dermott in and almost immediately the war came taking him away from her for the best part of five years in those years she saw him only for brief spells of leave they did not start a family during the war she lived in a small flat over a shop at cosham and worked as a woodworker with many other girls in a small dispersal aircraft factory at havant in the evenings she attempted to catch up on education to be on equal terms with other naval wives she attended classes at the polytechnic in french and history and geography and english literature the latter she found infinitely tedious but struggled on with it john dermott came back to her in a lieutenantcommander with greying hair and a face lined on the murmansk convoy route in their only child janice was born they bought a little house in southsea and lived modestly as naval officers do they could have lived better for john dermott had a private income of about a thousand a year but already the shadow of an early retirement from the navy lay upon him he was a general duties officer a salt horse impatient with the rush of new techniques that were invading his service early retirement lay ahead of him as he passed out of the promotion zone they saved their money but for the extravagance of two years in hong kong for joanna and the baby janice when he was drafted to the china station and for the mild extravagance of dutyfree gin in increasing quantities as john dermott passed out of the zone early in the axe fell and john dermott was retired from the service to which he had given his life he was then fortyfive the same age as his brotherinlaw keith joanna sat talking to katie while the two men worked in the basement room below its terribly kind of you to offer to look after janice she said i do want you to know how we feel about that she paused i wouldnt feel very comfortable about leaving her for all that time with the dungannons katie said anxiously i do hope shell be happy though baling isnt very exciting not after what shes been used to do you think she will i mean never having had any myself one doesnt know she was a plump little woman in her early forties she worked in the household linen department of buckleys drapery shop in baling broadway she had been in household linen as a girl but in the war she had been directed to running an automatic lathe at stone and collinson at perivale here she had met keith stewart in they had married in and she had gone back to her automatic lathe after a weeks honeymoon they had no children the purchase and conversion of the house had taken all their savings and left them with a heavy mortgage she had tried it for a year after the war as a lady of leisure and had tired of it when keith gave up his job and took up freelance writing and construction for the miniature mechanic katie went back gladly to the household linen a redfaced dumpy little woman well liked by the customers joanna said i think shell be very happy with you very happy indeed i wouldnt leave her if i thought she wouldnt i think youll spoil her though shevsuch a dear little thing said katie i was saying to keith perhaps we ought to have a kitten youll be landed with a cat for the rest of your lives joanna said practically shell only be with you for about sixmonths i dont think it will be longer then youll just have to take her to london airport and put her on the aeroplane to us in vancouver would that be somewhere in america in canada jo said its on the other side on the pacific coast everybody says its a lovely place to live in and john thinks he can get a job there its got quite a mild climate but it rains a lot my the thought of the aeroplane was troubling to katie i dont like the thought of her going all that way all alone would she have to change like at a station jo shook her head she goes right through in the same aeroplane over the north pole fancy katie said is that the way youre going in the yacht all in among the ice jo shook her head you couldnt go that way in a boat katie was a dear and she was going to look after janice for them while they travelled but she had lived in baling all her life were going to go southwards into the warm seas she explained when we leave hamble on thursday week we go to falmouth to clear customs and to pick up anything that weve forgotten then john wants to make a passage straight far las pahnas in the canary islands from there to barbados and then to the panama canal when we get into the pacific first of all we go to the galapagos islands and then to tahiti we do want to see that and its not much out of the way then we go up to honolulu and from there to vancouver it ought to take about five months a bit less if were lucky with the winds the string of foreign names perplexed katie she did not know where any of them were except the panama canal the whole venture was entirely alien to her experience she struggled to make sense of it will there be anyone to help you with the boat she asked with the sails and that jo shook her head we dont need anybody she said john and i can sail her by ourselves katie was perplexed but what happens at night when you want to go to bed i mean do you anchor or something a sudden doubt assailed her you have got beds havent you weve got very good beds said jo i sleep marvellously on board no we couldnt anchor its too deep sometimes we can let her sail herself while we both sleep she tried to make the matter simple but it was rather difficult shell do that with the wind forward of the beam or running under the twin spinnakers otherwise we keep watch and watch one up in the cockpit steering and the other one down below sleeping she smiled its quite all right were very used to it you wouldnt be sailing all the way though would you katie asked keith was saving you could go some of the way with the motor joanna shook her head we shall sail all the way she replied except perhaps just getting in and out of harbour we have got a small motor but we dont use it at sea its only a little one and its dirty and it makes a smell she paused and then she said johns such a seaman presently katie reverted to her own problems its just the holidays she said thoughtfully school time well im back in the house by a quarter to six always school finishes at four so shed be back here by a quarter past but keith is almost always here then unless its a friday its really just the holidays the christmas holidays jo said we dont sail till the first of august im going to take her up to the dungannons in tyrone next week i think school starts miss pearsons school here i think she said term starts on september ith that means shed be coming to you about the ith i suppose i think youll have to meet her at euston but ill make sure that the dungannons let you know katie nodded keith would meet the tram and bring her down here hed like doing that i think well be sending for her about february said jo we should be there by then and if we havent got a house she can live on the boat with us but anyway ill be writing to you from each place its just the christmas holidays katie said of course keith is in the house most of the time down in the workshop theyre not very long the christmas holidays i dont want her to be a burden on you and keith she wont be that honestly she wont katie pausedi think it would be nice to have childrens parties and crackers and presents and all that joanna eyed her uncertainly wondering how far she meant it im sure margaret would have her do whatever you think would be best for her said katie but dont do it for us keiths always wanted to have kids about the place i mean with a great big garden in the room below keith turned off the gas at the two cylinders hung the torch up on its hook took the copper box to a sink in one corner of the room and scrubbed the brazing with water and a wire brush he dried it on a dirty towel and examined the seam carefully inch by inch then he handed it to his brotherinlaw shes tight now he said briefly john dermott took it from him no chance of seawater getting into it corrosion not in a hundred years he paused when you want to open it just cut the top off with a hacksaw round here the naval officer hesitated im going to set it in concrete he said diffidently keith stared at him surprised he had thought the box was to go into the yacht do you know how to mix it i know how to mix concrete the mechanic said you mix it in different proportions depending on what its for what its got to hang on to how much would you want the naval officer hesitated and then indicated the box upon the bench before them about as much as that or a bit more keith frowned this was getting difficult i should grease it before setting it in concrete he suggested trying to be helpful without knowing the job come out easier when you want it out i see the naval officer hesitated irresolute he had never had to do this sort of work before and he wanted a good job made of it you wouldnt like to come down to the boat and do it for me down to hamble john dermott nodded when were going down tomorrow in the car would it take long if itsa straight job it might take about an hour keith said then you ought to leave it for a while to set two or three daysi could come tomorrow but id have to be back tomorrow night his eyes strayed to a corner ive got half a bag of cement there but id have to slip up to the builder for some sand got some aggregate down there whats that little clean stones just a few pounds not salty washed in freshwater theres plenty on the beach we could wash them under the hose couldnt we keith nodded doesnt matter if theyre wet they left it so and turned to go upstairs the naval officer paused by the littered desk with the drawing board beside it this whereyou do your stuff keith nodded i used to do it up in the parlour but its better down here youd be surprised at the number of letters that there are all over the auction i save the foreign stamps and give them to the boy next door jamesie morris he collects them six or seven in a day some days youd be surprised john dermott opened his eyes how many letters do you have to write say in a week twenty or twentyfive the mechanic said its letters all the time and then theres the articles each week i spend more time writing than i do working he paused and added a little resentfully its fifteen bob a week for stamps more sometimes of course one has to do it some of them send international reply coupons though do a lot of them come from foreign countries then about a third john dermott went back to the bench and picked up the copper box ill take this along with me he said he hesitated youll keep this under your hat he inquired diffidently i mean its quite all right theyre just jos rings and bracelets and things theyre all her own property but the regulations are so stupid about taking things like that out of england and shed be miserable without them i mean a woman sort of values her little bits and pieces when shes away in a strange country and we may be away for years keith said oh thats all right i shant talk about it he paused and then he asked youre going to live out there i think so if we like it jo says she wants to live in tahiti but i dont go much on that myself its french and its a very little place you knowstill she wants to see it i think well probably end up in british columbia its a grand country that id like to bay a house in victoria on vancouver island keith nodded he had only the vaguest idea where vancouver island was but it was the sort of place that people like his brotherinlaw who sailed about the world in little yachts would want to go to suppose i tell katie that im going down to rig up an electric light over the compass so you can see it at night he suggested john dermott smiled thats just the thing they went up the narrow wooden basement stairs to the main floor and keith went to wash the grime off his hands when he rejoined them in the parlour his sister and her husband were standing ready to leave having pleaded a somewhat formalized dinner engagement to katie he did not press them to stay for tea because he had learned long ago that they pursued different meal habits katie and keith had their main meal in the middle of the day their evening meal was high tea at six oclock when katie got back from work a meal of perhaps a kipper bread and jam and a piece of plum cake washed down with tea they knew that jo and john ate differently at eight oclock favouring perhaps potted shrimps followed by soup a grilled steak and mushrooms on toast the meal preceded by a couple of gifts and followed by coffee the couples got on well together but they had long ago accepted differences springing from their ways of life jo and john dermott called for keith at about nine oclock next morning driving their vintage sports bentley open fourseater nearly thirty years old and with many prosecutions for noise and speeding to its credit they loved it very dearly katie had already left for work so she did not see the two small sacks that keith put into the back compartment beside him or she might have wondered why a small electric light required cement and sand it was a warm summer morning in late july and keith enjoyed the drive through southern england they got to hamble on the creek that runs into the east side of southampton water parked the car near the entrance to lukes yard and carried the sacks out on to the long wooden walkways above the tidal mud the yachts moored bowson in tiers presently they came to the dermotts ship shearwater iv shearwater was a healthy looking modern bermudan cutter about twentyeight feet on the waterline and nine feet beam on deck she was practical and well equipped for deepsea cruising the dinghy stowed upside down over the cabin skylight between the mast and the aft hatch the twin spinnaker booms in chocks beside it she had roller reefing to the mainsail and a very short bowsprit no more than four feet long for the jibstay aft she had a selfdraining cockpit well protected by the vertical extensions of the cabin top and a sail locker in her canoe stern below she was conventional in her arrangement a roomy forecastle served mainly as a sail store aft of that there was a washroom and toilet to starboard a galley and pantry to port aft again came the saloon with the settees on each side and a table in the middle a small chart table was arranged against the forward bulkhead aft again there were two quarter berths the companion ladder leading up on deck and a small petrol motor underneath this ladder rather inaccessible shearwater was such a yacht as is to be found by the hundred cruising the south coast of england though rather better equipped than most john dermott led keith down below the linoleum on the deck of the galley and the washroom had been taken up and the floorboards lifted what was exposed to view was a smooth level floor of concrete into which the frames disappeared and in which the mast was stepped about two feet behind the mast step was a fairly deep rectangular recess in the concrete large enough to hold the copper box that dermott carried and about two inches deeper thats the place he said thats where i want to put it keith wrinkled his brows whats all this concrete doing here internal ballast said the naval officer they often do it like this pour it in when shes building and bury pig iron or any old scrap iron in it shed be too lively with all the ballast on the keel shes got about three tons of lead outside as well i never knew that said the mechanic whats this hole been left here for then i dont really know shes got another like it at the stern but thats used for a sump the bilge pump suction goes down into it perhapsthey thought shed want another sump up here i dont know she never makes any water anyway keith knelt down and fingered the concrete hole its a bit oily he remarked i think ill chip it a bit first clean it up and make a sort of rebate so itll hold he fetched his toolbag and set to work with hammer and cold chisel half an hour later he was mixing a little concrete of cement fine stones and sand he made a bed of it at the bottom of the hole greased the copper box and set it carefully in the middle then he filled in the spaces round it with the wet mixture working it carefully into the corners and the newly cut recesses look your last on it he said and covered it over with a smooth layer of the mix patting it working it with a little builders trowel taking up the surplus till it was smooth and level with the original concrete floor only the darker wetness of the new material showing the difference he gathered his tools and the remainder of the mix in newspaper cleaned up the mess and got up from his knees a little stiffly id leave the floorboards up for a day or so till its set hard he said itll take a week to harden properly but you can put the boards back his sister asked what do we do when we want to get it out keith just cut around the edge with a cold chisel and a hammer like this he said youll probably be able to see where the concretes a bit different but even if you cant itll sound hollow when you tap it with a hammer the top layer of concretell come off easy enough because its only an inch or so thick then when you can see the box youll have to cut around with the chisel till you can get it out you wont have any trouble he stayed for a cold lunch with them on board and while the meal was in preparation he examined the ship a short whitefaced plump little man completely out of his element he knew nothing of yachts and the sea she seemed to him to be cosy enough downstairs though a bit cramped upstairs he was confused by the complexity of her and by the unfamiliar materials the sisal nylon flax cotton hemp and teak he was unfamiliar with the sea vand did not like it much it was a place that made you cold and wet and sick his brotherinlaw was a sensible man in most ways though not in matters technical and he liked the sea so there must be something in it for some people though not for him they had asked him once or twice to go down with katie for a weekend on the yacht in the solent but he had always made excuses and they had not pressed the pbint the stewarts had their way of life and the dermotts had theirs after lunch john dermott drove keith into southampton and put him down at the west station to catch a train to london they would meet again before the dermotts started off across the world in shearwater they parted cordially the naval officer grateful to his dissimilar brotherinlaw for his help he drove back from southampton to hamble they would live on the yacht now till they sailed but for one last trip to london there was still much to be done he parked the car and went on board jo met him in the cockpit catch his train all right he nodded ten minutes to spare oh good ive just put on the kettle for a cup of tea they had their cups of tea sitting in the cockpit in the sun the naval officer glanced down into the forward end of the ship to the rolledback linoleum and the floorboards piled beside it the dark wetness of the concrete patch was already drying turning a lighter grey at the edges that would match the original surface well thats the most important job done he said with satisfaction i was worried about that but its all right now joanna nodded keiths awfully good at that sort of thing she said quickly when hes got somebody to tell him exactly what to do she seldom talked openly to him about her brother now in their shared satisfaction and relief that remark had slipped out he glanced at her i know he said not much initiative she sat silent for a minute poor old keith she said at last i always feel hes missed the boat somehow that ive had everything and hes had nothing everything he asked he was morbidly conscious of his truncated career of the failure inherent in his early retirement of the forty years of idleness that might lie ahead of him unless he could reorganize his life she knew what he was thinking and he mustnt think it she turned to him oh yes she said ive had janice and money and the navy and this boat and ive been to china and to italy and malta and now were going off across the world and well see the coral islands and hawaii and canada and the states ive had everything but poor old keith he goes on in that ghastly half a house in baling and just makes his models and gets practically nothing for them and katie has to work in the shop and hes so good at what he does it isnt fair he tried to comfort her i dont think hes unhappy no she agreed hes not nor katie either theyre neither of them a bit jealous of the things weve got i think its going to do janice a lot of good to be with them for a bit but hes so much better than i am he ought to have so very much morehe smiled wants somebody to put a squib up his behind he always has to be told what to do she agreed apart from making models he remarked he seems to be original enough in that yes she agreed but that doesnt get him anywhere keith stewart got to waterloo at about half past four and travelled out to baling broadway on the underground from there he took a tram to west baling and walked up to his house he got in about ten minutes before katie and put the macaroni cheese into the oven as she had told him to and took the mail from the letter box in the front door and shuffled it through there was one letter for her and eleven for him three from the united states he sighed a little you could produce an induced current on the surface of a metal sphere that would act as a gyroscope and from this you could devise a tiny automatic pilot for ship or aircraft models that would weigh only a few ounces he was aching to get on with the experimental work on that but first he had to write the last instalment of his serial upon the congreve clock after that this heavy mail must be dealt with and he would be too tired then and it would be too late to start off on experimental work he was already inclined to be sleepy from his unaccustomed day in the open air he sat with katie at the kitchen table over the macaroni cheese and the cups of strong tea get the light fixed up for them all right she asked the light and then he recollected oh the compass light yes fixed that for them whats it like in the boat she asked how do they cook anything its like a caravan he told her they cook on primus stoves oh with everything rocking about i suppose so it must be ever so uncomfortable i think it is he agreed it looks all right when shes tied up in calm water like she is now but even then she goes up and down a bit i dont know what its like when she gets out to sea where its rough wouldnt suit me would the water come in say in a storm i think it would of course shes all decked in i dont suppose that much would get inside it sounds awful i mean jo was saying that one of them must be on top to steer why do they want to go like that k i mean theyve got plenty of money why dont they take a cabin on a proper ship or else fly i dunno he said i think they just like doing it they sat in silence they would never understand the dermotts and there were times when they abandoned the attempt at last katie said they wont get shipwrecked will they keith shook his head thats one thing they wont do johns a naval officer and he knows all about it theyve got two sextants to take sights with to tell them where they are and all the rest of it theyll be safe enough but if you ask me theyll be darned uncomfortable katie gathered the plates together arid put them on the draining board im glad its not me going with them so am i he said i cant imagine anything much worse chapter two shearwater rolled lazily upon the ocean swell as she forged ahead under her twin spinnakers making about three knots and towing the logline behind her it was early in the morning and john dermott was taking a sight upon the sun on their port quarter dressed only in a pair of faded shorts jo sat at the tiller in blue jeans and shirt watch in hand and pad and pencil at her side taking the time for him they were three and a half months out from england and now it was the middle of november they had crossed the atlantic to barbados without incident though more slowly than they had anticipated they had been delayed a little in the west indies for a broken gooseneck to the boom and they had been delayed for a long time at panama after passing through the canal waiting for a permit from the ecuadorean government to call for water at the galapagos islands in the end they had sailed without a permit had watered at floreana without trouble and proceeded on their way they were thirtyfour days out from floreana and all was well they had not hurried on their way thirtysix hours previously they had lain hoveto all night rather than approach the island of reao in the darkness their first landfall in the tuamotu group of islands with the coming of the dawn they had seen cloud forming above it and had sailed close enough to see the tops of the trees then they had borne up and resumed their course towards the south and west leaving the island ten miles to the north they would not set foot on land until they reached the island of tahiti more than miles ahead they did not particularly want to do so they had settled into the rhythm of their life at sea the rain squalls the warm easy days the unending maintenance of sails and gear the cooking and the housework down below they had grown accustomed to this routine and liked it for john dermott it meant full occupation in the way of life that he preferred shore life to him was now a matter of frustration and unwanted idleness for jo this way of life meant a happy john she jotted down the altitudes as he called them out and the exact time from the watch in her hand and gave the pad to him he disappeared below to work the sight and plot it on the chart he came on deck again after ten minutes it was reao she asked it was reao all right he replied i think were getting set just a bit to the north though youre still steering two four zero she nodded make it two three five he said pinaki should be showing up upon the starboard bow before long i want to pass about ten miles south of it theres a bit of cloud there now she said he stood looking at the little white patch on the horizon with her could be he went below entered the change of course in the log and came up again with the handbearing compass and squatted on the cabin top with it sighting upon the cloud thats probably pinaki they sailed on all the morning over a long swell before a moderate southeast breeze under a hot sun shrouded by occasional clouds in good conditions such as these it was their habit to take their main meal in the middle of the day jo coqked a corned beef stew and an apple crumble from dried apples and they had it in the cockpjt then she went down to sleep in the middle of the afternoon the sky clouded over the wind got up suddenly and a vicious rain squall swept down on them they were accustomed to these shortlived tropical squalls and before it started john at the helm could see clear weather behind it he carried on the ship scudding before the strong breeze with everything taut and straining but a seam in the port spinnaker suddenly let go the sail ripped across and there was nothing but a flapping shambles of loose sail and wildly flailing boom across the foredeck forward of the mast john shouted but jo was already awake and coming out on deck to take the helm such incidents were part of their daily life and she was well accustomed to them by the time john had got the sail down and the boom under control the sudden wind had dropped down to a gentle breeze and they could see the squall driving away to leeward they set the mainsail and the second jib took in both spinnakers and went on jo went down to finish her sleep before taking the first watch and john spread out the damaged sail to dry in the cockpit with him while he measured and cut new sailcloth on his knees for the repair sailing the ship as he did so they sailed on easily all night under twin spinnakers they could perhaps have slept at the same time but running under the mainsail they had to steer the ship jo took the first watch until midnight sailing easily under a bright crescent moon with little to do but to keep awake she roused john as he had instructed her and he put on the primus and made cocoa they had it together in the cockpit before she handed over to him and went down to sleep at dawn they were still sailing easily she relieved him at the helm and presently when the sun was high enough he took another sight and went down to work out the position line when she saw him plotting it upon the chart down in the cabin she called out how do we go not bad he brought the chart to the companion and standing on the cabin ladder he showed it to her in the cockpit we must be about here he made a little cross upon the chart we mightbe a little south of the course now ill take a noon sight today i think and see if it makes sense he did not trust a sight with the sun practically overhead how far before we change course john he took the chart back to the chart table and measured with dividers and came back to the companion about forty miles sometime this evening if everything goes well they had been sailing substantially the same course since leaving the galapagos islands thirtyfive days before what will the new course be two hundred and seventy an easy one thats for tahiti he nodded i dont suppose the compass will work she said its probably got rusty and stuck up weve been on this one for so long he smiled like me to get breakfast no you come and take her ill get breakfast after that well have to mend that spinnaker he nodded well be bringing the wind more aft when we change course all morning they worked on the spinnaker together in the cockpit it was finished before the noon sight had to be taken but they did not set it for the wind was still well on the quarter the noon sight confirmed their position for what that was worth but when they went to check it with the reading of the log they found the line trailing idly the rotator had been taken by a fish they had left england with a dozen spare rotators and were now reduced to three they fitted one of these last ones and started to get dinner they slept in turns all afternoon in overcast rainy weather without much wind in the hot humidity they paid little attention to getting wet at the helm save to wear a hat to keep the rain out of their eyes the overcast sky prevented an evening sight john stood for a while at the chart table weighing the doubtful evidence of the noon sight and of the log the more certain evidence of the morning sight which did not give much indication of the latitude the landfall that they had made the day before at pinaki eight oclock he thought would be a convenient time for the change of course when jo took over for the first watch if the wind held as it was they would take in the main and the jib then and set the spinnakers they should be far enough by that time to make the turn but he was very conscious of the massed coral islands of the tuamotus over the horizon to the north he didnt want to get mixed up with that lot they followed on this plan and started to change sails at half past seven the wind still moderate from the eastsoutheast by eight oclock they had her settled under the twin spinnakers on the new course i think this deserves a drink he said at sea they drank little alcohol she smiled whisky and lime juice for me the compass seems to be working anyway they had the sheets of the spinnakers rigged to the tiller and the ship would steer herself before the wind without attention they watched her for a few minutes and then went down into the cabin and sat with their drinks in the light of the oil lamp what are the hazards john she asked he pulled the chart over and showed it to her ahunui he said he showed her the island should be about twenty miles to the north and abeam about three in the morning weprobably shant see it after that theres nothing much until tahiti they finished their drinks and put their heads out on deck at the companion the ship was sailing easily on course in a gentle breeze and a long swell the tiller moving now and then to the pull of the sheets in those waters there was little chance of meeting any other ship and they sailed without lights as one chore less to do they went below together and slept intermittently one or other being up on deck every hour or so all next day they sailed on placidly under the twin spinnakers and the next night the massed chain of islands constituting the tuamotus now lay a hundred miles to the north of them there was nothing in their path before tahiti and they were making good about ninety sea miles each day rain squalls came occasionally without much strength in them the barometer which john watched unobtrusively but closely pursued its regular diurnal variation according to the book they began to make plans for cleaning the ship up including themselves before entering the harbour of papeete jo had been reading the sailing directions for entering the port we can lie alongside there at the quai du commerce she said its going to be good for getting the stores in but well have to get everything all tiddley john said going to be bad for little boys spitting on the deck i think well lie off if we stay for any length of time on the second morning after they changed course the barometer displeased him it was two millibars lower than it should have been according to the book he tapped it gently mindful of the delicacy of the mechanism but it showed no difference jo was on deck at the helm when he made this discovery for the wind had got up a bit and was veering towards the south and shearwater was now careering along with the spinnakers at a cockeyed angle fore and aft and needed someone at the helm he bit his lip and looked again at the barometer but there was no sense in trying to argue with the evidence they were late at tahiti and the hurricane season was now on he sat down on his berth and turned to the sailing directions he knew the part about tropical revolving storms pretty well by heart for he was a careful seaman and had briefed himself before entering these waters he read the page again it fitted with his observations of the barometric pressure and the wind now it was up to him the wind had already veered a little so the centre of the storm if storm it was must lie away to the northeast miles away from them it would probably move westsouthwest towards them at about ten knots far faster than they could sailto escape it at some time it would turn towards the south the wind direction showed them to be south of its path now the course of safety was to run north and west before the increasing wind and north of them lay the coral islands of the tuamotus if they escaped the eye of the storm the wind would go on veering to the south and then to the southwest blowing them dead on a lee shore they must make towards the west every mile they could to gain sea room he put the book back in the bookcase and went on deck he looked around the spinnakers were straining it would be unwise to carry them much longer anyway he said to jo i think well put the trysail on her and take these in the trysail was their storm mainsail the trysail she asked barometers dropping a bit he said oh she knew the situation almost as well as he did want any help not yet he went below and bundled the heavy canvas up on deck through the forehatch brought it aft of the mast and began to reeve the lacing the halliard and the sheets it was work that he was well accustomed to and liked while you were doing something physical like that you couldnt worry about falling glass and veering winds he hoisted the sail in the calm air before the spinnaker and made the halliard fast and pulled the sheet out to the cockpit putting weight into the sail then he got down the lee spinnaker and then the weather stowing them both below finally he set the storm jib under the reduced canvas the yacht went more easily with little reduction in her speed he came aft to the cockpit jo asked is anything bad coming i dont know he said shes going all right like this anyway it was an hour since he had looked at the barometer he went below and found that it had dropped another point it was now three millibars below normal he went back to his wife at the helm i dont much like the look of it he said we may be in for something she smiled at him too bad she remembered that you steered in certain directions to avoid the path of a tropical storm but it was different in the northern and the southern hemispheres and all a bit complicated ought we to change course he shook his head i think well keep on as were going for a bit see what the wind does like me to take her she relinquished the helm to him i think ill go below and make some sandwiches and put some coffee in the thermoses if were in for something she knew storms all morning the wind rose steadily veering a little as it rose the sun grew weaker covered over with a thin layer of cloud before it disappeared for good john took a sight and came to the conclusion that they were in about latitude south longitude west the wind was now south of southeast blowing about force or rather more by noon the barometer was five millibars lower than the normal reading there was now no doubt of the position in his mind and he braced himself for what was coming the wind would continue veering to the south and would increase in strength driving them to the north on to the tuamotus a hundred and forty miles ahead of them and a little to the south of west lay an isolated atoll called hereheretue there was no harbour there no entrance to the lagoon and no safe landing in this weather yet if he could reach it he might shelter behind it from the fury of the storm using it as a breakwater in any event a more southerly course would take him farther from the tuamotus he altered course to and his ship went racing along with a beam wind making about six knots at that rate they would reach the shelter of the atoll in about twentyfour hours but from the first he doubted if they would make it they put on their waterproof storm clothing with bright orange lifejackets and waist lifelines that they could clip on to the rigging they locked the forehatch down and fitted the weatherboards over the glasses of the cabin skylight under the dinghy all day the wind increased and veered towards the south they could take in one reef in the trysail with a lacing round the boom and they took that in with difficulty towards evening with the reduced canvas they made much more leeway and now john dermott gave up the attempt to reach hereheretue with the last of the light he backed the foresail a little and hove his vessel to on the port tack in the increasing wind she lay fairly quietly making about two knots to leeward in the direction of the tuamotus at any rate he thought they had made some useful offing they sat together in the cabin dimly lit by the swaying oil lamp turned down low because it smoked with the motion listening to the crash of the seas against the bow as the vessel rode the waves jo asked where do you think we are john he showed her on the chart its a bad one this isnt it she asked he nodded the worst weve ever had it might be he admitted til tell you when its over i suppose its because were late in getting here she said she had known in theory that hurricanes were apt to happen in those waters from november onwards now that theoretical knowledge was being translated into fact were not so late as all that he said a little resentfully this is an early one she knew that he had first proposed that they should leave england in june we had to see janice settled for the summer holidays he nodded we couldnt have started any earlier presently they lay down on their berths to get what rest they could from time to time dermott got up and put his head out of the hatch the wind seemed stronger every tune he looked and the sea higher each time the ships head pointed on the wildly veering average a little more towards the west and north at about three in the morning there was a great crack the ships motion changed and a wild beating of heavy canvas was heard above them they tumbled out on deck and saw in the light of a flashlight through the flying scud that the jib had gone only the bolt ropes remained with tattered streamers of canvas flying from them without the jib the ship had come up to the wind and the heavy blocks of the trysail sheets were flailing the cockpit threatening death to anybody in their way without the jib he could not lie the vessel to in such a wind he shouted to jo to get a warp from the forecastle and went forward carefully himself on deck clipping his lifeline on to something fresh at every two or three steps at the mast he slacked off the main halliard and let the trysail down and quietened it with the warp that jo had brought up to him from below they furled the trysail on the main boom wrapping it round with the rope without any sail at all the yacht now lay rolling wildly in the trough of the waves safe enough for the time being but blowing to the north john dermott sent his wife below to get some rest and stayed in the cockpit himself to watch his vessel and assess the situation the wind was now only about a point to the east of south and this was good so far as it went for it indicated that the centre of the storm might pass southwards of them the sea however was rising very high in the grey of the dawn it seemed to be breaking everywhere around him he judged that his ship was drifting to the north at the rate of three to four knots the line of the tuamotus to the north of him ran about northwest to southeast the more he could get towards the west the more searoom he would have to the north he took the helm and set himself to sail his vessel under bare poles as much towards the west as he could manage he found that he could steer about northwest upon his compass paralleling the line of islands and at that he seemed to make about five knots with the wind on his quarter but now running in that way the seas behind were menacing and occasionally the top of one came on board lukewarm flooding the cockpit and drenching the helmsman from below jo put the fashionboards in the companion how are we doing she asked all right he said if we can keep going like this i think well be all right its doing what they tell you in the book anyway deep in his heart he knew that they could not maintain that course much longer at seven oclock in the increasing wind and sea he could no longer run towards the west taking the seas upon his quarter without fear of broaching to and being overwhelmed by the rising sea each time a big sea came and they now came very often he had to run off before it taking it dead sternon so that now he was making about five knots towards the tuamotus in the north this could not go on he had a sea anchor in the forecastle a conical canvas drogue stiffened by a hoop of iron and he called jo up from below to come and take the helm while he rigged this thing shearwater was a cutter with a shape below the waterline thatwas cut away at the bow and deep at the rudder making her easy to tack and manoeuvre in the narrow seas and waterways of the solent for which she had been primarily designed running before the wind she was very stable by reason of the windage of the mast but held up to the wind by a sea anchor from the bow she would not be good unlikely to lie closer than fortyfive degrees to wind and sea she had a canoe stern however fairly well tucked up he decided to put out his sea anchor from the stern battening the companion down and retiring below using the forehatch for getting out on deck he bent his heaviest warp on to the sea anchor made the other end fast around both pairs of stern mooring bitts and put the drogue overboard taking a turn of the warp round one of the bitts as he paid out to ease the strain the warp strained like a bowstring as the drogue sank in and took hold of the water then the ship slowed the strain eased and he paid out the remainder slowly he sent jo below and stood himself on the companion steps for a while behind the fashionboards his head out of the hatch watching the seas the ship was riding well to her sea anchor her buoyant stern lifting to the seas so that little came on board the wind had steadily increased however and he judged that now it was blowing at about force it was so strong that it seemed to be blowing the tops off the seas in the form of flying scud beneath the heavily overcast sky flattening the very seas the warp stretched taut behind the vessel to the submerged drogue hard as a bar with this increasing wind the speed of the ship through the water did not seem to be very much reduced she still seemed to be making about three knots towards the north visibility was now only a few hundred yards he went below and secured the companion hatch behind him in the cabin it was dark and stuffy lit only by one small glass port tight shut at the galley and another at the companion he went forward and lifted the forehatch a little letting some air into the ship and then came back and sat upon his berth opposite jo he pulled the chart over to him from the chart table and sat studying it jo leaned across in the dim light where do you think we are he did not know with any certainty i should say were about here he laid his finger on the chart actually he was farther to the north and not so far to the west but he did not know that what happens next she asked well just have to lie like this now till it moderates he said i think the centre will pass south of us how long before it moderates she asked two days i should think he said two days maybe three have we got that much room she asked he shook his head no he said no i dont think we have too bad she smiled a little and then said tell me do you think were going to pile her up he glanced up at her i hope not he replied he ran his fingers down the line of the tuamotus the line of islands isnt very thick and theres deep water all between them we can steer her a bit downwind running if theres any visibility we should be able to run through them he paused and then said a little bitterly like a drunk crossing the traffic in the strand we arent drunk she said gently a bit out of luck perhaps but not drunk he glanced at her im sorry about this jo well be all right she said lie down and get some sleep they lay down and rested if not slept the motion of the ship was too violent for any cooking but in the course of the afternoon jo managed to light a primus and to brew some strong sweet chocolate and this revived them a little she still had a few sandwiches left but neither of them could eat the bilge water was slopping over the cabin floor inevitably a wooden ship will leak a little under such strains and in the last two days a good deal of water had found its way below in the middle of the afternoon john dermott decided to pump the ship out he pulled up the floorboards near the engine and left jo to keep the suction clear of any debris in the bilge and went out on deck himself by the forehatch he was startled and concerned at the strength of the wind now and the steepness of the seas behind them as the yachts stern rose upon the forward slope of each great wave the warp to the sea anchor stretched out taut behind her the wafer pattering off it with the strain then the crest passed the surf filling the cockpit and the rope relaxed he crept aft on hands and knees on deck against the wind and the loose surf of each wave crest that slapped at him with each step he refastened his lifeline for the danger of being swept overboard was now a real one he gained the cockpit but he did not immediately begin to pump the ship the sea anchor warp was more urgent and he turned his attention to that he had wrapped three teacloths around the rope at the stern fairhead tying them to the warp with marline to take the chafe they were just about worn through he cut the marline working mostly under water and remade the packing the rope below the cloths did not seem to be damaged he crouched waist deep in water in the flooded cockpit watching it for a time everything seemed to be holding but the strain was immense if the sea anchor went or when it went there would then be nothing to be done but to come to the helm and steer the ship running under bare poles before the storm towards the islands he turned and started work upon the pump there was a little opening glass porthole in the aft side of the cabin top by the companion and from time to time jo opened this to tell him how the water level was before shutting it again it took him about an hour to clear the ship of water sitting mostly in lukewarm water up to the waist in the force of the gale by the time he had finished and the pump had sucked he was exhausted but he did not immediately go forward to the hatch he made another inspection of the sea anchor warp it looked all right he sat for a time looking round the horizon an early dusk was creeping down upon the scene he could see nothing but blown spray and breaking towering seas he did not think he could see farther than about two hundred yards there was nothing to indicate the presence of land but then he knew there wouldnt be until they saw and heard the breakers he glanced around at his ship she seemed to be in perfect condition but for the tatters of the sail upon the jibstay the helm swung quietly and loose the ends of halliards and sheets were streaming overboard they did not matter seeing the strength and order of his ship he felt suddenly tired as usual he thought the ship was stronger than the people in her he took a final glance at the compass the wind had gone round farther and was now west of south blowing harder than ever the eye of the storm would pass to the south of them now though pretty close before the wind eased it would haul round into the west before then he knew they would be in among the tuamotus he left the cockpit and crawled forward to the forehatch waited his chance then opened it and slipped below pulling it down behind him he was shivering a little more from fatigue and shock than from cold they heated up the remainder of the cocoa and drank that and then lay down fully clothed with lifebelts on in their sodden clothes upon their sodden berths there was nothing further to be done on deck it was more important now to conserve their strength darkness came swiftly but they did not attempt to light the lamp they had electric torches and there were still dry spare batteries in sealed tins they lay trying to rest listening to the struggle of the ship the wash of waves along the deck over their heads and the insensate screaming of the wind presently they may have slept a little at about ten oclock john dermott went out on deck again to adjust the wrappings round the warp conditions were similar but it was dark as pitch and raining hard or so it seemed to him for it was only possible to distinguish rain from the blown spume by taste he worked largely by feel renewed the wrappings and returned down below well have to stand a watch as soon as it gets light he said we may be getting pretty close to something by tomorrow would you like me to go up now he shook his head were all right for tonight you cant see anything up there anyway hardly the ships length whats the wind doing seems to be a bit more over in the west they lay down on their berths again but not for the whole night soon after midnight the yacht surged forward on the forward slope of a wave a motion they were well accustomed to and did not check her run instead she went surging forward wildly and then round in a crazy turn to port throwing john out on to the cabin floor then she was thrown oh her beam ends and buried in the seas everything fell down on to the starboard side within the cabin john on top of jo in a mass of tins books tools bedding sextants and cooking gear the ship lay on her side for what seemed an age till gradually she rose again as they struggled free and to their feet in a foot of water over the cabin deck they knew what had happened the vessel had broached to in fact the sea anchor warp had chafed and parted at the drogue end and now the yacht was lying broadside on and at the mercy of the waves they ripped the companion hatch back and struggled into the cockpit and as they did so she went over again in a breaking sea she came up again more slowly sluggishly and they were both still there in the cockpit the companion hatch had been half open and she had taken much water in through it she now lay heavily and sluggishly at least a foot deeper in the water in the trough of the waves but dermott had the helm now and was steering her round downwind and jo had slammed the hatch shut and bolted it when the next wave came they took it sternon and she rose to it with far less than her normal buoyancy but rise she did the top of the crest swept green across them but they did not broach again there was now a little faint light on the scene probably due to the moon above the clouds john said quietly start pumping jo well take it in turns she bent to the pump and began the endless backbreaking motion on the handle presently he gave her the helm and took the pump himself so they continued alternately pumping and steering for the rest of the night while the wind screamed around them and the surf beat on them from time to time the suction blocked with debris in the bilge then john had to wait his chance to open the companion hatch for a moment to get down into the flooded cabin shut the hatch above him and working with his hands and arms deep in the water in pitch darkness clear the pump the night passed like this but when the grey cold light began to make things visible the ship was buoyant again almost clear of water in the cockpit as they rested jo asked did you think wed had it that time john i dont know that i had time to think of anything except getting her straight and running he replied when we got her running i knew that we were going to make it all right she said ive been thinking so much about janice dont he said gently well have her with us in a month or two if we get out of this well get out of it all right he said but if anything should happen if we buy it she couldnt be with anybody better than katie and keith theyll look after her she said but shes only ten and john they havent any money shell have money he repliedits all left in trust to keith for her until shes twentyfive shell get as good an education as anyone can get and after that shell have a good lump sum dont you remember how we made our wills but john she wont have anything weve got it all here he stared at her in the half light i never thought of that this was another disaster that had come upon him and one that hit him far harder than any that had come so far the approach of the storm the parting of the jib the chafing of the sea anchor warp the broaching to the nearness of the tuamotus these were challenges to his seamanship when you went to sea and crossed the world in a small yacht you wagered your courage and your skill against the elements with your life as the stake and if you were good you usually won it was what you went to sea for in this game if you didnt like the game you neednt play it he had wanted to play it because the sea was his whole life and jo had wanted to play it with him because she loved him now suddenly and without warning his small childs future had been added to the stake inevitably perhaps he held strongly rightwing views he was a conservative in politics he held that if a man worked hard and well and saved money he had a right to pass some of it on to his children especially if they were girlsi who usually got a raw deal anyway he approved of moderate death duties because he did not hold that grandchildren should live in idleness because grandfather had worked all people ought to work as he had worked for the navy himself he held however that it was the duty and the right of every decent man to give his children as good a start in life as he had had himself he had been blessed with money from the start and he had tried to use it wisely and to save it for his child so that she should grow up in the way of life he was accustomed to that she should go to the council school and be fed and clothed by charity was quite unthinkable joanna did not follow him in all of this for twenty years she had lived as a naval officers wife and she had absorbed a good deal of it but she had come from a labourers home and had gone to the council school herself in renfrew she had raised herself when she went on to the stage with a serious wellmanaged troupe of girls she had raised herself again when she had married john dermott in many ways she was now more conservative than he the slum streets and the council school were not terrifying novelties to her for she had come from them but she had long been determined that janice was going to have no part of them she had borne janice into a different world a world of naval officers and impoverished noblemen in northern ireland and she was going to stay there as the full daylight came they could see the binnacle and see that the wind was now about westsouthwest by their compass at the same time it had risen higher than ever and was now screaming in their ears deafening them so that john judged it to be force or more the sky cleared with the morning so that they could see much farther than before and away to the south there seemed to be a line of blue sky just above the sea john pointed it out to jo and put his lips to her cold ear thatll be the eye of the storm he shouted passing south of us he nodded there were no great waves now just a smoking hissing sea flattened by the insensate torrent of the wind to talk was an effort and a strain it was better to conserve their strength they sat in silence each busy with their thoughts turning over slowly in their stunned minds john dermott was thinking always of the ship she was still sound and practically undamaged the mainsail and the trysail were still lashed firm upon the boom ready for use no sails could stand a minute in such wind it was no good thinking about them there was one resource still left to them however they still had a little engine he had scant faith in it but it was there in dead calm weather it would give the ship a speed of about four knots for going in and out of harbour or up windless estuaries but the wind was now blowing sixty knots or more this puny little engine if he could make it work could not affect the major issues of their course yet if he could get it going it might serve to pull them out of trouble somehow it was the last resource still left unused he gave the helm to jo and went below shutting the companion after him in the light of bis torch he saw that the battery had been thrown from its crate when the ship broached to and was lying on its side everything was streaming with seawater he stood the battery upright checked the leads and tried a light switch there was the faintest of red glimmers from the filament which faded as he watched there was no help in the starter he wiped the magneto and the plug leads with a wet handkerchief having searched in vain for a dry cloth and tried her on the handle for a quarter of an hour he laboured over her and never got a kick finally he gave up the effort and went back on deck there was no help in the engine while he was below jo sat at the helm in dull despair the huge efforts needed to pull the tiller continuously one way or the other to keep the ship sternon to the seas were draining the last of her strength she could still make them mechanically but she was now near collapse there was no ending to this storm and would not be for days and days and days the ship might see it through if she had fresh hands at the helm but they would not she was near failure now she knew half an hour longer or perhaps an hour and she would be no longer able to swing the tiller then the ship would broach to and lie swept by every sea they would be drowned shearwater would fill and sink and janices future would sink with her she was too tired now to care about themselves but janice was a sharp pain keith would look after her and bring her up and he would do it well but he would have to bring her up into his own way of life not theirs at sixteen she would have to start work in a shop john dermott came back to the cockpit and took the helm from her no good he shouted in her ear she shouted back wont it go he shook his head and feghe settled down beside him listless about the middle of the morning something in the water ahead drew johns attention he gave the helm to jo and stood up against the companion the wind tearing at his clothing lashed by the spray visibility was between one and two miles there was something different half a mile or so ahead of him the backs of the seas looked different in some way then over to the left a little in a quick passing glimpse he saw what looked like the tops of palm trees above the waves he turned with a heavy heart and went back to his wife there seems to be an island dead ahead he shouted i think were driving down on to a reef she nodded she was now past caring he took her hand im sorry about this jo she smiled at him it doesnt matter can you take her a bit longer he asked i want to see if we can dodge it she nodded and he stood up again by the companion it was clearer now for they were closer what he had seen was the backs of great combers breaking on a coral reef the line of different surf extended both on port and starboard hands as far as he could see he searched desperately for a break in the surf something to indicate a passage through the reef into the sheltered lagoon that might lie beyond if there were any break he would try to steer her off and run in through it even though they might be overwhelmed in the process he could see no break at all it all looked just the same on either hand as far as he could see there was no escape for them now shearwater was driving straight on to a coral reef in the tuamotus somewhere and would leave her bones upon the coral as many a tall ship had done before he had not the remotest idea where they were he came back to her and took the helm in bad moments in the last fortyeight hours he had imagined this situation and had thought it out better to take the coral straight headon than to be thrown on to it on their beam ends to have the hull crushed like an eggshell by the fury of the waves better to take it headon taking the shock on the lead keel and trying to keep sternon to the sas reefs were seldom uniform in height if they had the luck to strike a fissure a patch where in calm water the coral was a couple of feet or more below the surface they might possibly be driven over it into the lagoon and still float and live he bent to explain this to his wife i want you to go below he shouted when we strike stay in the hull shell probably get full of water but stay in the hull just keep your head above the water but stay inside she shouted what are you going to do im going to stay up here and steer her on ill join you down below as soon as she strikes its our best chance i dont think shell break up if she breaks up shell stay on the reef wont she he knew what was in her mind the keel will and probably the frames he paused and then leaned across and kissed her now go belowtm sorry to have got you into this she kissed him in return its not your fault she stood up waited her chance opened the hatch and slipped down below leaving it open for him to follow her she sat down on one of the settees the firstaid box in her hands there were now only a few minutes to go she thought she ought to say a prayer but it seemed mean to have neglected god and her religion for so long and then to pray when death was imminent the words would not come she could only think of janice janice whose future happiness lay buried in the concrete beneath her feet the concrete would survive upon the coral reef but nobody would ever know of it but keith keith who had never made much of his life keith who had never been anywhere or done anything keith to whose keeping she had trusted janice from the cockpit john dermott shouted above the screaming of the wind next one jo in those last moments the power of prayer came to her and she muttered in the accents of her childhood lord gie keith a bit o guid sense then they struck chapter three at about eleven in the morning the telephone hell rang upstairs keith stewart stopped his lathe wiped his hands and went up the narrow wooden stairs to answer it the girl said mr stewart this is gordon and carpenter just one moment mr carpenter is calling in a moment the solicitor came on the line keith had met him once before a heavy methodical man whose office was in bedford square he said mr stewart have you had any news of your brotherinlaw and your sister do you know if they have reached tahiti yet i havent heard anything not since they left panama nor have i i would have thought that theyd have cabled their arrival by this time it seemed an unnecessary extravagance to keith an air letter would do thats what theyve been sending all along yes i know the airmail to tahiti is very infrequent though all mail seems to be infrequent to tahiti theyre building an airport there now but its not working yet i would have expected a cable to say they had arrived but you havent heard anything no i havent they should be there by this time though shouldnt they the last letter i had was from panama posted on september agth commander dermott says in that they expect to arrive in papeete on november aoth well here we are and its december ist we should have heard something by now they discussed the possibilities of delay in arrival and delay in mails for a minute or two finally mr carpenter said theres no british consul in papeete i think ill send the governor a short cable asking if theres any news of their arrival keith went back to his lathe vaguely disquieted he had a great respect for johns solicitor in his lifetime he had never had much to do with the law he had met solicitors from time to time some that he had met in pubs were clearly not so good others had been better one had come to see him once because he was making the little burrell traction engine and was in trouble with the governor and because of that he had handled the purchase of the baling house for keith mr carpenter johns solicitor was different again part of the wider world johns world infinitely competent and infinitely courteous keith would have hesitated to suggest that mr carpenter should take his work when katie came in she gave janice and keith their tea and then he read an enid blyton book to janice for half an hour till it was time for her to have her bath and go to bed katie looked after that and he went down to his desk in the basement to write an article about fusible plugs he sat for a long time fingering the four little screwed pieces that had been loaded with the different solders the paper ready to his hand but the words would not come it was incredible that anything could have happened when janice was safely in bed in the room beside his workshop he went upstairs and told katie all about it in the parlour i dont think anything could have happened he said uneasily its just that they havent got there yet katie said they wouldnt have got jammed among all that ice would they he knew that she had it in her mind that john and jo had taken a course somewhere over the north pole but how she had got hold of that idea he did not know he pulled out the school atlas that they had they didnt go that way he explained its hot the way they went he turned to the map of the pacific down here he traced the route from panama to tahiti with his finger oh i remember it looks an awful long way keith all that blue would mean its sea wouldnt it thats right he said it is a long way he studied the longitudes with an eye well accustomed to calculations its its seventyfive degrees thats more than a fifth of the way round the world he checked the figures in wonder she stared at him all in one trip i mean not landing anywhere in all that way i dont think so well they might take any time i mean the wind might be against them i suppose so he said doubtfully i think its quite all right still wed better not say anything in front of janice there couldnt be anything wrong though could there i dunno i dont like that mr carpenter sending cables all about the world dont look as though hes any too happy for the next two days he was restless and ill at ease mainly because he felt himself to be quite incapable of assessing the situation he knew nothing about yachts or the sea the oceans to him were something painted blueupon the pages of the atlas and no more he had never been out of england he had sailed once on an afternoons excursion in an old paddle steamer from wevmouth to lul worth cove a distance of six miles he had liked the look of the cliffs from the water but had been appalled at the machinery and interested in its antiquity till the smells of the engine room coupled with the slight motion of the vessel made him sick he knew that this experience was no guidance for assessing any hazards that might lie around his sister on her voyage and his ignorance distressed and worried him mr carpenter rang him up again on the morning of the rd mr stewart he said i wonder if you could come up and see me ive got an answer to that cable and theres a good deal that i think we should discuss have they got to tahiti not yet said the solicitor im having further inquiries made out there but in the meantime i would like to see you if you could look in i can come up now if you like said keith i dont punch a clock they fixed a time keith took off his apron and washed his hands put on his dark suit and started off towards the bus it was raining with a cold december drizzle he wore a greasy old raincoat and an equally greasy old soft hat he had a shabby muffler round his throat he was pale with lack of sun and exercise and running a bit to fat he looked as he sat in the trolley bus taking him to baling broadway like any one of thousands of men to be seen in buses in any industrial district and he was he got to the solicitors office at about half past eleven and he was shown straight in mr carpenter got up from his desk to meet him i told you that i had an answer to that cable mr stewart he said directly im afraid it isnt very satisfactory he passed the flimsy to keith who could not read it without the steelrimmed spectacles he always had to use for close work he undid his shabby coat fumbled for his spectacle case and put them on the cable was in english and it read natives from kautatva island report small vessel wrecked in hurricane november th on reef off marokota island bodies one man one woman buried marokota stop shearwater now much overdue making further enquiries administration papeete the solicitor watching closely saw the fat pallid lips quiver a little the shabby little man stood motionless staring at the cable sit down mr stewart he said gently im afraid this isnt very good news he went on talking as was his habit upon these occasions theres nothing very definite in that he said as you see it seems to be just a rumour brought to tahiti by natives from another island we cant come to any conclusion till we get more renews keith sat down heavily loosening his muffler its terrible he muttered i never thought anything like this could happen we must hope that it isnt true the solicitor said i thought it was sufficiently serious to ask you to come up though i didnt want to read this out to you upon the telephone keith said thank you sir he raised his eyes ive got their daughter staying with us in the flat he said ill have to tell her wont i how old is she twelve is it ten only ten the solicitor tightened his lips if its true shell have to be told some time mr stewart he said i should talk it over with your wife when youve had time to think this over for a little you may decide its better to wait until the news is definite keith asked you think its definite now dont you i mean you think theyve been drowned i think the governor thinks its definite mr carpenter said carefully i dont think that he would have cabled quite in those terms unless he was fairly sure keith laid the cable down upon the desk its got to happen to us all some day he said its when it happens suddenly to your own people it comes as a bit of a blow i know the solicitor picked up a sheaf of papers from his desk i dont know if you want to talk about the future just now mr stewart or if you would rather come up again when we know more if unhappily your sister and her husband should be dead a new set of circumstances comes into being as you probably know i know they wanted us to take care ofjanice if anything happened keith said it might be better if we talk about that now you know the contents of their wills i think so they wanted me to be trustee or something i said i would yes that was at our previous meeting in this office it was after that meeting that i drew up these wills he handled them upon the desk before him they are very simple wills mr stewart i dont think i should show them to you till the deaths are established but as you are already acquainted with the most important features i think we can discuss what may arise from them he paused both wills are in identical terms as perhaps you know that seems to make it immaterial which spouse died first each will leaves the entire estate to the surviving spouse if the spouse should be already dead then the entire estate passes to the daughter janice to be held in trust for her until she attains the age of twentyfive you are appointed the sole trustee and you and i are appointed joint executors to the wills in consideration of your trusteeship you are to receive the sum of one thousand pounds from the estate he paused if the daughter should decease before the expiration of the trust or if she should be already dead you receive the same legacy of one thousand pounds but the balance of the estate passes back to the dungannon family that means id have to sort of look after the money for her and give it her when she gets to be twentyfive does it that is correct mr stewart both wills name you as the guardian of the child janice and both wills appoint you as die sole trustee you would have to invest the money for her in certain selected securities that we call trustee stocks and you would devote the interest to her education and general benefit during the period of the trust in case of necessity you have power to realize some of the capital for her benefit ive never had to do anything like that before keith said doubtfully the solicitor nodded you may need a little help i realize that if you have confidence in your own solicitor he would be the best person to assist you otherwise i should be glad to mr cannon had made a nice little model of the burrell traction engine but privately keith did not think that he had handled the purchase of the house at baling any too well it had taken a long time and there had been trouble with the council over the alterations which might not have been his fault id be grateful if its not putting you out he meant if the scale of the business was worth the time of a man like mr carpenter do you know how much money there might be the solicitor turned over the papers on his desk i hold a power of attorney both for your sister and for her husband he said i know ofthree bank accounts your sister has an account at southsea your brotherinlaw has one at alverstoke and he has another at the head office of the bank here in london in throgmorton st when i began to get troubled about their non arrival at tahiti i wrote to all three banks for a statement of account and a list of securities that they might be holding on behalf of my clients using the power of attorney he paused the throgmorton st office report a credit balance of fiftysix pounds eighteen shillings and fourpence he said your brotherinlaws account at alverstoke is three pounds four shillings and tenpence in credit your sisters account in southsea shows a debit balance that is to say an overdraft of four pounds sixteen shillings and fivepence adding those up there seems to be a total credit balance of fiftyfive pounds six shillings and ninepence all three banks state that they are holding no securities keith stared at him but thats daft i mean theyve got more than fiftyfive pounds i have always imagined so myself said mr carpenter i must say at the moment i am perplexed do you know of any other bank accounts that they might have had or where they might have deposited their securities keith shook his head they never talked of things like that not to me anyway oh i had hoped that you might have the answer thesolicitor paused in thought i have a number of commander dermotts papers in my keeping he remarked when he gave up his flat he left a suitcase full of receipts and correspondence with me with instructions to send it to him later on in canada or wherever he decided to settle probably i shall find the answer in that he thought for a moment he certainly told me that the contents were receipts and correspondence but probably the share certificates themselves are there i shall have to look and see thats where theyll be said keith do you know how much money they might have left i mean if they are dead commander dermott gave me to understand that the estate would be between twenty and twentyfive thousand pounds thats about what i thought said keith they left it that they would meet again when mr carpenter had received further news from the administration in papeete by which time he hoped to have found the missing securities keith lunched absentmindedly in a lyons cafeteria and went back all the way to baling down oxford street through netting hill gate and shepherds bush on top of a bus deeply troubled in his mind he had loved his sister though in recent years he had seen little of her and he had felt honoured when john dermott had suggested that he should be their trustee and guardian of their daughter rather than one of their naval friends or one of their relations in northern ireland they had chosen him he knew because of his stable life because he was always there in the same place with the same wife doing the same things the dungannons fell in and out of marriage with the greatest alacrity and savoirfaire their naval friends were apt to uproot and go to kenya or hong kong they knew that through wars and rumours of war whatever happened in the greater world keith stewart would go on living at no somerset road baling because his workshop was there built up and established over the years to uproot all his machine tools and remove the whole of his equipment to another house would mean a dislocation to his work that was unthinkable he was anchored firmly in the same place by his workshop and by his own inclinations he got back to his house an hour before janice was due back from school his mind full of his little niece if her parents were indeed dead they would have to tell her but he could not imagine how they were going to do it katie might have some ideas katie was good with children his mind ranged on beyond the bad halfhour to the part that he could play janice would have to have something to play with to take her mind off death a dolls house she already had one and was getting a bit old for it a bicycle not old enough and children didnt seem to have them nowadays perhaps because of the traffic a scooter somerset road was a quiet bystreet that carried no through traffic she could use a scooter there and be in no danger and it would take her out of doors and keep her warm his rnind ranged over the job he had a couple of eightinch rubbertyred wheels left over from a little traction engine passenger truck and he could bore them out to take a ball race each side inchandaquarter steel tube for the steering head parallel fiveeighths tubes for the frame he could braze that up in no time make the handlebars first because they would have to be chrome plated he had some red paint for the rest of it which would make it look gay he went down to the workshop directly he got home and took the little bronze sphere of the automatic pilot from the bench and packed it carefully away in rags in an old cigar box with its tiny transistor rectifier and the delicate relays clearing the decks for a more mundane job and started work upon the handlebars better to work at something than to sit thinking of joanna and their childhood together in the renfrew streets when janice came in he suggested that she should draw a farm with all the animals for him and he took her down with him to the workshop and settled her down at his desk with a large sheet of paper clearing away letters from cornwall and colchester and california to make a space for her he went on working at the handlebars which were too immature as yet to draw her notice and as he worked he measured her furtively with his eye for the height of the steering head thirtytwo inches from the ground from time to time he stopped work to admire her picture that evening after janice was in bed he told katie all about it this chap in this place papeete the governor he thinks theyre dead he said heavily theres no doubt of that it might have been some other boat she suggested they buried two people he replied a man and a woman on this other island maro something or other they looked for it on the atlas unavailingly ought we to tell her he asked she shook her head not now wait till we know for sure shes not old enough for things not being certain i started to make her a scooter he said ill keep it under cover all in bits until we know thatll be nice for her she said she can use it up and down the pavement not in the road he told her about the missing securities hell find them all right he said i mean they must be there somewhere they couldnt have taken them with them in the boat thats possible he remarked they might have done that but then that wouldnt matter because theyd still be the owner of the shares in companies in england or where have you it just means that the lawyers would have to get copies be a bit more expense the money would be there just the same she did not fully understand this but let it pass until its all squared up though theres just fiftyfive pounds he nodded not much to bring her up on not in the way theyd want but itll be all right the money must be somewhere its enough she said shed live with us till shes grown up like as if she was our own kid i dont want any money with her be a bit tight he said she smiled well manage he was content with that if katie said that they could manage it was so he himself had never cared much about money or wanted it or taken any interest in it except so far as it controlled the equipment of his workshop that was very largely over now the tools he had would last his lifetime and only minor additions would be necessary from time to time he was content to take what income he could derive from the work he loved and live on that without complaint the management of the miniature mechanic knew all about him and gave him just enough to keep him in a very modest way of life the finances of their magazine allowing no more he kept no car drank very little and hardly smoked at all each year they took a fortnights summer holiday in cornwall and went for motorcoach rides but that was only possible because katie worked she managed all of their finances and saved about a hundred pounds a year for the gradual repayment of the mortgage it was a week before mr carpenter rang again again at about ten oclock in the morning he said i have a further cable from the governor in papeete mr stewart could you come up and see me again do you think keith said ill come up right away can you tell me whats in the cable not very good news i am afraid oh theyre dead are they i am afraid so the vessel that went on the reef at marokota island was undoubtedly shearwater they have some of the clothing from the bodies keith said dully til come up right away sir he was sitting with the solicitor in bedford square an hour and a half later reading the cable there doesnt seem to be any doubt about it now he said this full report he says hes sending we havent had that yet i suppose mr carpenter shook his head this only came in during the night well thats the end of it he sat in silence fear a minute well have to tell janice now i am afraid so the solicitor paused and then said if i may speak from my experience dont be too much influenced by the childs first reaction mr stewart it will be very painful because there will be floods of tears they will go on for a day and then they will dry up a childs wounds heal very quickly or appear to anyway the thing is patience and enduring kindness the engineer glanced at him gratefully i know ive been making her a scooter a scooter you know what kids have to push about on with one foot ive got it painted red she hasnt seen it yet a very good idea mr stewart you say you made it yourself keith nodded i can do that sort of thing how fortunate you are the solicitor turned back to the papers on his desk i have been going into my clients financial affairs since i saw you last he said i am afraid they are rather unsatisfactory you havent been able to find the securities the securities that john dermott held were all sold mr stewart between february and april of this year the proceeds were paid into the throgmorton st branch of his bank they totalled he glanced at a paper twentysix thousand eight hundred and fortyfour pounds eleven shillings and tenpence whats happened to that money then between march and the end of may said the solicitor cheques were drawn in favour of a firm called rosenblaum and franck totalling twentyseven thousand nine hundred and thirtyeight pounds sixteen and twopence he raised his eyes and looked at keith rosenblaum and franck are dealers in precious stones mr stewart principally diamonds i think they are quite a reputable firm keith stared at him what on earth did they want with those mr carpenter said i know no more than you do mr stewart but i have talked to a partner in the firm mr franck what did he say the solicitor leaned back in his chair mr franck is still a youngish man under forty i would say he told me that he knew commander dermott well he served under him in the recent war when he would have been between twenty and twentyfive years old he has a very high opinion of your brotherinlaw i am telling you this in order that you may understand the background of this business he paused i would say that elias franck is a jew and a very good one he inherited the family business from his father he told me that commander dermott came to him last spring and wanted to buy diamonds that would be readily saleable in any part of the world mr franck told me that they sometimes getinquiries of that sort and in such cases they avoid asking questions it is no business of theirs what the purchaser wishes to do with the gems their business is to sell precious stones in london keith nodded i see they dont want to get mixed up in anything exactly the solicitor went on commander dermott bought diamonds to the value i have stated twentyseven thousand pounds odd and took them away with him just like that mr carpenter inclined his head mr franck tells me that he was very careful in his selection of the gems for commander dermott on account of the sincere regard that he feels towards him he thinks that your brotherinlaw might well make money on the resale and if the diamonds should come again upon the market he would like to have the first refusal of the business he paused there is just one other thing commander dermott asked him for the name of a reputable broker on the west coast of america mr franck gave him an introduction to a firm in which he has confidence in los angeles he paused i have been wondering if commander dermott took those diamonds with him in the yacht keith stared at him i suppose he might have done but why should he want to do a thing like that mr carpenter sat in thought for a minute i can only surmise mr stewart he said but as i understand the matter it was the intention of your brotherinlaw to settle permanently in the dollar area perhaps in british columbia there are restrictions on the transfer of capital from england to the dollar area as perhaps you know under the present regulations your brotherinlaw could only have transferred a very small part of his capital into dollars each year it might have taken ten years or more to transfer the whole of it you think he bought diamonds and took them with him in the yacht to sell themin america and get his capital that way i think it possible did he ever tell you he was going to do that the solicitor placed both hands on the desk in front of him mr stewart he said if commander dermott did that it was an illegal act it was very highly illegal and would have resulted in a considerable prison sentence if he had been detected a solicitor must not allow a client to tell him that he intends to commit a felony if the client should do so the solicitor must refuse to advise him or to handle his case in certain circumstances his duty would be to inform the proper authorities commander dermott never told me or gave me any indication that he intended to do such a thing keith said im sorry sir i didnt know thats all right mr stewart he smiled if your brotherinlaw had such a thing in mind he knew enough not to come and tell me about it i dont understand why it should have been so illegal the engineer said it was his own money that is the law of the land the solicitor replied dollars are short in this country i am not allowed to spend more than a hundred pounds in america if i wish to go there for a holiday in the same way your brotherinlaw was not allowed to take twentysix or twentyseven thousand pounds to spend in the united states or canada i see keithglanced at the solicitor he did tell me once that he wanted to buy a house when he got to a place called victoria on vancouver island he told you that keith nodded i doubt if he could have done that very easily by any legal transfer of capital not unless the payments could have been deferred over an excessive period of time he didnt say anything about that he just said that he was going to buy a house there i see they discussed this for a time but keith could remember nothing more presently the solicitor said if in factthese diamonds were with them in the yacht i am afraid that the prospects of recovering them do not seem very rosy we dont know yet how badly the yacht was wrecked keith said things might have been saved off her luggage or things like that from a yacht a wooden yacht wrecked on a coral reef some distance from the land in a tropical hurricane i think she must have broken up mr stewart otherwise the bodies of the crew would hardly have been washed ashore in that case all her contents would have been scattered over the sea floor but we shall know more of the condition of the vessel when we get that report i do not personally feel very hopeful keith glanced at him its fiftyfive quid then i am afraid it looks rather like it do you think that you can manage with the daughter without any appreciable money mr stewart in the circumstances i should have no hesitation in approaching the dungarmon family on her behalf katie says that we can manage said the engineer katie thats my wife after all its no more than if we had a kid of our own there would be no difficulty in approaching the dungannons i could write to lord dungannon personally if they paid for her schooling and that said keith shrewdly theyd want to have her wouldnt they i mean they wouldnt want for her to go on living with katie and me and going to miss pearsons school down the road and baling high school after that holidays theyd want her to be with them in northern ireland they might the solieitor agreed the engineer shook his head thats not what jo wanted for her he said nor did john when they left her with us they did it for a purpose they could have left her in northern ireland with the big house and people with titles and ponies to ride and all of that but they didnt do that they didnt even like her going there last summer much but they kind of had to what they wanted to do was for her to stay with us do you know why they took that line asked mr carpenter i know that that was theirjntention but do you know why they had ideas keith said awkwardly i mean people getting divorced two or three times and mess and muddle over the children they didnt want janice to grow up thinking that was the usual way people did they thought shed be better off with katie and me in baling seeing it was just for a short time its going to be for a long time now said the solicitor i know but katie says we can manage he paused id like to find out all we can about things that might have been washed up from the yacht its just possible that the diamonds might have been recovered said mr carpenter if so they would be in the hands of the french authorities he sat in silence for a minute and then said i will find out everything i can mr stewart but i shall have to word any inquiry rather carefully if the diamonds were taken out of the united kingdom it was a most illegal act keith sat with his brows wrinkled how do the french come into this he asked tahiti and the tuamoto islands are a part of french oceania the solicitor told him just as if they were french colonies i didnt know that the engineer said humbly i thought that they were japanese or something he left the solicitors office a few minutes later with the thought dominant in his mind that now either he or katie would have to tell janice that her father and mother were dead he had the red scooter finished and painted hanging up in what had once been the coal cellar of the house and now was used as a boxroom he had made it with pleasure for her but now that the moment had come to use it as an anodyne it did not seem to be quite the right thing after all he walked down to holborn and then eastwards looking in the shop windows till he came to gamages he went into the big store mingling with the crowd of christmas shoppers till he found the toy department and browsed around there a palefaced rather fat little man in a greasy raincoat he was already conscious of the need for economy and finally he bought a yellow and blue plastic duck that would float in the bath he knew as he bought it that it was much too young a present for a child of ten but he bought it feeling that somehow it might be the right thing in the circumstances he got back to the flat in baling early in the afternoon carrying the duck in a paper bag he had thought of stopping at the store in baling broadway and discussing the position across the counter with katie in the household linen but he had abandoned that idea katie would want to come home early in order to be at home when janice got back from school and it did not seem quite fair to him to throw all the dirty work on katie he felt that he would rather tell janice himself and get the back of the job broken before katie got home enough would fall upon her later anyway he was sitting in his chair before the fire in the parlour when janice came back from school a slim darkhaired child in a thick blue overcoat and a blue hat with the school ribbon on it he called that you jan take off your coat and come in here ive got something i want to tell you she came in and he sat up in his chair what do you want to tell me she asked come over here he said she came close and he put his arm around the slender little waist in the gym tunic he could only take this straight look jan he said ive got something serious ive got to tell you you know about boats and yachts and how they get wrecked sometimes running on shore on rocks she nodded sometimes he said the people in the boats get drowned when that happens she stared at him and he knew that the realization was already with her she asked drowned dead that does happen sometimes in a shipwreck he said gently has that happened to my mummy and daddy im afraid it has jan he said steadily they got into a terrible storm a long long way from here and they were wrecked are they drowned dead uncle keith im afraid they are both drowned he replied come and sit up on my knee he had thought that she would burst into tears but that did not happen she came jap on his knee and he held her close and so they sat in silence for ten minutes at last she asked do you think my mummy and daddy were very frightened when the ship got wrecked the adult quality of the question amazed him children were so much older than you thought they were no he said no i dont think that theyd ever have been frightened they werent that sort of people and you wont be frightened of things either i dont think she shook her head he reached down beside his chair and brought up the paper bag i bought you a duck he said im not sure if its a very good present but i wanted to bring you something and this was all that i could think of she pulled it out of the paper bag upon his knee its a lovely duck she said can i have it in the bath of course he said she wriggled round upon his knee and kissed him its a lovely present she said thank you ever so much for it he held her for a moment and then said what about a cup of tea she got down from his knee there were still no tears can i come and watch you make a bit in the workshop why yes he said ill make a bit specially for you what sort of a bit shall we make her eye fell on the duck clutched close in her arms can you make an egg for the duck to lay his mind ran quickly over techniques and materials to hand i can make you all sorts of eggs he said but none of them would be quite the right colour a ducks egg ought to be a sort of blueygreen he thought rapidly we could do a silvery egg in steel or a yellow egg if we heated a steel egg a bit or a blue egg if we heated a steel egg quite a lot or a grey egg if we case hardened it or we could make a copperycoloured egg if we made it out of copper but i cant just see how we could make a proper coloured ducks egg unless we painted it she smiled at him it isnt a proper coloured duck so it wouldnt have proper coloured eggs would it but its a lovely duck she stroked its plastic hide can i have one egg of each sort so that we can make a nest for her to sit on i cant make them all before your bedtime he said we can make one now and then ill make the rest after youre in bed and then ill put them on the table by your bed and you can have them in the morning he paused which one would you like me to make now the blue one she said he got up from his chair all right well go down and make a blue egg he took her by the hand and they went together down the steep wooden stairs into the front basement room that was his clean workshop he pulled out the high stool that he sometimes sat upon before the bench and sat her up upon it so that she could see everything that he was doing at the threeandahalfihch lathe and began a running commentary on his operations he picked a threeinch end of inch diameter steel rod out of the scrap box put it in the threejaw chuck started the lathe and chamfered the end to fortyfive degrees a lifetime of such work had made him very quick in a minute he was working with a hand scraper on a rest turning the end of the steel to form the large end of the egg talking to the little girl all the time three emery sticks of successive fineness followed the scraper and the large end was finished he brought forward the parting tool and parted off the piece one and a half inches long down to a diameter of about a quarter of an inch and chamfered the small end shape roughly by the careful manipulation of a knife tool in the fourtool post then came careful work again with the hand scraper then the final parting off he gave the warm nearly finished egg to the little girl to hold while he found a oneinchbore copper collar and put it in the chuck then he put the egg in it small end outwards and pinched it up using the tailstock centre to set it roughly true started the lathe again and went to work very gently with the hand scraper and the emery sticks till he had it finished to his satisfaction then he took it from the lathe gave it a final burnish on a rouge polishing mop at the tool grinder and gave it to her to hold a new silvery shiny egg it had taken him less than twenty minutes to make therell be another one like that in the morning he said and a grey one and a yellow one and a copper one but now well make this one blue he helped her down from the stool still clutching the plastic duck and the new shiny egg and led her into his dirty workshop he lit a bunsen burner and arranged a tin filled with about an inch of sand above the burner on a little metal stand and began to heat the sand presently he took the egg from her and dropped it on the sand and began to stir the sand expertly with a small pair of tongs always keeping the egg on top of a good layer of the hot sand turning it over and over as the heat increased it took a yellow tint which grew darker as they watched and began to turn to blue he made the little girl stand back turned out the bunsen put on a thick leather glove ready on the bench beside him picked the hot egg from the sand quickly and dropped it in a tin of oil upon the bench it made a sizzling splash and a little spurt of hot oil he waited a moment took off the glove and fished it out of the oil and wiped it carefully on a clean rag then he gave it to janice a deep brilliantly blue egg its a lovely egg she said its such a pretty colour just like dianas frock thank you ever so much uncle keith there was the sound of the front door upstairs and katies step in the hall lord he exclaimed theres katie and we havent done anything about the tea she scurried to the stairs the duck held firmly in her arms the egg clenched tight in one hand ill go and put the kettle on he followed her more slowly and arrived in the hall in time to hear her greet katie uncle keith has bought me a duck and i can have it in the bath and he made me a blue egg for it to lay and hes going to make me more eggs tonight a silver one and a yellow one and a grey one and a copper one so shell have five eggs to sit on in a nest he heard katie say a little dazed what a beautiful duck and what a lovely egg keith spoils you janice said he made the egg in the lathe and i watched and we forgot all about the tea but ill run and put the kettle on now she scurried off into the kitchenette duck and egg held close in the hall keith said in a low tone its true enough old girl i went up and saw carpenter again this morning they were both drowned and buried on the island he paused ive told her youve told janice he nodded how did she take it she didnt cry he said she just sat quiet on my knee for a bit and then we went down and made the egg she didnt cry at all he shook his head oh thats bad she said in a low tone youre sure she understood she understood all right he replied she stood in silence well i dunno she said at last well talk about it tonight after shes in bed in the meantime dont lets say anything unless she brings the subject up let her take it her own way she paused i think ill give her one of those phenobarbitone tablets tonight she went into the kitchenette to run up a dish of scrambled eggs and keith went down into his clean workshop to sweep away the steel shavings from the lathe and to start work on another egg he had it nearly finished by the time the meal was on the table and was halfway through a third one by the time the meal was washed up and he was called upstairs to see the duck swimming with janice in the bath he went downstairs and worked till he had finished the fifth and brought them up to the parlourhe found katie sitting and darning a hole in one of janices stockings he put the eggs down on the table by his chair did she say anything katie shook her head only about the duck and the eggs its as if shes kind of closed her mind to the other thing she sat in silence for a moment and then said i think ill put my coat on and run round and have a talk with miss pearsori so that if anything happens at the school tomorrow you could go round and fetch her home you wouldnt mind doing that k if she rang of course not these eggs all ought to have a coat of lacquer before they get scratched i might do that tomorrow while shes at school you think its all right for her to go to school katie im sure it is the way shes taking it its just in case anything comes out in the newspapers and the other children start asking her that might set her off crying or something youd think thered be a fair chance that the newspapers wont get hold of it he said its all in a french colony on the other side of the world he paused and then he said ive got that scooter i made for her when do you think she ought to have that tomorrows friday she said give it to her saturday morning and she can play with it all morning if its fine and then in the afternoon she can have diana soskice round to play ill see mrs soskice or else ring her up there isnt any money katie he said if there was they had it in the yacht with them she darned on placidly mr carpenter couldnt find the securities they sold them he told her seems like they turned everything they had into cash and then bought diamonds and took them in the yacht kind of illegal it was so he says seems like they meant to sell the diamonds in america or somewhere and buy a house that doesnt sound illegal to me she said her eyes fixed on the darn well it is he told her its about the worst thing you can do apart from murdering somebody and now the diamonds are lost so shell have nothing thats about the long and the short of it he said he asked if he should ask the dungannons to help with educating her and that but i said no she shook her head i wouldnt want that and we can manage she dropped her busy hands down to her lap and they were still i know we cant give her all that john and jo would have wanted her to have she said quietly im sort of sorry about that in a way but it does make it more as if she was our own child now and maybe thats for the best things being like they are he stirred uneasily in his chair those diamonds are her diamonds now and they must be somewhere he said uneasily i mean im the trustee she picked up her darning again you cant be a trustee for whats at the bottom of the sea she said the ships not at the bottom of the sea he said stubbornly she got wrecked on a coral reef near an island same thing she said and went on darning she went out presently to see miss pearson and he went down into the basement he looked into the little bedroom off his dirty workshop and saw janice sleeping deeply the plastic duck clutched in her arms he laid the other four eggs down beside the blue one on the table by her side and pulled the bedclothes gently up around her shoulders for the night was cold and the window open he closed the door and sat down at his desk there was the morning mail seven letters still unopened among them was one from the united states in an ornate airmail envelope the back of which announced to him in neat print that it was from solomon p hirzhorn box tacoma washington he sighed a little mr hirzhorn was an enthusiast who was building the congreve clock from keiths serial in the miniature mechanic and mr hirzhorn couldnt read a drawing very well and mr hirzhorn evidently had a secretary with an electric typewriter to whom he could dictate because each letter was about fifteen hundred words long this was the third that keith had answered patiently though not at such length he settled down to work and worked till midnight the succeeding days passed anxiously in a state of inarticulate tension janice never cried so far as they could see and she never once spoke of her father and mother but she lost appetite and got very pale katie went to see dr simmonds about her and he came round and stethoscoped her chest and put her on cod liver oil and malt which she liked and approved the phenobarbitone at night for the next week or so nothing happened at school because no parent of a child at miss pearsons school happened to read the times the only paper which picked up and printed a short account of the yacht wreck in the tuamotus janice played with her scooter in somerset road on saturdays and achieved some distinction among the other children in the road because her uncle had made every bit of it himself instead of buying it in a shop but she continued pale and peaky in appearance katie said shell pick up as the spring comes on but she took her down each saturday morning to mr evans the chemist to weigh her on the machine in the shop and kept a careful record of her weight the christmas holidays came it seemed better to katie and to keith to cancel the arrangements that had been made for janice to go and stay with her aunt margaret at tunbridge wells and to keep her with them in baling to the extent of disrupting their own routines a little for the period of the holidays mr buckley agreed to let katie go on half time working mornings only till school started again and keith suffered an influx of children into his workshops at all hours sometimes working on till one oclock in the morning to keep abreast of his current jobs they did their work in a welter of childrens parties parties in their own flat fetching janice from parties in other peoples homes loaded with little presents with paper caps and unpulled crackers in the middle of all this a letter arrived from mr carpenter enclosing the report from the governor in papeete and suggesting that keith might like to come up for another discussion when he had digested the contents it was a fairly long typewritten report it said that the vessel in question was undoubtedly the yacht shearwater and the two bodies were those of commander and mrs dermott the yacht had struck on a reef about two miles to the southwest of theisland of marokota which was only intermittently inhabited by natives from kautaiva island according to the demands of the copra harvest the yacht had struck at the height of the hurricane and at that time there were about ten natives on marokota who had seen the vessel as she struck the reef but could do nothing to help she had apparently broken up in a few hours all that now remained was the keel and some of the frames wedged firmly on the reef from which most of the planking had been washed off there was no question of salvaging the yacht the engine had remained attached to its bearers and had been removed by the natives three days later and placed under cover on the island much of the remaining heavy articles which were within the hull had been recovered by the natives by diving including the two primus stoves and the binnacle and had been taken for their own use the same applied to lighter articles that had been washed ashore such as bedding spars planking sails etc the governor did not consider it practicable to recover these things from the natives he would however appreciate instructions whether any attempt should be made to salvage the engine or whether it should be disposed of at his own discretion he also asked for instructions regarding the marking and the upkeep of the grave keith showed this letter to katie one evening when the turmoil of the current party was over she read it carefully and then said i should think the best thing would be to let him sell the engine for what he can get for it and put the money towards the cost of the headstone for the grave theres nothing much else that we can do keith said theres no hurry it all wants a bit of thinking about to his mind it certainly did she said no more to her the matter was perfectly clear and straightforward put the money for the engine to the cost of the headstone and everything would be cleaned up neat and tidy and done with but keith was handling all this with mr carpenter and she knew her husband to be slow and vacillating in matters of business let the men settle it in their own way it didnt matter on new years eve keith went up to see mr carpenter in the solicitors office they went through the report together finally mr carpenter said as katie had i think we should instruct the governor to set the cost of the headstone against what he can get for the engine and accept the balance either way would you like me to write to him in those terms keith sat in silence finally he said i think id rather kave it be and think things over a bit longer the solicitor glanced at him curiously there is no immediate hurry of course the engineer looked up thats right he said john and jo theyre buried and all decent far as i can see suppose they had a headstone well theres no one there to read it he paused im not against a headstone he said dont think that but theres a lot of things in this that want some thinking over the solicitor sat in silence im here to help you mr stewart he said at last i know that you are keeping something from me and you may have very good reasons for doing so id just like you to remember that your brotherinlaw was not only my client but a friend just bear that in mind keith smiled and said shrewdly unless it came to telling you i might be going to do something illegal there are degrees said mr carpenter and then he smiled and said are you trying to tell me that you see some chance of getting back those diamonds i dont know where they are keith said defensively i dont know anything id like to let the whole thing rest a while until i think it out whats best to be done he got to his feet the solicitor rose with him as you like just remember that im here to help he picked up the report from his desk would you care to take this with you keith took the report and thrust it deep into the pocket of his greasy raincoat i dont want you to think i dont appreciate everything youve done sir he said but theres just one thing sticking out like a sore thumb and thats that im the trustee i dont want to do things in a hurry like selling anything he left the office and walked down to holborn he stood at the kingsway corner waiting for his bus and from habit he bought a copy of the evening standard but he did not read it he stood in a doorway in the milling crowd deep in thought trying to resolve his problem twelve thousand miles away there was a coral reef in french territory washed by the sea not far from a coral island wedged upon that reef there was a threeton lump of lead surmounted by another lump of concrete deep buried in the concrete probably would still be the copper box that he had brazed up for john dermott in the copper box was jos jewel case red leather and he was now certain in his mind that in her jewel case were ј worth of diamonds that belonged to janice who had made a little basketwork nest at school to hold the coloured eggs for the plastic duck to sit on and he was the trustee chapter four peter james sanderson was a navigator with the british overseas airways corporation he lived in south baling convenient to london airport and at that time he was working the londonkarachi sector of the eastern route flying in britannias this gave him about a fortnight of each month at home with his young wife and baby and plenty of time for his hobby which was model engineering he was a devoted reader of the miniature mechanic every week he had fitted up a workshop in a garden shed and in it he had built a stuart turner steam engine and two of keith stewarts designs the five cc hornet singlecylinder compression ignition engine with its builtin reduction gear and the more ambitious twenty cc gannet fourcylinder horizontally opposed fourstroke engine he had exhibited the latter at the annual exhibition of the baling and district model engineering society which had been judged by no less an authority than keith stewart and he had received a bronze medal from the hands of the great man himself he treasured this medal and valued it more highly than any of his professional certificates it was therefore with surprise and pleasure that he received a telephone call from keith stewart asking if he could come round and have a word with him of course he said any time you like mr stewart now thats fine as a matter of fact i was just reading about your congreve clock but id rather talk to you yourself he hung up and went to tell his wife of the honour that was to befall them and she was duly impressed and hurried to make some hot scones for tea over the scones and tea keith stewart unburdened himself partially im in a kind of an awkward position and i dont know what to do for the best he said and he proceeded to tell mr and mrs sanderson about john and jo and shearwater the navigator said softly i remember reading about this marokota was the name of the island they got wrecked on keith told him its not marked on our atlas but seems like its somewhere near a place called tahiti or papeete or something sometimes they say one and sometimes the other tahiti is an island said the navigator quite a big french island in the pacific papeete is the town on it wait a minute i think ive got a chart here that would show it maps and charts were his speciality the tools of his trade and he had acquired a considerable private store he pulled out a blue volume the pacific islands pilot and consulted it nine nine two he said i havent got it but seven eight three i know ive got that somewhere he pulled out the bottom drawer of a long chest rummaged and pulled out a chart and laid it on the top of the chest well theres tahiti he said now marokota he turned again to the pilot and extracted the latitude and longitude of the island he laid these off upon the chart with pencil and parallel ruler and marked the position with a little pencil cross theres your marokota he said about sea miles more or less due east of tahiti keith stewart studied the chart he had never seen one before but he had heard about them and he was a technician all these little bits of figures he said they mean depths depths in fathoms said mr sanderson a fathom is six feet keith nodded and stood looking at the chart he pulled out a packet of players and offered one to his host how would a chap set about getting out there he asked i mean theres things to be done the grave and that i dont kind of like to let all that go if you understand me if it was just over the way in france well of course one would go there and see everything done right what would it cost to get to a place like that the navigator stood in thought by air tourist it might cost about three hundred pounds you might be able to do it for a little less by sea perhaps two hundred thats just for the one way mr sanderson nodded the return fare would be double keith stewart said twas afraid that that might be the size of it the miniature mechanic doesnt pay that sort of wage packet you feel its very important that you should go there to tidy things up the engineer nodded yes i do but theres things you just cant do and thats all about it they talked for a little while finally the navigator said take that chart if its any good to you let me have it back when youve done with it keith stewart said goodbye and walked off down the street in the grey dusk the chart under his arm mr sanderson watched him go from the front door and went back into his sitting room where his wife was clearing away the tea what did you think of him he asked her i liked him she said hes a very genuine little man thats what i thought he replied he didnt mind a bit telling you straight out that he hadnt got the money to go out to the pacific i know he said he leaned against the mantelpiece in thought of course he said there are ways ways to get to tahiti without any money of course there are he said smiling people get all over the world without any money how peter in aircraft when the load factors a bit down he said its just a question of working the right racket two nights later he rang up keith stewart i dont know if this is any good to you he said do you remember a chap called oliver thorn who had a model of the petrolea locomotive in the baling and district exhibition i remember him said keith fairhaired chap shortish with glasses works at blackbushe airport or somewhere thats the chap said mr sanderson hes chief storekeeper to albatross airways i used to work for albatross before i got into the corporation he thinks a lot of you nice of you to say that muttered keith well said the navigator the point is this albatross have a job coming up to fly a generator rotor to a ship thats stuck at honolulu the cathay princess tons shes a tanker i believe she cant move till she gets this rotor and shes costing the owners god knows how much a day theyve got to make a new one up in lancashire and albatross are flying it to honolulu one day next week theyre sending it in one of their dcb freighters but it wont be a full load it struck me that it might be possible to wangle you a ride keith was startled to honolulu yes distances meant nothing to the navigator one day he would be in singapore and the next in sydney the world to him was a succession of indifferent hotels united by long dreary stretches of cloud how far would that be from tahiti about sea miles its not very close but its a good deal closer than you are now can one get from honolulu to tahiti ah now said the navigator that may be the snag i can tell you this much theres no airline youd think there must be some sort of shipping line but honestly i just dont know it could be that youd have to find out that in honolulu mr thorn told me that the aircraft would go straight through by way of frobisher and vancouver and that it would load the generator rotor at speke well speke to honolulu must be close on thirty hours so the crew would want at least fortyeight hours rest before starting home there should be plenty of time in honolulu for you to find out about sea passages to tahiti if there arent any then you could tome home again with albatross the machines got to come back empty as i understand it you dont think theyd want any money asked keith still a little dazed youd have to talk to oliver thorn said mr sanderson there may be some accountant in albatross whod cut up rough but i dont see why there should be after all if a journalist wanted to go and write up the trip and albatross airways theyd take him fast enough youre a journalist arent you i suppose so said keith uncertainly well there you are they talked a little more and mr sanderson gave keith the address and telephone number of mr thorn and rang off keith stewart hung up and went down to his workshop to sit down at his desk he had janices school atlas there and he traced the route as far as he was able speke he did not know where that was nor had he heard of it before it would be somewhere in the north because the generator rotor was being made in lancashire somewhat to his surprise he found frobisher bay without difficulty but it was in baffin land up farther north than hudson bay then to vancouver he knew where that was and then to honolulu girls in grass skirts and not much else he knew about great circle courses and though he had not got a globe he could visualize this as the shortest route besides when jo had been speaking to katie about janices journey she had mentioned that the aeroplane went near to the north pole he had never been out of england it was incredible that he should even be contemplating such a journey with all its expense all its uncertainties he would have to have a passport and he had no notion how to set about getting such a thing still he knew that the bank manager would tell him he would have to have money quite a lot of money for if he succeeded in getting to tahiti from sthat would cost a lot then he would have tofere back to england that might perhaps be possible if he were to find the diamonds but if he didnt then he would be stranded out there in this outlandish place papeete he thought perhaps that he could raise about a hundred pounds without increasing the mortgage on the house but katie would have to know if he took a hundred pounds from their bank account it would drain it to the very bottom to the utmost limit of overdraft that the bank manager would allow there was a little money owing to him from the miniature mechanic perhaps about fifteen pounds katie in theory at any rate could carry on for a month or two upon her salary to meet the living expenses of janice and herself they had just paid the school fees for the coming term without his earnings they could not pay off the debt upon the house or maintain anything they could not paint the windows or replace sheets or blankets or pillowcases or clothes if he were to take a hundred pounds and go off on a trip like this katie would be down to the barest of bare bedrock he got up and walked about the workshop uncertain in his mind presently it occurred to him that by ids movements he might be waking janice who slept in the little room off the workshop that once had been the scullery he opened the door gently and looked in janice was sleeping deeply the plastic duck on the table by her side perched hazardously on its basketwork nest stabilized by the weight of the metal eggs she had thrown the bedclothes off from her shoulders and one arm was out the room was cold he went over to the bed and gently put the arm inside and tucked the bedclothes up around her shoulders she did not wake and he went back into the workshop closing the door softly behind him the diamonds must be in the jewel case safely buried in the lump of concrete that had once been shearwater it was the only place where they could be it was just a matter of someone going there and getting them without attracting too much attention and he was the trustee he sat down at his desk again irresolute suppose he didnt go with the help of mr sanderson and mr thorn and albatross airways he might have enough money to get there just but he certainly hadnt got enough money to get back he would be leaving katie with little or no money for an indefinite time with janice to look after john dermott and his sister jo wouldnt have wanted him to do that if he didnt recover her little fortune well janice would be all right katie had said that they could manage and katie knew shed have to work like any other girl as soon as she could leave school probably mr buckley would give her a job in the shop it would be just as if she was their own daughter shed never be a fine lady but who wanted to be a fine lady these days anyway he sat there in mental torment knowing that he couldnt take it that way unless he made a real effort to get back what belonged to her hed never be able to look at her without feeling ashamed of himself hed never be able to think of john and jo without feeling ashamed of himself they had made him the trustee but dear lord what was katie going to say about it all he went upstairs presently conscious of a bad half hour ahead of him katie was still up sitting by the fire knitting something for janice and looking at the television he sat down opposite her and said ive got something i want to talk about i know what that is she remarked turning off the set whats that he asked startled she said complacently you want to go out to this place tahiti i heard you talking about it on the telephone i think its silly better wait to say that till you know all about it he replied a little nettled what dont i know everything he said you remember that time when i went down to the yacht with them to fix up an electric light over the compass she nodded well it wasnt an electric light at all it was something quite different i guessed that much she said what was it jos jewel case he said sort of building it into the boat he started in and told her the whole thing it took about a quarter of an hour course i believed what john told me he said he told me it was just jos rings and things like that but now we know that they took ј of diamonds along with them i bet that they were in that jewel case too katie got up from her chair make a pot of tea she said she went and busied herself in her little kitchenette while she thought it over she came back presently with two cups of tea suppose you went out there she said whats it all going to cost everything weve got and probably a bit more he replied thats just to get there getting back would cost as much again she stared at him helplessly but thats crazy he rubbed his hand across his eyes i know the other way is to do nothing and just leave it be she sat in silence for a minute that dont seem right she said at last i cant say i like that much better he looked up at her gratefully katie was coming round to the unthinkable course he had proposed i like it a bloody sight worse he said id never be able to think of john and jo again if we just sat tight on our fannies and did nothing thats enough of that shop language she said drink your tea while its hot he obeyed her this governor in this place papeete she said suppose you were to write to him and tell him all about it couldnt he go there and get the box out of the keel keith nodded i thought of that tell you the truth i dont just know what a governor does would he be the top man an asylums got a board of governors but they arent top of anything i think hes the top man said katie i read about a governor in a book once thats what i thought said keith if thats right hed be paid by the government the french government i suppose in paris well when john and jo took those diamonds out of england they could have gone to prison for it thats what mr carpenter said maybe the diamonds would have been confiscated if theyd been found out she nodded well now whos to say that if this governor got his hands on them they wouldnt be confiscated again i just dont know and whats more i dont know who to ask safely i mean ј is worth while anybody going after if they know its there i dont feel like telling anyone about it least of all this governor she nodded slowly twentysix thousand pounds was an incredible sum of money to her but if it existed at all it belonged to janice and no one else was going to lay a finger on it she knew from her sunday newspaper that many a bank manager had fallen from grace for much less than that and who was to say that a french governor would be any better she was reluctant to admit it and to face the infinite difficulties that would ensue but keith had the right idea better to say nothing to anybody and go after this himself she asked him what were you going to do in this place papeete if the islands miles away i dont honestly know he said but look at it like this suppose we had lots of money enough to do whatever we wanted without thinking about it she nodded well id go out there and get a headstone for the grave made in this place papeete and then id hire a ship with a crew that knew the way around and id go to this island and get the headstone set up on the grave and everything done proper and id take a lot of photographs for janice to see when shes older well while i was there id go out to the wreck upon this reef in a small boat and id know soon as i laid eyes on it if the box was still there in the concrete just behind the mast it was towards the rudder end id be a poor sort of a fish if i couldnt lay my hands upon it then and get it away well we havent got lots of money she said not for hiring ships and that i suppose youd say that if you can get a free ride out to this place honolulu you can do the rest of it free too i could try he said simply maybe i could do some work out there or something if i get into a jam much money do you think i could take with me i was thinking i could take a hundred pounds she laid her teacup down ill get the bank book they discussed finances for a time upon the basis that he would be away for three or four months you forgot about the rest of the top flat she said she figured with a stub of pencil on the back of the cheque book i think it would be all right if you took a hundred and ten pounds she said but wed have to have money coming in by the middle of april or we wouldnt be able to pay school fees for the summer term for janice at miss pearsons shed have to go to the council school i know but jo was against that he nodded that gives me a deadline anyway she sat deep in thought at last she said itll be hot out in those parts keith youll have to take your cricket shirts and your blazer on that note they went to bed he knew shop hours and he knew that halfpast six on a pitchdark january morning was no time to ring a busy man hurrying to catch the transport out to work at blackbushe forty miles from london he waited until eight oclock and rang mrs thorn and got from her the telephone number of albatross airways and the extension number he inquired a little delicately if it was all right to ring mr thorn at his work and got a somewhat affronted reply of course its all right she said mr thorn has a secretary he apologized and hung up well pleased mr oliver thorn apparently was somebody at albatross airways ltd ten minutes later he was speaking to the man himself he got a courteous reception somewhat to his own surprise nice to hear your voice mr stewart we met last at the baling and district exhibition thats right said keith i liked your petrolea liked it very much if id been judging the locos id have given it a bronze it wasnt worth it mr stewart not really i should have fluted the connecting rods and its got cheesehead screws all over where they should be hex ill do better next time but it goes all right well thats the main thing said keith tell me mr thorn did you hear anything from mr sanderson about me sure he said you wanted to know if there was any chance of a ride with us to honolulu thats right well now there is and there isnt mr stewart what i mean is we dont carry passengers we arent allowed to we run a freight service we do sometimes stretch a point but then its for someone special like yourself and we sign them on as crew second engineer under instruction or something like that its all at the discretion of the chief pilot captain fielding hell be taking this honolulu flight and hes the one youd have to get round you have got a machine going to honolulu oh yes thursday or friday of next week as soon as the component is finished we load at liverpool at speke he paused are you doing anything today mr stewart nothing urgent think you could come out here to blackbushe and meet the boys captain fielding hes taking off for ankara about three oclock with four jet engines and spare parts and that and then on the way back he picks up a load of cut flowers at nice hell be gone three or four days then his next trip is the honolulu one hell be here at dinner time and you could have a talk with him whats the best way for me to get out to you at blackbushe there was a pause and keith heard daisy what time is that truck leaving belgrave road with the manifolds why not okay he came back on the line weve got a truck leaving belgrave road thats by victoria about tenthirty mr stewart one of our red trucks with albatross all over it if you wait for him on the great west road at the corner of south baling road say say about tenfifty ill ring him and tell him to pick you up there then ill be there waiting for him thats fine mr stewart theres four or five of the boys in the maintenance shop would like to meet you ill have a word with captain fielding tell him what its all about there was plenty of time before he had to meet the truck janice went off to school and katie to the shop and he went down into his workshop to find something that would entertain the fitters at blackbushe a couple of years before he had been doing some research upon miniature electric generators in connection with the showmans version of his traction engine he had evolved a little sixvolt generator no more than an inch and a half in diameter running at revs for research purposes he had adapted the basic castings of his hornet engine to make a new fourstroke seven cc engine running on petrol with a little carburettor and in place of the reduction gear he had fitted a governor ignition was by a tiny magneto of his own design and a miniature sparking plug the whole lot mounted on a little baseplate was about four inches long two inches wide and two and a half inches high it was an easy starter he could flick it into life by swinging the flywheel at one end with his thumbnail and as it speeded up to the governed revolutions a pea bulb at the other end glowed with the electricity it generated it had always been a great success in workshops and he put it in a little box and slipped it into his pocket by half past eleven he was sitting in the office with mr thorn drinking a cup of tea albatross airways ltd was an independent company operating three tenyearold vikings and a couple of dcgbs one of which was permanently on a trooping contract their offices in an old wartime hutment were not luxurious but their shops were clean and adequately equipped mr thorn said glad to see you again mr stewart look before we start would you mind telling me what this is all about do you just want to go to honolulu or was it your idea to go there and come back with the aircraft i dont really know keith stewart pulled the newspaper cutting from his wallet and showed it to the chief storekeeper and told his story ive got to try to get to this place tahiti and fix up about the grave and the salvage and all that he said i havent got the money to get there in the normal way its too expensive but i did think if i could get a lift to honolulu it would be a help sure mr thorn handed back the cutting to him you want to show that to captain fielding he said i wont say weve never done this before mr stewart because we have but i can tell you now wed have to have it both ways if captain fielding agrees to take you wed have to sign you on as second engineer under instruction at a salary you wouldnt get and at the same time youd have to sign our legal form of indemnity to say that thered be no claim against us if you get killed or injured on the flight keith nodded fair enough you havent got any ground engineers tickets i suppose keith shook his head im afraid not you know what i do i do indeed i dont know if captain fielding does though wed better get along down to the hangar and see if we can find him hes down there somewhere keith pulled the box a little shyly from his pocket i brought a bit along with me i thought the boys might like to see mr thorn took the tiny generator set and examined it with interest my he breathed that really is something does it go of course it goes keith took it from him primed the tiny carburettor by turning the model upside down and flipped the little engine into life with his thumbnail it buzzed like an infuriated wasp as he made delicate adjustments to the jet and settled to an even note as the pea bulb lit up mr thorn gazed at it entranced have you ever shown it keith shook his head i only made it up for research fv when i was working on the generator he paused the commutator is the tricky part the rest of its quite simple he stopped the little engine by shorting the plug with his propelling pencil bring that down into the shop mr thorn said the boys will like to see it ten minutes later the little generator set was running on a workbench in an annexe to the hangar surrounded by a crowd of mechanics attracted by the noise and by the rumour that keith stewart of the miniature mechanic was actually there in person he faced the barrage of questions that he was accustomed to at exhibitions dealing with them one by one a little shyly in the middle of all this a man in uniform darkhaired with a small dark moustache pushed his way through the crowd whats all this going on mr thorn said this is captain fielding mr stewart keith stopped the engine with his pencil and turned to the newcomer glad to meet you sir the pilot nodded smiled and fixed his eyes on the little model on the bench dont you know we arent supposed to run engines in the hangar start it up again if you can she usually starts all right keith said diffidently he flipped it into life again with his thumbnail the note steadied the pea bulb lit up and it went on running evenly the pilot bent to examine it i wish our engines started as easily as that shes warm keith said apologetically ours are worse when theyre warm the pilot moved keiths hand and studied the tendency of the running model to move about the bench not badly balanced what revs is she doing about three thousand where did you get the dynamo from i made it someone in the crowd said and designed it he wrote an article about it in the miniature mechanic two years ago was it about that keith said the pilot grunted what about the magneto somebody said he designed that too the pilot looked at keith what didnt you design and make in it keith said the sparking plug he added diffidently working in ceramics is a bit specialized and you can buy them so easily he stopped the little motor again with his pencil and the pea bulb glowed red and went out captain fielding took it in his hand and examined it closely then he passed it to somebody else and it went from hand to hand he said to keith just a minute mr stewart he turned and they walked together out into die main hangar under the wing of the dcb mr thorn was saying something about you wanted a ride with us to honolulu keith started in to tell his story again and showed the pilot the cutting from the times i dont know anything about the services from honolulu to tahiti the pilot said at last do you no i was thinking id find out in honolulu and if it wasnt any good or expensive then perhaps youd let me come back with you captain fielding stood in thought thats possible how long will you be there two days at least probably three or four its over thirty hours from speke to honolulu and theres such a thing as crew fatigue ive told the directors itll be a weeks job altogether he paused the officers of the cathay princess might know about services to tahiti or they could find out he turned to keith all right mr stewart youre in mr thorn told you the conditions yes sir said the new second engineer under instruction okay youll need a passport and an american visa and a vaccination certificate got any of them no well youll have to hop around i cant take you in the aircraft without them keep in touch with mr thorn well probably be leaving here for speke on thursday morning keith made a good start on his formalities before he left blackbushe the provision of passports at that aerodrome was a matter of routine the ministry of civil aviation had a supply of application forms and a tame justice of the peace to witness signatures he presented this at the passport office in westminster next day got himself vaccinated and was well on the way through the formalities by the weekend he saw mr mcneil the managing editor of the miniature mechanic and told him that there would be a gap of several weeks in his articles mr mcneil was disgruntled but less so when keith had told his story and had shown him the cutting from the times well if youve got to go i suppose youve got to he said reluctantly i think ill put a para in the book to say youre on holiday or wait now think you could do a piece upon the flight to honolulu and mail it when you land flying to honolulu right from the flightdeck over the north pole the readers might like that as a change i think i could do that said keith id have to get the permission of albatross of course the trips a bit irregular you see because they arent allowed to carry passengers ill ask them when do you think youll be back april i hope said keith its got to be early april somehow or other because of the school holidays my wife works you see the editor opened his eyes i never knew you had any children i havent said the engineer this is my sister jos little girl jo who got drowned he indicated the cutting from the paper she left her with us to look after till they got to vancouver he explained shes ours for keeps now the editors eyes softened a little it was just what a silly unbusinesslike mutt like keith stewart would let himself in for but a fine engineer in his own line going to make things difficult he asked keith shook his head katie says we can manage mr mcneil sat for a moment in thought you know what its like with the book he said we just scrape along we have to use such a hell of a lot of blocks still we do scrape along if while youre away you want a bit of an advance on stories that youll do when you come back let me know if theres any cash in the kitty ill do my best keith thanked him and went back to baling janice was now one of their main problems because school ended at four and katie did not get home much before six moreover there were saturday mornings to be considered when katie worked and there was no school what to do for janice in those periods perplexed them very much indeed always before keith had been at home it worried keith far more than the problem of how he was to get from honolulu to tahiti i might ask mr buckley if she could come to the shop just for the hour before closing katie said doubtfully john and jo wouldnt have liked that said keith uneasily i know ill find out about that dancing class from miss pearson some of the children do go to that i know miss grayson or gleeson or some name like that the dancing class filled one evening and the saturday morning and mrs soskice mother of diana filled the rest janice could go to mrs soskice and play with diana till katie called for her with that problem cleared away it then remained to tell janice that keith was going to the island they decided that they had to tell her where he was going to rather than to fob her off with some indefinite journey she was too intelligent and would probably find out where he had gone to and lose confidence in them they told her together going to the place where my daddy and mummy was drowned she asked it was the first time so far as either of them knew that she had spoken of her parents she had been putting on a little weight however and was no longer quite so peaky thats right said keith weve got to see about selling the engine and the bits and pieces from the wreck and that can i go too katie shook her head no darling its too far and it costs too much mummy and daddy took me to china when i was little thats right said katie but you were very little then just a baby and you know a baby doesnt have to pay a fare on the bus or the underground or anything but youre a big girl now and youd have to pay janice nodded thoughtfully i have to have a half ticket dianas much bigger than me but she has a half ticket just the same we couldnt afford even a half ticket katie said its going to clean us right out if uncle keith goes there but we think its necessary janice nodded again already she had become accustomed to the straitened finances of the stewart household the free spending ways of her father and mother were already fading from her memory she turned to keith are you going to see that my daddy and mummy are buried right she asked thats one of the things i was going to do he replied she wriggled on his knee and prompted by some obscure chain of thought she asked would you like to take one of my eggs with you why yes he said that would be a lovely thing to take which one would you like to take which one can you spare most no she said you choose the casehardened one would take the friction of a long journey in his pocket best id like the grey one he said she clapped her hands laughing i was so afraid youd say the blue one because i like the blue one best because its the prettiest and because i saw you make it right from the start she slithered down from his knee ill go and fetch the grey one now so that moment passed in the last day or two problems of health in the tropics obsessed katies mind pith helmets she said thats what people out there wear in the sun you must buy one of those as soon as you get there keith you dont want to go getting sunstroke and mosquito nets to sleep under at night else you get malaria perhaps you ought to take one of those along with you theres some kind of a pill you can take for that he said ill ask at evanss in the morning they decided that he should travel in his best blue suit and the heavy woollen overcoat that he had bought after the war and kept for best and wear the imitation panama hat that he reserved for his annual august holiday in cornwall he packed a suitcase with his cricket shirts blazer and grey flannel trousers two suits of heavy woollen underwear and a clean grey workshop coat he got from his bank a hundred pounds worth of dollar travellers cheques and took with him a few pounds in notes he put the small petrolelectric generator set into his pocket in its box then he was ready to go chapter five the journey to honolulu in the dcb was an unmitigated sheer delight to keith stewart he had never been out of england and though he had flown once or twice as a passenger he had little practical knowledge of aircraft he had however an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of things electrical and mechanical and to be given the free run of the big douglas was to open a glittering storehouse of technical interest to him he caught a transport down to blackbushe very early on the thursday morning and entered his wonderland the aircraft had been stripped of all passenger seats and upholstery behind the flightdeck was a crew restroom on the port side two pairs of seats faced across a table on the starboard side there were two bunks behind again there was a toilet to port and a small galley to starboard and aft of that the cabin was an empty shell right to the aft bulkhead keith spent an hour in the office with mr thorn and captain fielding putting his signature on various documents in the course of the formalities he learned the names of the other crew members and was a little surprised at their number there were six apart from the captain and himself three copilots of varying experience and standing a navigator a radio operator and an engineer dick king who knew all about keith stewart the formalities over he carried his suitcase down to the aircraft with mr king who showed him where to put it and changed putting on his grey workshop coat presently soon after eleven oclock the crew came aboard led by the captain who told keith to sit in one of the unoccupied rest seats and strap himself in the doors were slammed shut the steps withdrawn and two of the younger pilots came and joined him in the other seats on the flightdeck the crew commenced the preflight checks the engines whined and started one by one the captain spoke to the tower and got clearance to taxi engines were run up at the threshold of the runway and presently the aircraft moved forward lined up and took off she got off very quickly with no load on board and only half fuel as the flaps came up the two young pilots undid their belts indicating to keith that he should do the same they all moved forward to the flightdeck keith keeping behind out of the way there was nothing to be seen out of the windows or through the pilots windscreen but the grey january cloud everybody on the flightdeck seemed to be busy though they sat relaxed and motionless he could sense the nervous tension the grey wisps of cloud whipped past and once they emerged into clear air between two layers of cloud and entered cloud again so that he knew that they were climbing from time tp time the captain spoke to dick king who made adjustments to the throttles and the prop controls from time to time the navigator or the radio officer left his seat and spoke to the captain who nodded sometimes glancing at the clock on the instrument panel keith had never before been on the flightdeck of a large aircraft or been in any aircraft at all while it was flying blind he was impressed and somewhat amazed by the things he did not know these men were working as a team doing things together quickly and accurately things that he could only guess at he knuw that on their teamwork the safety of the aircraft depended all his own skill and ingenuity could not assist them by one iota the most that he could do to help them in their work was to keep right out of their way he went aft again into the rest quarters and examined the galley that was understandable at any rate there were tins of coffee and tins of tea and tinned milk and tinned meats and vegetables and bread and butter and cheese and jams this was within his competence he could not assist these people in their work mechanical though it was and that was humiliating but he could keep them well supplied with coffee and biscuits he set himself to discover where everything was stowed presently he sat down again there was nothing to be seen at all but the grey fog one of the young copilots came and sat beside him half an hour to go he said hell be starting the letdown in a few minutes how high are we fifteen thousand were going to do a gca approach keith asked timidly whats that ground control they get us on the radar screen and talk us down on to the runway its quite interesting you can hear it all on the loudspeaker if you come forward but dont get in anybodys way the note of the engines changed as the letdown began but nothing else seemed to alter when the young man beside him got up and went forward keith followed him a trickle of remarks was coming from the loudspeaker over the windscreen between the pilots half heard by keith at the rear one quarter understood delta november you are cleared down to ooo feet six zero zero zero feet qfe nine nine eight nine nine eight course three two zero and then delta november roger he could not understand any of it the copilot seemed to be flying the machine captain fielding sat relaxed watching the instruments and fingering a black hand microphone occasionally raising it for a short remark everyone was standing or sitting very quiet nobody was peering from the windows for there was nothing to see once captain fielding turning to say something to the navigator noticed keith stewart at the back of the standing officers and smiled slightly at him then he turned and faced the instruments again the stream of halfheard quiet orders from the loudspeaker brought them lower lower upon changing courses delta november you are cleared to descend to aooo feet check your qfe nine nine eight keith saw the captain raise the microphone and heard delta november roger they sat in motionless tension then delta november turn now right on to heading zero four zero and presently delta november you are now on final and eleven miles from touchdown commence your descent at oo feet a minute check your wheels and flaps for landing there was activity in the cockpit the wheels went down with a thump the flaps crept halfway out the note of the engines rose higher as the pitch decreased there was still absolutely nothing to be seen but the grey fog outside there was dead silence on the flightdeck delta november you are four miles from touchdown closing with the centre line turn left now five degrees on to heading zero three five the captain said laconically roger two miles from touchdown now ar d on the centre line suddenly the fog was ripped apart and streaks of it flew past the windscreen and the windows the quiet voice said turn right two degrees on to zero three seven you are one and a half miles from touchdown can you land visually the runway broad and long and comforting lay immediately in front of them the captain lifted the microphone and said delta november is visual thank you he hung the microphone upon a little hook and placed his hands and feet on the controls nodding to the copilot one of the juniors turned to keith and said captain likes everyone strapped in for landing they went back to the seats and as they settled down in them thewheels touched the runway the engines roared suddenly in reverse pitch and died again the brakes squealed a little and the aircraft slowed turned from the runway and taxied to a remote part of the tarmac where the batsman waited one of the lads by keith grumbled theyre putting us the hell of a way from anywhere i got an aunt in allerton i told ma that id try to get to see her the other said theyre putting us over here so the truck can get to us to load and be out of the way the machine came to rest and the engines stopped on the flightdeck the crew entered up their various log books and forms one by one they came down the cabin to the door nowopen the captain stopped by keith saw you watching the talkdown he said did you understand it keith smiled some of it not very much everyone to his trade the officer saidas soon as we get clear of this foggy muck you can come and sit up front he passed on and keith left the machine with dick king how did you enjoy the flight keith smiled like being on the underground it was a bit not much to look at is there the met says well be out of this by the time were over ireland what time do we take off depends what time we finish loading i dont see any sign of the truck yet wed better get some dinner while the goings good they made for the restaurant thats one thing i wanted to ask you keith said who cooks and dishes out the food while youre in flight i do said the flight engineer all the way youve got to sleep some time oh well one of the others does it if ive got my head down or they go without i could help with that keith said i can serve coffee and biscuits or heat up a can of stew i dont know that i can help in any other way well that might be a help ill show you what we do the loudspeaker broadcast a call to the telephone for mr king while they were having lunch he came back to the table bloody trucks arrived he said and gulped down his cup of tea see you later he made off back to the machine keith finished his lunch quickly and followed him anxious to miss no moment of the play the semitrailer stood by the aircraft with the sausagelike component on the tray swathed in hessian twelve feet long and weighing about five tons beside the truck dick lounged with one of the copilots idle neednt have hurried over dinner he said to keith waiting for the bloody crane now captain he knew better presently the mobile crane arrived and a landrover loaded with baulks of heavy timber and the slow delicate business of loading the rotor into the cabin through the door began and positioning it in the right part of the cabin when it was in and straining it down to holding lugs with steel ropes and turnbuckles keith could do nothing technical to help these men who knew their job so well but he worked all afternoon as a labourer for them moving heavy timbers under their direction and passing wires it took three hours to get the load in place and secured then the tank wagon came to refuel the aircraft it was half past five before everything was finished well have a meal before we go said captain fielding take off at seven oclock a foreman electrician from the works was to accompany them and install the rotor in the cathay princess a man called adams dick introduced keith as they walked towards the restaurant again this is mr keith stewart he said writes for the miniature mechanic mr adams stopped dead in his tracks not the keith stewart he inquired thats right mr adams put out his hand well did you ever wak till i tell the lads in the shop i met keith stewart the words comforted keith assuaging something of the inferiority complex that had begun to descend upon him there was so much here that was technical that he did not know here in dick king and in mr adams were two who recognized what he could do in the little technical field that he had made his own he went on to the restaurant with them with restored confidence in himself technical fields he reflected of necessity were small if you were expert in one subject you could not be expert also in all the others for no mans mind was big enough the man who designed the radar presentation that the controller had used to talk them down that morning would not himself have been able to bring them into a safe landing for he would not have known sufficient about aeroplanes they ate together at a long table in the deserted restaurant all nine of them the navigator sat next to keith in reply to a question he said be about midnight local time when we refuel at frobisher nine hours flight be just the same if it was daytime because they dont see the sun there much this time of year say its an hour to refuel another nine hours to vancouver gets us there around dawn after that its daylight down to honolulu in the cold windy january darkness they walked back to the aircraft at about half past six and climbed on board and made their way forward through the cabin climbing over the many securing wires of the rotor lights were switched on the steps were withdrawn from the door and the door itself was slammed shut and secured by one of the young pilots mr adams and keith settled in a couple of the seats and strapped themselves in and the routine of preflight checks began on the flightdeck you done this often before asked mr adams keith shook his head ive never been out of england you dont want to either said mr adams decidedly last year the missus and the daughter kept on at me would i take them to the south of france theyd read about it in the books and grace kelly and all that well i did god love us what it didnt cost flying to nice and flying back again and when we got there not half so much fun as wed have had at blackpool but they liked it gave them something to talk about in salford that where you live aye ever been there keith shook his head the salford and eccles model engineers would like it fine if you could come up to judge one of their exhibitions mr stewart they had the last one in the town hall october was it or november a lot of your designs were there they went on talking model engineering while the starters whined the motors caught and ran and the douglas turned and taxied slowly to the runway framed in amber lights they took off down the runway and were airborne for a moment or two keith saw the lights of liverpool away over on the left then they were blotted out by cloud and only the bright glow of the exhaust manifolds could be seen and the rhythmic pulsations of the red wingtip light reflected from the mist looks like were in cloud again said keith it was like this all the way from blackbushe mr adams stirred from a postprandial doze wonderful the way they find their way about he said comfortably and dozed again keith was too technically interested to follow his example he got up and stood in the dim alley leading to the flightdeck watching what was going on nothing much seemed to be happening the pilots sat relaxed and he judged that the machine was on the automatic pilot for neither of them seemed to be flying it the pilots microphone hung idle on its hook but now and again the radio operator seemed to speak to someone from his desk dick king sat upon a folding seat between and behind the pilots but he did not seem to be doing anything as he watched the darkness ahead through the windscreen seemed to lighten for a moment darken again and lighten suddenly a wisp of white cloud ripped by the windscreen and they were momentarily in moonlight more cloud rose up ahead and enveloped them and that in turn was ripped away then they were flying in full moonlight over a white moonlit floor of cloud and climbing away from it it seemed to keith the most wonderful sight that he had ever seen for it was new to him he could not repress his technical interest he moved forward and spoke to dick quietly how high are we the engineer said thirteen thousand five hundred have a cup of coffee presently when we level off to cruise the captain heard the question and the answer were going up to twentyone thousand he said ill let you know when weve settled down at cruising altitude and you can come and sit up front here if you like keith went back to his seat and sat looking out on the moonlit clouds below at the serene untroubled security of the wing presently the note of the engines altered the nose of the machine dipped slightly and she seemed to take a new stable and rather quieter flight he judged that this was the change to the cruising condition and this was confirmed when dick came aft to the galley keith got up to help him with the coffee and biscuits captain says well have a meal for anybody whos awake and wants it at twentythree zulu at eleven oclock english time then another sometime after we leave frobisher breakfast on the ground at vancouver coffee and biscuits every couple of hours or so when are you going to sleep the engineer smiled pretty soon mate take off landing and refuelling those are my busy tunes ill take one of the inside chairs soon as weve cleared this coffee show me what you do about the meal i can look after that if youre asleep when coffee was over and the cups rinsed keith went forward the captain got out of his seat and stretched and at his invitation keith got into it and sat relaxed watching the wide dim panorama of deep blue sky and moonlit cloud far below he studied the instruments massed on the panels in front of him examining them one by one most of jthem were familiar to him in theory some of the others were explained by the legend on the dial when prolonged cogitation failed to yield the function of a lever or a dial he asked the first officer beside him who explained it to him he passed over the radio equipment without questions knowing that the explanations would be quite beyond his understanding his day had been a long one and at the conclusion of an hour he found that he was growing sleepy he got out of the captains seat and one of the young pilots took his place the navigator smiled as he brushed past him and keith paused to look at the chart well be about here now the officer said putting his pencil on the thin pencil line that led across the north atlantic to greenland keith studied the line do we go over greenland it seemed incredible that he keith stewart should be doing this thats right we might be over the icecap about one in the morning greenwich time shall we see it eskimos and explorers and the dogs with tails curled up over their backs that they called huskies t i doubt it theres usually a lot of cloud cover we might like me to call you if theres anything to see i would keith hesitated are you going to be up for the next hour or two captains having a ziz now said the navigator suppers at eleven oclock greenwich hes getting up for that after that ill have mine dont wake dick king to get the supper if hes asleep keith said give me a nudge he showed me what to do okay he passed aft to the rest quarters the captain and the radio operator were sleeping in their clothes in the two bunks keith settled down in a vacant chair and pushed it back to the reclining angle so many technical interests that he could not absorb because of the need for sleep janice and katie in the flat at baling all seemed very far away his many years of work for the miniature mechanic were something that had happened in a previous existence quite unreal the even murmur of the engines the motionless flight wrapped him round and presently he slept he was roused by dick climbing over him from the inside seat to start getting the supper he got up and lent a hand the whole crew seemed to come to life with the smell of the meal heating on the stove captain fielding and the radio operator got down from the bunks shook themselves and put on their shoes keith realized for the first time that the aircrew were divided virtually into two watches that the pilots could do the routine navigation and the routine radio checks the meal served in two sittings signified a change of watch he rinsed the dishes when mr king went forward and put everything away mr adams slumbered agaih uninterested in the flight and keith went forward to the flightdeck again he sat at the navigators desk for some time but presently he grew sleepy and went back to his seat he was roused by the changed note of the engines as they began the letdown an hour out from frobisher he knew what was happening from the slight pressure difference in his ears and from the time he went and washed his face to clear his mind and then went forward again to the flightdeck the navigator was backat his desk clear for landing he said cloud two tenths at three thousand temperature on the ground minus ten fahrenheit good and cold fortytwo degrees of frost i should stay in the machine if i were you keith was startled whats the outside temperature here now i dont know the officer leanedback and glanced at the panel about minus thirty id like to do anything i can to help if theres anything that i can do the navigator shook his head its just the refuelling then well be off again get your bloody nose frostbitten if you go outside they landed presently upon a white snowcovered runway lit with amber lights using the brakes very little and the engines in reverse pitch a great deal they followed a bluelit taxiway to the few buildings constituting the base and came to a standstill in front of the control tower steps were wheeled up and the door opened the captain and the flight engineer and the two youngest pilots put on heavy coats and leather gloves and went down on to the snow keith followed them to the door and stopped in the entrance checked by the bitterness of the cold the moon was bright upon the snow plain of the airfield and the snowcovered buildings the lights brilliant he saw the captain and the navigator hurrying to the control tower he saw a refuelling truck drive up and stop by the port wing he saw a ladder erected and dick get up on to the wing with one of the refuelling crew and commence to sound the tanks then he could bear the cold no longer and retreated forward into the machine across the web of cables lashing down the rotor in the rest quarters warmth still lingered though cold air was seeping forward from the rear refuelling took threequarters of an hour the crew made a quick external inspection of the aircraft and came hurrying into the fuselage again the door was slammed shut the steps removed the motors started again and the machine moved out on to the runway and took off with a slow careful acceleration on the icy surface till she was airborne on the long flight over the northern wastes of canada to vancouver presently keith went forward and spoke to dick king seated between the pilots at the console what time for the next meal he asked in a low tone nine or ninethirty greenwich the engineer replied he pointed to the clock above the navigators table that time there it showed about fivethirty when keith looked well have coffee and biscuits soon as we level off ill start getting that ready what are you having for the main meal theres some precooked steaks in a carton on the lefthand side up at the top they went on to discuss the detail of the meal ill probably be up for it the engineer said get my head down for a bit presently but ill be up you dont have to be said keith i can do all that in spite of his bold assertion he was growing tired the flight from frobisher to vancouver was a repeat of the flight to frobisher a night flight without incident with nothing to be seen the four pilots the radio officer and the navigator took their turns in the bunks the flight engineer slept in one of the seats these men were all younger than keith stewart physically more fit and accustomed to long hours of flight and irregular sleep they seemed to stand it well but for the first time keith realized the meaning of crew fatigue by the time they reached honolulu he knew he would desire nothing so much as sleep in a bed hecould well understand the necessity for two or three days rest before the crew flew home again to blackbushe he slept most of the way to vancouver only rousing himself to help to serve the meal few of the aircrew ate much during that stage of the flight but the demand for coffee and biscuits was brisk they landed in from over sea on the long vancouver runway in the darkness at about six in the morning of local time refuelled and inspected the machine in misty rain and walked wearily to the airport restaurant you wont get bacon and eggs english fashion here the engineer told keith hot cakes and syrup with a side order of bacon ill show you where everything was strange this seemed no stranger than the rest he accepted the north american food and enjoyed the novelty though mr adams grumbled at the little teabag hanging in the cup of hot water they ate together sitting up in a long row at a stainless steel counter while outside the grey dawn showed in the rain might as well be in england mr adams said the navigator heard him and smiled faintly youll be gasping for breath tonight in honolulu in the grey morning light they walked through the rain to the machine and settled in their places the clock over the navigators desk showed either four or sixteen both seemed quite inapplicable to keith and which it was he had no means of knowing they took off to the west down the long runway and climbed away over water till they entered cloud eleven more hours the navigator told him then well be through half an hour later they broke out into sunshine over a cloud floor the pilots reached for their sunglasses and put them on presently while the first cups of coffee were being consumed the cloud beneath them thinned into holes through which they could see the sea corrugated with waves by the time the empty cups had been collected rinsed and placed in their racks to dry the cloud had practically disappeared and they flew on under a cloudless sky over a blue sea later they met cloud again the day passed in boredom and fatigue for keith he had long exhausted those technical interests of the aircraft that were within his comprehension and he was growing very tired indeed he dozed wearily much of the day with his shoes off for his feet and legs were swelling with the continued sitting and lack of exercise he ate little of the midday meal as the hands of his watch moved gradually past twelve and on to one he began to come to life again for three was the hour of landing english time when this slow purgatory would be over since they were nearly half way round the world and they were to land in the late afternoon he guessed that his watch still cherished the opinion that it was the middle of the night soon after two activity began on the flightdeck and the letdown began he went forward and the captain pointed out a very small cloud dead ahead of them and very far away that could be over oahu he said its either that or maui but i think its oahu were on the range now keith nodded and went back to the navigators desk to look at the chart honolulu it appeared was the name of a town and not an island as he had supposed it was on an island called oahu by no means the largest of the group he went back to his seat and sat down wondering for the first time if he was not absolutely crazy to be here at all ealing was his place and writing articles for the miniature mechanic was his job these wastes of sunlit sea these islands with strange names like oahu were no part of his life he owed it to janice to try to get back her inheritance but still ealing was his place he could stay with the aircraft of course and presently the crew would take him back to blackbushe only forty miles from ealing a truck or a coach would take him up the great west road a red bus up the south ealing road and he would be home again home in his workshop in his own routine abruptly he realized that he was afraid afraid of the unknown that lay before him he must do better than that for janice before he could have licence to go home the island grew ahead of them and there was more activity upon the flightdeck dick king was in the folding seat between the pilots and the captain was talking into the small microphone they dropped off height as they approached the island and approached it from a little to the south of east a considerable town with docks and shipping lay upon the southern shore and to the west of this there was an enormous airport apparently about five miles long they made a wide circuit of this and approached from the southwest and touched down upon a runway halfway up die length of the field they taxied to the customs entry building near the garlanded civil airport building and stopped the motors keith asked the flight engineer what time is it here ten minutes to five in the afternoon steps were wheeled up to the aircraft the door opened and they made their way out on to the tarmac carrying their luggage the humid heat hit keith like a blow he was wearing a blue serge suit with a waistcoat a woollen shirt and thick woollen underwear clothes that had been reasonable enough in england thirtysix hours before but which were intolerable in the tropics where everybody seemed to be wearing a light shirt and trousers and little else moreover he was carrying his suitcase and his raincoat he stood with the crew in a small group while a small oriental man in charge of a brawny customs officer came up and greeted captain fielding very good afternoon captain he said he spoke with a slight american accent i am harold yamasuki of the yamasuki trading company incorporated we are agents for the tanker ship the cathay princess you have had a good flight you arrived exactly on time captain fielding put out his hand nice to meet you mr yamasuki he said yes we had a good flight no troubles he turned around this is mr adams who is to superintend the installation of the rotor you had a cable about him mr yamasuki stopped shaking hands with the captain and shook hands with mr adams very glad to know you he said yes we had the radiogram about mr adams he will be great help now everybody must go to the entry formalities with passports and vaccination certificates ready please and after that the customs you give bags to the boy here and he will meet you with them in the examination room there are nine yes nine i will now call the beachcomber hotel and arrange accommodation you will not mind if two must share a room a room with two beds i will meet you as you come from customs and we go to the hotel then we can talk more now you go with officer to passport examination the captain said theyll want us to shift the aircraft away from here before we go to the hotel are you unloading tonight it is too late now said mr yamasuki tomorrow i think at seven oclock we will begin to unload by the time we could begin tonight it will be dark and there would be the possibility of accident and damage to the rotor i think it will be better in the day mr adams said im with you there mate all the way they went from the brilliant sunshine into the cool shade of the airconditioned examination room keith passed through with the crew without difficulty and emerged into the customs shed with them nobody had anything to declare and only a cursory examination was made the bags were loaded into an elongated motor car the captain spoke to the control tower and to shell upon the telephone and the crew went back to the machine to move it to the park keith stewart went with them leaving his coat jacket and waistcoat in the car even so he sweated profusely as he walked out to the aircraft in his braces and blue trousers there were palm trees by the foreshore and the sea was glittering and blue it was incredible that he keith stewart should be in a place like this moving the aircraft nearly a mile away and refuelling it took an hour the sun had set and the quick darkness was covering the airport when the last man got down from the aircraft slammed the door and locked it in the fading light the aircraft movements seemed to be continuous they took off and landed with their winking navigation lights in the soft velvety dusk in what appeared to be an endless stream keith stood watching them fascinated busy place this remarked mr king the long car appeared with mr yamasuki and took them to the hotel the agent consulted with the desk clerk about the rooms and then turned to the captain i will now leave you to rest he said tomorrow at half past six in the morning i will come back with a car and the truck will be beside the aeroplane at seven they talked about the mobile crane i will arrange said mr yamasuki one thing i have called the ship the cathay princess to say you have arrived i think some of the officers may come here tonight to meet you and to talk about the electrical work with mr adams as he was going down the steps to the car keith stewart stopped him you can tell me mr yamasuki is it possible to get from here to tahiti to tahiti there is no regular service the matson ships they go tahiti to honolulu but not from here to tahiti there are rumours that they will change but i do not know there are norwegian cargo steamers which call sometimes from vancouver to tahiti they carry a few passengers will one of those be going soon mr yamasuki shook his head i do not think so one was here last week perhaps in two months time i will find out sometimes there is an island trading schooner going to tahiti they take passengers not very comfortable sometimes to sleep on deck would one of those be going soon i do not know i will ask tonight and tell you in the morning you wish to go from honolulu to tahiti yourself thats right i do not think it will be easy but i will ask keith stewart was depressed and tired and very very hot in his unsuitable clothes he went back to the group at the desk and signed his name in the register and found no that he had been allocatedto share a room with dick king they went up in the elevator to the fifth floor the beachcomber was a fairly modern hotel on the unfashionable dockside side of the city much used by aircrews and ships officers on account of its nearness to the airfield and to the docks it had no swimming pool but it commanded a pleasant view out over the ocean in the front and the mountains at the back keith and dick king found themselves in a back room with a shower two beds converted into lounges for the day and a wide deep verandah furnished with wicker chairs and table the door of the room was louvred for the full height permitting the cool trade wind to blow through the room continuously im for a shower said dick king throwing off his clothes and making for it keith stewart had never had a shower in the whole of his life he had seen them in shop windows and had read about them but one had never come his way as a boy and a young man in renfrew he had had a bath once a week and though he had graduated from that to having a bath whenever he felt like it it would have seemed to him a senseless extravagance to have one every day he certainly felt like one now while dick was in the shower he stripped off his heavy woollen underwear with a sigh of relief and stood in the cool breeze with a towel round his waist presently he opened his suitcase and stood looking at his clothing ruefully his woollen cricket shirts and grey flannel trousers were the best he could do they might be tolerable after dark but he knew now that they would be very hot in the daytime still they were all he had presently dick king came out and he went in and tried the shower experimentally he found it strange but not unpleasant and he stayed under it for a long time gradually reducing the temperature of the water and washing away his fatigue with the sweat when he came out he was cool and refreshed he would have to have some money in his pocket and they used dollars here it seemed he had never cashed a travellers cheque before and consulted dick who showed in him where to sign it and told him they would cash it at the desk he followed this advice when they went downstairs then they went to the verandah bar beers the cheapest said dick not like the english beer a kind of fizzy lager but its what we mostly drink here on account of the dollar allowance in the bar most of the rest of the aircrew were already gathered with captain davies of the cathay princess the chief engineer and the third engineer a lad called alec bourne captain fielding turned to dick and keith to introduce them this is mr king flight engineer he said he smiled this is mr keith stewart we call him flight engineer under instruction which means hes come along with us for the ride he writes for a model paper in london were hoping that hell give us a good spin when he gets back the third engineers jaw dropped and they all shook hands the third said it wouldnt be keith stewart of the miniature mechanic by any chance dick king said the very same you read the miniature mechanic ive read it every week ever since i was a little nipper said the lad ive got every copy since at home and a lot on board ma sends it to me every week fancy meeting you sir i never thought id do that except maybe to see you opening an exhibition he hesitated and added would you like a beer sir a beer was just exactly what keith stewart needed and while it was coming he talked models to the third engineer i made a hornet about two years ago the young man told him im working on a gannet now did the hornet go all right it went fine i had a bit of difficulty getting it started at the first go off but then i got a bottle of american fuel and she goes fine i got a little airscrew on her for the load keith nodded they generally put more ether in the american fuels if youre using that i think i should wash out the cylinder with a light oil after each run ive heard that the american fuels are more corrosive than ours put in a drop or two of threeinone or something like that the young man nodded gratefully thanks for the tip mr stewart where do you work oh in the engineroom workshop the third said weve got a six inch lathe there and a shaper its quite well equipped really he paused and added a little shyly if youve got the time to come on board and have a look round mr stewart theres one or two of the lads would like to meet you id like to do that very much said keith id like to see your workshop twelve beers arrived upon a tray carried by a very pretty asiatic girl in a cheongsam of figured silk these were distributed around and the talk became general alec bourne turned to his captain ive just asked mr stewart if hed like to come on board and see the engines and the workshop sir of course captain davies turned to keith theres more model engineering done in that workshop than was ever done on bits for the ship you should see the commotion when alec here was trying to get his little engine started up they had to use the main engines as a starter motor for it so the chief was telling me the third flushed uneasily mr stewart designed it sir it was the fuel that was wrong there was general laughter come on board any time you like mr stewart said the captain thats very good of you sir said keith i thought perhaps id stick with the rotor and lend a hand unloading that tomorrow morning and perhaps come down with it to the dock fine what are your movements mr stewart are you staying here a bit or going back to england with the aircraft keith said well thats just the point i really want to get to tahiti but i asked mr yamasuki and he said he didnt know of any service from honolulu to tahiti he was going to find out this evening and let me know he hesitated i suppose you dont know of any service sir captain davies shook his head i never heard of one there must be an odd tramp or two of course its got to be tahiti has it youve got some business there or something thats right these merchant service officers would probably be understanding and sympathetic about events following on a wreck he pulled out his wallet and took the cutting from the times from it my sister and my brotherinlaw were sailing out here in a yacht he said they got wrecked on an island in the tuamotus ive got to get down there and see about things the grave and salvage and anything that might need to be done he gave the cutting to the captain the officers were very interested and asked a number of questions about the yacht and about john dermott captain davies had been an officer of the royal naval reserve in the last war im almost sure i remember him he said thoughtfully at invergordon or was it scapa an rn twoandahalf in one of the tribal class wait now the man im thinking of had a broken nose boxing or something thats right said keith he had a broken nose the captain dropped his eyes again to the cutting he was a good seaman he said better than most rn its curious it should have to end like this the three merchant officers turned their minds to keith stewarts problem and discussed it carefully theres a fortnightly air service from fiji through samoa to tahiti said the captain you can probably fly from here to samoa but its the hell of a long way round how far would that be keith asked id only be guessing might be miles ill work it out for you tomorrow when you come on board sounds like it might be a bit expensive for me said keith a little ruefully i was hoping thered be something more direct and cheap something like a cargo steamer taking a few passengers captain davies shook his head i dont know of anything but ill find out for you mr stewart he handed back the cutting and keith put it back into his wallet they all turned to the beer in the buzz of conversation the chief engineer said to his captain theres always jack donelly nonsense captain davies said shortly the mans mad it seemed to be an unwelcome subject and keith did not pursue it but he noted the name they set to work upon the beer and to a consideration of the unloading and the handling of the rotor from the aircraft to the ship the air officers being principally concerned to avoid damage to the aircraft by the crane reaching into the fuselage through the door and the marine officers being principally concerned to get the rotor undamaged into its field magnets and bearings in the engine room keith stood a round of beers and was concerned at the inroad that it made into his small store of dollars and presently they all went to dinner in the hotel dining room all who had flown from england went to bed early that night in the bedroom that keith shared with dick the moon was bright upon the mountains the palm trees rustled continuously and a warm wind hardly cooler than in daytime blew steadily through the room keith unpacked his thick woollen pyjamas and eyed them with distaste youll boil in those in this place said dick king i dont sleep in anything in these tropical places look put the sheet over your middle and tuck it in like this so you dont catch cold then youve got your shoulders arms and legs out in the cool keith followed his example fell asleep at once to the murmur of the palm trees and slept like a log all night next morning he was up with the aircrew and out on the airport with them at seven oclock mr yamasuki said i have asked about the ships or aeroplanes to tahiti there are no ships on regular service no aeroplanes the next norwegian freighter is due here on march rd that was seven weeks ahead nothing before that i am so sorry it is possible to go to tahiti by air through samoa or else perhaps by los angeles i think either way would be expensive pan american can tell you what the fare is and the services at the passenger terminal keith nodded til go and ask them presently he knew quite well that the answer would be far beyond his means you didnt hear of any irregular service a trading schooner or anything like that mr yamasuki said i have no news of one sometimes with a trading schooner there would not be any advance news she would arrive one day and stay perhaps three or four days and let it be known that she was calling at papeete and other places one might come today or perhaps not for six months keith thanked him and went on working with the aircrew to get the rotor out of the aeroplane without damaging either it took about two hours to get it on the truck most of the aircrew then went back to the hotel to rest and swim and shop on their small dollar allowance for the next two days before beginning the long flight back to england mr adams and dick and keith rode on the truck through the streets of honolulu to kapalama basin where the tanker was berthed there was nothing he could do to help the dockyard engineers get the rotor into the ship and he went on board with dick king the third engineer met them and invited them below to see the main engine room and the workshop and more particularly the gannet engine of keith stewarts design which was half finished a little box of carefully machined unassembled bits half the engine room have had a hand in this the lad from dartford said proudly whenever somebody gets tired of reading peter cheyney he comes and asks if he can machine one of the pistons i sometimes think that im just managing the job not making it he was in trouble over the crankshaft machining jig you said to make it of high tensile steel in the serial mr stewart but i cant seem to lay my hands on just a little bit anywhere in honolulu the smallest i can find is four inch bar would it be all right to use mild steel instead keith had had this one before in letters from andover to auckland he picked up the miniature mechanic from the bench and turned to the jig drawing that he had made in the basement room in somerset road baling with janice sleeping in the room next door ooo miles away ive got a mod for that he said youve got to retain this eighth inch thickness here because of the tool clearance if youre going to make it in mild steel make it an l section like this he added swift pencil lines to the printed drawing its just a little bit more complicated youd have to get out this bit with an end mill about threesixteenths have you got a mill like that on board the third nodded thats easy mr stewart i could do that in the drilling machine best i think thanks a lot presently keith pulled a small box from the pocket of his blazer ive got a little thing here that might amuse you he unwrapped the little hornetengined generating set from the rag that wrapped it round and put it on the bench gee said the third reverently that really is something he studied it carefully whats the engine mr stewart it looks a bit like a hornet its a hornet with a different cylinder and piston cam gear and valves to run on petrol and a governor in place of the reduction gear he said he picked it up shook it to check that there was still petrol in the little tank turned it upside down to prime the carburettor and flipped it into life with his thumb the little engine caught with a crackling roar speeded up steadied as the pea bulb glowed with light the noise attracted other engineers from the engine room and soon the workshop was crowded somebody said laughing has bill adams seen this no i dont think he has said keith cor thatll give him something to think about anyone can build a big generator set that you can get your hands around inside fetch him along bert and ask him how hed like to service this one mr adams was fetched and stood in reverent awe till the little motor ran out of petrol and stopped and almost at the same time the dockyard hooter sounded for twelve oclock knocking off time for dinner keith wrapped his generator set up again and put it in the box in his pocket later he filled the tank with an eggcup of petrol provided for use in the ships launch strained carefully through a piece of chamois leather the officers escorted mr adams and dick and keith up into the wardroom for lunch after lunch as they were sitting smoking at the table over cups of tea and coffee captain davies said ive been making some inquiries about your journey to tahiti mr stewart not very satisfactory im afraid i cant find out anything about a cargo boat in the near future and theres no regular service keith nodded slowly mr yamasuki said this morning that a trading schooner might come in at any time no one would know beforehand she was coming its a possibility thecaptain agreed weve been here for four and a half weeks now there was one just after we came but she was going to palmyra i dont know where she was going after that where do they tie up in case one did come in asked keith this one berthed just inside the harbour just the other side of the merchant officers training school the captain said i think they like to sail in and out if theres a fair wind save the cost of a tug you dont think theres one there now not that i know of but thats where youd get news of them if anywhere it might be worth a walk along and talking to the longshoremen they might know more than the harbourmaster the first officer smiled he doesnt bother much about the small fry the trouble is ive got so little time keith said if theres nothing turns up thats within my means ill have to go back with the aircraft the day after tomorrow more like tuesday said dick king captain fielding said this morning wed be taking off at dawn on tuesday thats right said mr adams well be having the test run on monday then if everythings all right he can take me home again it doesnt give much time agreed the captain the second mate said jack donelly there was a little ripple of laughter round the table only the captain remained serious i wouldnt think of it he said the first officer took him up nor would i sir for myself but i dont want to get to tahiti as much as mr stewart as i see it its either him or nothing mr stewarts over twentyone i dont see why he shouldnt have a look at him i wouldnt be any party to it said the captain if he ever gets his ship out of hock to the harbourmaster hell just go off and disappear and no more heard of him ever ive seen it all my life keith asked who is this jack donelly anyway the first officer leaned back in his chair hes an american from oregon or somewhere maybe hes a fisherman i wouldnt know his ships a sort of slooprigged fishing boat a sailing boat he built it himself quite small i should say that hes a halfcaste and id guess that his mother was a polynesian hes a big chap though and he must be a good seaman because he sailed here from the united states alone singlehanded hes got the mentality of a child of ten said the captain that may be sir hes so dumb that he can hardly string two words together but he did get here from the united states two thousand ruddy miles of open sea found the islands you cant get away from that yes said the captain and you know how he did it i do keith asked how did he do it got on the air route between here and san francisco andfollowed the aeroplanes the captain said scornfully there are about ten flights every day or more thats a fine way to navigate never mind sir he got here he wont get to tahiti that way said the captain theres no air service is he going to tahiti keith inquired the captain leaned forward look mr stewart hesaid i dont want to stand in your way if you want to go and talk to him but first of all ill tell you about jack donelly he came in here about a fortnight ago and sailed right in to this basin as far as he could go till his bow was practically in the street and tied up just ahead of us ill admit he handled his ship well he came in under sail he hasnt got a motor with his warps all ready fore and aft got down his main and came in under jib dropped the jib and came alongside sweet as anything chucked his warps on to the quay hopped on shore and made her fast bow and stern in two shakes of a ducks arse it was pretty to watch ill agree with number one here hes probably a good seaman he paused now thats as far as i go the port authorities were after him as soon as he tied up he hadnt got peimission to berth there but that was the least of it he hadnt got any ships papers at all no registration no manifest nothing he hadnt got a bill of health and he didnt seem to know what it was he hadnt even got a passport i shouldnt think hes got any money he paused i think they were pretty kind to him all things considered he remarked they called him a yacht and towed him round into the yacht harbour how did you come to know about him then keith asked he came on board the captain said he came on board to ask the way to palmyra and half a dozen other places hes got no charts he wouldnt know how to use one if he had it what hes got is a small school atlas with the whole of the pacific ocean on one page and a pretty dirty page it is i can tell you he picks the biggest merchant ship that he can see and comes on board to ask the course to the next place thats why he berthed just ahead of us we were the biggest ship in harbour at the time keith asked did you give him the course he didnt seem to know where he wanted to go to the captain said indignantly he just wanted a course to what he called the islands well this is an island but he didnt likethis one apparently too civilized i suppose the second grinned what he wants is the huahines naked women thats about the strength of it the captain said hes been reading the books i shouldnt think he can read remarked the chief engineer well somebodys been telling him stories then keith asked again did you give him a course sir i did what i could for him the captain said i gave him half a dozen all magnetic true courses wouldnt be any good to him and no good talking about variation being different at the end of ooo miles i gave him a mean value for the course to several places nukahiva was one i remember and tahiti was another of course ocean currents dont mean anything to him he can write just the first officer observed he drew a thick line with a stub of pencil on his atlas from here to each place and wrote the course along the line i never saw such a mess keith wrinkled his brows in perplexity but can he find an island miles away just with a compass course from here of course he cant the captain said scornfully hell go off and therell be no more heard of him hell die and thats the end of it im not quite sure that i agree with you sir said the first officer what dont you agree with i dont think hell die he may get to the wrong place and he may take the hell of a long time to get there i talked to him after you gave up and gave him a beer i must say i was rather impressed what was it that impressed you mr fairlie well for one thing sir he knows a lot about birds sea birds i mean the captain snorted whats that got to do with it is this raft book stuff yes sir i think it is birds fly from a to b just like aeroplanes what i mean is if he gets within a hundred miles of land i think hell find it he paused swell seaweed floating mangrove seeds all that sort of thing things that we dont use the captain got up from the table well ive heard everything now and so have you mr stewart if you like to go tosea with a bloke that navigates by mangrove seeds dont let me stop you he smiled one of the boys will show you where the yacht harbour is if you want to go there he went out and to his cabin the others all got up from the table the first officer glanced quizzically at keith want to go any further with it he asked keith hesitated well i dont know do you think hes going to tahiti for a start so far as i could gather he didnt much mind where he went footloose you might say do you think hell get there mr fairlie stubbed his cigarette out in the ashtray its an opinion mr stewart ive got a better opinion of him than captain davies has in some ways what the captain says is right hes simple if you like he thinks like a child ten years old but hes certainly a good seaman and he knows a lot about the sea you think hell get there in the end yes i think he probably will he glanced at keith it wont be comfortable would you go with him yourself mr fairlie smiled if i was absolutely desperate and had to get there somehow at whatever risk yes i think i would there was half a minutes silence in the wardroom to go back tamely with the aeroplane to blackbushe to renounce all chance of getting janice her inheritance because he was afraid of jack donelly would be cowardice if he did not at least investigate this line he felt that he would never be able to tell katie the truth about this journey at one point he would have to lie and go on in the same lie for the rest of his life at the same time he felt that he was sliding deeper into the mire of the unknown and the fantastically dangerous still there was no need to decide anything until hed met the man i think id better go and have a talk to him keith said at last chapter six the first officer changed out of uniform into linen slacks and a light shirt open at the neck borrowed mr yamasukis car and driver and took keith to the alawai yacht harbour they dismissed the car and walked past the rows of sleek mo tor cruisers till they came to the less opulent end mr fairlie pointed out a vessel with one mast hes still here i was half afraid he might have left by now the vessel that he pointed out was a white fishingboat type about forty feet long and very beamy she had one mast and no bowsprit she had no pretensions to yacht finish everything about her was heavy and painted her metal fittings were all of iron the sail upon the boom was of heavy red canvas apparently tanned with oil and ochre there was an appearance of rough efficiency about her but in the alawai yacht harbour she looked like a poor relation she was moored sternon to the quay and a single plank gave access to her deck mr fairlie stood on the quay and hailed jack donelly you aboard jack ive got a friend id like you to meet he hailed again and presently there was movement in the cabin and a man appeared at the hatch he was a very big man possibly forty years old oliveskinned with tousled black hair and a somewhat vacant expression he was bare to the waist and wore only a pair of very soiled blue jeans he blinked in the sunlight and muttered who are you yelling at i was having a lie down mr fairlie said you remember me jack jim fairlie from the cathay princess the tanker you came aboard the first day in we had a beer together i havent got any beer said the mariner vaguely thats all right said the first officer i didnt come for that i brought a friend along with me to see your ship mind if we come aboard i havent got any whisky either havent got nothing mr fairlie said quietly to keith except methylated spirits i should think aloud he said thats all right jack well come down if we may i want you to meet mr stewart hes from england mr donelly grunted turned his back on them and retreated from the hatch into the cabin he may be on the booze mr fairlie said to keith and hes very shy but theres no harm in him i think he means for us to go on down they walked gingerly down the sagging teetering plank on to the transom of the vessel stepped over the horse ducked under the boom and stood on deck by the tiller the vessel had no cockpit jack donelly appeared again at the hatch guy fell in off that plank he muttered wanted dough for berthing here or sumpn he got a swim he threw back his head and laughed suddenly and a little shrilly startling to hear he wanted seven dollars and two bits and he got a swim he went on laughing and then stopped suddenly tell you sumpn he muttered you tread on the bow warp up forward by the winch he said seriously n she goes forward just a tiddy little way n then the plank conies off the transom thats how its done but dont tell anybody they laughed dutifully has he been back again asked mr fairlie mr donelly shook his head wordlessly i want you to meet mr stewart jack said the first officer his names keith keith stewart hes from england and hes having a look round i was telling him how you built this ship yourself and sailed it out here from the states keats said mr donelly no keith jack keith keith said the mariner obediently never heard a name like that before its a scots name said keith did you build this ship yourself mr donelly grunted its a big job said keith did you have anyone to help you mr donelly shook his head how long did it take you bout five years worked in the lumber mill some of the time get dough for fastenings and that keith ran his eye over the ship with a new interest there was nothing that a patient woodworker could not have done over the years except his eye fell on the seams of the deck planking each plank was twelve or fifteen feet long and tailored in plan form to fit the washboard and the bulwarks at the outside of the deck the curvature reducing to a straight edge towards the centre of the ship where the hatch and the skylight of the cabin made a line keith stooped and ran his finger along the seam how did you get these curves a gleam of interest illuminated the dark features router you routed each plank all along its length to fit the next one it was not impossible but it denoted a skill and a love of ships that threw a little beam of light on the character of the man the owner grunted in assent then he heaved himself out on deck and stood beside them a massive powerful man show you sumpn he muttered he led keith down the port side to a point about three feet aft of the mast went down on his knees and pointed out a blemish on one plank caulked with a tarry compound thats where my finger come off he said seriously he lifted his left hand and showed that the forefinger of the left hand was missing down to the second joint in the router mr donelly grunted boss said i shouldnt have been using the machinery but how in hell would a guy do these curves without he had a router thats what i said to him he couldnt answer that how long did it hold you up the job was the thing two weeks i guess soon as it quit bleeding i could work keith got up from the deck and the owner got up with him he looked around studying everything with a technical eye unpractised in the shipwrights art where did you get the hull lines from he asked out of a drawing in some book mr donelly shook his head guy gave me a lot of blue papers with white lines he said i put mythinking cap on but they didnt seem to mean nothing he paused got some bits of hardwood n made half models over n over till i got one right took the frames off of that got it below still it was the old shipwrights approach keith said gan i see it the man turned and made for the hatch keith and mr fairlie followed him down the ladder inside the ship was little but an empty shell she was fairly new so that the dirt had had no time to accumulate but she was already dirty there were rough unpainted wooden berths to port and starboard the port one with a palliasse on it that was evidently jacks bed there was a cupboard with a deeply fiddled top on which stood a primus stove and a few dirty glasses and plates forward there was a mass of sails and sailcloth and rope in tangled confusion erupting into the living portionof the ship aft of the hatch behind the ladder seemed to be a tangled mass of nets and cordage the whole smelt strongly of saltwater and of jack donelly the owner burrowed into the forecastle treading over sails and rope with his bare horny rather dirty feet he emerged with three half models glued and screwed to pieces of hard finegrained planking he showed them to keith shyly these are what i made keith took one from him and examined it critically half models of ships were no novelty to hinc but he had never examined one that had shown better workmanship it was about two feet long made of some hard dark wood perhaps mahogany frenchpolished he sat down uncomfortably on the vacant berth to examine it the better squinting along the lines from bow to stern you certainly made a good job of this he said seriously i never saw one better you want to make them nice commented the builder else you get mad looking at them he took the half model from keith thats the second one youre looking at this was the first he gave him another i looked at it two weeks maybe more but it didnt seem right somehow looked like she wouldnt rise to a following sea he took that model and gave keith the second i filled out the buttocks a tiddy bit on this one n i didnt like that no better made her look fatarsed and slow he took that model away and gave the third to keith so i put my cap on n brought the beam back aft a ways not so much cods head n mackerel tail couldnt see nothing wrong with that so thats the way i built her the process of design by eye was nothing new to keith there were very fine lines scribed vertically upon the half model that he handled at intervals all down her length you took the frames off this mr donelly dropped his eyes and shuffled one foot upon the floor you want book learning for that he muttered its not right what i told you i built her all myself the schoolmaster at cushman he set out the frames but i did everything else keith warmed to this uncouth dirty man you designed her and you built her he said setting out the frames from the half model thats nothing how does she behave at sea okay bit heavy on the helm first go so i took a tiddy bit off the boom n leach makes her easier to reef anyways n just as fast mr fairlie asked you built her at cushman jack wheres that mouth of the suislaw thats in oregon south oregon the owner muttered interrogation seemed to make him shy and resentful keith reached up and ran his finger along the joint between one of the deck beams and the frame at the side ofthe ship it seemed to him that it would be difficult to insert a tenthou feeler in it and all the others were the same you certainly made a beautiful job of building her he said the owner glowed with pleasure i kinda liked doing it he said it took quite a while but i kinda liked it i know said keith i like making things but mine arent so big as yours he pulled the little box from his pocket and unwrapped the generator set and gave it to mr donelly who handled it as carefully as an egg in his great horny hands you made this he inquired he designed it and made it electrics and all mr fairlie said just like you did this ship mr donelly stared at it in wonder i never did see such a tiddy little thing he said it doesnt go does it it goes all right said keith he took the little engine turned it upside down adjusted the tiny carburettor delicately and flipped it into life with his thumb it broke into a roar disproportionate to its size steadied its note and the pea bulb lit up he placed it on the bare wood of the cabin floor and it went on generating steadily mr donelly went down on his hands and knees upon the floor and studied it entranced making the electricity he breathed thats right i seen the big ones he said threecylinder diesels and that making electricity he raised his head say mr keats i guess this is the smallest in the world isnt it keith said its not the smallest engine i think perhaps it might be the smallest generating set mr donelly broke into a cackle of laughter and looked up at mr fairlie well what do you know he inquired theres the smallest generating set in the world running right here in the cabin of the mary belle folks wouldnt never believe me if i went ashore and told them that theyd say i was nuts keith leaned down and stopped it with his pencil fearing that it might overheat if he kept it running too long without a cooling draught of air mr donelly bent closer to examine it at rest look at all those tiddy little wires he breathed as he scrutinized the armature all going the same way and each to the right place he raised his head mr keats did you think out all that yourself the way each had to go keith nodded everybody to his own job he said i couldnt have begun to build this ship i wouldnt know where to start you start with the half model what i showed you ah yes but if i made a half model i wouldnt know by looking at it if it would make a good ship not like you do you wouldnt keith shook his head not a hope youve got to really know the sea for that you must have been at sea all your life my old man said mr donelly he took me offshore first of all when i was six long lining course i was playing around in scows and that with all the other kids before keith nodded you build up experience without knowing it he said then when the fit takes you to build a ship like this or build a generating set like that it just comes easy mr donelly glanced at him with common understanding from the floor say you got sumpn he said building mary belle was just like it was kinda fun keith reached down and picked up the little generating set wrapped it up and put it back into his pocket mr donelly watched him do it regretfully he got back on to his feet and sat down on his berth keith asked him what are your plans jack where do you go from here i guess im going to the islands keith said ive got a reason for asking that i want to get down to tahiti and then out to an island called marokota thats somewhere in the tuamotus but theres no regular service and no trading schooner and anyway ive not got very much money mr fairlie here suggested that you might be going down that way there was a long silence ma came from huahine mr donelly said at last she said for me to get back to the islands where id meet up with my own sort so thats where im going mr fairlie asked to huahine i guess ill go there some time i dont know where it is its not far from tahiti its in the same group thats what a guy said one time then another guy said it was this place nukahiva its not jack its nowhere near nukahiva its a bit over to the west from tahiti ill give you a chart i got an atlas said the mariner he rummaged under the palliasse on the wooden boards of his bunk and produced his one navigational aid it opened automatically at the map of the pacific ocean i looked at all the tiddy little names he said but i never see huahine i guess they left it out by mistake mr fairlie said i think its probably too small to show on the atlas jack if youre going to take keith along with you to tahiti ill give you a chart that shows every island on the way and round about tahiti i know weve got a lot of outdated ones on board mr donelly grunted keith guessed that he had little use for charts never having used one you want to get down to tahiti donelly asked thats right got a bed keith hesitated somewhat taken aback mr donelly helped him out by lifting the dirty corner of his palliasse it rustled evidently filled with hay or straw lake this i havent at the moment keith said but ill get something theres a bolt of sailcloth you could sleep on but i guess youd find that kinda hard said mr donelly ill get a bed like yours said keith how much money would i have to pay you for the passage well now said the mariner id have to put my thinking cap on for that the harbourmaster he wanted seven dollars and two bits when he come on board and had his swim he cackled intolaughter i reckon hed want more now what with drying his clothes then theres the eats he sat in evident bewilderment how long you reckon it would take to sail to this tahiti keith shook his head i dont know at all mr fairlie asked how long did it take you to get here from san francisco jack three weeksn two days i had a fair reaching wind most of the way its a little bit farther to tahiti said the first officer and youve got to get through the doldrums youll need food for six weeks at least i dunno what that would cost said mr donelly he lifted his head and cut the gordian knot with decision say he asked how much you got about a hundred dollars said keith conservatively well then said the ship owner the fares a hundred dollars he leaned back with the air of one who has concluded a difficult business negotiation we bake every day said mr fairlie but we carry a stock of biscuits in sealed tins twentyeight pounds ill talk to captain davies maybe we could let you have two or three of those against repayment in england save the dollars anyway thatd be very kind of you said keith i got bouthalf a sack of cornmeal n some grits said mr donelly i guess we could catch fish a day or two n dry some of them n salt down the rest theres plenty sun here dry the fish not like itd be at home where would you put them to dry asked mr fairlie mr donelly looked surprised out on shore some place he said i dont think theyd let you do that here jack huh theyd get people on the power yachts bellyaching about the smell they said i was to berth here mr donelly muttered got a motor boat n towed me round keith judged it better to change the subject well think up something together about the food he said when do you want to sail most any time the owner said and youd be willing to take me along the other raised his head you get sick it was better to face it ill probably be sick keith said how long does it go on for twothree days i get sick after a spell on shore theres nothing to it i dont suppose ill be much use to you at first keith said ill do the best i can cant do better n that mr donelly said youll be bringing the tiddy little motor along this he fingered the little box oh yes ill be bringing this move in when you like said mr donelly they arranged that keith would go into the question of the food supplies with mr fairlie and presently they left the mary belle and took a taxi back to the cathay princess in the wardroom mr fairlie said i think weve earned a beer he went and fetched a bottle and two glasses filled them and raised his own i think youre a brave man he said keith smiled so do i but i liked him well enough theres no harm in him mr fairlie agreed hell probably get you there but i wouldnt take any liquor on board i wont the first officer eyed him speculatively youre technical do you know anything about navigation anything at all keith shook his head mr fairlie sighed well theres no time to teach you astronavigation but ill look out the charts and a volume of the pacific islands pilot for you this evening and give you an hour on them tomorrow morning you can read at any rate and thats more than jack donelly can keith left the ship soon afterwards and walked back through the town to the beachcomber hotel looking as he walked for a shop that sold a mattress the prices did not seem to him to be excessive but they were all far too good to put into the mary belle he knew that he was in for an indefinite spell of hard living and he had no great fear of it it was many years since he had suffered much dis comfort though as a child and a young man in renfrew he had known plenty of it to sleep on a straw palliasse upon bare boards would be no novelty to him the food was a perplexity something better was needed than jacks cornmeal grits and dried fish but what he needed was to him unknown or how to buy it he clung to the thought of the sealed tins of biscuit that might come from the cathay princess in his room at the hotel he found dick lying upon his bed listening to the radio and told him all about it i fixed up that id go with him he said hes not as mad as all that the engineer raised himself on one elbow hes going to tahiti keith started to undress preparatory to a shower hell go anywhere so long as its away from here hell take me to tahiti sure about that keith sat down upon the bed i think so captain da vies isnt old man i know ive been talking to jack donelly all afternoon on board his boat the boats quite good you know whats more he built her himself he did without any help keith nodded singlehanded that doesnt mean that he can find his way to tahiti from here though its an awful big place the sea i know keith got up from the bed tve never done this before he muttered theres no fuel problem anyway because all he uses is the wind it seems to boil down to carrying enough to eat and drink foran indefinite time how much water storage has he got i saw a fortygallon drum upended tied to the mast with rope lashings i suppose thats it how long is the trip going to be jim fairlie says at least six weeks youll want more than that much water then old man keith went into the shower and dick lay back upon his bed in perplexity what keith did was no concern of his really and yet he felt himself involved in the world of workshops and of amateur mechanics keith was a wellknown man and that world was dicks world also if keith were to lose his life at sea with this man jack donelly inevitably dick king would be involved and charged with some responsibility by other members of their common world for it would be known throughout that world that he had been with keith in honolulu if keith were to disappear at sea as captain davies had warned him bluntly might well happen he dick king would be telling a defensive story of their time in honolulu in the workshops of england for many years to come excusing himself perhaps for all his life he could hear the whispers hes the bloke who was with keith stewart in honolulu and let him go off with that crazy fisherman youd think he might have done something about it he did not like the prospect if only keith knew a little more about foreign countries about the tropics if only he wasnt quite so raw he said no more but lay there troubled in his mind while keith also rested on his bed letting the cool breeze blow over his bare body it seemed to dick that there was no escape from the position he was in keith had some compelling reason to get down to tahiti that was driving him to take the most fantastic risk by going with this halfcaste fisherman if he dick king wished to escape the odium of the future there were only two courses he could take one was to talk keith out of it he did not think that would be possible the other was to try to make the journey a success presently they dressed and went downstairs for a beer before dinner captain davies was there in the bar with captain fielding somewhat the same line of thought may have been running in his mind too because he said evening mr stewart evening mr king beer the engineers said thank you sir the captain said to the girl in the cheongsam two more beers then he turned to keith and said mr fairlie tells me that ive got to provision your ship keith was embarrassed thats not necessary at all sir all he said was that you might let me have some biscuits on repayment in england to help out the grits anddried fish i dont know if youve ever tried to live for two months on dried fish it goes bad of course then the thing to do is to put it in a barrel with some salt youve got to eat it in the end of course some people like it he laughed youd better come on board tomorrow with a list of what you want and well see what weve got thats very kind of you sir the aircraft navigator strolled up to them beer in hand as a matter of fact that really would be a great help i was coming on board tomorrow anyway to see mr fairlie he was going to go over the charts with me well thats something anyway bring your list along thank you sir heres luck he raised his beer youre going to need it said captain davies grimly the air navigator asked is this jack donelly thats right said captain fielding keiths going with him to tahiti can he find tahiti thats the sixtyfourthousanddollar question said captain davies the navigator sipped his beer in thought has he got a sextant of course he hasnt said the captain he looks to see which way the aeroplanes are flying if there arent any aeroplanes he looks for mangrove seeds if there arent any mangrove seeds he follows his compass and thats probably wrong he turned to keith i was right he hasnt got a motor in the ship has he no sir well thats something i dont suppose hes ever had his compass swung just watch he doesnt put a bucket down beside it when he needs it most keith nodded thoughtfully ill watch that sir it makes a big difference does it captain davies laughed try it and see pity about the sextant said the air navigator the track must be just about due south a meridian latitude would give them quite a lot of information youve got to be able to add and subtract for that said captain davies mr king drew the air navigator on one side ive been thinking about that he said i mean hes made up his mind to go a meridian sight for latitude isnt very difficult is it its the easiest sight there is said the navigator you want a sextant and a nautical almanac and a rough idea of greenwich time then youve only got to add and subtract he could learn to do that couldnt he jack donelly no keith keith stewart i mean look at the things he does in the shop with mikes and sine bars and all that hed learn to manage a sextant in five minutes with somebody to put him in the way of it the navigator stood in thought its an idea wheres the sextant coming from i think i know where one could pick up one secondhand said the engineer you know where king st crosses nuuanu the navigator nodded well coming this way second or third sidestreet on the right theres a chinese shop sells everything you know old clothes lacquer screens bali heads all sorts of junk im pretty sure i saw a sextant there this trip this afternoon i was poking around got something for the wife the navigator stood in thought its an idea theres not much time to teach him we could write it all down for him of course just what you do and it should be possible to pick up an old sextant in this place he stood in thought pity its got to be this time of year he said at last the sunll be pretty near the zenith when they get down to tahiti that makes it less accurate more difficult anyway i tell you what ill do ill slip down to the ship after dinner and have a talk to jim fairlie see if its worth while trying to stuff something into him keith spent the evening cogitating in his bedroom pencil and paper in hand he had no wish to provision the mary belle with expensive delicacies to which jack donelly would be unaccustomed he knew that if he were to live harmoniously with this man for six weeks in the close association of a very small sailing vessel he must adapt himself to jack donelly and live as he did that didnot trouble keith what troubled him was that he had little idea what jack was in the habit of eating he did not know what cornmeal tasted like or how you ate it and grits were a sealed book to him but they were what jack seemed to eat it was pretty certain that he would like sweet things though he headed his list with sugar ib and added jam he was certain of nothing else and at the end of half an hour he had only six or seven items on the list his mind drifted to the navigation hazards that they all seemed so concerned about he got out the chart that mr sanderson had given him in baling baling that now seemed so far away there were certainly a lot of islands to be passed on their course southwards to tahiti they had names that he had never heard before maiden and starbuck and flint and many others he supposed they would be coral islands similar to that which had destroyed shearwater if john dermott who was an experienced navigator could not sail through this archipelago in safety could jack donelly his hand drifted to his pocket and he sat in perplexity fingering the case hardened grey steel egg that he had made for janice presently he got a scrap of paper and measured the distance between these islands he had a hazy idea that the vertical graduations on the side of the chart gave you some measure of the scale and by that the closest of these islands were two degrees apart but how far was a degree he sat in thought anyway the earth was miles round at the equator he figured with a pencil on the chart if that was right the closest of these islands were over a hundred miles apart about as far as it was from baling to weymouth that didnt seem so bad there was a lot of sea to sail on in between the difficulty might lie as the ships officers said in finding one of them at all it was very different in the tuamotus where shearwater was lost there the islands all seemed to be on top of each other he went to bed before dick king got back from exploring the night life of honolulu and slept fitfully uneasy and worried next morning he was on board the cathay princess by half past eight he found jim fairlie and showed him his inadequate list the first officer took it summoned the third and told him to get out a mess list for two men for eight weeks able seamens scale biscuits instead of bread well compare his list with yours and see how they match up he said theres one thing though if youre going to provision the ship you dont have to pay jack donelly a hundred dollars he took keith up to the chartroom on the bridge behind the wheelhouse ive got one chart keith said diffidently he unfolded the one that mr sanderson had given him oh good youve got seven eight three mr fairlie slipped a chart back in the drawer now you want seven eight two and nine nine two he opened a volume of the pacific islands pilot and showed keith the chart index these two and that one youve got he paused id have liked you to have three o four five as well in case you get set over to the west but i havent got it maybe you could get one in the town yamasuki would tell you where to try now look im going to put these two together and pencil in your track do you know what i mean by compass variation they worked on together well there you are jim fairlie said presently your track is one six six degrees and in theory at any rate you dont hit anything you dont have to sail over any dry land youre in the clear the first part of the passage then you come to all this over to the west christmas island and all that keep away from that they let off atom bombs from time to time then youve got to go between flint island and the carolines theyre about two and a half degrees apart call it a hundred and fifty sea miles if youre on course you probably wont see them after that theres nothing till you hit tahiti they stood examining the charts and the pilot for the best part of an hour keith making notes busily in the middle the air navigator came in greeted them and stood listening in silence they turned to the predominant winds and studied the picture for january you should have a fair wind all the way easterly the first officer laid his finger on the page a bit irregular on the equator in the doldrums but steadying again as you get farther south all easterly i dont know how much leeway that ship makes but just watch out you dont get set over too far to the west jack knows about that i think id keep edging up to windward ten degrees at least youre very unlikely to go much east of track but you might get down a long way west of it they stood in consultation keith scribbling down notes at last he said well thats pretty clear its very kind of you to take all this trouble he smiled the only thing remaining is to know how far ones gone he laid his finger on the line that marked the track from behind them the air navigator remarked youve said it chum jim fairlie said jack donelly would probably say he knows how fast hes going from the look of the water how many miles he does in a day take note of that and jot down what he says for each day he may not be so very far wrong when you tot it up but dont depend on him he paused you could trail a log but then its not your ship he might not take to it probably wouldnt he paused the proper thing for you to do would be to take a noon sight for latitude each day as a matter of fact we were talking about this last night the air navigator said its dead easy mr stewart youd better let us show you how to do it once youve got your latitude upon this course you know how far youve gone and no argument have you ever handled a sextant keith shook his head well youre going to handle one now the first officer was opening a polished wooden box upon the chart table keith was torn between technical interest and practical considerations i havent got a sextant he said and im sure jack hasnt you can probably pick one up secondhand quite cheap the air navigator said as a matter of fact dick kings off looking for one now with captain fielding look mr stewart we dont want to read in the newspaper one day that youre dead this latitude sights easy for a man like you youd better let us put you in the way of it and then go off and buy a sextant they settled down to show him how the sextant worked he was accustomed to precision instruments and had no trouble with it upon the stable deck of the ton ship in harbour in half an hour he was able to bring the sun down on to the horizon and read off its altitude with some accuracy youll find it a bit more difficult on jacks ship because of the motion the first officer said its a matter of practice on a ship like that or any other ship for that matter they took him through the relevant part of the nautical almanac and drew a little diagram for him to show what declination meant youre behind greenwich time they told him when youre taking your noon sight you want to use the declination for ten oclock at night on the same day twentytwo hundred look ill underline it for you each day so you wont go wrong you can take this copy and well get another for the ship the air navigator bent to the task at a quarter to twelve they took him out on to the bridge and made him start taking the altitude of the sun on the horizon over sand island never go back mr fairlie said quietly maximum altitude is what you want when they were satisfied that he had got it they took him back into the chartroom to do the figuring height of eye here is about thirty feet they told him with you take about five feet they underlined the correction for him now away you go he did the sum that seems to come to twentyone degrees twentythree minutes he said diffidently north or south he studied the figures north quite sure i think so okay now put a horizontal pencil line on that latitude on the chart he did so not too bad the air navigator remarked youre about three miles north of where we are up in the suburbs somewhere still its not too bad keith stared at them in wonder and at his pencil line is that all im wrong thats right twentyone twenty is the right answer i told you it was dead easy he was amazed and naively pleased that he had done this thing that he keith stewart looking at the sun through a precision instrument had established the position of honolulu on the surface of the earth he said something of the sort to his instructors youre forgetting about longitude jim fairlie said id like to teach you that but theres not time anyway it needs a watch and a wireless set and tables its not practical im afraid but learn this thoroughly and youll be all right on the way to tahiti anyway that afternoon he went off with dick and the air navigator and bought a secondhand sextant for twentyseven dollars and a depressed looking flock mattress for six fifty back to the ship to show his sextant to mr fairlie who spent an hour trying to get out the index error and reduced it to about three minutes and to have a session with the third officer about provisioning subject to the captains approval he found that the ship could provide practically everything that they would need on board the mary belle in the way of food he mentioned an extra fortygallon drum for water the third said that if he got the drum they could steam it out for him he went and called mr yamasuki who agreed to find a secondhand oil drum and get it to the ship it was sunday evening he was tired by the events of the day but he did not dare to let a day go by without visiting jack donelly lest he should forget about his passenger he gave the sextant to dick king to take back to the hotel and went on shore and found a taxi he picked up his mattress at the chinese shop and drove to the yacht harbour jack donelly was sitting on the bow of his ship fishing over the side with a hand line six or seven small silvery fish lay on the deck beside him in the evening light evening mr donelly keith said i brought my bed can i come on board the owner grunted keith took this as assent and ventured cautiously down the plank the mattress on his shoulder keeping a wary eye on jack donelly as he went but the owner went on fishing keith carried his mattress below and laid it on the vacant berth and then went up on deck and forward to his host what are you using for bait he asked conversationally maggotssaid mr donelly keith sat down on the deck beside him watching the line where did you get them from out the cornmeal sack theres just a few in there dont make any difference keith swallowed spasmodically how long did it take you to get these not long he jerked the line sharply there was a flurry in the water and he pulled another little fish on board they come in here after the muck the boats let go toilets and that he baited the hook with another maggot you staying to supper i cant tonight jack ive got things to do back at the hotel i was thinking id move in tomorrow if thats all right with you cornmeal fritters n fish get a few more n therell be plenty for two id like to but i cant tonight look well want another oil drum for water wont we what for we wouldnt be having baths how much did you use coining from san francisco the owner ruminated i guess i filled it last at sausalito theres still some left id better get a hose n fill it up before we go think youd have used half of it on the passage i mean might have done there was plenty left when i came in therell be two of us this time keith said patiently and the trips a longer one from here down to tahiti ive got another oil drum if you want it you have the owner considered this proposal it might be a good thing to have it along he admitted always use a barrel where would you put it forward by the mast with the other one mr donelly sat in thought have it aft under the ladder if you want it full of water he said at last make her a bit lighter on the helm ill have to make some chocks keith nodded its getting steamed out tomorrow ill get it on board soon as i can say said mr donelly with enthusiasm thats a good idea the one i got had kero in it one time been better maybe if it had been gas he paused kero kinda makes you feel sick in the stomach he explained keith nodded theyre steaming it on board the tanker he remarked they might do the other if we asked them the one youve got now theres another thing jack theyve got out a list of food they think well need for the trip to tahiti basing it upon the seamens scale ive got to see the captain but i think theyll let us have the stuff they say that i can pay for it in england he pulled the list out of his pocket on two sheets of paper thats what they suggest mr donelly took the list and glanced at it uncomprehending you read it out he suggested keith started in to do so mr donelly sat watching him bemused while the words flowed past him presently he stopped keith jam n butter n currants he said kinda rich chow for a ship we havent got all that dough its what they give the seamen on the tanker keith explained they have to by law if you signed on on the cathay princess thats what theyd give you to eat that so thats right i was going to pay for it myself and take it out of the hundred dollars if thats all right by you mr donelly looked at him vacantly what hundred dollars the hundred i was going to give you for the passage i could buy the food for us both from the cathay princess if the captain agrees and take the cost of it out of the hundred dollars you got two pages there mr donelly objected a hundred bucks wouldnt buy that much i think it will and leave a good bit over said keith who had already been roughly through the costs with the third officer huh said mr donelly keith turned to the list again is there anything that you dont like that ive read out he inquired turnips said mr donelly keith wrinkled his brows and turned over the two pages there arent any turnips on the list he said that so i never did like turnips keith nodded ill look out and see that we dont get any he put the list back in his pocket assuming correctly that jack donelly would eat everything else when do you think we ought to sail most any time tomorrow if you like sure costs the earth in this place i dont think well be able to sail tomorrow jack weve got to get this food on board from the cathay princess and the other barrel i tell you what ill probably move in tomorrow and sleep on board if that suits you then maybe we could sail on tuesday suits me said the owner he jerked another little fish on board rebaited the hook with a maggot from a tin and lowered the line again i been thinking he said presently he paused a long time after that alarming statement then he said see that threestick schooner at the end keith followed his glance lying at the end of the seaward jetty there was a fine threemasted schooner yacht she lay almost in the deep water channel because there was no room and no depth of water for her closer in she carried a big crew all dressed in whites her decks were white her polished brass gleamed in the setting sun she wore the flag of the united states and one of the whiteclad seamen was standing by the halliard ready to lower it at the sunset gun even keith was impressed by her i see her he said shes built of wood said mr donelly i guess well go aboard her before sailing n check up on the course he struggled to give voice to what was in his mind ships built of iron he explained they go a different way upon the compass to what ships do if they get built of wood that cathay princess shes built all of iron i guess shed go quite a different way to get to this tahiti than what that schooner would because shes a wooden ship shes a wooden ship and mary belles a wooden ship so theyd go the same way i guess well go aboard before we sail n check up with the captain novice in navigation though he was keith suspected that jack donelly hadnt got his theory of compass deviation quite right still any second check upon their course was good and it might be that from the captain of a sailing ship jack could pick up information about getting through the doldrums which he would not have learned on the seventeenknot tanker thats a good idea he said amiably he left the mary belle shortly after that and went back to bis hotel he found most of the aircrew drinking beer with the officers of the cathay princess and joined them captain davies said mr fairlie tells me that youve turned into a navigator he was very kind keith said he showed me how to get the latitude the captain nodded think youll remember how to do it i think so i made a lot of notes ill have another go at it tomorrow at midday jack donellys in luck i dont suppose he knows it but he might get there now he took a drink of beer mr fairlie show you the victualling list keith took it from his pocket ive got it here he said i was to see you and ask if i could have the stuff you can have it if you sign a pretty detailed letter saying where and when youll pay for it remarked the captain thats very kind of you sir payment in england would be all right would it i think so youd better come on board tomorrow morning and ill draft the letter for you to sign while the third gets the stuff on deck how are you going to take it round to the yacht harbour ill have to get a taxi make yamasuki take it hes got nothing else to do beside them dick king said give you a hand with it if you like ive got nothing else to do either presently they went in to dinner at the table keith said to dick king youre still taking off on tuesday morning the flight engineer nodded seven oclock take off for vancouver youre going back the same way thats right vancouver frobisher blackbushe when will you be back in england thursday midday if the fans keep turning well have been away a week keith said i wonder if youd take a letter back with you and post it in england its just to tell my wife whats happening why sure she should get it friday morning that evening keith went up to his bedroom after dinner and sat for an hour with his sextant and his nautical almanac and his notes he rewrote the notes into a progressive and coherent form while the smbject was still fresh in his mind pausing from time to time to draw little diagrams around the outline of an english penny it was when you came to the equator that you needed a clear head or when the sun went over the zenith still if you followed the rules exactly it would probably come out all right the thing was to practise presently he left the navigation and started a letter to katie he could not make it very detailed because he did not want to worry her the details of his passage to tahiti were not such as would create confidence in consequence his letter consisted mainly of a description of the sight to honolulu and the installation of the rotor in the ship his future plans and movements were dealt with in one sentence at the end in which he said that he had got a passage on a ship going to tahiti and he hoped to be there by the end of february he sealed it up and gave it to dick king to post in england next morning he went with the flight engineer to the ship signed a letter drafted for him by the captain looked in on the generator trials inspected the oil barrel newly steamed out and free from taint and took another noon sight they lunched on board telephoned for a taxi truck loaded the oil barrel and the stores into it and set off for the yacht harbour dick had not seen the mary belle before nor met jack donelly and he was filled with misgiving he knew about sailing boats in theory at any rate and he had little confidence in them they depended solely on the fickle and the vacillating wind if the wind didnt blow in the right direction they couldnt go they were archaic survivals of a bygone age it was true that the wind their motive power was free but what did that matter in an era of government subsidies the right way to get from honolulu to tahiti was in a douglas with horsepower pushing it along it was pennypinching to think of going by the wind because the wind was free it was thinking small and there was no future in that in these modern times you wanted to think big he was deeply concerned when he went on board the mary belle with keith there was not so much as a wheel to steer by nor any seat on deck for the pilot of the craft a sort of stick stuck forward from the top of the rudder which came through the deck and you steered by pushing this stick from side to side so that the ship went the opposite way to what you pushed he knew of this arrangement of course but had thought that it had gone out with the dodo there was of course no engine he was prepared for that but the total absence of all mechanical contrivances shook him badly even the bilge pump was a crude affair square section in its bore built up of wood it was a hot humid day when they arrived the owner was below making the chocks for the new oil drum because he was below and out of sight and because it was hot he was working without any stitch of clothing on his burly frame he had a woodworkers vice arranged upon the side of keiths bunk and the deck of the cabin was a litter of shavings as he formed the floor chocks curved to the radius of the drum using a spokeshave keith went on board with mr king and called to him down the hatch afternoon jack he said ive brought the grub the woodworker looked up get the barrel weve got that with us too huh mr donelly stood in thought better bring the barrel down n see if these chocks fit he said at last its going here he indicated a spot behind the ladder which seemed to have been moved forwards we might need a hand getting it on board said keith its an awkward thing to handle mr donelly laid down the spokeshave and started up the ladder keith checked him what about a pair of trousers jack he said theres ladies about huh mr king said theyll put you in quod if you come out on deck without your trousers on this place makes me sick said mr donelly you see some of the girls on these hooch ships they dont wear practically nothing grumbling he turned and pulled on his soiled trousers and came out on deck they got the drum on board jack lowering it quickly and expertly from the quayside with the two ends of a warp around it and lowered it down through the hatch into the cabin dick king and keith carried all the rest of the stuff on board there was no room to stow anything below till jack was finished with the oil drum so they stacked it all by the tiller there was little more then that they could do till jack had finished except watch him through the hatch which they did for a time he worked on oblivious of their presence both keith and dick king were impressed with the quality of his woodwork he worked accurately and quickly putting a loving finish with a few strokes of glasspaper on each chock before laying it aside presently keith leaned down the hatch and told him that he was going on shore to say goodbye to the ships officers and to the aircrew but would be back later mr donelly only grunted in reply intent upon the job chapter seven keith moved into the mary belle that evening the installation of the new oil drum was finished when he arrived and it was ready to be filled with water in the morning there had been no opportunity to get jacks drum that had once held kerosene steamed out for the cathay princess was due to sail for yokohama in the morning keith was to regret most bitterly that he had not taken action upon that earlier when he drank his first cup of coffee they stowed the tins mostly beneath the bunks the tins of biscuits going in the forecastle and the perishables in the one cupboard the cooking equipment of the mary belle consisted of a frying pan and two battered saucepans there were two chipped enamel plates and an inadequate supply of knives and forks keith found them sufficient for his needs however because jack donelly ate mostly with his fingers they supped off tinned sausages and beans cooked by keith followed by a half loaf of stale bread that he discovered in a locker and a tin of jam as he had suspected jack donelly was a voracious eater he ate everything in sight and then leaned back with a contented sigh you cook good chow he said what you got in that wood box a sextant keith said ive got some charts here too he opened the box took out the sextant carefully and gave it to his captain who handled it gingerly i seen them in shop windows he observed presently marine stores and that you know how to use it not very well keith said they put me in the way of the noon sight on board the tanker huh mr donelly handed the mystery back to him tells you where you are dont it not quite not unless youre better at it than i am but i think it may tell us how far weve gone jack donelly said well i can telljwathat he turned to the soiled wooden bulkhead at his side and showed a long vertical line of pencilscrawled figures thats how far we went each day coming from san francisco keith got up and examined the record with interest how did you know how far you went each day he asked mr donelly said well each day after sunrise id sit down and put my thinking cap on and reckon we were doing five knots yesterday morning say four hours well that makes fifteen knots he paused in thought and then started counting on his fingers rather expertly no that makes twenty he went on then around midday maybe it fell light and then id reckon up that then maybe id heave to in the night catch up a bit on the sleep n reckon on a knot or maybe a knot and a half so then id tot it up for the day n write it down up there keith was deeply interested how did it come out he asked i mean how did it compare with the real distance when you got here i never got it added up mr donelly admitted sometimes id try adding all those figures up but it always came out something different to last time he reached for his atlas and scrutinized the dirty page of the pacific ocean it says here two thousand and ninetyeight he remarked a guy came on board one time said he was from a newspaper he added it up and wrote it underneath beneath the horizontal line written neatly in another hand was the figure that makes it about a hundred and fifty miles too much said keith in wonder less than that about seven per cent you dont go straight all the time said mr donelly you get way off course n then that makes it more keith nodded i think its very good indeed he said he sat in wonder for a moment if you took off a bit say four per cent for course deviations then jack donellys estimate of the distance made good was only three per cent in error and that error was on the safe side how do you know how fast the ship is going through the water he asked my dad taught me he used to know do you look at the waves she leaves behind or something i dunno just how she goes he could not explain himself and keith did not pursue the subject jacks dead reckoning was clearly most important to them jim fairlie had warned him that at that time of year the skies might well be overcast as they got farther south making the noon sight impossible if he could only get an occasional sight as a check on their progress they might well depend more on jacks estimates than on his sights well do this again he said mr donelly ran a dirty finger down the woodwork put another lot of figures right alongside there he said he was seized with doubts think you can add them up right all those tiddy little numbers he asked i can have a try huh there was a pause and then the captain said you bring the little motor along what makes the electricity keith nodded ive got it here he reached into his suitcase and pulled out the box unwrapped the model and set it going with a flick of his thumb he placed it on the floor and jack donelly got down on his hands and knees and gazed at it entranced smallest in the world he breathed he looked up thats right i think so a disturbing thought crossed the captains mind how long does it go on one fill of gas ten or twelve minutes he added ive got a bottle with me a bottle of gas keith nodded we could run it every day i think so he let it run until the miniature tank was dry and it stopped and then put it in its box on the fiddled top of the cupboard well keep it there he washed the dishes a proceeding which his captain obviously considered to be quite unnecessary the cabin was dimly lit by a kerosene lamp in gimbals too dark for reading if there had been anything to read they sat on deck for a while smoking and listening to the radio music from the yachts in the row brought to them by the cool scented breeze get the hose along first thing n fill the barrels said jack donelly then were all set to go keith thought about ships papers and the strange thing called a bill of health and decided that they were matters which concerned the captain of the ship and not himself he asked how much paraffin have we got i mean kero kero theres a jerrycan i guess its still about half full ill get it filled up tomorrow four gallons he thought should take them to tahiti since there was only one primus stove and the cabin lamp i saw a store at the end i wouldnt buy nothing there theyll skin you alive is there any other place i could buy kero i dunno they retired to bed soon after keith found that jacks preparations for the night consisted simply in taking off his pants and lying down upon his dirty mattress with a soiled blanket ready to pull over if he felt cold keith followed his example having made a pillow of some of the clothes from his suitcase and put out the lamp he was tired but for a time he was kept awake by the strangeness of his surroundings the hardness of his bed the wind blowing steadily from the east kept the main halliards tapping rhythmically against the mast the water lapped against the ships side by his ear with little liquid noises from time to time as the ship moved in her moorings the rudder in its pintles made a clunking sound he did not know what any of these noises were except the lapping water but jack donelly was already asleep so they were probably all right this was monday monday night it was only on thurs day morning that he had left his home in baling but how far away it seemed even katie seemed distant and remote and janice in whose interest he was here hardly more than a little wistful dream he tried to reckon sleepily how many thousand miles he was away from his workshop in somerset road and gave up the attempt eight or miles perhaps but he still had the casehardened egg that he had made for janice the grey egg safe in a little box within his suitcase the warm wind blew softly through the cabin scented with frangipani and saltwater presently he slept he woke in the dawn to the sound of jack donelly getting out on deck and the sound of a thin stream of water falling by the ships side and realized that he was out on deck without a stitch of clothing on he got up put on his trousers and put his head out of the hatch are you allowed to do that here he asked mildly morning said his captain isnt nobody around cleaner n doing it in the bucket since there was only one bucket on board to be used for washing and all other purposes keith could not but agree i think ill go ashore he said up the end there by the store how you sleep fine keith put his shoes on and took a little walk returning to the ship he asked what would you like for breakfast cornmeal fritters said mr donelly youll have to show me how to do that keith said he received his lesson over the primus stove jack picking the maggots expertly out of the cornmeal and putting them in a tin for future use as bait he had a dirty tin of fat smelling strongly offish carefully hoarded and poured back after the fry keith added some bacon rashers and a loaf of bread that he had bought at the store to his surprise the cornmeal fritters were very good if you could forget about the maggots and the coffee brewed by jack was excellent but for the kerosene all told he didnt do too badly and sat for a while smoking before washing the two plates he went off after breakfast with the jerrycan for kerosene while jack looked for a hos along the quayside that he could borrow without permission the canjiad only a little kero in the bottom and though it seemed to keith that there must be sufficient in the drinking water to get them to tahiti it was as well to fill the can he did so at the store and bought a few tinned delicacies that took his fancy and walked back heavily laden to find jack with a hose watering the ship i let the forward barrel overflow a little get rid of some of the kero he said she might need pumping out now if youve nothing else to do keith bent to the bilge pump a crude affair with a straight pull upon the plunger awkward to the novice it worked well however and a steady stream of dirty water flowed out on the deck and away by the scuppers gradually becoming clearer jack finished filling the barrels below and put the running hose on the deck in the warm sun turned it off upon the quay and returned it to wherever he had got it from while keith continued his backbreaking work finally the pump sucked and keith rested his aching muscles guess were all set to go said jack you dont know of anything we might want keith shook his head i cant think of anything jack went below and fetched up his atlas which opened at the soiled page of the pacific captain davies he said to steer one five three he said looking at the scrawled pencil figure on the smudged line he said that was the same as south twentyseven east on the compass but the real course was sumpn different he sat in puzzled silence the thinking cap firmly on his head i guess well go on board the threestick schooner he said at last shes a wooden ship same as mary belle keith asked do you think it would be a good thing if i brought the charts along sure said mr donelly affably cant do no harm they set off for the schooner jack donelly clad in pants alone and keith in trousers cricket shirt and braces crowned by the somewhat crumpled panama hat that he wore on holidays in cornwall he seemed pale and fat and undersized in comparison with the magnificent torso of the man beside him and he was very conscious of his physical deficiencies whatever one might think of jack donellys mental ability and keith was now beginning to differ from captain davies there was no denying that he was a fine figure of a man they walked round the head of the yacht basin and down the long tier of vessels to the immaculate schooner yacht at the end as they approached her keiths heart sank she exuded wealth at every glance from the polished bronze cap on the end of her bowsprit to the gilt emblem on the top of her ensign jackstaff at the stern her paintwork her varnished brightwork were spotless and brilliant her halliards were of stainless steel wire rope running to hydraulic winches at the foot of each mast her sheets of gleaming white nylon a wireless aerial ran from the trunk of the mainmast to the mizzen and down to the wheelhouse and deck lounge at the stern from which a television aerial and a directionfinding loop protruded a deckhand in immaculate white overalls lounged by the varnished gangway leading to the deck keith would never have dreamed of setting foot on such a ship himself he decided that negotiations here were his captains responsibility no such qualms beset jack donelly he marched down the gangway to the deck keith following behind the lounging sailor stood erect what can we do for you brother he asked jack said see the captain what do you want with him none o your business just tell the captain i got sumpn to talk to him about you got to say what you want the captains busy jack flared into a quick anger that keith had not seen before he advanced a threatening step towards the man you go tell him the deckhand stepped back hurriedly okay superman okay but he wont see you till hes finished breakfast just wait up on the jetty well wait right here the man hesitated and then went towards the wheel house door he almost collided with a woman who came flying out on deck whos that she asked him urgently coupla guys want to see the captain lady he replied they wont say what they want she hesitated and then brushed past him and walked quickly to jack and keith by the gangway you havent come from manuel she asked she had bright auburn hair almost red in the honolulu sunlight that probably owed something to art keith judged she might have been about thirty years of age jack looked at keith blankly the situation was beyond him keith said weve come to see the captain oh she was plainly disappointed i was expecting somebody else we just want to see the captain she looked them up and down want a job she said to jack youre a sailor by the look of you he might have one for you i dont suppose hed have one for your friend we dont want no job jack donelly replied just want to see the captain ask him about the course down to the islands she stood in silence her lips drooping keith had a queer feeling that at any moment she was likely to start crying youre nothing to do with manuel she asked dully jack looked blank and keith shook his head weve never met him i dont think he told her who is he at the royal waikiki hotel with his orchestra she said music with manuel every thursday evening on cbs you must have seen it everyone knows manuel jack donelly said we just want to see the captain she turned away from them and walked slowly to the deckhouse door and vanished inside they stood in the sun at the end of the gangway waiting jack smiled thoughtfully like to see her with no clothes on he remarked shed peel off nice keith laughed youre not likely to get the chance the deckhand reappeared captain hes at breakfast he told them he said to tell you to wait or else come back again in half an hour guess well wait said jack patiently they waited for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes then the captain came out of the deckhouse door and walked towards them a tall bronzed efficientlooking man in naval whites and a whitetopped naval cap you want to see me about something he asked im captain petersen jack said awkwardly i was wondering if we could check a course with you down to the islands im jack donelly and this is mr keats sailing with me sure said the captain there was a piece about you in the paper you came from san francisco single handed didnt you piece about me in the paper asked jack vaguely in the postjournal nearly a column about you and your ship one day last week didnt you see it jack shook his head ill get the steward to look through the papers in the cookhouse maybe weve got it still thats your ship up at the end the white sloop thats right where are you bound for now captain going south to this place tahiti jack donelly said mr keatss got business to do there quite a way said the captain but you should find a fair reaching wind this season of the year it might fall light and variable when you get down about five north then after the equator it might steady up again still from the east you havent got a motor jack shook his head oh well i think youll be all right you may get a few days slamming about in the doldrums come into the charthouse and well have a look at the course they went with him towards the deckhouse door keith asked have you got a motor sir oh sure weve got a big main diesel and a smaller one for starting and battery charging the engine room is quite a show place in this ship how many hands you carry asked jack nine deckhands said the captain two engineers one cook two stewards boatswain mate and me seventeen all told they entered the wheelhouse and stood by the chart table the captain pressed a bellpush and a buzzer sounded below a steward appeared sam said the captain chase around the ship and see if you can find a copy of the postjournal about the middle of last week wednesday or thursday with the column in it about captain donelly and the mary belle if you find it bring it here and hold it he turned to jack and keith cup of coffee right three cups sam they turned to a consideration of the course keith was surprised and pleased by the consideration that the american captain of this very fine yacht gave to jack donellys problems a dumb fisherman from oregon was clearly no novelty to him moreover he had probably been briefed by local gossip in the yacht harbour he examined jacks smudged atlas page with interest and with care and turned to keiths charts with tact ran out the course for them and curiously enough arrived at exactly the same magnetic course as captain davies had in the cathay princess guess i neednt have troubled you said jack at last i thought maybe it would be something different the tanker being an iron ship the captain shook his head thats compass deviation you dont want to stow anything made of iron near your binnacle an anchor or anything like that take it up forward they went on to discuss the probable winds two men of the same country talking the language of sail they went on talking for half an hour sipping the cups of coffee smoking as they stood over the charts keith showed his newspaper cutting about the loss of shearwater and the death of jo and told this pleasant man the purpose of his journey the redheaded woman came up from below dressed for the shore and passed them by walked with quick steps up the gangway got into a car upon the quayand drove off you wont have any trouble captain petersen said at last a good reaching wind most of the way unless youre very unlucky you should make better than a hundred miles a day average add a week in the doldrums id say youll be in papeete in thirty days he paused and then said wish i was coming with you keith asked have you been here long too long the captain said nearly four weeks we came here from la bound for tokio and then manila with the owner his daughter and some friends four months cruise it was to be but soon as we got here he was talking on the telephone to new york and then to cincinnati where the plant is and he left and flew back east hell be back again some time but lord knows when in the meantime theres just the daughter living here on board and shes doing no good thats the lady who went on shore just now keith asked she came and spoke to us while we were waiting the captain nodded mrs efstathios he said at least i always call her mrs efstathios i dont think the decrees gone through yet jack said she was asking sumpn about a guy called manuel seemed to think we ought to know about him the captain nodded manuel de silva he said reflectively music with manuel he was born mike simmons but that was in puerto rico so i suppose he felt hed got a right to a spanish name looks like hes going to be number four if we stop here much longer he stood in thought for a moment gee he said i wish that i could jump this ship and come down to the islands with you boys they thanked this competent man and said goodbye and went on shore and started to walk back towards the mary belle fine ship said jack donelly she was beautiful keith said ive never been on board a ship like that before do you know her name flying cloud registered in seattle he walked a few steps in thought she costs somebody plenty they walked back to the mary belle and went on board in the cabin jack tucked the school atlas away under the mattress of his bunk and keith wedged the roll of charts behind the locker jack looked around the cabin you think of anything we need we havent got he asked keith thought and shook his head weve got food water and kero he said i dont know about the ship jack grunted you ever been in a sailing craft like this before keith shook his head just keep out of my way n dont do nothing less i tell you he busied himself for the next half hour about the deck while keith stood on the ladder in the hatch and watched he set the jib in stops made halliard and sheets ready set up the main boom and removed the crutch made fast the main sheet and removed all but two tieers from the sail the wind was blowing from the east down the fairway of the yacht harbour towards the entrance he took in the leeside bow and stern warps and led the doubled end of the bow warp from the weather bow pile to the stern then everything happened in a rush so quickly that keith had difficulty in appreciating what was going on jack cast off the weather stern warp and then he was everywhere at once a big nimble man stripped to the waist hauling on ropes and casting them off the mary belle moved forward smoothly from her berth into the fairway turned as the jib broke out and then she was sailing quietly down the middle of the rows of yachts towards the entrance trailing a long rope in the water from her bow jack at the helm just gather that rope n put it on the deck beside the mast he said keith did his best with this and got it all on deck they turned by the flying cloud and headed out to sea under jib alone the wind a little aft of the beam as they passed the schooner yacht captain petersen came out and waved to them from the deckhouse door they carried on southwards down the channel till jack judged that they were well outside the reef then he told keith to get down below out of the way he loosened the main sheet cast off the tieers from the main put the ship up to the wind and ran forward to hoist both peak and main halliards the big tanned sail slammed and banged about as keith crouched down below it in the hatch and jack worked like a demon at the mast then suddenly it was over and they were sailing quietly again jack at the helm the big sail billowing above thejn they were sailing much faster now a little heeled to starboard making about five knots keith sat in the cabin hatch enjoying the smoothness of the motion in the lee of the land as he looked around he saw a white launch come out of the harbour behind them presently he noticed it was closing up upon them fast making about twenty knots a white plume under the raised bow that grew and spluttered as she slammed each wave he said theres a boat coming out behind us jack turned and looked at it always sumpn he grumbled the launch ranged up alongside them and slowed to their speed a uniformed man in the stern spoke through a megaphone say captain he said you better heave to grumbling beneath his breath jack donelly pulled the foresheet up to weather slacked the main and put the helm down the mary belle came up into the wind and lay quietly with little forward way the launch ranged up beside her on the lee quarter only a few feet away the uniformed man appeared by the coxswain where are you bound for he shouted jack donelly answered hilo youre not going any farther just to hilo youve got to get clearance if you go outside the group dont need no clearance for hilo no the officer admitted all you need is just pay fourteen dollars and fifty cents what we got to pay that for harbour dues captain jeez i wasnt in the harbour more n a week nine days the officer said your size makes one fifty each day plus tax makes fourteen dollars fifty i dunno as ive got it then youll come right back and tell the judge about it come on captain i got things to do grumbling jack left the helm and went below and from some secret store unearthed the money the officer reached out a little fishing net on a bamboo for it and passed back the receipt in the same way the launch sheered off put on speed turned around and made off back towards the harbour keith asked timidly wheres hilo on hawaii they make all lands of trouble if you say youre going foreign he let draw the jib and the main and got the vessel on her course again you sick yet he asked not yet said keith come n take the helm a while and ill show you keith came to the tiller held by a turn of light rope round it from a cleat upon the bulwark the rope held in the hand he sat down on the deck as he had seen jack sit keep looking at the card he said he laid a dirty finger on the glass of the binnacle that black line thats the lubber line n that goes with the ship the card with all them black marks on it that moves against the lubber line the way you pull the tiller you see the big thin diamond well not that one but the one next to it the tiddylittle triangle not the big triangle the tiddy little un keep her about there keith put on his glasses to inspect the binnacle and picked out the tiny numerals remembered from his navigational instruction and so identified the tiddy little triangle he settled down to try and steer the ship and became engrossed in it jack watched him for a time and then went down and lit die primus stove he made a jug of coffee while keith steered and the island of oahu grew less distinct behind them and presently passed up on deck a cup of coffee a great hunk of corned beef out of a tin and two inch thick slices of bread you okay he asked so farsaid keith jack donelly grunted guess ill have a bit of a lie down he said keith was alarmed what will i do if anything happens he asked aw nothings going to happen said the captain he sat by the galley at the foot of the ladder contentedly eating bread and beef then without ever looking out on deck he went forward and lay down upon the lee berth which was keiths and went to sleep keith sat at the helm terrified he had never sailed a ship of any sort before now he was in sole control of this rushing heaving monster which towered above him in a mass of brown sails and rope whose very function was a mystery to him he had mastered only one small element of the seamans craft that of keeping the appropriate compass mark upon the lubber line and thai only within the last half hour he did not know what disaster would ensue if he should let it stray either way the wind seemed to be increasing and the sea rising as they cleared the land and the ship was heeling noticeably more he was scared stiff he sat there in his cricket shirt and braces with panama hat upon his head under the brilliant sun of the hawaiian islands the bread and the corned beef un tasted on the deck beside him concentrating on doing the one thing that he had been taught keeping the tiddy little triangle upon the lubber line presently his cup of coffee now quite cold left him and slid down into the lee scuppers still upright an hour later he was still sitting in the same position the ship still rushing along in much the same way under the steady beam trade wind he was hungry and thirsty and very sore from sitting motionless on the hard deck he was less frightened now and his arms were getting tired he began to experiment with the rope lanyard which assisted him to hold the tiller if he took another turn around the tiller it eased the grip of his hands he still had to steer but if he tied it the ship would probably go straight enough for ten or fifteen seconds while he retrieved the cup of coffee from the scuppers he made a couple of trials and then greatly daring lashed the helm and slithered down the deck upon his bottom to retrieve the cold cup by the middle of the afternoon he was taking things more easily he ate his lunch about three oclock and sat on at the helm growing steadily more sunburnt and tired below he could see jack sleeping peacefully upon the lee berth tired as he was he realized that this made sense since for the next month they would have to sail all night he could not sail the ship at night jack would have to do that or they must heave to as they had done when the harbourmasters launch had overtaken them he must stick it out and call jack at sunset which seemed to come at about six oclock when the sun was about an hour above the horizon he couldnt stand it any longer and called jack the big man stood up in the cabin yawned and came on deck you done a good spell he said everything okay i think so said keith i havent touched anything jack donelly took the tiller i got her now get down and rustle up some chow ill heave her to n pull a reef down case it gets up in the night keith got up stiffly and went down below regardless of what was going on on deck he lit the stove to make some coffee and got out a tin of pork and beans to heat up for their supper he had got as far as getting out the bread when he suddenly felt dizzy and faint the fumes of the stove were nauseating the motion of the ship intolerable he struggled on for a little unable to focus his eyes on anything then he was overcome and dashed up on deck to be sick over the lee rail he moved back to the hatch when it was over jack was tying down the reef points at the boom and paused in his work gets you down below he said affably stay out on deck a while ill get the chow i can manage youll get sick again stay where you are keith obeyed him and sat on the deck by the hatch gradually recovering jack finished his chores on deck and went below presently he handed up a dirty plate with a great mess of steaming pork and beans on it a huge hunk of bread and a cup of coffee i dont want anything said keith faintly go onneat it ill be sick again sure youll be sick again go on n eat it keith took the path of least resistance and ate most of it and felt the better for it for the moment jack took the dirty plates and cups wiped them with a filthy rag and put them back ready for use again he took the bucket with the lanyard on the handle and sluiced it over the side left a little seawater in it and placed it on the deck below beside the head of the lee berth he lit the cabin lamp and turned it low then came on deck and took the tiller let draw the sheets and got the vessel on her course it was now nearly dark get on down n get some sleep he said dont go standing up lie down right away you got nothing else to do till daylight you cant sail her all night aw if i get sleepy ill heave to keith took off his shoes went down below and stretched out on the berth somewhat to his own surprise he fell asleep at once he slept for five or six hours woke up feeling sick and got out on deck to vomit over the rail jack was sitting smoking at the helm and the ship going smoothly over the long ocean swell just take her while i get some chow he said keith took the helm in the bright moonlight and struggled to keep the vessel on her course in the faint light of the oillit binnacle presently jack passed him up a mug of coffee and a great hunk of bread spread with jam and sat below himself finishing up the tin of cold pork and beans then he came on deck again guess ill take her now so the night passed for keith in alternate vomiting and sleep he took the helm again at dawn while jack donelly slept in general he was well enough on deck while he concentrated on the sailing of the ship and he was ill directly he went below they sailed on all the day under a blue sky flecked with cloud once in the afternoon when keith was lying dozing and exhausted on the lee bunk he opened his eyes to see jack donelly wedged upon the other bunk and realized that there was no one at the helm to his inquiry jack said she goes by herself okay with the wind forward of the beam wont be no harm if we get up a tiddy bit to weather he pointed at the bulkhead at his feet i reckon we made ninetyfive miles yesterday up till dawn today see where i wrote it down later that afternoon when keith was at the helm and jack below beginning the preparations for supper he happened to glance up through the hatch immediately he stopped what he was doing and came out on deck and stood looking at the sky keith asked him what he was looking at frigate bird said jack thats the third ive seen keith followed his arm pointing and saw the bird very high flying or gliding on a straight course thats a gull isnt it he asked frigate bird said jack much bigger n a gull see his forked tail hes going home some place how do you know that that sort dont spend nights at sea they go way out but they go back to land each night hell be down by sunset he glanced at the sun hour n a quarter hour n a half theres land that way forty fifty miles thats the third i see all going the same way he laid a horny dirty hand vertically across the binnacle looking up at the flight of the bird and down at his hand just a tiddy bit south of east he said get them charts of yours n see what land that is keith went below and got the chart and brought it up on deck quickly before he was sick he put the pacific islands pilot down on it with the edge pointing a little to the south of magnetic east must be hawaii he said if were on course that should be about sixty miles away jack thought about it watching the bird now disappearing to the east i dunno as hed fly so fast as that he said reckon were up to windward just a tiddy bit chapter eight the dcb flown by captain fielding landed back at blackbushe about midday on thursday just a week after leaving for honolulu they could have flown to speke from frobisher which would have been more convenient for mr adams but the landing fees for the aircraft at speke far exceeded mr adams fare by rail from london to manchester so they took him to blackbushe with them they landed back into the cold foggy drizzle of a january day in england after the languorous sun and warm trade winds of honolulu the change was little to their liking halfinch thick underwear fires in the living room and hot buttered crumpets for tea said the navigator thoughtfully well i dunno i suppose theres something to be said for it the crew were tired and ready for a rest they had flown the best part of their maximum permitted allowance of flying for a month in one week finishing up with thirtysix hours on end for most of them there was employment or instruction on the ground in the installations of blackbushe until they were rostered for another flight but all were entitled to three days of rest dick king would start again upon the overhaul of engines in the shops on monday morning but having turned in his log books and written his report he was free to go home he telephoned to his wife ethel to bring the car to blackbushe to fetch him he lived at egham in a house off stroude road convenient both for blackbushe and for london airport in case he wanted to change his job and convenient for ethel for shopping in staines he had brought back little gifts from honolulu for his wife a lei of frangipani blossoms in a polythene bag and a bracelet of coloured tropical nuts unusualin egham i havent got anything particular for tea she said as he got into the car anything you fancy he shivered a little in the unaccustomed raw chilliness of the early dusk sausages he said pork sausages and fried potatoes he thought of the navigator and crumpets lets have lots and lots of crumpets got the fire lighted she looked surprised i didnt light it yet its not very cold are you cold a bit well light it when we get in halfway home he thought of keith stewarts letter in his pocket and they stopped and posted it and bought sausages and crumpets when they got home he gave her his presents and she exclaimed with pleasure at the bracelet and the lei which was satisfactory to him while he was lighting the fire and putting the car away she picked the lei to pieces and put the sowers in water in an endeavour to make them last a little while in january england and then she started to cook the potatoes and the sausages and crumpets i never asked if you had a good trip she said pretty fair he replied he paused and then he said you remember me telling you about keith stewart of the miniature mechanic who was coming with us she nodded i remember did you bring him back no he got off in honolulu tell you all about it after tea he did so as they washed the dishes in the kitchen and as he recapitulated to her what had happened in honolulu the unease grew on him again it was absurd of course and that he realized because keith was his own master and if he chose to go to sea with a man like jack donelly in a ship like the mary belle well that was that moreover it was all of ioooo miles away and no concern of his yet he was still worried something of his unease communicated itself to her as they sat before the fire we got him fixed up with a sextant and the ships officers showed him how to use it to take a latitude sight he said i hope to god its going to work out all right doesnt the captain have to do that she asked puzzled this one couldnt he was just a sort of fisherman american he added in ultimate disparagement doesnt the captain of a ship have to pass exams like in an aeroplane i dont know he replied maybe if the ship is small enough you dont i shouldnt have thought that this chap could read or write he thought for a moment he was a good woodworker however small the aeroplane youve got to have a licence and pass exams before you can fly it anywhere havent you she asked thats so it may be different with ships this chap couldnt navigate at all he got to honolulu from san francisco by following the aeroplanes she was puzzled but they fly to all sorts of places dont they how would he know that any aeroplane he saw was going to honolulu its the only place they can go to he said they all put down at honolulu to refuel you get out in the pacific west of san francisco and you see one flying to the west its going to honolulu he sat in brooding silence presently she asked him kindly whats the trouble dick are you afraid that they wont get to this place hes going to whats the name tahiti he said thats about the strength of it its the hell of a long way more than miles of open sea nearly as far as from here to new york and at the end of it to find one tiny little island in among a lot of coral reefs you could get wrecked on like his sister was to think of starting off upon a trip like that in a sailing ship without an engine with a skipper who cant navigate theres nothing you can do about it she said at last no he turned to her i was with him all the time in honolulu we shared a room in the hotel ive never shared a room with someone who was somebody before i mean well known tou know she nodded hed never been outside england before he said uncomfortably for so famous a man he didnt know a thing really never seen a shower before or foreign money he didnt even know how to sleep properly in hot weather was he nice she asked curiously just like you or me he told her we got on fine he sat in an uncomfortable silence i ought to have stopped him going on that ship he said at last i didnt quite know how she comforted him itll probably turn out all right she said you see i hope it does he spent a restless night much to her discomfort weighed down by a sense of imminent disaster he did not know what to do but he knew that if keith were to lose his life he would be associated with the tragedy in some small measure towards morning it occurred to him that anyway he should not keep his grim forebodings to himself two heads or several heads were better than one if he shared his apprehensions with other people someone might pull some rabbit out of an unthought of hat might make some suggestion that would somehow make keiths journey to tahiti safer but who to talk to he talked to everyone that he could think of over the weekend and he talked to all and sundry at blackbushe when he started work again on monday but no rabbit was extracted from any hat on the wednesday when he had been back in england for nearly a week he took a batch of exhaust manifolds for repair to a firm in croydon travelling with them to suggest a welding modification that would prevent certain cracks from starting he rode with the driver in the truck arriving in the middle of the morning he did his business in the welding shop and had lunch in the firms canteen by the time he had disposed of his lunch and his work it was getting on for three oclock there was little sense in going back with the truck to blackbushe for at most an hour of work before knockingoff time and keith stewart was still uneasily in his mind he rode with the truck driver to croydon station and took a train to victoria an hour later he was walking into the editorial offices of the miniature mechanic in victoria street it was not a large office and it was not modern or well furnished in the outer office there was a girl and a young man and two vacant desks littered with bits of miniature machinery photographs and pulls from blocks he asked the girl if he could see the editor who shall i say she asked mr king he said a little awkwardly mr king of albatross airways he wont know me tell him its about keith stewart she went into the inner office and came out followed by the editor he went up to the engineer mr king he said with outstretched hand my name is mcneil youve come about keith stewart thats right i thought you might like to know how hes getting on come into the office like a cup of tea he turned to the girl make us two cups daphne they went into the office and the editor gave him a chair dick king said im the flight engineer of the crew mr stewart went to honolulu with we left him there when we flew back last tuesday i thought you might like to know how he was getting on i certainly would he told me hed got a flight with you to honolulu and he wanted to get down to tahiti he had to go there to see about his sisters death thats right did he manage to get a passage on to tahiti he wasnt quite sure about that when he left dick king said he did get a passage of a sort thats what i wanted to tell you about really and truly he was going on a sort of fishing boat she hadnt got an engine even just the sails mr mcneil opened his eyes that doesnt sound like keith couldnt he get anything better apparently not we were all a bit worried about it but he made up his mind so there wasnt anything that we could do its a very long way isnt it about miles he hesitated sea miles that would be knots close on land miles i suppose and hes gone on that in a fishing boat sailing thats right the tea came when the girl was out of the room the editor said tell me just what happened mr king the engineer considered how to tell his story well he said it was like this there was this crew of the cathay princess the officers i mean the ship we took the generator rotor to launched on his story he had little difficulty in going on in his own way and the editor had little difficulty in getting the essentials of the tale the chap was kind of simple said the engineer describing jack donelly he built the boat himself and made a good job of her hes a woodworker by trade or else a fisherman he could be a bit of both but i dont think he can read or write and he certainly cant navigate mr mcneil was puzzled if he cant navigate hows he going to find tahiti thats the trouble said the engineer captain davies hes the captain of the tanker we took the generator rotor to he said they wouldnt get there at all the first officer he said he thought theyd get there in the end but theyd take the hell of a long time he paused it was all a bit of a mess up if you get me he said unhappily but he went off on this ship did he i suppose he did said the flight engineer we took off at dawn last tuesday and they were going to sail the same day i dont know for sure that they went but i suppose they did how long was the voyage to take mr fairlie said six weeks youd make it in ten hours in a dc but thats the time he said it would take he paused he did teach mr stewart how to take a latitude sight and we got him a sextant and captain davies he fixed them up with food and that the editor pursed his lips it sounded absolutely crazy and it probably was he had private troubles of his own that concerned keith stewart it was barely a fortnight since he left england but already his absence had been felt very much by the staff of the miniature mechanic every other day a batch of letters arrived from katie that keith normally would have answered and which now had to be answered by the editor himself they were letters from all over the world jim mcneil had not fully realized till he had the job of answering these letters from edmonton and bulawayo from gateshead and hong kong how widely keiths influence had spread in what high regard he was held by modellers all over the world he was uneasily conscious that keiths salary was perhaps too small after all it was only one third of his own yet which of them did more for the circulation of the magazine the overseas subscriptions were increasing every day the air fare from honolulu to tahiti might not be more than the book could stand a hundred or a hundred and fifty pounds keith had been on the staff now for twelve years it might be reasonable to stand him that he asked the engineer how could we find out if hes actually left dick king rubbed his chin well i dont know i think he probably did sail the day we left id like to know for certain the editor paused if id known that he was in this difficulty wed have given him some help i think id have to put it to the board of course but i think wed have helped him with the air fare rather than see him get into a mess like this you cant fly direct said the engineer youve got to go by samoa have your firm got an agent in honolulu that i could cable to not that i know of replied mr king theres mr yamasuki he was agent for the ship the cathay princess any good the engineer thought for a minute i dont think hed do much for a stranger unless there was money in it for him he said at last he didnt seem to want to be mixed up in it at all it might be worth a try ill think it over for an hour or two said the editor i might think of something better he took mr yamasukis name talked to the engineer for a few minutes longer and thanked him for coming in finally dick left the office to catch a train to staines and so to egham back in his office after seeing the engineer off the premises mr mcneil sat deep in thought smoking pipe after pipe something would have to be done about keith stewart he should have realized that earlier he should have realized when keith first proposed his most improbable journey that his value to the magazine was such that he must be assisted to complete it quickly and get back to work again true he had made a halfhearted offer of an advance payment if keith should be in any difficulty it now seemed to him that in view of his very small salary that offer had been quite inadequate he should have offered him assistance with the airline fare to tahiti and return especially the return because he wanted keith back at work it would have been quite a shock to his board but he could have pushed it through indeed he would have to push it through now whether the board liked it or not the effect of his pennypinching was that his best contributor the man who attracted correspondence to the magazine from all over the world had had to go off on a crazy trip in the pacific on a fishing boat sailed by a skipper who didnt know how to navigate if keith stewart were to lose his life the effect upon the magazine would be disastrous he sat in brooding silence no good crying over spilt milk now constructive action was required the first thing was to find out whether keith was still in honolulu or whether he had in fact left upon this fishing boat whom did he know or correspond with in honolulu he searched his mind there was nobody he could think of there must be modellers in honolulu probably the mail department of the printers could produce half a dozen subscribers to the miniature mechanic in honolulu if you included the armed forces but he knew none of them well then americans americans who might have contacts there professor oleary leaped to his mind professor oleary was professor of mediaeval literature at ann arbor university in michigan just outside detroit perhaps as a reaction from the mediaeval literature he made models they had published an article by him once was it in on the construction of his finchgauge locomotive model of one of the old woodburning engines of the northern pacific railroad of two years ago he had visited england and mr mcneil had lunched with him and with keith stewart he was then completing a model of a case traction engine acknowledging a considerable debt to mr stewart for his articles upon the burrell he had shown them photographs of a very well equipped workshop in the basement of his home in ann arbor with the oilfired airconditioning plant in the background which had interested them as much as the model mr mcneil and keith had kept in touch with this pleasant reader who was now engaged on the construction of keiths congreve clock a congreve clock is an antique clock mechanism in which a steel ball rolls upon a zigzag path down an inclined plane and takes half a minute to do so when the incline of the plane reverses and the ball rolls back again professor oleary was the man he had been in honolulu lecturing probably more than once he must have numerous contacts on the academic staff indeed with his engineering hobby he might well know other modellers in honolulu or members of the faculty of engineering at the university to whom the name keith stewart would be known in the professor the editor felt he had a sympathetic contact in the united states who would exert himself to the utmost to find out what had happened to keith stewart in honolulu his staff were all departing or had gone by the time he reached that conclusion he reached for the telephone and rang up his wife in finchley to tell her that he would be a bit late and went out into the deserted outer office he sat down at his secretarys typewriter put an airletter form and carbon into the machine and began to type he wrote dear professor you will remember lunching with keith stewart and myself when you were last in london when you showed us the photographs of your case traction engine and your workshop i am a bit concerned about keith stewart who was recently in honolulu and i have wondered if you have a friend there who could assist me in an inquiry the circumstances are as follows he wrote on putting the case clearly and concisely explaining about keiths sister about his financial inability to pay for his extensive journey about his free flight to honolulu about jack donelly and the mary belle he ended with a few words of apology i feel we are to blame in some degree in not assisting him with the expense of this journey in view of his long service with the magazine but you will appreciate that we do not make great profits we did not think that he would become involved in such difficulties and we would assist him now if we could get in touch with him do you know anyone in honolulu who could cable us at my expense to tell us what the position is or who could get in touch with him if he is still there and ask him to cable us yours sincerely james mcneil he folded the air letter and sealed it he glanced at his watch there was still time to catch the airmail to new york if he took it to the charing cross post office he put on his hat and coat turned out the lights and locked the door and went out into the chilly january night to catch a bus to charing cross cyrus shawn oleary got that letter on the friday morning at his home in ann arbor near detroit he had no formal lecture on that day though he had essays to correct on monday he was lecturing upon the debt owed by the elizabethan lyricwriters to the early english mediaeval poets and on that morning he was engaged in tracing a comparison between piers plowman and the work of john donne he had strayed a little from his line to consider thomas campion the graceful reprobate and the mail lay unnoticed at his elbow and he smiled as he read for he was still young at heart care not for these ladies that must be woode and praide give me kind amarillis the wanton country maide nature art disdaineth her beauty is her owne her when we court and kisse she cries forsooth let go but when we come where comfort is she never will say no perhaps there was enough of that in ann arbor he had better not stress it to the sophomores better to stick to the religious angle to the soulsearchings that had followed the reformation he laid campion aside and turned back to john donne outside the snow lay deep the cars passing in the street made a whisper and a rustle it was overcast outside with heavy lowering clouds presaging more snow spring with flowerdecked meadows was the time for thomas campion winter was the time for john donne and for the workshop he resolutely turned his mind away from his hobby john donne was his business and he turned to him again endeavouring to regain the train of thought from which he had been sidetracked he read the passage again which seemed to him to reflect the plowman thou hast made me and shall thy work decay repair me now for now mine end doth haste i run to death and death meets me as fast and all my pleasures are like yesterday that echoed something surely on your midnight pallet lying listen and undo the door lads that waste the light in sighing in the dark should sigh no more night should ease a lovers sorrow therefore since i go tomorrow pity me before no that was housman much much later his mind was wandering today he could not concentrate pallets he was worried about the method of machining the pallets of his clock but then that was a different sort of pallet he did not see how he could hold them in the fourjaw chuck to bore and ream the axis hole and keith stewart had not explained that in the serial he must be being stupid there must be some simple way to do that job which every modeller would know perhaps if he went down to the basement and had another look no he never went down to the workshop in the morning get thee behind me satan he must work if the work would not flow at least there was the mail to go through and the essays to correct he picked up the pile of letters and furtively looked through to see if the new issue of the miniature mechanic had arrived it hadnt but there were two heavylooking archaeological journals three local letters one air letter from his married daughter in colorado springs and an air letter from london england he opened the one from his daughter first and skimmed it through it was all about the baby and not much else his wife would be interested he put it down and picked up the one from london the back snowed it to be from j mcneil the name rang a faint bell but he could not place it he opened it and sat riveted in his chair as he read this was really serious very serious indeed he read the letter again and then sat deep in thought piers plowman and john donne and the remainder of his correspondence unnoticed on the desk before him the direct appeal stirred him deeply he was an engineer at heart if things had broken differently for him he might have been one he had money that was the trouble his grandfather shawn oleary had been a railway contractor in the palmy days of expansion in reaction his father had become a minister in boston massachusetts cyrus had been directed to the academic life and he had not resisted a year at oxford had followed four at harvard research had come after that and academic appointments he did not regret his life but the urge to make things had been strong in him all the time inherited perhaps from his grandfather who had made the iron roads towards the west his workshop meant a great deal to cyrus oleary he enjoyed his literary work but the high spot of his visit to europe two years previously had been the lunch with keith stewart and his editor he had subscribed to the miniature mechanic for nine years and in that time he had come to have a deep regard for the design engineer whose lucid modest and well written articles had taught him so much they did not seem to breed that sort of writer in the united states and he had wondered why his country with so much engineering achievement did not throw up people of that sort when he had met keith stewart he understood a little better he had thought from the pleasure that the engineer had given to so many modellers that he would be in the twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year income bracket when he had met him his regard for keith was if anything increased but he now realized that his income was three to four thousand or even less few people of such ability in his own country would be content with so modest an income and perhaps no engineers the devotion to an art inherent in keith stewarts circumstances flowered more prolifically in europe he sat wondering how to deal with this appeal how best he could help he did know honolulu he had lectured there three times but the people that he knew there were all literary people mr mcneil had been in error when he had assumed that professor oleary might know members of the engineering faculty in honolulu university it was the professors habit to conceal his workshop hobby from his colleagues even in ann arbor he did not display his locomotive or his traction engine to his fellow professors fearing that if he did so he would not be taken seriously when he spoke on mediaeval poetry he would not have dreamed of talking about engineering matters when visiting another university in consequence the only associates that he had in honolulu were serious and somewhat unpractical students of mediaeval history he did not know one person there to whom he could turn for an account of the movements of a fishing boat in the harbour he left his study and went down to the basement of his house to the workshop he had a special bookshelf down there for the copies of the miniature mechanic not caring to display them in his study the row of little magazines was now seven feet long extending every week presently he would have to put up another shelf he had abstracted from the series the issues of the magazine dealing with the construction of the congreve clock and these lay in a little pile upon the drawing bench he turned them over thoughtfully it was incredible that a man who could write stuff like that should be so short of money he turned to the bench deep in thought and fingered the tilting platform of the clock already assembled in a trial erection in its trunnions he had made that first thinking it to be the most difficult part in fact it had proved to be the easiest who could he turn to for help in this affair who else in the united states was an admirer of keith stewart who else was making a congreve clock to his instructions there was that dairy farmer down in maryland he wouldnt be much help there was dave coulson in indianapolis he was an accountant there was the chap that he had met at the brotherhood of live steamers in detroit the stockbrokers clerk in toledo then wait a minute out on the west coast lumber and pulp mills what was his name hirzhorn solly hirzhorn solly hirzhorn had attended a meeting of the brotherhood last year and nobody had realized who he was till after the meeting a week later solly hirzhorn was building a congreve clock and he had all the money in the world and all the contacts too he picked up the tiny pallet that he could not think of how to hold for machining and stood fingering it absently he should have bored and reamed it first before shaping it to that rather complicated form perhaps if he put it in a tin and melted lead all round it he could hold the lead but then how would you line it up there must be a simpler way than that he wondered if solly hirzhorn had been caught that way or whether he hadnt got as far as making the pallets as he stood there at the bench of his workshop it seemed to him that solly hirzhorn was the one person to whom he could turn he did not know the lumber tycoon well he had been introduced to him at the meeting of the model engineering society the brotherhood of live steamers and they had talked enthusiastically together about the congreve clock for nearly a quarter of an hour both had then been starting on the project and had been drawn to each other by their common interest the fat unwieldy magnate sixtyeight years old and the lean professor of fiftytwo in that quarter of an hour they had become friends though it was only when they came to exchange addresses at the end of it that each learned who the other was that was a year ago they had exchanged cards at christmas but they had not met again nor were they very likely to do so he glanced at his watch half past eleven that would be half past eight in tacoma not a very good time to call a tycoon upon a personal matter when he would just have arrived in his office perhaps he went up to his study again closed the door lifted the telephone and spoke to the longdistance operator i want to call mr solomon p hirzhorn person to person he said this is professor oleary i dont know the number but its in tacoma washington its hirzhorn lumber enterprises inc or something its the mr solomon hirzhorn is it she asked thats right if you get through to his secretary tell her its about a clock ill take the call at any time convenient to him he hung up five minutes later the operator called again with news from miles away mr hirzhorn is dealing with his mail right how she said and after that he has to fly to a conference at one of the plants he could accept your call best at his home at five oclock tonight that would be eight in the evening of our time i was to ring her back and tell her would that be okay he said that would be fine and put the receiver down he could not work that day against all his rules of routine he went down again to the workshop and stood turning over the work of keith stewart so much pleasure given to so many people in all walks of life and yet the man was short of money worse paid than a professor it didnt seem right but that was evidently the way it was at eight oclock he was speaking to the magnate on the telephone say professor this is a real pleasure said mr hirzhorn how are you making out with the clock not too bad said the professor i got the tilting table and the escapement made all right but now im finding the clock motion to be quite a job however ill get over it all right what i wanted to talk to you about was mr keith stewart hes a great guy said mr hirzhorn whenever i get in a difficulty i write to him and he comes right back with the answer hes in a little trouble i thought you might like to know hes been in honolulu but hes probably somewhere in the pacific at present in honolulu whats he doing there if id known id have flown across to meet him i got a letter from his editor shall i read it out sure professor im sorry if hes got in any trouble professor oleary started to read the letter from mr mcneil when he was halfway through mr hirzhorn stopped him say professor he said this is interesting but id like to see a copy and consider it mind if we put it on the tape by all means mr hirzhorn laid down the receiver and called to the next room julie say julie a handsome jewishlooking girl appeared at the door get this on the tape the letter that professor oleary will be reading out get the conversation too all of the call in a moment he spoke again were all set now professor if you wouldnt mind starting the letter again when that was over he said well professor thatll need some thought ill have it copied and think about it and call you again can you find out whether hes left honolulu oh sure ill call honolulu right now if i can contact him id better speak to him myself and read him out this letter that would be a good idea his editor this mr mcneil hes evidently prepared to help him with the fares hed better cable his office but im afraid that hell have started already well well find that out say if we can locate him id be mighty glad to have him visit with me for a day or two on his way back to england theres one or two things on the clock that id like his advice on and he might be interested to see some of the plants would you be able to come over and join us professor oleary said not till the end of may ive got things i must do here each day too bad well anyway professor ill be calling you again mr hirzhorn put down the receiver and called for julie when she came he said give me all that in type soon as you can and say whats the name of the guy that runs our business in honolulu making monkey pod wood bowls and dishes setches mr hirzhorn setches and byrne incorporated thats right paul setches well get that tape in type and let me have it after that i may want to speak with paul setches she went out and he sat on alone in his study a glass of rye and water with a little ice beside him he sat as was his habit in the evening in front of the great picture window facing to the west he lived not far from wauna on an inlet off the puget sound ten miles from his office in tacoma the east side of the house looked out over the inlet his private airstrip his boathouse and his moored motorcruiser the west side looked over many miles of forest to the snowcapped olympic range here he would sit on the evenings when he had the leisure and rest a little and watch the sunset light beyond the snowy forests he had been born a lumberman and he loved forests he lived very much alone devoted to his business his two sons lived in suburbs of tacoma more convenient to schools and to the main seattletacoma airport where the executive aircraft of the corporation were housed and maintained his wife liked florida and was frequently away there in the winter he liked florida well enough and sometimes spent a day or two there with her in the sun but he could not live for long away from his business and his forests the girl julie perlberg lived in the house with him and managed the servants and worked as his secretary at home she was an illegitimate daughter of his oldest son emmanuel who had found a job for her in the office of the plant at marblemount on the skagit river when she was fifteen years old conveniently tucked away in the mountains at a discreet distance from tacoma she had the hirzhom blood in her however and by the time she was eighteen she was virtually running the marblemount plant there had been little option but to transfer her to the head office in tacoma if they wanted to keep a man as manager in marblemount there the old man had met her and had taken a fancy to his granddaughter largely because of her encyclopaedic knowledge of the business as he found less room for detail in his mind he had taken her as his personal secretary his sons approved of this because they were a closely knit family and theirs was a family business his father had emigrated to seattle from austria in the early years of the century solly had been an enormous powerful young man who liked work in the woods he had been a hand faller at the age of twenty and a high rigger when he was twentyfive he saved his money and at the age of thirtytwo he had taken his own lumber concession and had become an employer of men from that time he had never looked back forest after forest had been added to his empire mill after mill to his payroll his writ now ran from bellingham to eugene from cape flattery to spokane he employed rather more than men in the various businesses under his direct control he owned logging railroads bulldozers by the score trucks by the hundred and many lumber mills at sixtytwo he had a coronary and his doctors told him bluntly that he must do less work he must acquire a hobby and live quietly at home for a portion of each day or of each week he had seen this sentence coming and he knew what he would do as his business had grown he had bought huge varieties of engineering products but he had never been an engineer he had never formed a thread upon a bolt though in theory he knew how it was done he had concealed his lack of engineering knowledge all his life by virtue of his native wit but always he had been uncertain in the background of his mind if now he had to stay out of the office for a portion of his life he would devote that portion to learning something about engineering the craft that impinged so largely on his business he set to work to organize a very spacious workshop in the basement of his house at wauna where he could learn some engineering quietly and secretly away from the eyes of the engineers that he employed very soon he found out about the english magazine the miniature mechanic and had it sent to him by airmail every week with several other and lesser american publications in a short time he became completely absorbed in his new interest to the satisfaction of his sons and of his doctors he became conscious of a considerable debt of gratitude to the little magazine the miniature mechanic all bis life he had heard his engineers speaking casually of milling and he had not known what the process was the magazine taught him in the first few issues that came to hand he consulted with the engineer who maintained their three executive aircraft at the airport and went with him to a machinery store in seattle and bought a bench milling machine with a variety of cutters he got his aeroplane engineers to install it in his workshop beside the lathe and drill press that he had already bought and learned to use it thereafter he could talk on equal terms on milling with his engineers and once or twice was able to correct them which gave him immense pleasure in lathe work it was the same of all the contributors to the magazine he held keith stewart in the highest regard for the lucidity of his descriptions and his comprehension of the difficulties of the tyro once in a difficulty which he later realized to be due entirely to his own stupidity he had dictated a letter asking for advice hardly expecting to receive an answer he had got one promptly brief but helpful the letter of a friendly man encouraged he had written again some months later and again and help had never failed to reach him by return airmail this was the mental climate in which he received the sheets of typescript from juke ten minutes after the call from professor oleary in ann arbor he sat in front of the big picture window in the sunset glow the girl switched on a standard lamp and moved it to throw the light over his shoulder he thanked her absently as he refreshed his memory of the call by glancing over her typescript say he said at last hes got himself into a real jam i wonder where this fisherman came from would you like me to try to find out mr hirzhorn no leave that be what time is it in honolulu now half past three well get me a call to paul setches if hes not in the office give his girl hell n tell her to find him and tell him to call me at once ten minutes later he was speaking to the president of setches and byrne inc say paul he said this is sol hirzhorn i want you to see if you can contact a man called keith stewart for me he has been staying at the beachcomber hotel but it may be that hes living on a fishing boat called the mary belle in the yacht harbour or someplace he went on to describe the situation and read out the letter from mr mcneil the message is tell him to contact his editor before going any further and especially before sailing for tahiti after hes done that ask him if he would call me id like to speak with him he can do that from your office if hes short of money mr setches said that he would make some inquiries and call him back mr hirzhorn laid down the receiver and heaved his bulk up out of the chair he went to the door of the next room furnished half as sitting room with a log fire and half as office he said to julie im going down into the workshop if paul setches calls again ill take the call down there tell me when its half an hour before supper n well have a drink okay mr hirzhorn he lumbered off and went down to his workshop and stood fingering the tilting table of the clock that he had made and burnished with such loving care he was a slower worker than professor oleary partly from inexperience and partly from age on the other hand he was lavish with equipment and spared no expense in providing machine tools for die workshop he stood fingering the halfmachined bronze trunnions that would support the table his mind far away ten or eleven days had elapsed since the mary belle had been due to sail for tahiti there was little chance that paul setches would find her still in the yacht harbour she could be halfway to tahiti by this time but how to find a fishing boat in the wastes of the pacific ocean a boat that had no radio chuck ferris had a yacht and yes it was a yacht in honolulu he had been on a world cruise and had interrupted it to fly back to new york or some damn place paul setches had entertained chuck ferris and his party at the royal hawaiian on the old mans instructions and he had written later to say that the cruise had been interrupted sooner or later solly hirzhorn meant to fit ferris hydraulics as a trial installation in one of his mills on all of the conveyors among the many accidents that happened in the lumber business a man caught in the flying chains and sprockets of the conveyors was the most horrible it always made the newspapers in all its gory detail it created too much adverse comment sooner or later he would have to fit a trial mill with ferris hydraulics throughout and cut out every chain it would be expensive one million seven hundred thousand bucks was the ferris estimate for the flume river mill manny was for it joe said that it would never pay his son joseph was the treasurer of hirzhorn enterprises it was for the boys to decide but he thought it ought to be tried out one day in one mill he started work upon the backplate of the clock a thick sheet of brass which involved little but simple cutting and filing he was as yet nowhere near the difficulties which had beset professor oleary he did not strain his dubious heart by cutting the thick metal with a hand hacksaw as the professor did among his many machine tools mr hirzhorn had a little bandsaw powered by an electric motor which did the job for him in no time he worked on happily for an hour or so and made good progress till the telephone rang on the corner of the bench he switched off the machine and picked up the receiver i have mr setches on the line said julie will you take his call down there sure he said get it on the tape a minute later he was speaking to honolulu well mr hirzhorn im sorry to say hes gone he sailed in this fishing boat the mary belle on tuesday of last week where were they going to well they told the harbour launch that they were bound for hilo thats on hawaii in the group of islands but they never turned up at hilo and the gossip on the waterfront says they were bound for papeete in tahiti that checks with the letter that you read me out why would they say that they were going to hilo then id say they were afraid of the formalities mr hirzhorn theyd have to have a french visa on their passports for one thing and the french dont like immigrants that havent any money that could be the reason i wouldnt know whats going to happen when they get to papeete then if they get there theyll find themselves in trouble mr hirzhorn there was a long silence paul setches said you still there mr hirzhorn okay okay i was just thinking did you hear anything about the captain of this fishing boat well now thats another thing mr hirzhorn the customs officers say hes nuts the yacht owners down in the yacht harbour they say hes a good seaman but kind of simple they dont any of them think hell find tahiti you see hes got no radio no df loop no echo sounder no iron mike nothing the ship hasnt even got an engine no engine at all not even an outboard and the captain certainly wouldnt know how to use a sextant if he had oneit was bad youre sure keith stewart sailed upon this boat sure thing mr hirzhorn i spoke with the customs officer that went after them in the harbour launch they left without paying harbour dues he said keith stewart was on board thats when they said that they were bound for hilo there wouldnt be any way to get in touch with them would there not that i know of you see theyve got no radio there was another silence while the old mans mind reviewed thesituation tell me he said at last is chuck ferris yacht still in the harbour the flying cloud sure shes still here mrs efstathios chucks daughter shes living on board making quite a fool of herself with a band leader manuel de silva you know music with manuel on the tv there was another pause well thanks paul thanks a lot for what youve done ill have to think this over maybe ill be in touch with you again but thats all for the present okay mr hirzhorn its been a pleasure the old man stood by the bench for a few moments the conversation had interrupted the thread of thought connected with his work and now he could not take up his enthusiasm again he took off his working apron and hung it on the hook on the door put on his jacket and went up again to the big sitting room with the picture window julie had drawn the curtains to shut out the darkness she came in from her own office in surprise for she had expected him to stay down in the workshop much longer will you have the drinks now she asked not yet he said say that engineer chuck ferris keeps at boeing the one who came with him last time jim rockingham rockawin mr hirzhorn thats right you know where he lives its somewhere out by renton she said thoughtfully elliott or maple valley or some place like that i can find out easy enough do you want to speak with him its more than i can do upon the telephone he said what id like him to do is to come here right now and visit with me for a little while see if you can get him at his home if so ill speak with him myself she went into her office and closed the door and he sank down into his chair before the fire seventeen hundred thousand dollars was a lot of money and on top of that theyd lose at least a fortnight of production from the mill while the conversion was going on in terms of cash joseph was probably right hydraulic operation would put up their costs but emmanuel had the right idea the day was passing when such ghastly accidents could be tolerated in the interest of cheap lumber people thought much more of human lives now than they used to do they must convert the flume river mill for a trial of the ferris system but if they were to do that he would see that chuck ferris lent his yacht for a few weeks chuck had been trying to get his hydraulics into the lumber business for years julie came in again i called mr rockawin at his home she said he left this afternoon to spend the weekend with his family at the mount rainier mountain lodge skiing see if you can get him there he said he sat on by the fire presently julie came in again mr rockawin is on the line right now she said softly she moved the table with the telephone upon it closer to his side he said that jim rockawin say jim this is sol hirzhorn here im speaking from my home at wauna i been thinking a lot about our flume river mill id like you to drive over n have a talk if you can make it it was a royal command and must be obeyed but it was also dark and snowing at the mountain lodge and fiftyfive miles to go id be happy to do just that mr hirzhorn he said the skiing with his family must be abandoned matter of fact its snowing pretty hard up here right now and im not too sure id make it down the road to the highway ill come now if you say but id as soon start with the first light n be with you by ten oclock okay jim i wouldnt want you to go and break your neck come over soon as you can make it in the morning meanwhile ill be talking with the boys they hung up and jim rockawin stood in deep thought by the row of telephones in little counter booths he was a man of about thirtyfive dressed in ski trousers slippers and an ornamental pullover this was business he sensed it this was the culmination of three years of patient tactful work he did not know exactly what would happen in the morning but he knew this very certainly ferris hydraulics was about to break into the lumber business his wife pretty and kittenish came downstairs from the bedroom floor with their two daughters twelve and ten years old who was that hon she asked sol hirzhorn he replied ill have to go and see him in the morning oh honey wont it do on monday he shook his head im afraid not not when sol hirzhorn takes the trouble to find me here and ring me personally she sighed but she did not complain further men were like that always putting business first but after all sol hirzhorn was sol hirzhorn to her born and bred in the state of washington the name was a household word and she shared in the reflected glory of her husbands coming visit to sol hirzhorn in his fabulous home at wauna she said well come and eat anyway just a few minutes he replied ill have to call chuck about this oh honey hell be going to bed he explained he glanced at the watch upon his wrist its ten oclock right now in cincinnati she left him and took the children into the dining room he turned again to the telephone and presently he was speaking to his employer in his home i dont know what it is he wants mr ferris he said but its about the flume river mill and its business say thats great news said mr ferris what was it that we quoted for the whole job just under two million wasnt it seventeen hundred thousand and some odd dollars said his representative what will i say if he only wants to do a part of it string him along n call me as soon as you can in that case id not go back to new york id fly right out and be with you sunday afternoon he shouldnt split that job id try to talk him out of it its not giving the system a fair trial they talked a little longer i guess ill call you anyway soon as i get away from him mr rockawin said youll be home tomorrow sure ill be home said mr ferris this is big news i just sit right here looking at the television waiting for your call mr ferris was a smah dynamic man with auburn hair fiftythree years old the war had made him what he was in he had been a draughtsman in an aircraft drawing office specializing upon undercarriage legs and on aircraft hydraulics generally he had considerable inventive genius and even more business acumen with the growth of aviation he had left the drawing office and had started a tiny specialist business in cincinnati working on a shoestring getting all his machined parts made out by sub contract he had never looked back his business had grown astronomically with the war by he was the president of a twentymilliondollar corporation with a business that was comparable with that of solomon p hirzhorn for years he had wanted to get his finger into the lumber industry which he considered to be antiquated in its equipment judged by aircraft standards moreover although his business was doing well there was little doubt that rockets and guided missiles would replace the manned aircraft in the future to a large degree guided missiles were not well suited to hydraulic units and even piloted aeroplanes were now flying at such altitudes that special precautions with increased complexity had to be taken to prevent the hydraulic fluid boiling in the pipes he had already switched a considerable proportion of his manufacturing capacity to the automotive industry the lumber business was another one as a hydraulic engineer he was turning his attention more and more to things that stayed on the ground he did his best to delegate authority but his business grew too quickly as soon as he found a man to take one section off his shoulders another enterprise was starting up needing his guiding hand for the first year or so in he had a nervous breakdown and spent three months in a very expensive home he came out mentally refreshed and fit as a flea divorced his wife and married another one and began working sixteen hours a day again in he had another breakdown and went back into the home this time his doctors impressed on him that he really must do less work and find more interests they suggested a long sea voyage he did not want to die and so he bought a large schooner yacht the flying cloud that had been built for a cinema magnate who committed suicide for an unmentionable reason he had actually voyaged in her on his second emergence from the mental home across the pacific and as far as sydney by that time he was so bored that he left her and sank into the deep chair of a pan american airliner with an audible sigh of relief in two days he was back in his office at cincinnati and at work since then he had conscientiously tried to use his big yacht as his doctors had recommended and he was actually on board her two or three times a year each time intending a months cruise or longer each time the office drew him back as with a magnet because he had no other interest in his liie except his very fleeting loves he sat in his home on paxton avenue between the observatory and the country club and waited for the call from jim rockawin it came at about three in the afternoon noon on the west coast look mr ferris said his representative this isnt just what i thought no business asked his employer sharply i think hes going to order presently but hes not ordering just yet emmanuel was there the eldest son they wanted to know if they could use the existing power house with the steam plant in it throw out the steam plant and put our diesel motors and hydraulic generators in it its feet from the first conveyor its not a proposition really but i said that id go over monday and take a look at it with them he paused what sol hirzhorn really wanted was something different whats that he wants to borrow your yacht for crying out loud said mr ferris what does he want with that go for a sail in it no he wants to use it say mr ferris this is going to be mighty difficult to explain over the longdistance line you got a tape machine there so you could read it over later and make up your mind sure ive got a tape wait while i fix it up there was a pause and then he said go ahead the representative had been collecting his thoughts during the pause and when he spoke it was clearly and lucidly some years ago mr hirzhorn had a bad spell with his health and his doctors told him he must get himself a hobby in his home well he started a workshop not a wood workshop like the rest of us but a real engineering workshop with lathes milling machines shapers a drill press oxyacetylene welding and god knows what he took me down and showed me i never saw anything like it thats where he spends most of his spare time now hes making some kind of a clock the tape reel rolled slowly steadily as he spoke he told the whole story reading out the carbon copy of the letter froin mr mcneil to professor oleary at ann arbor that he had got from julie well thats the way it is mr ferris he said at last he wants to borrow the flying cloud to go down to tahiti and pick up these boys on their fishing boat and do whatever this keith stewart wants to do and bring him back to tacoma so that sol hirzhorn can talk to him about his clock before he goes back to england hell pay you charter money of course i know this all sounds screwy but thats the way it is you think hes going to convert that mill jim imsure he is mr ferris is he dickering with anybody else i dont think so i dont think hed do that when the time comes hell try to beat us down on the price sure sure that was a commonplace well he can have the yacht of course tell him that right away regarding charter money it wont cost him a cent if he puts an order with us otherwise oh tell him that well let him know ive never chartered it before no tell him he can have it free as long as he likes whether he puts an order with us or not thats right i shant be using it i think thats very wise boss if i may say so sols going to be very pleased okay okay ill play this tape back and call captain petersen now you go over monday and string them along better call me again monday night around six oclock your time keith stewart sat on the deck of the mary belle that saturday afternoon twelve days out from honolulu while jack donelly slept below he was very different now from the fat rather unhealthy little man who had sailed upon the maty belle five days of seasickness had made him noticeably slimmer and more competent in his appearance that had been over for a week he now knew the sails and ropes by name and what they did he could not yet pull down a reef alone or he had never done so but he knew how it was done he still wore the tattered panama hat as a protection from the midday sun and he still wore the cricket shirt at night and when the sun began to burn but most of the time he went clothed only in a pair of bathing shorts and barefoot from frequently stubbing his toes he had charted the position of every eyebolt in the deck and now avoided them he was a very different man from the keith stewart who had boarded the aeroplane at blackbushe by his noon latitude observations and by jacks dead reckoning he judged that they were now about two degrees and forty minutes north of the equator about abreast of christmas island and probably two or three hundred miles to the east of it jack thought that they were closer than that they had seen a patch of floating seaweed early that morning and he had viewed it with concern it could have come from anywhere keith had protested not from the east it couldnt jack grumbled seaweed dont last more n a few weeks in the sea i never seen seaweed more n miles from land n that only when theres been an offshore gale want to put the thinking cap on for this later in the pacific islands pilot keith had found some evidence of an eastgoing current in the vicinity of christmas island at that season of the year jack grunted when he told him i guess were well away down to leeward he grumbled give me a shake up if you see any birds he went down below to sleep later that afternoon keith saw something better than a bird he saw the smoke of a steamer it appeared broad on the starboard bow on the horizon and grew fairly rapidly it was the second ship that they had seen since leaving honolulu and keith watched it with interest presently he could see the hull above the horizon and realized that it was going to pass fairly close to them he called jack donelly from his sleep the captain put his head out of the hatch and studied the position bear up a little he said he pointed with the flat of his hand at the direction he wanted keith to steer to intercept the steamer or pass close to her keith put down the helm and pulled in the main sheet and then the foresheet thats okay said jack keep her as you go what are you going to do asked keith the captain looked at him in surprise why stop her n ask where we are he said it seemed the most natural thing to him to keith it seemed an appalling thing to do this was a big ship costing millions of pounds but he was new to the sea and he said nothing jack said well need a board he thought for a moment vanished down below and reappeared with the lid of the locker under his bunk and mysteriously a piece of chalk ill take her he said going to the helm you write better n what i do put want position a sudden doubt assailed him suppose they give it on a board in this latitude and longitude you know how to put that out upon the chartn say where we are keith said i can do that he bent to his task making the letters as bold and clear as he could and adding the word please which seemed quite unnecessary to his captain then he took the helm again while jack went below and reappeared with a large flag of the united states which he bent on to the burgee halliards and hauled to the masthead upside down he viewed it with satisfaction its a great thing to belong to a wonderful country like the ole united states he remarked i mean you britishers nobody wouldnt know if your union jack was upside down or not but with old glory theres no mistaking the ship drew nearer on an intercepting course she was a tanker light in the water painted grey all over like a battleship and wearing the blue ensign in fact she was a fleet oiler that had discharged her cargo at christmas island and was now on her way back to england through the panama canal but they had no means of knowing that when she was less than half a mile away and they could hear the noise of her engines above the noises of their own passage they held up their board her engines slowed and stopped jack took the helm and put the ship about to windward and let all sheets draw and sailed down the length of her keith holding up their board from the bridge an officer scrutinized it through glasses waved to them in acknowledgement and vanished inside at the stern of the tanker jack gibed the mainsail and sailed up the length of her again two officers appeared upon the bridge holding a blackboard the figures on it read lat n long w keith copied the figures down carefully and went below and set them out upon his chart he reappeared at the hatch were only seventyfour miles from christmas island he said how far ought we to be about two hundred and fifty jack waved a salutation to the officers on board the tanker and they waved back they heard the engineroom telegraph bells jangle and the big propeller turned in a flurry of foam under her counter they sailed clear of her stern and got on to their course guess well put her up a point to windward maybe a point and a half said jack donelly i knowed that we was getting down to leeward by that patch of weed that afternoon mr ferris called captain petersen from cincinnati say captain he said i was hoping to have joined you again before now but i dont seem able to make it i got a job for you to do though you know anything about a fish boat called the mary belle been in the yacht harbour recently sure mr ferris said the captain in surprise they sailed for tahiti maybe two weeks ago how many people were on board her when she sailed two i think there was the captain a guy by the name of jack donelly the other was a kind of passenger english he was flew out here in an aeroplane from england and wanted to get down to tahiti they came on board here to ask about the course they did what was the passengers name the captain rubbed his chin well now mr ferris ill have to try to think it might have been keats keith keith stewart say hes a friend of sol hirzhorn and sols all het up about the risk hes taking going to tahiti in that way he is the captains jaw dropped he knew all about sol hirzhorn and his empire of the forests he hasnt any money he remarked weakly thats why he went with jack donelly his employer replied sol hirzhorn hadnt any money when he started nor had i now look captain i want you to get going right away n follow down the route that hed have taken to tahiti if you catch up with him thats fine if you dont then when you get to this place papeete n hes not there you start looking for him back along the track if you reckon theyve got wrecked upon an island visit every island they could be on but find keith stewart captain petersens heart rejoiced he was sick of honolulu this was a job after his own heart what will i do when i find him youll put the flying cloud at his disposal mr ferris said keep in touch with me by radio his sister got wrecked in the tuamotus or something so he wants to go to one of the islands i know about that the captain said he told me he had a newspaper clipping about it fine well put the ship at his disposal for whatever he wants to do but when thats over i want him back in seattle or tacoma youd better come right back to seattle with the flying cloud n mind you bring keith stewart with you sol hirzhorn waiits to see him and ive got a big deal on with sol you shall have him mr ferris okay then for now ill maybe meet you in seattle when you arrive or else it might be jim rockawin you know jim sure i know jim mr ferris well keep me informed by radio every two three days how its going on theres just one thing mr ferris whats that about mrs efstathios will she be coming along with us there was a momentary silence gee said mr ferris i forgot all about dawn she with you now shes on shore some place i wouldnt know maybe the royal waikiki hotel music with manuel mr ferris i know i know there was a pause what time is it with you a quarter to three in the afternoon its a quarter to eight with us the doctor says i got to be in bed and asleep by ten say if she comes within the next two hours ask her to call me otherwise tell her how things are yourself the captain made a slight grimace she isnt mrs efstathios any more the decree went through she can move into a hotel on shore or she can go along with you or she can come right home tell her that with love and kisses from daddy but you sail for tahiti first thing in the morning okay mr ferris said captain petersen chapter mine the mary belle made a quick passage to papeete covering the nautical miles in twentyfive days they carried a fair beam trade wind all the way but for one day of slamming about in the light airs of the doldrums on the equator they never made quite enough allowance for leeway and passed within five miles of an island which from the latitude they assumed to be vostok they bore up two points and passed close to flint island thereafter they had no difficulty they sighted tahiti with the last of the light one evening hove to for the night and went to sleep and sailed into the harbour of papeete next morning they had need of all their sleep because in papeete every mans hand was against them on their nonarrival at hilo the french officials had been fully informed by honolulu over the radio of their suspected destination and there was quite a reception committee waiting for them on the quay the harbourmaster in his launch directed them where to drop their anchor and took a stern warp to the quay as soon as the vessel was made fast a gangway was put down on to their stern and the reception committee came on board there was the harbourmaster an official in plain clothes from the bureau de administration an official in plain clothes from the banque dlndochine the port health officer and three gendarmes in uniform armed to the teeth there followed the most unpleasant hour that keith stewart had ever had to undergo jack donelly could produce no ships papers at all and no cornet and was told that import duty would be due upon the value of his vessel on entry into french oceania probably at thirty per cent he was also liable to a considerable fine he had no bill of health they would therefore be put in quarantine for thirty days and refused permission to land during that time they would have to pay for the visits of the port doctor to inspect them each day and would be fined for that as well he had no passport and no visa to visit the islands that merited another fine keith stewart had a passport which the police immediately confiscated he pointed out that no visa was required for france they said that a visa was required for french oceania and he would be fined they were forced to produce what money and travellers cheques they had which the official of the banque dlndochine immediately confiscated giving them a receipt and stating that accounts would be opened to their credit a first charge on which would be their liabilities to the administration after that the ship was searched very comprehensively by the gendarmes who left everything in confusion the party then departed leaving one of the gendarmes as a guard at the head of the gangway they were given to understand that they would be towed to the quarantine anchorage later in the day jack donelly was dazed and bewildered by this rude reception i dont see why they want to be so mad about these tiddy little things he said we haven done nothing wrong i suppose we set about it the wrong way said keith he thought deeply for a few minutes while putting the nets back into the stern locker from which the gendarmes had dragged them i think the thing to do would be to ask to see the british consul your consul too i dunno said jack i never had no truck with one o them you ask to see yours first n see what happens keith went to the gangway and spoke to the gendarme he knew no french and the gendarme knew no english so they did not get very far british consul he said the man shook his head actually he was trying to convey the information that there was no british consul in tahiti failing to get his message through he tried again sousofficier viendra he said apres le dejuner spik english keith said i am speaking english he tried to move past the man to find someone on the quay who would interpret but the gendarme barred his way with his rifle keith returned disconsolate to the deck of the mary belle i suppose weve just got to wait here till something happens he said there was a strong smell of vanilla in the port and very soon little black iridescent beetles started to descend upon the ship in hundreds they were everywhere theyd be copra beetles jack observed ma used to tell me about them when we were little nippers they can bite he shook himself lets have some chow they went below and cooked a meal upon an even keel for the first time in nearly a month jack was depressed and uneasy they couldnt take the mary belle away could they he asked i havent got no thirty per cent that wouldnt be thirty cents would it i mean its something more it means about a third of what the ships worth keith said but dont worry about that its just a tryon the consuls will put that right for us to console and amuse his captain he got out the little petrol generator set and started it with a flick of his thumb there was still a little petrol left in the bottle jack donelly got down on his hands and knees to watch it running smallest in the world he breathed entranced he raised his head those folks who came on board the guy from the banque and the guy from the governors office and all theyd have been mighty interested to see this maybe we oughta showed it to them they lay moored sternon to the quay for most of the afternoon while papeete slept the sunlight on deck was torrid and they sweated it out upon their berths at half past three there was a step on deck and keith got up it was the sousqfficier very smart he held two folded papers in his hand and gave one to each of them citation he said what you say summons to the law court the judge on monday at eleven hours in the morning i will come to fetch you keith opened the paper but it was all in french can i see the british consul he asked there is no british consul in tahiti said the man he comes sometimes from fiji ask about the american consul growled jack there is no american consul said the sousofficier he eyed jack puzzled you are american im a us citizen said the captain truculently you better watch your step keith said if youre going to take us to court well have to have an interpreter we neither of us speak french the man nodded not unfriendly there is here an englishman mr devenish who was consul many years i will ask him to come and talk to you will there be an interpreter in court the judge speaks good english perhaps mr devenish also he will come will we get fined the sousofficier shrugged his shoulders perhaps what happens if we havent enough money for the fine the man smiled you will have to get some sell the ship perhaps otherwise there is the prison he left them with that to think about and walked up into the town they sat in the cockpit dejected waiting for something to happen i dont like all this talk about going to prison keith muttered he had an idea that a permit from the governor would be needed before he could visit marokota island and prison didnt seem the best place from which to forward an application id rather go to prison than have these frenchies steal the mary belle said jack i havent got no thirty per cent what they making such a fuss about anyway we done nothing wrong i havent any money to pay fines said keith but they cant put us in prison there must be some way out aw thats nothing said jack comforting him i been in prison there aint nothing to it keith raised his head in curiosity what did you go to prison for rape said the captain he struggled to explain himself gloria didnt make no trouble about it shed ha come with me again but then her ma turned nasty and she got a lawyer n he said it was rape n they made gloria say all kinds of things in court the judge asked me why i did it n i didnt know what to say except that i just naturally wanted to so he said it was rape too n give me three months he stared out over the rippling sunlit waters of the harbour it was worth it he said simply keith didnt know what to say to that he grinned and asked what was it like in prison okay said his captain good chow n not much work they got the radio in every cell so you can lie and listen to it all the time television twice a week n a movie every so often its okay he paused in reminiscent thought gloria would have liked it fine he said towards evening the harbour launch came backhand towed them out from the quay to the quarantine anchorage they were sitting disconsolate on deck next morning awaiting the arrival of the port health officer hoping to negotiate with him for supplies of water and fresh vegetables when the flying cloud sailed in she came from the north and she came very quickly for it was one of captain petersens principles in making a passage that he carried sail all the time but whenever the speed dropped below about ten knots he put on his big diesel to help her along in consequence he made good more than twice the speed of the mary belle he had sailed from honolulu thirteen days behind them but arrived in papeete only a day later he sailed into the harbour for he liked to display his fine ship and the seamanship of his crew the big diesel ticking over with the exhaust muttering beneath the counter ready to pull him out of trouble if the unexpected happened in the narrow waters of the harbour but nothing did so he rounded up neatly into wind heading for a vacant mooring buoy a dinghy splashed into the water by her side the square yards on the foremast came down together the mizzen swung free above the wheelhouse and deck cabin and in a couple of minutes a coir hawser had been passed through the eye of the buoy and returned on board jack watched all this entranced gee thats pretty to watch he said that captain petersen he handles her fine great big ship she is too youre sure thats the same one asked keith the one we went on board to ask the course the flying cloud his captain turned to him with scorn sure its the same one think i wouldnt know her see shes got one topping lift rigged to the end of the mizzen boom i never see that before more often they have twins rigged about two thirds the way along course shes the flying cloud he turned to keith a brilliant thought fresh in his mind maybe hell come off and talk to us he was real nice that day suppose he does lets you and me show him the generating set smallest in the world i bet hes never seen anything like that he did not come that morning they thought they saw him on deck inspecting the mary belle through fieldglasses but the ships were nearly a mile apart and it was difficult to say they thought they saw the woman on deck too though they could not be very certain about that either sails were furled quickly and neatly a derrick was rigged and lowered a big motor pinnace into the water and the captain went ashore to the customs house quay there was nothing to be looked at any more lets have some chow n then lie down captain donelly said i wish that redhead would get in one of them boats n come on over the remains of the cornmeal in the sack was now a festering mass of maggots which neither of them had eaten for the last fortnight keith persuaded jack to let him drop it overboard which jack did with regret cornmeal fritters are good chow he observed maybe we can get another rsack here someplace he scooped up a double handful of the maggots for use as bait and put them in a tin and consigned the sack to the deep they had a meal and lay down to sleep away the heat of the afternoon it was about three oclock when the launch from the flying claud came alongside captain petersen hailed them maty belle anyone aboard jack stuck his head up out of the hatch sure he said they wont let us go any other place mind if i come aboard okay the launch drew alongside keith joined jack on deck were supposed to be in quarantine he said is that all right thats okay said captain petersen ive just come from the harbour office he swung himself over the bulwarks on to the deck of the mary belle and turned back to the coxswain of his launch lay off a cable or so or else make fast astern he said ill give a hail when im ready to go back the launch sheered off and he turned to the mariners smiling well he said you boys have certainly got yourselves a mess of trouble here aw said jack that doesnt amount to anything its only paper stuff we havent done nothing wrong there was a momentary pause well said captain petersen thoughtfully thats certainly one way of looking at it it may be the right way he sat down on the bulwark anyway he said you arent in quarantine any more you can move into the quay now any time you like ill get my launch to give you a pluck in later they stared at him dazed how come asked jack donelly i got a bill of health for you in honolulu and brought it along and put it in with mine said captain petersen its only a sort of letter saying that there wasnt any cholera in honolulu on the day you sailed i told the port health officer here that youd left it in the office by mistake and they asked me to bring it along in fact he had had to exercise a good deal of personal charm to soothe the ruffled feelings of the port authorities in honolulu but he had got what he wanted in the end he had been equally successful that morning in papeete in fact he was a frequent visitor to papeete in the flying cloud and had built up an enduring friendship with the chef du port over the years the flying cloud was a large and an important yacht whose owners expected the captain to avoid irritating delays caused by minor french bureaucracy there was only one berth in the port that had water and diesel oil piped alongside and from which a telephone connection could be made at the grand quai used by mail steamers at infrequent intervals on his first visit to papeete he had taken the chef du port out to lunch and the chef had mentioned the great interest that he took in the affairs of the st xavier hospice des orphelins orphan asylums said the chef with tears in his eyes were usually short of money and this one was shorter than most but they all did what they could to help the little homeless children of papeete captain petersen reckoned that he knew the form and he was duly touched so deeply that he had pulled out his wallet there and then and had given the chef two notes of ten mille francs for him to take up to the mother superior as a contribution and that afternoon he had moved the flying cloud into the berth at the grand quai he had been stunned that evening to receive an envelope delivered by hand containing a note of thanks from the mother superior and a receipt for the full amount out of curiosity he had walked up the mountain next morning and had found that the st xavier hospice des orphelins was a real place complete with nuns and children since then he had repeated this donation on every visit that he had made to papeete with the result that he had always got the best berth in the harbour and had had no trouble at all he squatted on the bulwark of the mary belle in the warm sunlight a resplendent figure in a clean white uniform he dealt first with jack donelly they tell me that youre having trouble over no certificate of registration and no clearance from honolulu captain he remarked cigarettehe proffered an opened packet jack donelly took one and the captain lit it for him i didnt know you had to have them things said jack nobody ever told me papers arent they thats right said captain petersen he turned to the man beside him tell me are you polynesian im a us citizen said jack i got born in reedsport oregon n lived there all my life eleven of us there was eleven that grew up that is seven boys n five girls dad met ma around these parts someplace n settled down at reedsport they got married there i guess your mother came from round about these parts from these islands ma came from a place called huahine jack said she was always telling me to get down to the islands and id be okay i guess she didnt know let me get this straight said captain petersen your mother was born at huahine she must have been polynesian id say she was she was always kinda dark darker than the other women in our street not nigger dark of course just kinda brown is she still alive asked the captain gently jack shook his head ma died last year she was always wanting to get back to the islands but she liked the television too so she was pulled both ways did you tell them you were half polynesian when you got here yesterday that your mother came from huahine jack shook his great head i didnt think of it nobody ever asked have you got anything to show your mother was a polynesian any birth certificate or anything like that thats papers captain petersen nodded and jack shook his head i got my navy discharge paper someplace he said vaguely maybe i left it back home but there wasnt anything about ma on that he hesitated i dunno that dad and ma were ever married not in church i mean but they stuck together over forty years that counts for something dont it sure said captain petersen he turned to the man beside him look captain he said they cant do a thing to you down here youre half a polynesian the french run this colony for the polynesians not for the whites theyll have to give you back your money you wont come into court on monday theyll withdraw all the charges against you they wont try to take your ship away from you they wont expect you to have any papers for the ship theyll forget about the passport you rate down here as polynesian and this is your country im a us citizen said jack they wont take that away the captain hesitated no but dont talk about it just at first let things get settled down he paused ill see the chef du port soon as we go on shore he said hell fix everything for you jack was very pleased he nudged keith beside him and said in a hoarse whisper show him the little generator smallest in the world keith nodded you tell him he said jack donelly turned to the officer beside him say captain he said mr keatss got something down below wed like you to see smallest motor in the world it is id certainly like to see it said captain petersen politely they got up from the rail and jack led the way down below the captain touched keith on the arm before going down the ladder would you be mr keith stewart he asked keith smiled thats right he said he always calls me keats he got it wrong first day nice guy one of the best id say so too he paused id appreciate a bit of a talk with you later on mr stewart keith glanced at him in surprise of course they went down into the cabin after jack donelly captain petersen took a quick glance around the stark bareness of the ships interior there was not even any varnish just the bare wood getting a bit dirty there was a minimum of bulkheads and cupboards the ship was little but an empty shell devoid of any comforts yet she was efficient the two fortygallon barrels of water were properly chocked and stayed in place and the very emptiness of her the absence of tables doors and bulkheads made it possible to get about inside her in a hurry he knew fishing vessels and he liked this one jack lifted the little generator set reverently down from the fiddled shelf take a look at this captain he said smallest generator set in the world mr keats here he designed it all n made every bit oi it the captain of the flying cloud took it in his hands and examined it with interest and growing respect he lived at midlake close outside seattle here his small son had several model aeroplanes fitted with mass production compression ignition motors and he had spent many hours contracting a sore finger twiddling the props to try to make them go he was very familiar with small motors of that sort this which he now held cradled in his hand was something totally different it was a fourcycle motor for a start with tiny valves and valve springs and push rods beautifully miniaturized superbly made the generator was to him a little wonder with its delicately worked commutator and tiny brush gear does it go he asked in wonder sure it goes said jack lets show him how it goes keith filled the little tank with a drain of petrol inverted the model to prime the carburettor and flicked it into life with his thumb the pea bulb lit the note steadied as the governor came into action and the model ran on steadily gee said captain petersen quietly i never saw anything like it he sat watching the model deep in thought he was one of the few people of the west coast of america who knew anything about sol hirzhorns secret hobby his wifes youngest sister was engaged to a boy called pete horner who worked in a minor capacity upon the maintenance of the hirzhorn executive aircraft at the seattletacoma airport pete had actually worked upon the installation of the machine tools in the basement workshop of sol hirzhorns home at wauna and he had made several visits to the house since then to service minor defects or to take in stocks of materials he had been warned not to talk about these matters because mr hirzhorn valued his privacy but inevitably he had told his girl about these visits to the hirzhorn home and so they had become known in the family captain petersen had heard that sol hirzhorn in his later years had taken to making small engines and clocks in the privacy of a fabulous workshop in his home he had paid little attention to the rumour but now it came back to his mind most forcibly he watched the little motor till it ran out of fuel and came to a standstill say he remarked isnt that just dandy i never saw anything like it is that right that you designed it all yourself and made it keith nodded its what i do he said a little apologetically i make things like this and write about them in a magazine in a magazine he nodded the miniature mechanic its an english magazine he reached over to the foot of the bunk and opened his suitcase rummaged in it and produced a couple of copies of the little magazine this is it he said he gave one copy to the captain who examined it with interest and leafed the other through himself this is the serial ive just finished now he observed how to make a congreve clock a congreve clock captain petersen was puzzled its a clock that keeps time by a steel ball running on a zigzag track down an inclined plane keith told him only it doesnt keep very good time it takes thirty seconds for the ball to run down one way then the plane tilts and it runs back again its quite fascinating to watch look theres a picture of it here thats the one i made captain petersen examined it with interest you make these things and then write about them telling other people how to do it thats right the captain glanced at the date of the issue it was only six weeks old does this come weekly he asked keith nodded does it circulate in the united states i dont think you can buy it on the bookstalls keith told him a good many copies thousands i believe go to the states by post to subscribers the captain sat in thought two days before he had left home in midlake to come upon this cruise yvonne had brought pete horner in to supper some time in the evening pete had mentioned that sol hirzhorn had started to build some kind of a clock there had been an order for planished brass sheet five thirtysecondths thick that he had had to chase all round seattle for and take out to wauna he raised his head and looked at keith say he remarked would you by any chance know a man called sol hirzhorn in the hot cabin of the mary belle with the strong scent of vanilla all around them and copra beetles everywhere keiths mind went back to baling nearly ioooo miles away to the long hours spent after katie had gone to bed answering the correspondence in his dirty workshop in the basement with janice sleeping in the room next door converted from a scullery ive had some letters from a solomon p hirzhorn he said thoughtfully lives somewhere in washington thats the capital isnt it somewhere south of new york thats washington dc the captain told him sol hirzhorn lives in the state of washington in the northwest i live there myself do you know anything about sol hirzhorn keith smiled hes got a secretary with an electric typewriter he said i should imagine he dictates to her from the length of his letters hes building one of my congreve clocks following the serial and hes not very experienced so he writes me a lot of letters all of which need answering you answer them the captain asked oh yes if people cant understand the serial and take the trouble to write to me about it i always send them an answer you must have quite a correspondence said the captain i have said keith with feeling captain petersen sat in silence for a moment i see ill have to start and tell you things he said at last the first is this sol hirzhorn might be one of the wealthiest men in the united states i wouldnt know about that what i do know is that hes the biggest noise around our parts keith stared at him what does he do lumber said the captain hes the biggest lumberman on the west coast he started off from scratch working in the woods like any other guy id say hes close on seventy years old now and his sons have taken over the executive side of the business its a family concern god knows how many mills they have or how many forests they control id simply be guessing if i tried to tell you how many hands they employ in washington and oregon but its an awful lot theyre quite a family the old man solomon p hirzhorn hes the one thats making my clock thats right he thinks an awful lot of you mr stewart he got all het up about the risk that you were taking sailing from honolulu to tahiti in a fishing boat keiths jaw dropped how on earth did he hear about me being here at all the captain smiled i wouldnt know he wants you to go visit with him for a day or so on your way back to england n help him with his clock i suppose anyway he wants to meet you id be very glad to meet him said the engineer that clocks quite a tricky piece of work for somebody whos not very experienced but how did he know i was here the captain leaned forward see here mr stewart he said guys at the head of a big business with plenty of money and plenty of contacts all over the world anything they want to get to know about they get to know now thats a fact i dont know how sol hirzhorn got to know that you were here but i do know this he paused hes pretty well out of the business now he only goes to the head office in tacoma two or three times a week they tell me other days he might fly out and visit one of the mills or else fly in the helicopter to one of the clearings where theyre cutting he dont work much most of what work he does he does at home hes got his granddaughter working for him as a secretary a girl called julie perlberg but i tell you mr stewart theres not a cat kittens in the state of washington but those two know about it keith said weakly i never knew that he was anything like that i thought he was the ordinary sort of man who makes models in the evenings like a dentist or a bank manager captain petersen nodded i guess you did you made yourself a good friend when you answered all his letters he got real worried about you coming down this way of course he remarked he knows why you came he knows all about your sister and the wreck of the shearwater for gods sake said keith theres one more thing ill have to tell you said captain petersen evenly and thats why im here my boss is chuck ferris of ferris hydraulics cincinnati mr hirzhorn got so worried about you that he borrowed the flying cloud from mr ferris to put her at your disposal my instructions on leaving honolulu were to find you wherever you were and put the ship under your orders to take you to your sisters grave on marokota island and anywhere else you want to go after that if youre going back to england mr hirzhorn suggested i might take you to seattle in the flying cloud in order that you might visit him for a day or two and help him with his clock he paused i guess this is where i start to say sir when i speak to you mr stewart keith stared at him dazed but thats fantastic it may seem so to you it did to me at first captain petersen admitted but id say the way to look at it is this you took a lot of trouble answering letters from a stranger and maybe some of them were rather stupid questions i wouldnt know the fact is that you made a friend and now this friends going to a little bit of trouble to help you thats fair enough look at it that way keith sat in silence for a minute could you take me to marokota he asked at last sure take us about four days to get there spend as long as you like would i get a permit from the governor to go to marokota i mean after all this trouble captain petersen said forget it we took the governor to borabora one time ive been to the tuamotus six or seven times with the flying cloud romantic coral islands thats what a party always wants to see lousy dangerous places i wouldnt want any part of them youll see more grass skirts in honolulu than ever youll see in the tuamotus but sure we can go there it wouldnt be any danger to the ship the captain shook his head not a bit id take a pilot from here somebody who knows the islands theres no lagoon at marokota that would take the flying cloud wed have to lie off under the lee and send you in with the launch but theres no difficulty about it is it inhabited probably not its got a few palms on it coconuts i think they come over from kautaiva in the copra season gather the nuts i dont think anybody lives there permanently do you think i could get a headstone for the grave made here and take it with us why yes theres a chinese stonemason in the town does that kind of work would that take long a day maybe suppose we get on shore before so long and give the order tonight hed have it finished by tomorrow night how much would that cost i wouldnt know youd have to argue that one out with mr ferris and mr hirzhorn he turned to keith see here mr stewart sir i know the way youre fixed mr hirzhorn knows that too i got a radio from mr ferns that all expenses of whatever nature go on the ship ill give you an account of what you might call personal expenses when you leave the ship and you can settle it with them he paused reflectively you might have quite a job they went up on deck and he hailed the launch i got a cabin ready foryou mr stewart he said when will you be moving in ill stay here tonight said keith ive got a lot of things to fix up with jack would it be all right if i come on board tomorrow sure said the captain til be moving in to the quay tomorrow well need water and top up with diesel fuel come aboard any time you say the launch came alongside he turned to jack donelly how would it be if we give you a pluck in to the quay right now captain suits me said jack say would there be any place where i could get a sack of cornmeal here weve run out captain petersen thought for a minute lim hung foo he said hes your best chance hes a marine store nearly opposite your berth but he sells everything i think he might have it half an hour later the mary belle was berthed again sternon to the quay with the chef du port smiling all over his face and keith was walking up with captain petersen to see the chinese stonemason he printed the simple inscription on the back of an envelope the old stonemason took it and read it carefully letter by letter understand he said parfaitement demain le soir will be finished they walked back to the quay and met jack donelly on the way to his ship carrying an enormous sack of cornmeal on his back as though it had been a feather bit coarser n the last sack he said i like it that way and not a maggot in it thatll be a change said keith good thing we saved some maggots from the last sack jack said practically else we wouldnt have no bait a bit of fish goes good with cornmeal fritters keith arranged with captain petersen that he would move into the flying cloud when she berthed in the morning the captain got into his launch and went off to the schooner and keith went on board the mary belle with jack after depositing the sack of cornmeal in the forecastle jack came and stood in the hatch looking at the big yacht at the mooring buoy captain petersen he didnt say nothing about that redhead coming ashore tonight did he keith laughed no he didnt i dont even know if shes on board she probably stayed in honolulu shes on board said his captain positively i seen her keith had expected him to have bought a bottle of whisky with the sack of cornmeal but he did not seem to have done so alcohol was not his major weakness to take his mind off other matters keith went below and started up the little generator set and with the noise of the engine jack joined him at once and sat looking at it entranced smallest in the world he breathed captain petersen he liked it fine but then hes a seaman he handled that schooner beautiful coming up to the buoy just beautiful i never seen it done better stands to reason that he knows a thing or two he knows when somethings worth looking at smallest in the world presently keith said til be leaving you tomorrow jack you heard what he said ill be moving into the flying cloud in the morning fine ship said jack you make him learn you how to sail her like i learned you how to sail the maty belle til be sorry to leave you keith said where will you go now i guess ill head for huahine over to the west aint it shows on them charts of yours thats right its only about a hundred miles away a little bit west of northwest on the compass he paused til leave you the charts they might come in handy say thanks the captain took them gingerly these things take a bit of understanding he remarked just show me where it says huahine there oh i see he pointed to the compass rose upon the chart is that what tells you which way to go thats right see a little bit west of northwest he traced the course with his finger they dont put that on the atlas jack observed wonderful the way they think of things aint it something new each year he rolled up the charts presently and put them away theres one more thing said keith ill be moving out tomorrow wed better do some settling up whats that asked jack you remember i was going to pay you a hundred dollars for the passage when we talked about it in honolulu well then there was the cost of the food thats right said his captain you bought all the chow except the cornmeal which was mostly maggots anyway which didnt cost me nothing that squares it off keith said patiently the chow didnt cost a hundred dollars most of it came from the cathay princess at english wholesale prices theres a good bit owing to you aw forget it said his captain you sailed the ship half the time i didnt pay you no wages keith stared at him helplessly he knew better than to cross this man thats not right he said we agreed id pay a hundred dollars for the passage the food came to about forty dollars theres about sixty dollars due to you i got plenty to be going on with said jack i got forty fifty dollars to get back out of that bank tomorrow id like to pay you what we said said keith honestly i would okay said his captain amiably you pay me sixty dollars when the bank let go of it then i pay you seamans wage sixty dollars a month and keep you give it me if you can get it from that bank n i give it back to you then well be all square his mind was made up and there was no use arguing with him keith had had this before i tell you one thing he said presently til leave the little generator set here in the mary belle jack stared at him leave that here with me thats right this ship hasnt got a motor she ought to have one gee mr keats i couldnt take that i wont want it jack id like you to have it he did not have much difficulty in persuading his captain to accept it the big man held it reverently in his great hand smallest in the world he breathed say i wonder what theyre going to think of this in huahine keith glanced at the bottle which was practically empty ill get another bottle of petrol tomorrow sometime and some lubricating oil and a little oilcan then youll be all fixed up they slept presently and in the morning keith spent a couple of hours cleaning up the ship which certainly needed it then he went up to the bank with jack donelly and somewhat to his surprise they were both repaid their dollars in full he was not to know that captain petersen had been active in the city before him in the bank he went through the ceremony of paving jack donelly sixty dollars for his passage and jack counted it out carefully and paid it back to him as wages they then went back to the mary belle and keith picked up his suitcase til be back on board this afternoon he said ill bring that bottle of petrol and the oilcan he set off carrying his suitcase towards the flying cloud now moored at the grand quai taking on water by a hose a whiteclad sailor from the yacht came hurrying to meet him and took the suitcase from him he walked down the gangway on to the deck of the flying cloud an incongruous figure perspiring in his rather inexpensive blue suit purchased in baling and suitable for the english climate captain petersen came out of the wheelhouse and welcomed him aboard ill show you your cabin he said its the one that mr ferris uses normally with a private bath i think youll find it comfortable in the luxury of the cabin keith said diffidently i think ill have to get something lighter to wear tropical clothes of some kind this suits too hot altogether and i cant go round this ship in a pair of bathing trunks like i did with jack donelly lots of them do that remarked captain petersen youd be surprised middleaged women too in not much more he glanced at the blue suit that suit will be fine for tacoma in the winter and well probably be there before so long clothes are a problem on this kind of trip he opened the door of a big wardrobe say mr ferris he leaves quite a bit of stuff on board and youre much the same build id pull out some of these suits see if they will fit you before buying anything its not worth it just for a few days keith glanced at the array of gleaming dacron and silk tropical suits the white neckties the white shoes are you sure that will be all right he asked the captain nodded sure ill get everything washed and cleaned before he comes again hed want you to have the use of the things and theres no sense in buying anything he left keith in the cabin he had a very welcome shower his first for a month and dressed in the soft linen and the light hotweather grey suit of a wealthy american he went out a little selfconsciously and up into the deck lounge where he ran into the thirtyyearold redheaded woman that he knew as mrs efstathios she got up to welcome him say she said you must be mr keith stewart ive heard such a lot about you my names dawn ferris and my pop owns this ship he never uses it but he just likes to have it around arent those his clothes youre wearing keith was embarrassed i hope its all right he said captain petersen told me it would be she laughed sure everyone that comes on board uses pops clothes hes never here to use them himself say i remember when you came aboard in honolulu only i didnt know who you were then when did you arrive here we got in the day before you the day before yesterday you must have made a quick trip we didnt waste any time mr hirzhorn he got really worried about you going in that little boat without any motor or anything say that big ape who caroeori board with you forget his name is he here too jack donelly oh yes hes here the mary belles moored farther up the quay that way you cant mistake her j shes the only boat thats got tanned sails is that so i got some shopping to do presently ill take a look and see captain petersen was saying wed be leaving in the morning for the tuamotus keith nodded ive got to go there to see about my sisters grave id like to leave as soon as the headstones finished thats supposed to be tonight will you be coming with us she said well now i dont know ive seen the tuamotus so many times and it seems like this would be a kind of private party the captain says hell have to come back here anyway to bring the pilot back before leaving for seattle i was thinking maybe id move into the hotel for three or four days while youre away and explore the island i should think that would be very interesting said keith it might be she said doubtfully they all speak french here and i dont which makes things kind of complicated they chatted together for a little in the deck saloon then she said time i went on shore if im going say if im not back on board for lunch tell the captain not to wait if i find a decent looking restaurant that can understand what im saying ill eat there she picked up a broadbrimmed sun hat with a gaudy ribbon and went off and up the gangway to the quay keith went out on deck and started to explore the polished cleanness of the ship an entrancing occupation the boatswain found him and showed him the anchor winch forward and the winches at the foot of each mast all hydraulic from a central power generator in the engine room he said proudly used to be manual except the anchor winch which was a great big electric cow of a thing when mr ferris bought the ship first thing he did was rip all that lot out and send down his engineers from cincinnati to make a proper job of her shes all hydraulic now steering and all ferris hydraulics keith was very interested indeed and spent some time examining the winches and their reduction gears which evoked his admiration for their clean and efficient design from the deck the boatswain passed him on to the chief engineer who took him down into the spotless engine room to show him the power generator the main diesel and the standby diesel he spent an hour of sheer delight down there and was finally discovered there by the steward telling him that lunch was ready he had spent the morning with machinery so clean that he hardly had to wash his hands he sat down happily to lunch with captain petersen and gave him the message from mrs efstathios on shore dawn ferris wandered through the town looked unintelligently at the big cathedral wandered back to the waterfront and looked at the french frigate with the sailors with red pompoms on their naval caps and wandered along the quay looking vaguely for a restaurant past rows of native fishing boats and yachts near the end of the row she came upon the mary belle which she recognized by the tanned sails jack donelly was sitting on the foredeck with his legs dangling over the side fishing with a handline a little pile of small silvery fish lay on the deck beside him he did not believe in buying food when there was food in the sea he wore a pair of old blue jeans and nothing else with his deeply bronzed torso he was a fine figure of a man dawn stopped and said hullo big boy jack looked up replied hullo and went on fishing she asked what are you catching he jerked a little fish out of the water and added it to the pile these are they good to eat i guess so they look all right are you having them for dinner the conversation was taking his mind off fish but anyway he had enough enough maybe for two i guess so he said fish fried with cornmeal fritters are good chow she was suddenly weary of the sophisticated meals on board the flying cloud and she had difficulty in understanding the french writing on the restaurant menus cornmeal fritters he raised his head say can you cook cornmeal fritters can i cook cornmeal fritters try me and see he got to his feet an amiable giant about six feet four in height in his bare feet all bronzed come on down n lets see how you can do it ill fetch the sack aft into the cabin in the flying cloud keith stewart was enjoying his first civilized meal for a month not altogether sorry to be relieved of the somewhat monotonous diet of the mary belle over lunch he told captain petersen that he had given the little generator set to jack donelly in lieu of passage money hes a nice kind of guy said the captain he may not know much navigation but he seems to get from a to b without it did you help him much upon the way keith shook his head i learned to take a noon sight for latitude the officers of the cathay princess taught me but the course was only a point or two east of south and there was never much more than a hundred miles difference between my sight and his dead reckoning hed have got here perfectly all right without my sights the captain laughed takes us all down a peg or two its wonderful the way they do it hepaused make a good boatswain he said thoughtfully id rather have him in the ship than some of the ones we got he sat smoking with the captain for a time and then went on shore and bought a little oilcan at a hardware store with an empty bottle and took them to a filling station to get filled with petrol and oil with these in hand he walked along the quay to the mary belle jack donelly was sitting in his blue jeans in the companion looking at peace with the world and very pleased with himself keith went down the gangplank to the aft deck and stepped over the tiller i brought the gas and oil for the little motor he said he showed them to the captain gee thats real nice said jack right kind o gas and right kind of oil keith nodded jack was very pleased everything in the world was rosy thatll keep her going a long time til just take them down and put them on the shelf said keith then youll be all set jack did not move his big frame from the companion dont go down just yet he said in a low tone but distinctly wait while she gets her dress on keith stared at him in horror wait while who gets her dress on the redheadjack informed him some foreign name i forget but she dont talk foreign he added thoughtfully or act foreign either he broke into a happy smile keith thought only of escape from this situation he thrust the bottle of gas and the oilcan into jack donellys hands here take these he said ill come over and see you later okay said jack phlegmatically be seeing you friends and women he knew never really mixed keith fled up the gangplank and walked rapidly away up the quay towards the flying cloud on deck he passed captain petersen and said something incoherent about going to lie down in his cabin and went and hid himself below his first instinct was to keep well out of sight and avoid a meeting with dawn ferris whatever her problem was he didnt want to get mixed up in it he lay on his bunk petrified with terror waiting for the storm to break till the steward tapped on the door and entered at about five oclock captain says hes sending up a boy with a hand truck to fetch the gravestone he said he wanted to know if youd like to walk up with him see the stone before it leaves the yard he ought to do that apparently the storm hadnt broken yet tell the captain ill be with him in a minute he said ill just put on my shoes as he sponged his face he thought of the gravestone and of jo his sister and he thought of how she would have laughed for her sense of humour had been broad he was smiling a little furtively himself as he left the cabin to meet the captain up on deck as they strolled up the hill tie asked casually is miss ferris coming with us to marokota not this time said captain petersen shes seen it all before she packed two suitcases and moved into the hotel while you were resting well pick her up when we come back here with the pilot thursday or friday she wont be on board for supper i dont think so she said not to disturb you but just tell you hullo till friday they walked into the stonemasons yard the stone lay upon the bench all ready for delivery a slab of purple coloured slate engraved with the simple inscription that he had chosen he passed his hand over it when he had done this for jo and seen it erected there was no more that he could do for her except to look after janice he would see this stone set up above the grave and then he would go away it was very unlikely that he would come back to see it again still it was something to have got this far when he had walked out of mr carpenters office in bedford square he had intended to try to make it but had never really thought he would succeed the captain was talking to the old chinese stonemason who was drawing a little diagram for him upon the back of an envelope to show him how to set up a gravestone so that it would not fall over as the years went by he arranged that the boy with the handtruck should bring a bag of cement down with the gravestone to the ship that evening and he paid the stonemason in american dollars to his great content then they were walking down the hill again towards the quay in the soft tropical dusk through the myriad evening smells of papeete on deck the captain turned to him i never drink at sea myself or in harbour before sunset but this is after sunset sir he smiled would you join me in a highball keith wasnt quite sure what a highball was but he appreciated the offer have you got any beer he asked diffidently sure weve got beer weve got pretty near every kind of liquor in this ship weve got dark beer and weve got a kind of lager beer it was still hot in the harbour and keith chose the lager they sat down in the long canvas chairs on the aft deck and the steward brought them iced beer and rye on the rocks presently keith asked what time are we going off in the morning i any time you say captain petersen replied have you got any more to do on shore no id like to get away as soon as possible before the dawn ferris storm blew up he thought he found it impossible to imagine what was going to happen to jack donelly or himself if he were to complete his mission to marokota however the sooner he put a considerable distance between dawn ferris and himself the better sail tonight if you like he said ive got it all fixed for tomorrow morning first thing said captain petersen hands to breakfast at six pilot on board at seven and get under way then we have breakfast about half past eight when weve got sail set and all clear a sudden thought struck him would you be likely to feel sick we could have breakfast here any time you say and get under way after i shant feel sick said keith not after a month in the mary belle with jack donelly at least i dont think so no that would suit me fine he spent that evening with the captain dining with him quietly in the big saloon sitting with him on deck in the vanillascented tropical night watching the reflections on the water he heard a good deal about captain petersens family and home at midlake and the captain heard a good deal about keiths home in baling and about katie and about janice and about the wreck of shearwater captain petersen had already picked up local information about that in papeete they had bad luck mr stewart he said simply when that hurricane blew up they were in just the worst possible position they could be in with no sea room for the change of wind he sat in thought for a minute i believe in that position id have turned right round and headed back to the southeast with the engine at full power and chance it turning south before it got to me i think that might have been a better bet but its hard to say but anyway theyd only got a little motor hadnt they keith nodded thats another thing he said from what i hear the motor was taken on shore from the wreck and covered up its probably worth something if i could get it back to england i could work on it myself and recondition it do you think we could get it on board and take it with us to seattle and ship it home captain petersen considered the matter we cant berth there to get it on board he said weve got to lay offshore while youre on the island and send the launch into the lagoon it wont be much good now you know not after being in the sea im not so sure said keith things like that often look a fearful mess with external damage and corrosion but when you strip them down theyre not so bad its got wet liners to the cylinders so theyre replaceable quite easily in england new pistons and liners and a coat of paint it might fetch a couple of hundred quid by the time ive done with it he paused enough to pay my passage back to england he said smiling oh sure it was difficult to keep remembering that this intelligent little man who had travelled half across the world and who was thought of so highly by so many influential people had practically no money at all how much do you think it would weigh he asked three or four hundred pounds i shouldnt think it could be more the captain nodded i should think thats about it we can do that mr stewart if thats what you want id beach the launch in the lagoon then wed need six or eight hands ashore and some baulks of timber get it in the launch and rig a wire strop round it he thought for a minute bring it off to the ship thats easy then to get it on board from the launch to the ship in the open sea he thought deeply id make up special coir bolsters four of them pretty thick and about eight feet long for the launch to ride against while we lift the motor on board with the launch derrick thatll be okay we can fix that for you mr stewart there wouldnt be any risk of damage would there only paintwork at the most he thought again we can fix that when we come back into harbour here at papeete before sailing for seattle get some planks when we get back here too and knock up a packing case for it so itll be all ready to ship back to england from seattle that would be fine said keith id give it a bit of first aid before closing up the case wash it well out with fresh water crankcase cylinders and all and leave it to dry in the sun and wind then pour a lot of oil into each cylinder and fill the crankcase up with oil i dont think shell have come to much harm maybe were too apt to scrap things in the states said captain petersen the engineers can lend a hand with that they sat in silence for a time theres just one other thing said keith marokota is uninhabited at this time of year isnt it so they tell me said the captain theres no regular settlement upon it the people come there every now and then to pick up the nuts but they make the copra upon kautaiva they happened to be there when shearwater got wrecked but of course they couldnt do anything i know he hesitated would it be very difficult for me to spend twentyfour hours alone upon the island after weve set up the gravestone the captain turned his head theres no difficulty in that from my point of view if thats what you want to do we shall be standing off and on offshore we can do that for a week if needs be but theres nothing there you know i dont know even if theres any water i could take that with me with some sandwiches he turned to the captain i dont suppose ill ever come back here again he said simply i dont suppose that janice jos daughter whos going to live with us i dont suppose shell ever come here i want to take a lot of photos an awful lot of photos from all kinds of angles and thatll air take time id rather not be hurried by having other people about id like to have your little rowing boat and go out to the wreck and take some photos of that and well she was my only sister id just like to be there alone for a bit sure said captain petersen a little huskily ill get a pack made up for you blankets it could be cold at night beer water sandwiches what we could do is go in in the launch with the gravestone towing the dinghy behind set up the gravestone and leave you with the dinghy go back to the ship then come off again next day and load up the engine into the launch and pick you up how would that be that would be grand said keith i could make a good inspection of the engine in an hour or so and decide if its worth taking back to england if the engine room could let me have a few spanners it might help sure you got plenty of film keith nodded ive got three new rolls over a hundred exposures i got them here today ill be all right for film he went to bed soon after that and slept soundly in chuck ferris cabin the first night that he had had in comfort for about a month he wondered as he went to sleep about dawn ferris no complaint had come from her or if it had captain petersen had not told him perhaps the omnipotence of sol hirzhorn could protect him even against that in any case apparently they were leaving in the morning he must take things as they came he slept he was roused by the bustle on the decks at dawn had a shower and dressed in an opennecked shirt and slacks and went up on deck the steward found him and brought him coffee and biscuits and he stayed on the aft deck out of the way of the seamen watching the processes of getting the ship to sea it was all very different from the mary belle a matter of ordered movement controlled by an occasional whistle from the boatswain the pilot came on board darkskinned and frenchspeaking and was welcomed by the captain then the main diesel started below his feet with a rumble that steadied to an even purr the springs were taken aboard bow and stern lines singled up and brought back on board by a harbour boat captain petersen moved into the wheelhouse the stern lines were cast off the engineroom telegraph bell sounded and the flying cloud moved forward from her berth into the main waters of the harbour she turned and made for the entrance hoisting the mainsail as she went followed by the foresail and the mizzen causing keith to retreat into the deck saloon from tahiti to the tuamotus is a dead beat into the easterly trade wind at that time of year captain petersen put his vessel under all plain sail and kept his engine going hard taking in the mainsail for the hours of darkness the distance to marokota is about miles and it took them four days of hard slogging against the wind a restful and invigorating four days for keith he learned a good deal about the management of a large schooner yacht and took the helm for several spells to the interest and amusement of the captain he found that sailing the big schooner was not very different from the sailing of the mary belle once you had got accustomed to the wheel instead of tiller and the size of her and the speed they were approaching marokota island on the evening of the fourth day captain petersen hove to at sunset unwilling to venture in among the reefs in the hours of darkness and they lay hove to all night with the engine stopped so that they could hear breakers but with an engineer on watch ready to start up if necessary with the first light they got under way again and by ten oclock they were hove to under the lee of the island on the west side of the encircling reef captain petersen stood at the door of the deckhouse staring at the reef through glasses he lowered them and handed them to keith thats the wreck he said she went on from this side just past that grey coral where you see those timbers sticking up that must be shearwater keith stared at the timbers washed by the sea it seemed incredible that this should be all that remained of the yacht that he had been on board in the hamble river only six or seven months before he lowered the glasses would i be able to get near her from the other side he asked the captain lifted the glasses again i should think so in the dinghy its on the lee side of the island so theres not much sea he lowered the glasses it looks quite calm in the lagoon he hesitated for a moment like me to come with you in the dinghy keith shook his head id rather be alone okay they rigged the launch derrick put the coir bolsters over the lee side and steadying the big launch with guy ropes watched their opportunity and put her in the waterthey lowered the gravestone cased in a wooden frame into the launch with the sack of cement a breaker of water a pick and a couple of shovels then they lowered down keiths pack for the night and dropped the tenfoot dinghy into the sea with a small davit the captain got down into the launch with keith four seamen joined them and the launch cast off and made for the narrow passage through the reef into the lagoon towing the dinghy behind the chief engineer leaned upon the rail with the second watching the boats as they went in to the shore if he comes off with that engine in the morning well have to carry it on deck he said get sammy to lash a tarp down on the deck somewhere there he jerked his head dont want to get the deck messed up with oil and rust okay said the second ill see sammy beats me what he wants with all those tools going to examine it he said see if its worth salving with a hammer and cold chisel and a hacksaw loosen off the nuts that got rusted up or cut them off thats what he said the second turned from the rail shouldnt think the engine would be worth the salving after treating it like that in the sunset keith stewart sat alone a little distance from the grave he had done all that he had to do and he had taken a good many photographs of the grave the island and the wreck out on the reef he had turned the motor on its side and he had taken off the sump cleaned out the interf ior and put it back again replacing all the bolts and screwing them up tight darkness was approaching and he had finished all the major jobs he sat eating his sandwiches upon the beach and drinking his beer in the morning he would take a few more photographs and then he would be ready to return to england the gravestone stood erect behind him set in a wide box of semiliquid concrete stayed upright with ropes to pegs driven into the coral sand they would leave it so the concrete would set into a solid mass when they had gone the ropes would slacken off and rot away in time but the stone would stay erect to mark the grave with its simple inscription to be read by any who should come to marokota he finished his meal and sat looking out over the tropic sea in the fading light a little sadly this was the end of it this was the end of something that had begun in a slum street of renfrew near to glasgow on the far side of the world through the joys and tears of childhood the tiller girls john dermott and the naval life and janice who could have thought that it would all end here on an uninhabited island in the pacific ocean he got to his feet and moved over to the grave he took the steel egg from his pocket the grey casehardened egg that he had made for janice back in baling on the evening he had told her of her mothers death jo he said quietly this is one of the eggs i made for janice to go with the duck its the only thing ive got of hers to leave with you and jo ill do my best he scraped a little hole before the gravestone and buried the egg in the sand chapter ten the flying cloud sailed back into the harbour of papeete three days later having made the voyage downwind under sail alone for much of the time keith stewart had been working on the engine secured on deck upon a tarpaulin assisted by one or other of the engineers they had removed the cylinder head and washed out the cylinders with fresh water and had hosed out the crankcase keith rejecting a proposal that they should take off the sump again as being quite unnecessary they had dismantled the magneto in the engine room and discovered that all that it required was a new contact breaker they had assembled everything again and filled the crankcase and the cylinders with oil by the time they sailed into the harbour the engine was ready for crating for shipment to england they approached the harbour in the late afternoon in the wheelhouse keith asked captain petersen how long will we be here you got anything you want to do no the sooner i start home the better the captain nodded its too late to go into the quay now itll be dark if theres a buoy to spare ill lie on that for the night go into the quay first thing in the morning well want to top up with diesel oil and water and a few stores get some planks and timber for the packing case put a little paint on the ships topsides where the coir mats rubbed pick up miss ferris get a bill of health and clearance and send a radiogram to cincinnati it ought not to take us longer than a day id say that well be on our way day after tomorrow keith nodded say goodbye to jack donelly sure see if you can find out where hes heading for and if we can do anything they sailed into the harbour before sunset with the motor ticking over and rounded up to a vacant buoy when the bustle of mooring and stowing sail had subsided a little the captain came aft to find keith on the aftdeck with the glasses in his hand funny he said i cant see the mary belle anywhere shes not in the place where she was the captain scanned the shoreline and the moored vessels then took the glasses from him and searched with them shes not there he said positively at last he must have sailed someplace keith was disappointed i didnt think hed have done that i wanted to thank him and to say goodbye maybe hes gone out fishing be back tomorrow said the captain the men were putting the launch into the water with the derrick guess ill go ashore and take the pilot said the captain see the chef du port and tell miss ferris that were back you like to come along they went in in the launch and stepped out on to the concrete steps that led to the customs house quay here they said goodbye to the pilot and shook hands with him he went off up an alley in the dusk there was a light on in the office of the chef du port and they went in the chef was still there and he got up to greet them well were back monsieur said captain petersen he offered cigarettes and lit them for the chef and keith were at the buoy right now but tomorrow id like to move in to the quay certainement said the chef tomorrow at what hour eight oclock the chef made a note upon his pad and they went on to discuss the refuelling of the flying cloud and her clearance for seattle a quarter of an hour later business concluded the captain asked casually whats happened to the mary belle she has depart the chef said sailed sailed where for the chef shrugged his shoulders who can say native boats they do not need clearance they come they go some say huahine but that i do not know in the lies sous le vent anywhere raiatea tahaa borabora anywhere perhaps even to samoa in the end that one he makes long voyages they stared at him i didnt think hed have gone off like that before we got back said the captain the chef shrugged his shoulders then he glanced at captain petersen a glint of humour in his eye we have many years been friends he said and we have laughed together i hope you will laugh now he hesitated he took a passenger a terrible thought occurred to captain petersen who was that a lady from your ship mademoiselle ferris avec la tlte chdtaine the captain stared at him aghast for the lords sake he said quietly well what do you know the more i see of women the less i know replied the chef du port at my age it is better to stick to wine when did they sail asked the captain two days after you replied the chef one night only she stayed at the hotel then she moved into the boat they bought many chases de cuisine then they sailed the next day over to the west on a westward course that is true they stood in silence for a minute then the captain turned to keith i guess this is just a bit outside my pro j vince he said ill have to put this to chuck ferris in a radiogram where do we go from here he stood conning the words over its going to be a mighty long one too they left the chef du port and went up to the hotel hoping to find that dawn ferris had left a suitcase there indicating an early return the captain went in to inquire at the desk and came out in a minute or two no suitcase and no note he said shortly too bad he led the way to the bureau des postes et telegraphes the office was closed but there was a light inside and he hammered on the door a halfcaste clerk came at last and told him that the office was closed a mille changed hands and opened it and the captain stood in worried thought writing three pages of a radiogram to his employer he made a copy paid the charge and went out into the dark vanillascented street with keith i dont know what we do now he said worried go back on board sit down and have a drink said keith i guess that makes sense they walked back in silence to the steps hailed the motor launch and went off to the schooner in her on the aftdeck the captain rang for the steward ordered the evening drinks and they sat down in the long chairs in the warmth of the tropic night looking at the lights reflected in the dark waters of the harbour at last the captain broke the silence if id thought a million years he said id never have thought of this one i would said keith knowing jack donelly i guess you know him better than i do they drank then keith asked has she ever done this sort of thing before i wouldnt know well yes id say she must have done shes been married three times there must have been incidents what did her husbands do i think the first one was a college boy in cincinnati he went into real estate the second was a rancher somewhere near helena idaho that lasted quite a while she had two children but i guess the country got her down then there i was efstathios but that didnt last long what did he do oriental rugs and carpets in new york city they called k him count efstathios but i dont think he was a count at all nice chap small guy with black hair and a little black moustache aid captain petersen noncommittally good dancer i d say he wore brown patentleather shoes i never saw shoes like that before he paused they didnt go with the ship he said keith laughed and now its jack donelly well hed go with the ship berthing with the seamen said the captain but i dont know the rancher gort or grant some name like that he was a great guy and pretty dumb maybe thats the way she likes them after all they sat in silence for a time what worries me the captain said at last is where do we go from here my last orders were to sail for seattle taking you along to meet mr hirzhorn well thats right the opposite way to huahine and borabora and theres hundreds of islands down that way all the way through samoa and tonga to fiji and new caledonia he paused and took a drink if im supposed to go and look for her he said it could take the best part of a year and what about you dont worry about me said keith i could get back from here some other way i do worry about you said the captain practically ive got a home at midlake just outside seattle and i want to see my wife and kids im not losing any sleep over dawn he paused reflectively i bet she is there wasnt much that they could do about it except to await an answer to the captains radiogram they sat in the warm darkness drinking rather more than usual in their perplexity and then went down to dinner they came up on deck again later and sat in the long chairs on the aftdeck smoking chuck ferris cigars till it was time for bed keith went down and slept well a little amused but captain petersen spent a bad night they moved into the quay next morning and began to take on diesel oil and water in the middle of the morning a radiogram arrived in answer from mr ferris it was refreshingly direct kingsize deal pending with sol htrzhorn so immediately for seattle bringing stewart along stop keep contact with rockawjn and be sure advise him date arrival time and berth stop you werent hired to monitor dawns lovelife but appreciate your concern leave her settle it her own way stop am arranging credit for her with the bank of indochina papeete suggest you tell harbourmaster ask him to inform her as opportunity occurs ferris the captain showed this telegram to keith who read it with interest well thats the way it is petersen said we kiss dawn goodbye and she goes sailing out into the far blue yonder with jack donelly he stood for a minute in thought i guess ill go on shore and take the chef to lunch n show him this he said its time chuck ferris gave a bit more to the orphelines anyway keith asked whats this about the kingsized deal with sol hirzhorn am i in on that i wouldnt know said captain petersen maybe i ought not to have shown you that he paused one thing he said sol hirzhorns getting an old man but he still owns the business its quite clear that he thinks a lot of you as an engineer my boss chuck ferris he sells engineering maybe sol hirzhorns looking to you for a fresh mind on his problem whatever that is maybe chuck ferris knows it i wouldnt know its just an idea i ot i see said keith thoughtfully anyway said the captain briskly we sail for seattle in the morning how long will that take about three weeks its quite a way from here will we be going into honolulu the captain shook his head ill have to do some figuring this afternoon but i can tell you right now what the answer will be north from here until were clear of the tuamotus at mataiva then make all the easterly we can while were in the southeast trades cross the line about longitude maybe then a thousand or twelve hundred miles of beating up against the northeast trades tracking due north if were lucky after that gales and fog and rain and radio bearings to cape flattery all kinds of rough stuff then home and a few days skiing on the spring snow just lead me to it he went on shore to lunch with the chef du port alone and to get the necessary clearances keith lunched alone in the saloon and strolled along the quays he bought a tinted coral necklace for janice and a bracelet of polished beans and shells for katie souvenirs of his travels that did not cost too much because he still had no idea how he was to get back to baling from seattle the one thing that seemed clear to him was that he hadnt got enough money for the fare however he might travel still he was getting a good lift on the homeward track by going in the flying cloud to seattle he was not very worried now about the homeward journey one way or another he would make it twenty days later the flying cloud entered the juan de fuca strait in a rainstorm at about ten oclock in the morning running into relatively sheltered water before a strong westerly wind they drove in with the mizzen furled the mainsail closereefed and the fore topsails doing most of the work an engineer on watch beside the motionless diesel they passed by radio bearings about four miles north of cape flattery and never saw it and carried on down the strait all day gradually coming into calmer water on deck they carried the engine from shearwater in a packing case constructed in the first days of the voyage one side secured by screws for the benefit of customs lashed down on deck beneath two thicknesses of tarpaulin in the early afternoon they passed port townsend and entered the calm waters of the puget sound the rain stopped and the clouds lifted to a thin vatery sunset light as they ran down past edmonds heading south under mainsail and jibs the topsails furled with the last of the light they approached seattle furled the main and started the diesel and finally dropped anchor in the quarantine section of elliott bay just north of duwamish head the captain came out of the wheelhouse as the chain rattled out well be staying here all night he said its a bit late now harbourmaster port health officer and customs theyll be off about eight in the morning i reckon well have breakfast half past seven then after that we move into a berth what about this chap jim rockawin asked keith we had to let him know thats so i sent him a radiogram four days ago via san francisco ive got a shore connection now on vhf i guess that this might be as good a time as any try to get him at his home ten minutes later he was speaking to jim rockawin who in turn rang julie at the hirzhorn home near wauna oh fine she said ill tell mr hirzhorn hes down in the workshop right now can i fix everything or would you like it if i put you through i dont want to disturb him unless you think hed like to speak to me i dont think that theres anything that we cant fix between us mr rockawin mr hirzhorn has been looking forward to mr stewart visiting with him for a few days and hed like you to bring him right out here with his suitcases as soon as you can get him off the yacht hes kept the next four days free of all appointments he thought perhaps mr stewart might care to take a look around some of the plants with him jim rockawin was deeply impressed he knew that sol hirzhorn thought a lot of this british engineer he had not realized that his regard went as far as to allocate four days of his time to him the thought flashed through his mind that inevitably in that four days they would discuss the flume river mill and the proposal to convert it to ferris hydraulics keith stewart was important to chuck ferris and chuck ought to know about it he said it would probably be midday before i get him off the yacht past customs and all the rest of it suppose i give him lunch in the city and bring him out to wauna in the afternoon she said evenly and directly mr hirzhorn doesnt like secret handouts mr rockawin whats more he always gets to hear about them in good time or else i do say he expostulated weakly we wouldnt think of anything like that thats fine she said ill expect you in the middle of the afternoon and well get the room made up mr hirzhorn will be very pleased when i tell him hes very grateful very gateful indeed to mr ferris for lending his yacht dont go and spoil it i wont he said thoughtfully the jobs good enough to stand on its own feet im sure it is she said bye now jim rockawin put down the telephone and sat in thought for a few minutes his first reaction had been that if sol hirzhorn was going to take this british engineer all round his plants and talk to him about the flume river mill they should get hold of him at once he should call chuck immediately chuck would probably drop everything and fly out to seattle to meet keith stewart at lunch tomorrow chuck could be pretty impetuous at times now after talking with julie he was not so sure that that would be a very good idea he had a notion that nothing he or chuck might say to keith before he got to wauna would remain long unknown to julie or sol hirzhorn in seattle they were playing on their own home ground better perhaps to take the matter straight and leave chuck out of it he did not call his boss he was on the quayside when the flying cloud berthed at about ten oclock next morning he knew captain petersen well and greeted him cheerfully as he went up the gangway hi joe he said hows everything good and bad said captain petersen jim this is mr stewart glad to know you mr stewart they shook hands he turned again to the captain whats bad joe dawn said captain petersen you know she skipped i did hear something mr rockawin admitted got another guy and how is chuck mad with me i dont think so he will be when he hears the whole of it said the captain apprehensively he knows most of it already said the engineer he did get a bit upset after he got your radio so he called sol hirzhorn and told him all about it theyre pretty thick just now sol put julie on to find out what she could about this jack donelly she got a line on him from the manager of the forest down on taylor butte and then she called a guy theyve got called paul setches out in honolulu to get a line on him from there id say chuck knows most of it now he smiled the worst that julie jnanaged to find out was that he got in prison once three months for rape and she reck dried that was a putup job thats one i didnt know about said the captain three months isnt much for rape lt wasnt much of a rape according to julie said mr rockawin she says the girls been giving her mother hell ever since captain petersen was immensely relieved well gee im thankful that i havent got to tell chuck much hes not worrying shes left three husbands and shell live this one if she wants to but you never know this might stick he turned to keith stewart say mr stewart he said hirzhorns looking forward to you staying with him a days before you go back to england he wants to talk to you about a clock hes making and he wants to take you andd and show you something of the hirzhorn enterprise is that okay with you of course said keith id like to meet him i had some letters from him back in england well thats fine if you can get packed up ive got my car right here what i thought we could do is drive around a bit so you can see seattle and then have lunch and then out to wauna in the afternoon thats around fifty miles to where sol hirzhorn lives that sounds fine said keith theres just one thing this case has the engine from my sisters yacht in it that got wrecked in the tuamotus i want to get it shipped back to england perkins and durant said mr rockawin theyd be the best shipping agents to handle that its passed customs inwards thats right said captain petersen we took the top of the case off for them this morning theres their mark oh well then it wont have to go in bond ill get a truck along and take it to their warehouse leave it to me ill bring you out the documents to sign the steward brought keiths suitcase up on deck keith turned to captain petersen i dont know if ill be coming on board again he said but i suppose i shant id like to say thank you for all youve done for me the captain said its been a real pleasure having you aboard mr stewart and having your company and say that trip down to tahiti was a pleasure too not to mention ending up back here at home id have cut my throat if id been stuck in honolulu for much longer acting as a houseboat while dawn made eyes at manuel they shook hands ill be seeing you one day keith went down the gangway with jim rockawin to the car the steward following with the suitcase i guess well go up through the city first of all so you can see the sort of town it is up by lake union across the canal take a look around the university then back down lake washington boulevard so you can see lake washington then back by boeing field and have lunch in the city he paused say if you could get sol hirzhorn to spare you for a day id like to take you into boeing theres stuff there classified you couldnt see of course but theres plenty that you could and there are engineers in boeing know about your writing in the magazine theyd be real glad to show you around they drove round for an hour and a half and finished up in the grillroom of the olympic hotel for lunch keith was a little daunted by the magnificence of the hotel and completely overawed by the prices on the menu far from his baling way of life he was equally astounded by the size of the spare ribs when they were placed before him it seemed impossible that he should eat all that as indeed it was towards the end of his meal he said to mr rockawin tell me mr rockawin jim the other interrupted smiling we get pretty quickly here to where it seems kind of formal even rude if you keep on using the surname thats unless theres a good big difference in rank i dont suppose ill ever get around to calling mr hirzhorn sol all right jim said keith tell me what does mr ferris do the representative brushed the ash off his cigarette which gave him a moment for thought hydraulic engineering he replied ferris hydraulics incorporated of cincinnati ever heard of them keith nodded is that the same ferris theres only one chuck ferris said his representative hes my boss keith searched his memory aviation mostly and motorcars well thats the way it used to be said mr rockawin automotive products are up each year both in the united states and on the continent of europe from our laeken plant in belgium but aviation products are declining theyre way down from what they used to be thats general in the industry on account of aeroplanes flying higher but we get by keith thought for a minute id like you to know that im very grateful to mr hirzhorn and to mr ferris for sending the flying cloud down to tahiti he said it was a tretmendous help we were really in trouble quite bad trouble when captain petersen turned up i dont think id ever ave got out to see my sisters grave or to set up a stone without his help it meant a lot to me well thats real nice to know said mr rockawin mr hirzhorn hed be glad to know that if you tell him he paused i think when people get older he said they kind of get more mellow they kind of like to give help in return for help they get and sol hirzhorn hes mighty interested in that clock keith nodded it was very good of mr ferris too to lend his yacht oh sure said mr rockawin but chucks not building a clock he lent the flying cloud just in the way of business its sol hirzhorn that you want to thank captain petersen showed me a telegram hed had from mr ferris keith remarked it was in papeete when we were so worried about dawn it was all about dawn but mr ferris did say one thing he wanted the flying cloud to come straight back to seattle with me on board because he said he had what he called a kingsized deal pending with sol hirzhorn he said that did he mr rockawin sat in thought for a moment wondering if it was wise to take a line so very different from that which his employer would have taken well thats true enough mr stewart he said at last there is a contract pending between mr ferris and sol hirzhorn you know that already he paused again whether you come into it or not i wouldnt know in any case im not going to tell you a thing about it youll be staying with sol hirzhorn for the next few days if he likes to tell you about it well its his business and thats okay with me but im not telling you about sol hirzhorns business from this end he smiled julie would know all about it by the time we get to wauna keith asked who is this julie captain petersen said something about her once julie perlberg said mr rockawin shes a jewish girl i think quite young twentyfive maybe shes the old mans private secretary sharp as a needle he paused ive heard it said that there was some kind of a tragedy i dont know in any case thats only rumour if true shed be his granddaughter he paused she lives at wauna in the house with him his wifes away in florida most winters so she runs the house servants she goes to conferences with him taking shorthand notes you might say shes his eyes and ears right now he laughed and say theyre mightysharp eyes and mighty long ears keith smiled with him long enough to hear whats going on in here shes quite capable of having someone put a mike into that bowl of flowers said mr rockawin although idont really think she works that way shed know by just looking at us if wed talked about the deal he paused shes sharp like all her family wed better not talk about it then said keith im not going to said mr rockawin i told you that he paid the cheque and they went out of the hotel to the car at the parking meter where the policeman was just making out a ticket for staving too long rockawin talked him out of it by introducing keith stewart as an english visitor which so intrigued the policeman who had been in england in the war that he forgot about the ticket they got on the road for tacoma and on southwards down the fringes of the puget sound it was the first time that keith had been in the united states and he was amazed by the high standard of living at any rate in visible material things the size and beauty of the motorcars the number of them the size and quality of the roads and the enormous number of great fourwheeled trailer caravans these things impressed him very much indeed they drove through the industrial city of tacoma at the head of puget sound and over the toll bridge across the narrows out into the country again presently they left the road and turned into an inconspicuous lane or drive marked only by stone pillars by the roadside and went on winding up the hill through a forest of fir trees after half a mile they came out on to an open hillside a place of grass and granite outcrops with a little snow upon the ground and with a magnificent view over to the snowcovered olympic mountains to the west there stood the house a long low stone building twostoreyed in the front and singlestoreyed at the back by the slope of the hillside a house very much larger than appeared at the first glance below it lay an inlet of the sound with boathouses and a moored motor yacht and by the waters edge there was a long airstrip with a hangar by the road that led down to it jim rockawin drove up to the front door behind the house and parked the car a manservant in a green baize apron came out and took the suitcase and they went towards the house a stout elderly man came forward to meet them mr stewart isnt it he said this is a real pleasure weve exchanged letters but weve never met before say take off your coat and come right in he paused im sol hirzhorn they went into the huge living room with the great picture window looking out over the olympics mr stewart would you like a cup of tea he asked i know you englishmen drink tea in the afternoon keith said dont bother about that for me mr hirzhorn ive been away from england long enough to get out of english ways we often have a cup of tea around this time said mr hirzhorn its getting so its quite a habit in the office he raised his voice say julie she came into the room mr stewart id like you to meet julie perlberg she does all my letters to you julie this is mr stewart say would you tell jake to get us english tea with cookies or sumpn im glad to know you mr stewart she said quietly til see about that right away mr hirzhorn keith walked over to the big window what a wonderful view he said ive never seen anything like it i built the house for it said mr hirzhorn simply i saw it first when i was quite a young chap and i used to go all over for the cutting lumber thats my business you know that keith nodded nineteen twentytwo or twentythree would it have been i cant just remember id have been thirty years old or so about that time and married about five years i thought then that id like to have a summer camp up on this hill well then that wasnt hardly practical with a young family and not much time to spare but i never forgot about it i got to realize that it would take a lot of money to live here and work at the same time but anyway i couldnt get it out of my head and in things got so i could buy the land as an investment so id got it anyway how much land is there mr hirzhorn jim rockawin asked twelve hundred acres a little more i think twelve hundred and thirtysix far as i remember sarah said it was a silly thing to do because wed never live there it would cost a fortune he laughed well then the fortune came n i never wanted to travel or go horse racing or anything just build the house and live in it n go on working and thats just what i did julie came into the room behind them tea will be here in a minute she said softly she went through into her own room leaving the men talking she closed the door and went to a tall cabinet of steel drawers she selected a file marked stewart and took it to her desk and opened it again to refresh her memory one of her jobs was to protect her employer who was also her grandfather she never sought to influence his judgement she worked rather to get him the maximum of information with the least effort on his part they had few contacts in england but she quickly discovered that there was an agency in london which specialized in finding out the particulars of individuals in connection with hirepurchase credit the first document that they had sent her read keith malcolm stewart born renfrew scotland lives now at somerset road ealing middlesex a fourstorey tenroomed house which is his property the house was purchased for ј in by mr stewart and subdivided the top two floors are let at a rental of ј per week there is a mortgage of ј on the property at mr stewart is married and has no children of his own but has one daughter apparently adopted recently mr stewart worked as a fitter in the aircraft industry till he then became a freelance technical journalist y working principally for a magazine called the miniature mechanic his income is estimated at about ј per annum his wife works whole time as a shop assistant in baling with the rental of the leased portion of the house the family income appears to be about ј per annum mr stewart does not bet or drink to excess he does not own a car he appears to live within his means and has a good reputation in the neighbourhood this report reached julie while keith was on his way from honolulu to tahiti with jack donelly and she was amazed first she was surprised by the invoice sent with the report which was for twentyfive shillings only about three and a half dollars secondly she was staggered by the smallness of the income only about three thousand dollars from all sources including the wifes earnings and then to go and adopt a child upon an income like that she had taken the report at once to show to mr hirzhorn he had read it with interest a guy with his ability he could earn a better wage than that he remarked presently even in england i guess its just he kind of likes his work better than making money theres nothing wrong with that he handed back the report to julie you know sumpn id like to see some photographs photographs of the wife of the adopted kid of the house of the street of the garden of the house so i can see if he keeps it clean or not photographs of anything that you can get okay mr hirzhorn said julie well have to have them here within two weeks or so they should be able to do that ill write today she paused in thought ill say we want it in a hurry i think i might put three tendollar bills in with the letter kind of help things along four days later a pavement photographer took a picture of katie in baling broadway as she went into the shop in spite of her smiling denials janice got photographed by a strange man on her way home from school to her surprise and the house and street were taken from all angles including the back garden a week after that a sheaf of photographs arrived on julies desk at wauna in the state of washington by the time keith stewart got there his hosts knew quite a lot about him she put the file back into the steel cabinet and locked it up the little man looked like what the file and photographs had told her added to what she had gleaned from sundry issues of the miniature mechanic an honest little man of lower middleclass suburban type content to go along upon a miserable salary for the sake of doing the work he loved with a wife who was prepared to work in order that he should maintain that way of life there was no deceit about this man that was important for she had little confidence in chuck ferris he was too anxious to sell his hydraulics to get in to the lumber industry jim rockawin was better but not much seventeen hundred thousand dollars for the conversion of the flume river mill was quite a contract in anybodys language she knew that production at the cincinnati factory was declining on account of the reduction in aviation contracts she knew that they laid off a thousand hands last month ferris hydraulics had indulged in too much salesmanship and made julie suspicious this lending of the yacht seventeen hundred thousand dollars was a lot of money she had not mentioned her misgivings to her grandfather her business was to take his orders take the load off him where she could and get him information she knew however that the same misgivings had occurred to him there had been too much salesmanship chuck ferris would have done better to have charged a charter fee for the flying cloud his refusal to do so had undoubtedly held up the contract for the flume river mill the old man smelt a rat he had delayed a decision till a fresh mind was brought to bear upon the problems of the mill for fresh advice he had been waiting for keith stewart to see if this insignificant little engineer from england could say anything useful she got up from her desk she had decided in her own mind that he was honest that was where she stopped whether he was competent was a matter for her grandfather to decide she went out into the living room the men seemed to have finished drinking tea and jim rockawin was getting up to go she went through to tell the houseman to clear away the tea and came back to the hall in time to bid jim rockawin goodbye she went on into the living room to pull the curtains over the great picture window and to light the lamps for dusk was falling now sol hirzhorn came back into the room with keith like to have a look at what im doing with your clock downstairs he asked id like to very much mr hirzhorn he said they moved towards the door julie said quietly drinks will be on the table here at seven oclock mr stewart and dinner is at seventhirty mr hirzhorn usually goes to bed at nine you see how she keeps me on a string said the old man thats what im here for she said equably she smiled i generally go down to the workshop about ten minutes to seven and chase him out otherwise hed be there all night the two men went down to the workshop in the basement it was a long room more than forty feet long but only or feet wide there was a long workbench for the full length of it lit by windows in the outer wall and these windows looked down the hill over the sea inlet and the airstrip the back wall was of light construction separating the workshop from the heating plant and from the laundry of the house in this long shop was every machine and hand tool that a modeller in metal could desire from lathes and a milling machine to oxyacetylene welding and soldering ironsr keith stood and took it all in with a practised eye from the clock parts laid out on a white cloth at the end of the bench to the racks of raw materials on the back wall he had never before seen anything like it in a private house and not in many institutions its completeness staggered him he turned to the old man by his side youve certainly got a beautiful setup here he said did you do all this yourself no said mr hirzhorn ill be straight with you when i first got interested eight years ago i had the bench put m and got the south bend lathe and fixed that up myself well then when i got going and got really stuck into it i decided on a whole raft of things i ought to have i was new to it you see and the lathe took me a month to get fixed up the way i wanted it so then i figured by the time i got the shop fixed up id probably be dead and nothing done so then i got along clem harrison who runs our aviation section and told him what i wanted and he made i the plan and got the things for me and put it all in with his boy pete horner i wouldnt like you to go thinking that i did all this for myself with my own hands very sensible said keith youve certainly got a fine shop you like it its the best ive ever seen in any private house thats the clock over there on the cloth thats as far as ive gone so far keith moved over and picked up the tilting table youve made a good job of that he said examining it a ibeautiful job how did you get the burnishing so flat and even lapped it on a sheet of plate glass with oil and finegrit carborundum said mr hirzhorn then i finished off with metal polish on the plate glass thats right i thought this was the part folks would be always looking at so it ought to be finished good keith nodded it was better finished than on most of the examples of the clock that he had seen he picked up the lions and the rocking arm examined them and laid down youre getting on quite well he said these the four plates thats so theyve to be burnished but i wont do that till all the holes are drilled he hesitated they dont get seen so much he said i thought id do them on a polishmop keith nodded thats quite good enough these bevels did you make them yourself no mr hirzhorn admitted i got clem harrison to have them made for me i do spur wheels but i never did a bevel wheel they arent so difficult keith said but they do take time i often get mine made in a shop where theyve got proper tools for it he turned over the parts youre getting on quite well he said i should think you must be about halfway through whats the next part to be tackled bobbins and armatures said mr hirzhorn i never wound a coil before and i dont know how im going to make out fortysix gauge is mighty fine wire to handle when you cant see so well i know said keith its better not to handle it at all its so easy to get kinks i made a coil winder for mine its quite a simple thing the wire passes from the spool through softwood grips tightened by a spring to give the tension then that traverses along the slow feed the pitch just bigger than the wire diameter reverse direction with the tumbler reverse at the end of each row like this he seized a piece of paper and began to sketch mr hirzhorn watching intently suddenly he stopped drawing look you dont have to make one get on with the and tooth wheels next and the maintaining gear as soon as i get back to england ill put my coil winder in the post to you airmail he moved to the south bend lathe and examined it youll have to make a little plate fitting and put it on the tool post here i shant be using it you can post it back to me when youve done with it say thats mighty kind of you said mr hirzhorn ive been kind of frightened of those coils and yet i want to learn to do them you know how it is keith nodded they arent difficult he said use the coil winder and pick a gauge of wire to suit a slow feed on the lathe and run in back gear at your slowest speed theres no magic in fortysix gauge he examined the gearbox on the lathe look this one here gives an advance of four thous per rev fortyfour gauge is thousandths diameter i should use this gear with fortyfour gauge wire you wont have any difficulty mine took about an hour to make each coil an hour later julie came down to the workshop she came in unnoticed by the men and stood behind them for a little watching and listening the visit of this english engineer was a good thing there was no doubt of that she had been troubled from time to time that the circumstances of his life compelled her grandfather to pursue his hobby and his interest alone every evening he went down into the workshop alone she could not share his interest with him nor could his wife it seemed all wrong to her that he had nobody to play with but thats the way things were she knew it for a solitary occupation in that he wanted to make the whole clock himself but his pleasure in keith stewarts visit pleased her very much indeed she said quietly drinks are on the table mr hirzhorn the two men started and turned to her sol hirzhorn said they cant be and looked at his watch oh well they went obediently upstairs with her and washed their hands in the cloakroom over the drinks before the big log fire sol hirzhorn said i was wondering if youd care to take a look at one of the mills tomorrow mr stewart ever seen a lumber mill in operation i dont know anything about the lumber industry at all keith said its all new to me id like to very much indeed but i dont want to take your time the old man shook his head i want to go and see this mill myself weve got an engineering problem there needs sorting out i think well go into the office first of all while i look through the mail n you can meet the boys my two sons emmanuel and joseph they do most of the work now and then well go on to the mill julie mr hirzhorn julie well want the car at half past eight tomorrow for the office youd better come along then ring the aviation section say ill be coming to the airport and ill want the helicopter at ten oclock for the flume river mill maybe well drop in at the eight mile cut in the afternoon so mr stewart sees the whole process okay mr hirzhorn will you want jim rockawin along no well leave him out this time but say if mannys free i think he might come call manny after the airport and if hes home id like to speak with him she moved the telephone to the small table by his side and put it by the glass and went into her office closing the door five minutes later the buzzer sounded quietly and the old man picked up the receiver the helicopter will be ready at ten oclock she said i have mr emmanuel on the line now will i put him through sure there was a click and mr hirzhorn said manny say manny ive got mr stewart with me now the british engineer that i was telling you about thats right im coming in the office see the mail first thing and let him meet you and joe after that im taking him to see flume river would you be able to come along i think so dad there was a short pause bill schultz of euclid hes coming in the morning about the new trucks but its all financial its more up joes alley than mine ill call joe presently if thats okay with him i could come thats fine said mr hirzhorn id like you to be there if you can make it time we made up our minds i kind of thought that telling mr stewart all about it might help to make up our own minds you know what i mean sure dad ill call joe and if he doesnt think hed like to handle it ill maybe call bill schultz and put him off a day its not that urgent okay manny give my love to rachel see you in the morning he put down the receiver they dined simply in a great dining room rather top ornately furnished full of oil paintings and clocks served by the manservant julie dining with them my wife sarah shell be sorry to miss seeing you said mr hirzhorn once she gets this sciatica each winter in the cold and wet and nothing seems much good except the sunshine and the warmth she used to go down into california but she likes florida best i go and see her there once in a month or six weeks but theres nothing to do there he smiled no business and no workshop i like it here she likes it too excepting when its cold shell be back around the end of april soon as it fines up they went to bed early and keith slept well in the deepest softest bed that he had ever slept in in the intense stillness of wauna by ten minutes to nine next morning he was in the head office in tacoma meeting the two sons emmanuel and joseph treated as a very honoured guest they left julie in the office and went on at half past nine to the seattletacoma airport by ten oclock they were outside the private hangar labelled hirzhorn enterprises inc with the helicopter standing on the tarmac in a little drifted snow saying good morning to the pilot well want to go to the flume river mill said mr hirzhorn well be there for lunch then if theres time well look in at the eight mile cut well be going back to wauna after that but it might be close on dark maybe wed better go home in the cessna okay mr hirzhorn said the pilot he spoke to a ground engineer and the father and son got into the machine in the back seat putting keith beside the pilot the pilot got in after them the doors closed the engine started the rotor revved up presently the pilot moved the big lever in his right hand gently up and they were in the air and moving ahead slowly he put the helicopter in a climb and they set out towards the east and north the flight was a delight to keith who had never been in a helicopter before it took about fifty minutes over mountains and up shallow valleys filled with the unending forest in the end a river showed up ahead of them and buildings marked by a great plume of smoke and steam a railroad and a small town beside mr hirzhorn reached forward and touched the pilot on the shoulder circle round a bit he said i want mr stewart to take in the whole setup before we land the pilot nodded and put the aircraft into a right hand turn around the plant at about a thousand feet while manny explained the layout to keith the logs coming down the river the log pond the jack ladder from the log pond to the mill the drying kilns the lumber stores along the railroad tracks then they had seen all that was to be seen from the air and they came in to land softly on an open space reserved in the car park they spent two hours in the sawmill seeing the whole process as the logs four feet in diameter were sawn into planks and taken away for kilndrying or stacking while the offcuts were turned into pulpwood for newsprint the hansel debarker ripping the bark off the logs by jets of water interested keith very much the saws both bullsaws and bandsaws were well within his experience though on a vastly larger scale than any he had seen before he spent some time in the sawsharpening shop talking to the head sawyer about set and cutting angles for the various types of wood to be cut information that he stored away in his mind the flying carriages operated by fourinch roller chains running over great sprockets appalled him but he did not say so at the time they lunched with the manager and the secretary at a table reserved for them in the canteen no drinks were served for the whole plant was dry emmanuel apologized to keith for this omission were kind of strict on that he said this is a company town weve got most everything else that folks would want a dance hall and a movie theatre and eight stores but not a liquor shop we find that liquor and a sawmill dont go well together do you have many accidents keith asked he had been shown a very comprehensive little firstaid room not more than whats average to the industry manny replied you get gangs felling the tall timber in the forests or walking around on logs in the log pond or dealing with quickmoving saws like what you saw youll get more accidents than in the automotive industry for example we try to keep them down there hasnt been a fatality in this plant since it was set up said the manager thats sevenyears thats so said manny thats partly due to lou here but hes got a modern plant to help him we had three at viper bend in the last year sol hirzhorn leaned forward and they all deferred to him say mr stewart he said youve been around a bit what do you think of safety in this plant coming to it fresh now that youve seen it keith paused before answering thinking over all that he had seen that morning i dont think you could do much better with the saws he said at last with big saws running at that speed youll always get the bloke who gets careless as the years go by and puts his hand in one you cant help that except by cutting out the drink as you do the thing i didnt like were all those chains emmanuel and lou glanced at each other the old man i asked you mean the roller chains that work the carriages thats right i saw that they were well lubricated how i do they get greased you dont keep stopping the plant they get greased nights and midday when the plants istopped for dinner said lou the manager theyll have i greasers working on them now in between a guy goes around with a slush can and a brush upon a fivefoot stick and puts it on with that does that stick ever get caught up some of those chains pwere going thirty miles an hour sometimes not very often does the greaser ever get caught up with it not here said lou definitely not in the seven years i that ive been manager sol hirzhorn said say mr stewart do you know anything about chuck ferris ferris hydraulics in this mill keith faced him no i dont he said i know that mr ferris has a contract hes negotiating with you i asked mr rockawin if hed tell me what it was in case i put my foot it and said the wrong thing but he wouldnt tell me he said it was your business there was general laughter sol hirzhorn said good for jim manny would you be able to come back to wauna this evening i dont think wed lose anything by telling mr stewart whats proposed now that hes seen the plant sure dad he thought for a moment ill call the office and have them send the plans out to the house they can call rachel too tell her ill be late they left in the helicopter after lunch and flew for twenty minutes eastward up the river they came to the eight mile cut a timber camp and put down on a level platform built of logs with a plank decking specially for the helicopter they got into a truck with the young manager and were driven a mile or two through the devastated forest to where the felling was going on this was wholly strange to keith he could make no useful comment and he said so though he found it full of interest he watched a couple of douglas firs about a hundred and fifty feet tall as they were felled watched the branches being lopped off by men standing on the trunks working with axes he tested the edge of an axe and found it as sharp as a razor he watched the bulldozers pulling the logs down to the lake and rolling them in to be made up into rafts by the boommen and floated down the river to the log pond at the mill the work seemed to him to be excessively dangerous but on inquiry he found that the hirzhorns were not worried by accidents in the forest cuts they said that the accident rate was lower than in the mills possibly through the average age of the men being lower most of them were unmarried anyway so that accidents made less trouble keith thought that the monotony of work in the mills might have something to do with it in factory work when men get thinking of other matters than the job in hand accidents are apt to happen but out in the forest where no two jobs were ever quite alike men kept alive to the chance of a tree rolling over and crushing them they drove back to the helicopter in the truck and took off for home they landed at the seattletacoma airport as cars on the main highway were beginning to put on their lights changed into the cessna waiting for them on the tarmac and landed on the strip below the house at wauna a quarter of an hour later the car was there to meet them and take them the few hundred yards to the house sol hirzhorn being forbidden to climb hills an hour and twenty minutes after leaving the forest cut a hundred miles away they were seated with cups of tea and cookies before the fire in the great living room at wauna julie had come back to wauna from the head office in tacoma in the car and had brought with her a great packet of plans and specifications from ferris hydraulics a file of correspondence and a sheaf of photographs she had laid these out upon the table in the middle of the room she showed them to the men and retired to her own office when they were warm and comfortable before the fire sol hirzhorn said id like you to know the way things are at the flume river keith id like to hear it mr hirzhorn the old man paused in thought it started over a year ago he said i got an invite to attend a demonstration of rockets at this place cape canaveral in florida thor and atlas and things like that well i dont know anything about rockets or satellites or space vehicles or what you call them and not much interested either but an invite like that dont come very often and i was taking sarah to palm beach so i decided to go i didnt understand much of what i saw or what they told me either but one thing did interest me they had one of these things lying horizontal on the launching base while they serviced it and did things to it then they had to lift it up into the vertical position for fuelling and firing it was eighty or ninety feet long and they put it up vertical with two great hydraulic jacks one on each side all in next to no time those jacks must have been thirty feet long the extension i mean and i never saw h jacks go so fast he paused well you know how it is you know at the first sight it might be useful in the business but you dont know what it is youve got in mind so i asked the officer showing us around who made the jacks and he said jerris hydraulics he paused again it wasnt till the middle of the night i thought that if those jacks could push at that speed they could push our carriages in the mill just the same n cut out every chain i dont suppose you ever saw a man caught up in a fourinch roller chain that runs over a sprocket mr stewart no said keith well you dont want to either i got in touch with ferris hydraulics and chuck ferris he came down with his engineers and left them with us for a week i guessed it would be best to try it out in the one mill for a start and we picked on the flume river well what they proposed was that we didnt stop at the carriages but put hydraulic motors on the saws as well worked off the same hydraulic mains from the same plant well thats attractive in some ways although its a big increase in the costs i dont care about highvoltage electric motors in a sawmill much more than the chains six hundred volts can kill a guy quite quick and you take an eightfoot bullsaw thatll take close on horsepower you get a saw break and hang up and things are apt to happen keith nodded well with the hydraulics they just put a sort of safety valve across the mains and no ones likely to get hurt no damage to the motor either i dont care about highvoltage current in the mill any more than the chains mannys got the drawings and the specifications on the table there he said i wondered if youd care to take a look at them id like to very much said keith i dont know that id be able to help much you know its not as if i was a consulting engineer no but youve been around a bit id appreciate it if youd look the scheme over keith crossed to the table with emmanuel and they started to discuss the scheme while sol hirzhorn sat on in his chair before the fire they started on the plan of the mill then turned to the ferris drawings and the specification it was all straightforward enough to an engineering mind a well prepared scheme easily comprehensible it was good too keith stewart liked the look of it it was one which would remove most of the apprehensions which had troubled him that morning in the mill it would certainly make the work safer what happens to the waste heat he asked emmanuel at last whats thatasked the mill owner keith turned to the specification the power going into the hydraulic system is the brake horsepower of these diesel motors the prime movers he remarked six thousand five hundred horsepower thats so thats the power going into the mill when everythings going at full blast well of course nothing works at per cent efficiency emmanuel nodded i dont know what the efficiency of these hydraulic rams would be said keith thoughtfully the motors might be per cent suppose we guess that as the figure for the whole mill ten per cent power loss that means that when the plant is going at full blast horsepower has to be got rid of as waste heat seems a lot said emmanuel i dont know that it is said keith reflectively not in the scale of the whole job i suppose it goes into the hydraulic fluid i saw something about that he turned over the pages of the specification here it is maximum temperature of the fluid i io f thats what these intercoolers are for i think said emmanuel theyve got them stuck around behind each motor and each ram with water from the river running through them heres the drawing of the water mains and pump i see keith took the drawing and studied it thats all right this is the drawing of the intercooler in two sizes he studied the dimensions its not very big i wouldnt know said emmanuel keith smiled tell you the truth i dont know either he sat in thought how hot does it get there at the mill he asked outside i mean on a fine day in summer oh it gets quite hot said emmanuel the guys outside they work in pants and singlet eighty degrees id say maybe eightyfive its right down in the valley so you dont get much wind thatd be the inlet temperature of the hydraulic fluid by the time it got from the power plant into the mill said keith thoughtfully it must go in at round about air temperature i guess it would said manny julie brought the tray of drinks into the room and the two men crossed over to sol hirzhorn by the fire how did you make out he asked id like to think about it just a little bit keith said the trouble is i dont know much about hydraulics and they know just about everything there is to know there are one or two things i dont understand but thats probably my fault he paused and took a drink id like to read that specification through quietly after dinner by myself do that said mr hirzhorn ill be down in the workshop starting work on the gearwheels not after nine oclock you wont said julie firmly youve had quite a day keith settled down after dinner at the big table in the middle of the room while the old man retired to his workshop and emmanuel sat in a long chair before the fire smoking a cigar he read the specification through twice and did a little figuring on the back of one of the drawings at the end of it when julie went downstairs to flush sol hirzhorn from the workshop keith was as much in the dark as ever he got up as the old man came into the room im sorry he said simply but i still dont understand these intercoolers id say they were too small and they should be about three times the size theres almost certainly some factor here that i dont understand could be said sol hirzhorn briefly he turned to his son manny how would you like to take a run up to cincinnati with mr stewart show him the hardware n talk to the engineers when dad tomorrow i guess emmanuel reflected for a moment i could do that he said go in the office first and catch the united plane midday flight thirteen zero five gets in around nine oclock their time sleep in the hotel n see them in the morning back here next night we could do that if you like dad id be kind of happier now this has been raised the old man said if we dont get it cleared up we might be worrying about it all the time he turned to keith could you do that for us he asked it seems asking rather a lot id be very pleased mr hirzhorn said keith he smiled id be very glad of the chance of walking through the ferris works sol hirzhorn turned to julie better call united now and make the reservations make them for the return flight too okay mr hirzhorn the organization went smoothly into effortless action keith spent the next morning in the workshop going over all the details of the clock with sol hirzhorn at twelvethirty the cessna was waiting on the airstrip to take him across the water to the airport at twelvefifty the pilot escorted him to the booking hall and handed him over to emmanuel ten minutes later he was sitting in the dcy and at ninethirty that night he was in his bedroom at the hotel in cincinnati over miles from wauna he had a morning of absorbing interest in the ferris plant next day and finished up with considerable admiration for the design and manufacture of the hydraulic motors the morning ended with an office conference presided over by chuck ferris a small dynamic redhaired man that keith had no difficulty in recognizing as dawns father the chief engineer was present with one of his aides a mr monnington keith said he didnt quite understand the intercoolers thats all right said the chief engineer patiently the cold river water comes in here from the main picks up heat and comes out here and back into the river the oil comes in here and goes out here a whole lot cooler keith said he understood that what puzzles me is the heat transfer balance he said i take it that the hydraulic fluid goes into the intercooler at no degrees thats the maximum temperature you work at thats so said the chief engineer in the case of the biggest motors that would be the outgoing temperature and it goes into the power generator about eighty degrees more or less keith stared at the drawing still puzzled well whatv the temperature rise in the cooling water then the chief engineer glanced at his aide mr monnington said fifty degrees fiftyfive under extreme conditions puzzled keith said it cant go higher than the temperature of the oil or it couldnt do any cooling whats the inlet temperature of the water fifty degrees said mr monnington emmanuel stirred but left the talking to keith that seems on the cold side for summer temperature said ke ith its general in these rivers said the engineer maybe you dont get the same conditions in england this is snow water made by melting the eternal snows upon the glacier peak emmanuel leaned forward on the table thats baloney he said candidly flume river doesnt rise from glacier peak flume river rises in the troublesome mountain not much higher than feet all the snows gone from troublesome by the end of april most years he paused and then he said tell you sumpn i went fishing up the flume two years ago in august ten or fifteen miles above the eight mile cut trout fishing we didnt catch anything because the water was too hot the fish wouldnt stir so there was only one thing to be done see we stripped off n went in for a swim real warm it was i stayed in half an hour or more i guess the water in that river in the flume the one were talking of i guess it was seventyfive degrees or more that day there was a dead silence in the conference room of ferns hydraulics inc sol hirzhorn took his call to chuck ferris next morning in julies office because he didnt want keith stewart to hear what was said the girl started the tape recorder as he lifted the instrument and stood back in the room he said that chuck ferris morning chuck the boys tell me they had quite a party with your engineers thats right said chuck cautiously about the intercoolers there was a difference of opinion on the inlet temperature of the water manny tells me that hes putting on a swimming party at the mill next august girls and all i know i know said mr ferris quit ribbing sol my boys had the rivers mixed up were redesigning the intercoolers for your plant right now that wont hold up the job and our quotation stands theres quite a bit more copper will be needed but thats our mistake and we pay for it thats fine said mr hirzhorn mr stewart that i sent with manny he was very impressed with what he saw well said mr ferris rather relieved thats nice to ttnow really impressed he was he had a long talk with manny on the plane on the way back they didnt put much importance on this intercooler business now thats all cleared up they advised me to go right ahead and sign the heads of agreement so the attorneys could draw up the contract theres only one point to be settled now whats that whos going to pay keith stewart there was dead silence on the line the tape rolled on hes not on your payroll and hes not on mine said p the old lumber man he isnt going to be on mine either i asked him to look over the scheme as a friend he said he i didnt understand why the intercoolers were so small so i sent him up with manny to see your boys well they found that thered been a mistake in your office i know i know said mr ferris you think he ought to get something i sure do kind of a consultant fee what were you thinking of asked mr ferris cautiously one per cent on the contract mr ferris leaped in his chair jeez he exclaimed thats thats over seventeen thousand dollars hes not a guy thats in that sort of money see here chuck said the old man evenly a guys worth what he earns if hed not spotted that the intercoolers were too small theyd have gone into the plant the way they were next july or august wed have had to stop production for a month or more while you put the job right maybe wed have had a lawsuit over it theres big money involved do you know what one days production from that mill is worth i know i know said mr ferris petulantly still seventeen thousand dollars thats three cadillacs if wed had a lawsuit over this n you lost it would have cost you fifty cadillacs said mr hirzhorn sure but there isnt going to be a lawsuit weve got the new design laid out in the drawing office right now i was in there just a few minutes ago sure there isnt going to be a lawsuit said sol hirzhorn maybe there isnt going to be a contract either my son joe he said right from the start we should have had some competition in on this there was a pause you really feel that this guys contribution rates seventeen thousand dollars i certainly do said the old man if those intercoolers had gone in as the old design wed have been up for ten fifteen times that amount and it wouldnt have been me who paid it mr ferris threw in the towel okay he said if thats what you think right well thats the way it is sol thatll be okay with us at this end well thats fine said mr hirzhorn jim rockawin hes got the heads of agreement typed out ready if he brings them to the tacoma office tomorrow morning ill sign up and he can sign for you then well get them right over to my attorneys theres just one clause needs adding seventeen thousand dollars payable to mr keith stewart for consultant services oh one thing more mr stewart will be leaving for england day after tomorrow so jim rockawin had better bring the cheque along with him with the heads of agreement seventeen thousand dollars he put down the telephone and leaned back a little weary julie came forward from the back of the room he wont know if hes coming or going she said softly she turned off the tape recorder shall i do a transcript may as well he said well have it at the office in the morning case they have second thoughts they wont do that she said they want this job too much he got up from her chair hes earned it he said a guy has a right to be paid for the job he gets mixed up in whether hes accustomed to that scale of dough or not he smiled pay off his mortgage itll do more than that she said its three times the value of his mortgage well hell have a little bit of loose change then is he going back to england day after tomorrow she asked thats what he wants to do had i better get busy with the reservations for his trip she asked he nodded yes do that on the office why certainly on the travelling overhead okay she said ill see him presently ive got the mail right here mr hirzhorn if youd like to see it now half an hour later while sol hirzhorn was getting ready to go into tacoma for a business lunch appointment she called keith stewart to her office theres two or three things she said businesslike and efficient first jim rockawin called yesterday hes got some shipping documents he wants you to sign about the engine salvaged from your sisters yacht keith nodded he was going to get those well youve just got to sign and its all through the engine will be shipped upon a british ship sailing thursday of next week the clan mcalister to london docks hes having it consigned to you care of perkins and durant in london is that okay with you fine said keith when can i sign the documents well now thats another thing mr rockawin is coming to the head office tomorrow morning to sign the heads of agreement for the flume river contract will i call him and tell him to bring the documents along with him then that would be fine okay ill do that mr rockawin has been talking with some of the boeing engineers and they certainly would like to take you through the plant one day would you like to do that tomorrow afternoon id like to do that very much if mr hirzhorn can spare me she glanced at her diary hes got a business lunch today and another one tomorrow he wont be back here either day till around five oclock she smiled i know that hed appreciate an hour in the workshop with you then she stood in thought for a moment suppose we fix jim rockawin for ten oclock tomorrow morning signing the heads of agreement and your shipping documents wont take more than half an hour he could take you on then to lunch with the boeing engineers and see some of the plant then ill have the cessna at the boeing field at a quarter past four to bring you right back here well said keith thatd be grand for me but its putting everybody to a great deal of trouble she shook her head the aeroplane and the pilot would be standing idle in the hangar mannys got meetings in seattle and joe hardly ever flies ill fix that now theres another thing mr stewart and thats about your consultant fee one of her duties was to deal with awkward or embarrassing matters for her grandfather my what consultant fee mr stewart mr hirzhorn asked you to look the ferris plans over and you discovered a mistake that had to do with the intercoolers to check on that you had to go to cincinnati well the ferris crowd had made a mistake that would have cost both parties a great deal of money if it had gone through mr ferris reckons that your technical services rate a consultant fee and he called mr hirzhorn about it this morning she said lying like a good personal secretary they reckoned that one per cent of the contract would be a reasonable figure thats dollars is that okay with you keith was dumbfounded but thats absurd he exclaimed its much too much its whats usual in this country she said offhandedly she could lie beautifully with a perfectly straight businesslike expression if you want to talk mr ferris out of it youll have to go to cincinnati but theres no reason for you to do that its in line with fees paid every day for consultant technical services ill have to think about it keith muttered jim rockawins bringing the cheque out with him tomorrow morning she remarked its probably made out by now thats because mr hirzhorn told mr ferris that youre on your way back to england they fixed between them what would be a reasonable fee and theres a clause in the heads of agreement about it its much too much for the work i did he repeated that may be so in england she remarked i wouldnt know i can tell you one thing though if you want those heads of agreement altered in the morning jim rockawin will have to call mr ferris in cincinnati and you wont get to boeing in time for lunch id leave things the way they are if i were you she paused theres one more thing mr hirzhorn said youd be leaving us the day after tomorrow will you be going straight through to london keith nodded ive got to hurry home ive been away too long too bad that you cant stay a little longer said julie maybe youll be over again ill call united and book you on the flight to idlewild new york that connects with the night panam flight to london okay wait a bit said keith i dont know that i want to fly i was thinking that id have to go by train and boat she said but you flew out to vancouver and honolulu didnt you i got that free he said at home well i dont live like you do here she saidi know it she eyed him kindly you mustnt think that everybody in the us lives like mr hirzhorn she said one day maybe ill get married and then ill come down with a bump mr hirzhorn has a right to live like this hes built up a great industry and thats about the only real interest he has except the workshop she paused i asked him about the reservations and the tickets she remarked he said to put them through the office account keith paused for a moment untangling her unfamiliar words you mean he wants to pay my airline fare back to london she smiled not personally of course he said to me to put it on the travelling overhead at the office but thats what it adds up to i cant let him do that keith said not with dollars of mr ferris money in my pocket you want to learn arithmetic she said if this goes in the office overhead it gets deducted from the profit before tax is charged mr hirzhorn wont pay twenty per cent of these fares if you pay youll pay it out of your net income per cent that doesnt make sense she paused dont refuse him when he wants to do this little thing she said gently youve given him a lot of pleasure with your letters and the clock let him do this for you chapter eleven keith stewart landed back in england at london airport three days later eighty days after he had left england from speke he passed through immigration and customs and took the airline coach for london he stopped the coach and got off at the end of the south baling road and got on a bus shortly before lunch time he arrived at his house in somerset road carrying his suitcase it looked a little small now and a little tawdry but he was very very glad to be back he let himself in with his latchkey for katie would be at the shop and janice would be having lunch at school for the first time in months he could relax he put his suitcase down took off his coat and went down to the basement his clean workshop was untouched the machines bright and shiny ready for work in the dirty workshop there was an enormous pile of correspondence on his desk but outside the daffodils were nodding in the sunshine and the wind he looked into janices room that once had been the scullery the plastic duck still sat upon the four eggs multicoloured in the basketwork nest upon the table by her bed it was very good to be home he made a cup of tea and a couple of pieces of dripping toast there was one job that must not be delayed he put on his coat after the little meal and went out again he walked a quarter of a mile to the shops of west baling and into the local branch of the westminster bank before the eyes of the astounded cashier he endorsed a cheque for seventeen thousand dollars and paid it into his account he walked back to the house and let himself in he took his coat off and went down to the workshop and stood for a time in thought he had brought back with him a few of the ferris drawings of the hydraulic installations at the flume river mill and his mind was playing upon those the hydraulic motors might not be too difficult to make in model scale and would be something new and up to date for readers of the miniature mechanic suppose he took the cc gannet engine as a basis or any engine of about that power suppose he coupled the power generator on to that aiming to deliver a quarter of a horsepower working at a pressure of ib per square inch as a first guess then a miniature hydraulic motor driving something or other a small bandsaw for example a tiny replica of the great bandsaws he had seen in the mill start off with a bronze casting like this he seized a pad of paper on the desk and began to sketch an hour later he heard the gate clang and heard janices footsteps on the path to the front door he went upstairs and let her in before she could open the front door with her key she dropped her satchel of school books andflew into his arms im glad youre back she said he hugged her clumsily miss me he asked she nodded mm and then she said its been dull not having anything made you been all right at school he asked she nodded id have come home early if id known youd be here she said we play hockey for the last hour now mondays and thursdays this is monday so weve been playing hockey but if id known you were here i could have come home after school like hockey he asked she nodded again aunt katie bought me a lovely hockey stick with a green and yellow handle new dianas got a new one too shes awfully good at hockey she struggled out of her coat i must put the kettle on because aunt katie will be coming home he glanced at his watch she wont be home for an hour she gets off an hour earlier now said janice rushing to the kitchen to fill the kettle she started doing that when you went away because she said she ought to be at home when i get back from school because you werent here but im a big girl now arent i and then they started taking eight and tenpence from her pay packet each week because she left an hour early wasnt that mean of them together they laid the kitchen table and put the macaroni cheese in the oven to heat and got out the bread and the butter and the jam and the cherry cake across the table she asked suddenly did you go to where mummy and daddy were buried yes i went there he said we had a stone made and put it up to mark the grave i took a lot of photographs for you but i havent had them developed yet ill take them up to london to kodak tomorrow or the next day better not trust them to a local photographer were they buried on the island she asked yes he said on the island with the sea all round nobody lives there you see its only a little island and there isnt any water for people to drink so nobody else can live there she stood looking at him can you hear the sea from the place where theyre buried yes he said you can hear the sea all round i think thats nice she said they always liked the sea i left the grey egg with them he said because i thought theyd like to have something that was yours i buried it just underneath the sand she nodded theyll like that that was the end of it she did not speak about her father or her mother again till they showed her the photographs ten days later katie came in before the kettle boiled keith she said why didn t you let us know i didn t really think that youd be home for another month where have you come from there wasnt really time to write he apologized it was out of their economic way of life to send cables about the world i came from the other side of america right through i left there yesterday morning i suppose times get a bit mucked up she wrinkled her browsflying he nodded there was much to tell her but it would have to wait till janice was in bed youve got so brown she said in wonder whatever have you been doing out in the sun thats right he said ill tell you about it later janice said diana went to bournemouth with her mummy and johnnie and they all came back ever so brown can we go to bournemouth some day aunt katie well go there one day dear perhaps next summer then they went in to tea after tea keith unpacked his suitcase and got out the little presents he had bought for them in honolulu and in papeete and gave them to janice and to katie there was so much to tell them that katie allowed janice to stay up for half an hour longer but it was a school day next day and katie took her off to see she washed her ears and neck properly in the bath after playing hockey and to see that she brushed her teeth and said her prayers and went to bed without reading keith washed the dishes while all thatwas going on and when katie came up from die basement room where janice slept they were free to talk first thing she said practically have you got any money keith he nodded i was trying to sort it out on the plane he said but its all foreign so it wasnt too easy i didnt have to spend very much he pulled a muddled sheaf of notes from his breast pocket with a black wallet of travellers cheques he shuffled the pack theres a pound note he said pulling it from the mess and theres another these things must be francs you see what you can make of it he passed the lot to her she opened the little wallet theres forty pounds here that you havent used she exclaimed is there i knew there was a good bit left well thank the lord for that she remarked are things tight not worse than theyve been before we dont owe anything ive got a little over three pounds in my purse but theres ten guineas to pay next month for the school still this will put us right i think weve got about eight pounds in the bank weve got more than that he said comfortably i paid in a bit over ј this afternoon thats janices money she replied we can use that for her school fees but we cant use it for living on ourselves wed better open another account for her money its not her money he retorted thats coming along later this is ours it was midnight before they went to bed next morning he wrote a letter of thanks to mr hirzhorn and packed it up with the coil winder in a little box to go to him by airmail he spent most of the rest of the day in sorting out his vast pile of letters and answering the most urgent ones thinking regretfully of julie in her office in the house at wauna and how she would have made a meal for them perhaps he thought idly one day janice would become a secretary and would be able to help him he gave up the correspondence early in the afternoon and turned for relaxation to the design of the hydraulic models next day rested and refreshed he took his hydraulic sketches up to mr mcneil in the office of the miniature mechanic and told him most of what had happened on his journey and about sol hirzhorn and his congreve clock they lunched together at a nearby lyons and talked about the serial that keith proposed for the hydraulic mechanisms weve got quite a few subscribers in the seattle and tacoma district he told his editor they told me that there are six or seven in boeing alone ill get hold of the subscription figures said mr mcneil thoughtfully i think a serial on model lumber mechanism is a good idea especially if you incorporate the bandsaw after all thats useful in the workshop too besides being something really up to date for the canadians and the americans keith stayed quietly at home for the next six weeks catching up with his work developing the hydraulic models and writing the serial then the clan mcalister docked and he was called down to the docks to see his packing case through customs presently it was delivered to the house in somerset road upon a truck he got the truck driver to help him roll the case on short lengths of steel bar from the workshop through the front gate and the front garden and down beside the house to the back garden where they left it in the middle of the garden path keith gave the driver five shillings for his help next morning after katie had gone to the shop and janice had gone to school he unscrewed the sides of the packing case the engine seemed in fair condition though a good deal of external corrosion was evident all over it he got an enamel basin from the kitchen and drained the oil from the crankcase spilling a good deal on the garden path to katies subsequent annoyance she wasnt too pleased about the condition of the basin either which she used for washing vegetables he had no chain blocks to lift the engine with nor any ropes or tackle he undid the main holdingdown bolts from the wooden bearers put a couple of coal sacks where the head would hit the ground and turned it rather roughly on its side using a length of oneinch round steel bar as a crowbar in that position he could undo the bolts holding the sump in place that afternoon he rang up mr carpenter the solicitor at his office in bedford square this is keith stewart speaking he said you remember commander dermotts brotherinlaw of course i remember mr stewart youve been away havent you just a short holiday keith said you know those diamonds that we were looking for i do well said keith i believe theyve turned up my wife katie she was turning out the boxroom yesterday and she found a suitcase that she didnt think belonged to us full of clothes she showed it me when i got home and they were uniforms and things like that and books and things it must have been one that john left behind he hadnt told us about or wed forgotten anyway there was a little box in it full of white stones cut like jewels if you understand me do you think theyd be the diamonds did you count them asked the solicitor how many of them are there half a minute and ill count them now said keith there was a pause fortyseven he said that is the number of the stones that mr franck sold to john dermott the solicitor replied i should think you probably have found them mr stewart thats very fortunate very fortunate indeed what had i better do with them mr carpenter thought for a moment theyll have to go back to mr franck as soon as possible he said to be sold for the benefit of the estate we shall have to reopen the matter with the estate duty officer but that comes later ill ring mr franck at once could you bring them up to my office tomorrow morning if i ask him to come round say about tenthirty thats all right for me said keith youll have to be careful of them tonight said the solicitor if theyre the diamonds theyre worth ј its just like having so much cash in the house with you does anybody else know about them not a soul said keith i havent even told katie arid theres no one in the house now to hear us talking well be careful of them and dont tell your wife or anyone youd better take a taxi in the morning straight from your house right up to this office ill expect you at tenthirty keith walked into the solicitors office next morning dressed in his soiled old raincoat and holding his dirty old felt hat in his hand there was a florid man with mr carpenter with curly black hair middleaged they both got up when keith came in the solicitor said good morning mr stewart mr stewart this is mr franck ofrosenblaum and franck the diamond merchants keith said good morning and shook hands mr carpenter asked did you bring those stones up with you mr stewart ive got them here said keith he pulled a little cardboard box out of his jacket pocket and gave it to the solicitor mr carpenter opened it glanced inside and handed it to mr franck the diamond merchant took it glanced at the contents and frowned he took a monocle magnifying glass from his waistcoat pocket and fitted it in his right eye then he selected one of the largest stones and carried it to the window for a better light he stood in silence for a minute scrutinizing it then he scratched it with his thumbnail and examined it again whats this yellow stuff all over them he asked i dont know said keith thats how i found them is there something wrong theres this yellow gummy deposit on them said the diamond merchant have they been stored in oil not since yesterday said keith truthfully thats all i know he paused and asked a little anxiously would it matter if they had mr franck shook his head itll polish off i can scratch it off with my nail theyre diamonds all right he said at least this one is he came back to the desk and put the stone in the box with the others from his attache case he took a little black leather case opened it on the desk and erected a tiny set of scales with minute weights handled by a pair of forceps he weighed them all together very carefully then he pulled a typed list from his pocket and consulted it ninetyseven carats he said thoughtfully the diamonds that i sold commander dermott totalled ninetytwo carats but then theyve got this deposit on them now he took the two largest stones and weighed them carefully and the two smallest stones again consulting his list he counted them for number finally he put the lid on to the cardboard box and put away the scales i think there can be very little doubt that these stones are the stones i sold commander dermott he said i cant be absolutely sure until we have them polished and examine each stone individually i should like to take them and have that done giving you a receipt for them of course then i suppose that you would want them to be sold a few minutes later he left the office taking the diamonds with him asking the office girl to call a taxi to the door keith said well ill be getting along youll let me know what happens he got up and reached for his old shabby hat the solicitor got up with him youre looking very well he remarked much better than when i saw you last you must have been out in the sun i had a bit of a holiday said keith defensively a very good thing to do said mr carpenter they moved towards the door tell me he said did you ever do anything about the engine that was salvaged from your brotherinlaws yacht i had it shipped home said keith ive got it in the garden but its not much good not really the shadow of a smile appeared on mr carpenters face i dont suppose it is not now he said he moved to the door with keith i wish some of my other clients took their trusts as seriously as you have done he said i think commander dermott made a very wise choice of a trustee janice still goes to miss pearsons school in west baling but she is entered for the royal naval school for officers daughters at haslemere and she will go there next year after that katie would like her to go to oxford or to cambridge if she can get in and miss pearson thinks she probably will katie says that thats what jo would have wanted for her and she may be right jack and dawn donelly are married in a kind of way though there is still a little doubt about jacks marital status they live on raiatea island in the ties sous le vent at the southeast corner on baie hotopuu they lived first on the mary belle at anchor in the bay mostly on fish and cornmeal fritters but presently chuck ferris sent the flying cloud to raiatea with a prefabricated house for them broken down into small sections for deck cargo and captain petersen helped them to put up the main structure before sailing for home the completion of this house has kept jack busy woodworking which he does very well and he in turn has kept dawn busy for she had three children in one calendar year twin girls in january and a boy in december i believe there is another one on the way of course she lives some distance from a pharmacy chuck ferris is sending out another house to them to make a bit more room sol hirzhorn has just finished the congreve clock and is thinking about starting off on the hydraulic models in keiths serial julie still works for him and looks after him in the winters when mrs hirzhorn is in florida he would like keith to come out to the west again and bring katie and janice with him for a few weeks holiday keith has deferred this until janice is a little older but julie writes privately that sol really means it and that joe says that in view of keiths professional services the lares would certainly be chargeable to hirzhorn enterprises inc so keith will probably accept the invitation in a year or two keith finally sold the engine salvaged from shearwater for sixty pounds but it took him six months to do so it cost him fiftynine pounds eight shillings and tenpence in shipping charges from seattle so that he made a profit on the transr action katie no longer works in buckleys drapery shop in baling broadway they discovered that the interest on the sterling equivalent of seventeen thousand dollars just about equalled her wages at the shop and that all janices expenses were amply covered by the interest on her own money relieving them of the burden they had willingly assumed at the same time keiths correspondence throughout the world was growing to such an extent that some days he did nothing but write letters so katie gave up her job and bought a typewriter and a tape dictating machine and took charge of the letters she is not a julie perlberg and she never will be but keith by sitting in his chair and talking into the microphone can clear the heaviest mail in an hour or so and the letters get done somehow if you happen to be in the trolley bus from southall or from hanwell at about nine oclock on a friday morning you may see a little man get in at west baling dressed in a shabby raincoat over a blue suit he is one of hundreds of thousands like him in industrial england palefaced running to fat a little rather hard up his hands show evidence of manual work his eyes and forehead evidence of intellect a fitter or a machinist you think perhaps out of the toolroom if you follow him you will find that he gets out at ealing broadway and takes the underground to victoria station he comes up to the surface and walks along victoria street a little way to an office block where he climbs four flights of stone stairs to the dingy oldfashioned office of the miniature mechanic to deliver his copy he will come out presently and take a bus to chancery lane to spend the remainder of the day in the library of the patent office he will be home at somerset road ealing in time for tea he will spend the evening in the workshop working on the current model he has achieved the type of life that he desires he wants no other he is perfectly supremely happy
