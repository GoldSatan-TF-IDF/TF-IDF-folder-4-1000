struggling upward or luke larkins luck by horatio alger jr chapter i the waterbury watch one saturday afternoon in january a lively and animated group of boys were gathered on the western side of a large pond in the village of groveton prominent among them was a tall pleasantlooking young man of twentytwo the teacher of the center grammar school frederic hooper a b a recent graduate of yale college evidently there was something of importance on foot what it was may be learned from the words of the teacher now boys he said holding in his hand a waterbury watch of neat pattern i offer this watch as a prize to the boy who will skate across the pond and back in the least time you will all start together at a given signal and make your way to the mark which i have placed at the western end of the lake skate around it and return to this point do you fully understand yes sir exclaimed the boys unanimously before proceeding it may be well to refer more particularly to some of the boys who were to engage in the contest first in his own estimation came randolph duncan son of prince duncan president of the groveton bank and a prominent town official prince duncan was supposed to be a rich man and lived in a style quite beyond that of his neighbors randolph was his only son a boy of sixteen and felt that in social position and blue blood he was without a peer in the village he was a tall athletic boy and disposed to act the part of boss among the groveton boys next came a boy similar in age and physical strength but in other respects very different from the young aristocrat this was luke larkin the son of a carpenters widow living on narrow means and so compelled to exercise the strictest economy luke worked where he could helping the farmers in haytime and ready to do odd jobs for any one in the village who desired his services he filled the position of janitor at the school which he attended sweeping out twice a week and making the fires he had a pleasant expression and a bright resolute look a warm heart and a clear intellect and was probably in spite of his poverty the most popular boy in groveton in this respect he was the opposite of randolph duncan whose assumption of superiority and desire to boss the other boys prevented him from having any real friends he had two or three companions who flattered him and submitted to his caprices because they thought it looked well to be on good terms with the young aristocrat these two boys were looked upon as the chief contestants for the prize offered by their teacher opinions differed as to which would win i think luke will get the watch said fred acken a younger boy i dont know about that said tom harper randolph skates just as well and he has a pair of club skates his father sent to new york for them last week theyre beauties i tell you randolph says they cost ten dollars of course that gives him the advantage said percy hall look at lukes oldfashioned wooden skates they would be dear at fifty cents its a pity luke hasnt a better pair said harry wright i dont think the contest is a fair one luke ought to have an allowance of twenty rods to make up for the difference in skates he wouldnt accept it said linton tomkins the son of a manufacturer in groveton who was an intimate friend of luke and preferred to associate with him though randolph had made advances toward intimacy linton being the only boy in the village whom he regarded as his social equal i offered him my club skates but he said he would take the chances with his own linton was the only boy who had a pair of skates equal to randolphs he too was a contestant but being three years younger than luke and randolph had no expectation of rivaling them randolph had his friends near him administering the adulation he so much enjoyed i have no doubt youll get the watch randolph said sam noble youre a better skater any day than luke larkin of course you are chimed in tom harper the young janitor doesnt think so said randolph his lips curling oh hes conceited enough to think he can beat you i make no doubt said sam on those old skates too they look as if adam might have used them when he was a boy this sally of toms created a laugh his skates are old ones to be sure said randolph who was quicksighted enough to understand that any remark of this kind might dim the luster of his expected victory his skates are old enough but they are just as good for skating as mine they wont win him the watch though said sam i dont care for the watch myself said randolph loftily ive got a silver one now and am to have a gold one when im eighteen but i want to show that i am the best skater besides father has promised me ten dollars if i win i wish i had ten dollars said sam enviously he was the son of the storekeeper and his father allowed him only ten cents a week pocketmoney so that ten dollars in his eyes was a colossal fortune i have no doubt you would sam said tom joyously but you couldnt be trusted with so much money youd go down to new york and try to buy out a t stewart are you ready boys asked mr hooper most of the boys responded promptly in the affirmative but luke who had been tightening his straps said quickly i am not ready mr hooper my strap has broken indeed luke i am sorry to hear it said the teacher approaching and examining the fracture as matters stand you cant skate randolphs eyes brightened confident as he professed to feel he knew that his chances of success would be greatly increased by lukes withdrawal from the list the prize is yours now whispered tom it was before answered randolph conceitedly poor luke looked disappointed he knew that he had at least an even chance of winning and he wanted the watch several of his friends of his own age had watches either silver or waterbury and this seemed in his circumstances the only chance of securing one now he was apparently barred out its a pity you shouldnt skate luke said mr hooper in a tone of sympathy you are one of the best skaters and had an excellent chance of winning the prize is there any boy willing to lend luke his skates i will said frank acken my dear boy said the teacher you forget that your feet are several sizes smaller than lukes i didnt think of that replied frank who was only twelve years old you may use my skates luke said linton tomkins i think they will fit you linton was only thirteen but he was unusually large for his age you are very kind linton said luke but that will keep you out of the race i stand no chance of winning said linton and i will do my skating afterward i dont think that fair said randolph with a frown each boy ought to use his own skates there is nothing unfair about it said the teacher except that luke is placed at disadvantage in using a pair of skates he is unaccustomed to randolph did not dare gainsay the teacher but he looked sullen mr hooper is always favoring that beggar he said in a low voice to tom harper of course he is chimed in the toady you are very kind linny said luke regarding his friend affectionately i wont soon forget it oh its all right luke said linton now go in and win chapter ii tom harpers accident tom harper and sam noble were not wholly disinterested in their championship of randolph they were very ordinary skaters and stood no chance of winning the match themselves they wished randolph to win for each hoped as he had a silver watch himself already he might give the waterbury to his faithful friend and follower nothing in randolphs character granted such a hope for he was by no means generous or openhanded but each thought that he might open his heart on this occasion indeed tom ventured to hint as much i suppose randolph he said if you win the watch you will give it to me why should i asked randolph surveying tom with a cold glance youve got a nice silver watch yourself you know i might like to have two watches youll have the ten dollars your father promised you what if i have what claim have you on me tom drew near and whispered something in randolphs ear ill see about it said randolph nodding are you ready asked the teacher once more aye aye responded the boys one two three go the boys darted off like arrows from a bow luke made a late start but before they were half across the pond he was even with randolph and both were leading randolph looked sidewise and shut his mouth tight as he saw his hated rival on equal terms with him and threatening to pass him it would be humiliating in the extreme he thought to be beaten by such a boy but beaten he seemed likely to be for luke was soon a rod in advance and slowly gaining slowly for randolph was really a fine skater and had no rival except luke but luke was his superior as seemed likely to be proved though only these two stood any chance of final success all the boys kept up the contest a branch of a tree had been placed at the western end of the pond and this was the mark around which the boys were to skate luke made the circuit first randolph being about half a dozen rods behind after him came the rest of the boys in procession with one exception this exception was tom harper who apparently gave up the contest when halfway across and began skating about here and there apparently waiting for his companions to return tom harper has given up his chance said linton to the teacher so it seems replied mr hooper but he probably had no expectation of succeeding i should think he would have kept on with the rest i would have done so though my chance would have been no better than his indeed it seemed strange that tom should have given up so quickly it soon appeared that it was not caprice but that he had an object in view and that a very discreditable one he waited till the boys were on their way back by this time luke was some eight rods in advance of his leading competitor then tom began to be on the alert as luke came swinging on to victory he suddenly placed himself in his way lukes speed was so great that he could not check himself he came into collision with tom and in an instant both were prostrate tom however got the worst of it he was thrown violently backward falling on the back of his head and lay stunned and motionless on the ice luke fell over him but was scarcely hurt at all he was up again in an instant and might still have kept the lead but instead he got down on his knees beside tom and asked anxiously are you much hurt tom tom didnt immediately answer but lay breathing heavily with his eyes still closed meanwhile randolph with a smile of triumph swept on to his now assured victory most of the boys however stopped and gathered round luke and tom this accident had been watched with interest and surprise from the startingpoint tom must be a good deal hurt said linton what could possibly have made him get in lukes way i dont know said the teacher slowly it looks strange it almost seemed as if he got in the way on purpose linton continued he is a friend of randolph duncan is he not asked the teacher abruptly they are together about all the time ha commented the teacher as if struck by an idea he didnt however give expression to the thought in his mind a minute more and randolph swept into the presence of the teacher i believe i have won he said with a smile of gratification on his countenance you have come in first said the teacher coldly luke was considerably ahead when he ran into tom suggested linton thats not my lookout said randolph shrugging his shoulders the point is that i have come in first tom harper is a friend of yours is he not asked the teacher oh yes answered randolph indifferently he seems to be a good deal hurt it was very strange that he got in lukes way so it was said randolph without betraying much interest will you lend me your skates randolph asked linton i should like to go out and see if i can help tom in any way if any other boy than linton had made the request randolph would have declined but he wished if possible to add linton to his list of friends and graciously consented before linton could reach the spot tom had been assisted to his feet and with a dazed expression assisted on either side by luke and edmund blake was on his way back to the startingpoint what made you get in my way tom asked luke puzzled i dont know answered tom sullenly are you much hurt i think my skull must be fractured moaned tom oh not so bad as that said luke cheerfully ive fallen on my head myself but i got over it you didnt fall as hard as i did groaned tom no i presume not but heads are hard and i guess youll be all right in a few days tom had certainly been severely hurt there was a swelling on the back of his head almost as large as a hens egg youve lost the watch luke said frank acken randolph has got in first yes i supposed he would answered luke quietly and there is linton tomkins coming to meet us on randolphs skates randolph is sitting down on a log taking it easy what is your loss luke is his gain yes i think he might have come back to inquire after you tom as you are a friend of his tom looked resentfully at randolph and marked his complacent look and it occurred to him also that the friend he had risked so much to serve was very ungrateful but he hoped now at any rate to get the watch and thought it prudent to say nothing the boys had now reached the shore hope youre not much hurt tom said randolph in a tone of mild interest i dont know but my skull is fractured responded tom bitterly oh i guess not its the fortune of war well i got in first randolph waited for congratulations but none came all the boys looked serious and more than one suspected that there had been foul play they waited for the teacher to speak chapter iii randolph gets the watch it is true said the teacher slowly randolph has won the race randolphs face lighted up with exultation but it is also evident continued mr hooper that he would not have succeeded but for the unfortunate collision between luke larkin and tom harper here some of lukes friends brightened up i dont know about that said randolph at any rate i came in first i watched the race closely said the teacher and i have no doubt on the subject luke had so great a lead that he would surely have won the race but he didnt persisted randolph doggedly he did not as we all know it is also clear that had he not stopped to ascertain the extent of toms injuries he still might have won thats so said half a dozen boys therefore i cannot accept the result as indicating the superiority of the successful contestant i think i am entitled to the prize said randolph i concede that but under the circumstances i suggest to you that it would be graceful and proper to waive your claim and try the race over again the boys applauded with one or two exceptions i wont consent to that mr hooper said randolph frowning ive won the prize fairly and i want it i am quite willing randolph should have it sir said luke i think i should have won it if i had not stopped with tom but that doesnt affect the matter one way or the other randolph came in first as he says and i think he is entitled to the watch then said mr hooper gravely there is nothing more to be said randolph come forward and receive the prize randolph obeyed with alacrity and received the waterbury watch from the hands of mr hooper the boys stood in silence and offered no congratulations now let me say said the teacher that i cannot understand why there was any collision at all tom harper why did you get in lukes way because i was a fool sir answered tom smarting from his injuries and the evident indifference of randolph in whose cause he had incurred them that doesnt answer my question why did you act like a fool as you expressed it i thought i could get out of the way in time stammered tom who did not dare to tell the truth you had no other reason asked the teacher searchingly no sir what other reason could i have said tom but his manner betrayed confusion indeed i dont know returned the teacher quietly your action however spoiled lukes chances and insured the success of randolph and got me a broken head muttered tom placing his hand upon the swelling at the back of his head yes you got the worst of it i advise you to go home and apply cold water or any other remedy your mother may suggest randolph had already turned away meaning to return home tom joined him randolph would gladly have dispensed with his company but had no decent excuse as toms home lay in the same direction as his well randolph youve won the watch said tom when they were out of hearing of the other boys yes answered randolph indifferently i dont care so much for that as for the ten dollars my father is going to give me thats what i thought youve got another watch you know more valuable well what of it said randolph suspiciously i think you might give me the waterbury i havent got any why should i give it to you answered randolph coldly because but for me you wouldnt have won it nor the ten dollars neither how do you make that out the teacher said so himself i dont agree to it you cant deny it luke was seven or eight rods ahead when i got in his way then it was lucky for me it isnt lucky for me my head hurts awfully im very sorry of course that wont do me any good come randolph give me the watch like a good fellow well youve got cheek i must say i want the watch myself and is that all the satisfaction i am to get for my broken head exclaimed tom indignantly randolph was a thoroughly mean boy who if he had had a dozen watches would have wished to keep them all for himself ive a great mind to tell luke and the teacher of the arrangement between us there wasnt any arrangement said randolph sharply however as im really sorry for you i am willing to give you a quarter there now dont let me hear any more about the matter he drew a silver quarter from his vest pocket and tendered it to tom tom harper was not a sensitive boy but his face flushed with indignation and shame and he made no offer to take the money keep your quarter randolph duncan he said scornfully i think youre the meanest specimen of a boy that i ever came across any boy is a fool to be your friend i dont care to keep company with you any longer this to me exclaimed randolph angrily this is the pay i get for condescending to let you go with me you neednt condescend any longer said tom curtly and he crossed to the other side of the street randolph looked after him rather uneasily after all he was sorry to lose his humble follower hell be coming round in a day or two to ask me to take him back he reflected i would be willing to give him ten cents more but as for giving him the watch he must think me a fool to part with that chapter iv lukes night adventure i am sorry you have lost the watch luke said the teacher after randolphs departure you will have to be satisfied with deserving it i am reconciled to the disappointment sir answered luke i can get along for the present without a watch nevertheless luke did feel disappointed he had fully expected to have the watch to carry home and display to his mother as it was he was in no hurry to go home but remained for two hours skating with the other boys he used his friend lintons skates linton having an engagement which prevented his remaining it was five oclock when luke entered the little cottage which he called home his mother a pleasant woman of middle age was spreading the cloth for supper she looked up as he entered well luke she said inquiringly i havent brought home the watch mother he said randolph duncan won it by accident i will tell you about it after he had done so mrs larkin asked thoughtfully isnt it a little singular that tom should have got in your way yes i thought so at the time do you think there was any arrangement between him and randolph as you ask me mother i am obliged to say that i do it was a very mean trick said mrs larkin resentfully yes it was but poor tom was well punished for it why hes got a bunch on the back of his head almost as large as a hens egg i dont pity him said mrs larkin i pity him mother for i dont believe randolph will repay him for the service done him if randolph had met with the same accident i am not prepared to say that i should have pitied him much you might have been seriously injured yourself luke i might but i wasnt so i wont take that into consideration however mother watch or no watch ive got a good appetite i shall be ready when supper is luke sat down to the table ten minutes afterward and proved his words good much to his mothers satisfaction while he is eating we will say a word about the cottage it was small containing only four rooms furnished in the plainest fashion the rooms however were exceedingly neat and presented an appearance of comfort yet the united income of mrs larkin and luke was very small luke received a dollar a week for taking care of the schoolhouse but this income only lasted forty weeks in the year then he did odd jobs for the neighbors and picked up perhaps as much more mrs larkin had some skill as a dressmaker but groveton was a small village and there was another in the same line so that her income from this source probably did not average more than three dollars a week this was absolutely all that they had to live on though there was no rent to pay and the reader will not be surprised to learn that luke had no money to spend for watches are you tired luke asked his mother after supper no mother can i do anything for you i have finished a dress for miss almira clark i suppose she will want to wear it to church tomorrow but she lives so far away i dont like to ask you to carry it to her oh i dont mind it wont do me any harm you will get tired if i do i shall sleep the better for it you are a good son luke i ought to be havent i got a good mother so it was arranged about seven oclock after his chores were done for there was some wood to saw and split luke set out with the bundle under his arm for the house of miss clark a mile and a half away it was a commonplace errand that on which luke had started but it was destined to be a very important day in his life it was to be a turningpoint and to mark the beginning of a new chapter of experiences was it to be for good or ill that we are not prepared to reveal it will be necessary for the reader to follow his career step by step and decide for himself of course luke had no thought of this when he set out to him it had been a marked day on account of the skating match but this had turned out a disappointment he accomplished his errand which occupied a considerable time and then set out on his return it was halfpast eight but the moon had risen and diffused a mild radiance over the landscape luke thought he would shorten his homeward way by taking a path through the woods it was not over a quarter of a mile but would shorten the distance by as much more the trees were not close together so that it was light enough to see luke had nearly reached the edge of the wood when he overtook a tall man a stranger in the neighborhood who carried in his hand a tin box turning he eyed luke sharply boy whats your name he asked luke larkin our hero answered in surprise where do you live in the village yonder will you do me a favor what is it sir take this tin box and carry it to your home keep it under lock and key till i call for it yes sir i can do that but how shall i know you again take a good look at me that you may remember me i think i shall know you again but hadnt you better give me a name well perhaps so answered the other after a moments thought you may call me roland reed will you remember yes sir i am obliged to leave this neighborhood at once and cant conveniently carry the box explained the stranger heres something for your trouble luke was about to say that he required no money when it occurred to him that he had no right to refuse since money was so scarce at home he took the tin box and thrust the bankbill into his vest pocket he wondered how much it was but it was too dark to distinguish good night said luke as the stranger turned away good night answered his new acquaintance abruptly if luke could have foreseen the immediate consequences of this apparently simple act and the position in which it would soon place him he would certainly have refused to take charge of the box and yet in so doing it might have happened that he had made a mistake the consequences of even our simple acts are oftentimes farreaching and beyond the power of human wisdom to foreknow luke thought little of this as with the box under his arm he trudged homeward chapter v luke receives an invitation what have you there luke asked mrs larkin as luke entered the little sittingroom with the tin box under his arm i met a man on my way home who asked me to keep it for him do you know the man asked his mother in surprise no answered luke it seems very singular what did he say he said that he was obliged to leave the neighborhood at once and could not conveniently carry the box do you think it contains anything of value yes mother it is like the boxes rich men have to hold their stocks and bonds i was at the bank one day and saw a gentleman bring in one to deposit in the safe i cant understand that at all luke you say you did not know this man i never met him before and of course he does not know you no for he asked my name yet he put what may be valuable property in your possession i think said luke shrewdly he had no one else to trust it to besides a country boy wouldnt be very likely to make use of stocks and bonds no that is true i suppose the tin box is locked yes mother the owner he says his name is roland reed wishes it put under lock and key i can lock it up in my trunk luke i think that will be a good idea i hope he will pay you for your trouble when he takes away the tin box he has already i forgot to mention it and luke drew from his vest pocket the banknote he had thrust in as soon as received why its a tendollar bill he exclaimed i wonder whether he knew he was giving me as much i presume so luke said his mother brightening up you are in luck take it mother you will find a use for it but luke this money is yours no it is yours for you are going to take care of the box it was indeed quite a windfall and both mother and son retired to rest in a cheerful frame of mind in spite of lukes failure in the race i have been thinking luke said his mother at the breakfasttable that i should like to have you buy a waterbury watch out of this money it will only cost three dollars and a half and that is only onethird thank you mother but i can get along without the watch i cared for it chiefly because it was to be a prize given to the best skater all the boys know that i would have won but for the accident and that satisfies me i should like you to have a watch luke there is another objection mother i dont want any one to know about the box or the money if it were known that we had so much property in the house some attempt might be made to rob us that is true luke but i hope it wont be long before you have a watch of your own when luke was walking after breakfast he met randolph duncan with a chain attached to the prize watch ostentatiously displayed on the outside of his vest he smiled complacently and rather triumphantly when he met luke but luke looked neither depressed nor angry i hope your watch keeps good time randolph he said yes it hasnt varied a minute so far i think it will keep as good time as my silver watch you are fortunate to have two watches my father has promised me a gold watch when i am eighteen said randolph pompously i dont know if i shall have any watch at all when i am eighteen oh well you are a poor boy it doesnt matter to you i dont know about that randolph time is likely to be of as much importance to a poor boy as to a rich boy oh ah yes of course but a poor boy isnt expected to wear a watch here the conversation ended luke walked on with an amused smile on his face i wonder how it would seem to be as complacent and selfsatisfied as randolph he thought on the whole i would rather be as i am good morning luke it was a girls voice that addressed him looking up he met the pleasant glance of florence grant considered by many the prettiest girl in groveton her mother was a widow in easy circumstances who had removed from chicago three years before and occupied a handsome cottage nearly opposite mr duncans residence she was a general favorite not only for her good looks but on account of her pleasant manner and sweet disposition good morning florence said luke with an answering smile what a pity you lost the race yesterday randolph doesnt think so no he is a very selfish boy i am afraid did you see the race asked luke no but i heard all about it if it hadnt been for tom harper you would have won wouldnt you i think so all the boys say so what could have induced tom to get in the way i dont know it was very foolish however he got badly hurt tom is a friend of randolph said florence significantly yes answered luke but i dont think randolph would stoop to such a trick as that you wouldnt luke but randolph is a different boy besides i hear he was trying for something else i know his father offered him ten dollars besides i dont see why it is that some fare so much better than others remarked florence thoughtfully the watch and the money would have done you more good so they would florence but i dont complain i may be better off some day than i am now i hope you will luke said florence cordially i am very much obliged to you for your good wishes said luke warmly that reminds me luke next week thursday is my birthday and i am to have a little party in the evening will you come lukes face flushed with pleasure though he knew florence very well from their being schoolfellows he had never visited the house he properly regarded the invitation as a compliment and as a mark of friendship from one whose good opinion he highly valued thank you florence he said you are very kind and i shall have great pleasure in being present shall you have many about twenty your friend randolph will be there i think there will be room for both of us said luke with a smile the young lady bade him good morning and went on her way two days later luke met randolph at the drygoods store in the village what are you buying asked randolph condescendingly only a spool of thread for my mother i am buying a new necktie to wear to florence grants birthday party said randolph pompously i think i shall have to do the same said luke enjoying the surprise he saw expressed on randolphs face are you going demanded randolph abruptly yes have you been invited that is a strange question answered luke indignantly do you think i would go without an invitation really it will be quite a mixed affair said randolph shrugging his shoulders if you think so why do you go i dont want to disappoint florence luke smiled he was privately of the opinion that the disappointment wouldnt be intense chapter vi preparing for the party the evening of the party arrived it was quite a social event at groveton and the young people looked forward to it with pleasant anticipation randolph went so far as to order a new suit for the occasion he was very much afraid it would not be ready in time but he was not to be disappointed at five oclock on thursday afternoon it was delivered and randolph when arrayed in it surveyed himself with great satisfaction he had purchased a handsome new necktie and he reflected with pleasure that no boy present not even linton would be so handsomely dressed as himself he had a high idea of his personal consequence but he was also of the opinion that fine feathers make fine birds and his suit was of fine cloth and stylish make i wonder what the janitor will wear he said to himself with a curl of the lip a pair of overalls perhaps they would be very appropriate certainly this was just the question which was occupying lukes mind he did not value clothes as randolph did but he liked to look neat truth to tell he was not very well off as to wardrobe he had his everyday suit which he wore to school and a better suit which he had worn for over a year it was of mixed cloth neat in appearance though showing signs of wear but there was one trouble during the past year luke had grown considerably and his coatsleeves were nearly two inches too short and the legs of his trousers deficient quite as much nevertheless he dressed himself and he too surveyed himself not before a pierglass but before the small mirror in the kitchen dont my clothes look bad mother he asked anxiously they are neat and clean luke said his mother hesitatingly yes i know but they are too small you have been growing fast in the last year luke said his mother looking a little disturbed i suppose you are not sorry for that no answered luke with a smile but i wish my coat and trousers had grown too i wish my dear boy i could afford to buy you a new suit oh never mind mother said luke recovering his cheerfulness they will do for a little while yet florence didnt invite me for my clothes no she is a sensible girl she values you for other reasons i hope so mother still when i consider how handsomely randolph will be dressed i cant help thinking that there is considerable difference in our luck would you be willing to exchange with him luke there is one thing i wouldnt like to exchange and what is that i wouldnt exchange my mother for his said luke kissing the widow affectionately his mother is a cold proud disagreeable woman while i have the best mother in the world dont talk foolishly luke said mrs larkin but her face brightened and there was a warm feeling in her heart for it was very pleasant to her to hear luke speak of her in this way i wont think any more about it mother said luke ive got a new necktie at any rate and i will make that do just then there was a knock at the door and linton entered i thought i would come round and go to the party with you luke he said linton was handsomely dressed though he had not bought a suit expressly like randolph he didnt appear to notice lukes scant suit even if he had he would have been too much of a gentleman to refer to it i think we shall have a good time he said we always do at mrs grants florence is a nice girl and they know how to make it pleasant i suppose we shall have dancing i dont know how to dance said luke regretfully i should like to have taken lessons last winter when professor bent had a class but i couldnt afford it you have seen dancing oh yes it doesnt take much knowledge to dance a quadrille particularly if you get on a side set come we have an hour before it is time to go suppose i give you a lesson do you think i could learn enough in that time to venture yes i do if you make an occasional mistake it wont matter so if your mother will give us the use of the sittingroom i will commence instructions luke had looked at some dancers in the diningroom at the hotel and was not wholly a novice therefore linton was an excellent dancer and was clear in his directions it may also be said that luke was a ready learner so it happened at the end of the hour that the pupil had been initiated not only in the ordinary changes of the quadrille but also in one contra dance the virginia reel which was a great favorite among the young people of groveton now i think youll do luke said linton when the lesson was concluded you are very quick to learn you think i wont be awkward linton no if you keep cool and dont get flustered i am generally pretty cool but i shall be rather surprised to see myself on the floor laughed luke no doubt others will be but youll have a great deal more fun so i shall i dont like leaning against the wall while others are having a good time if you could dance as well as you can skate you would have no trouble luke no that is where randolph has the advantage of me he is a very great dancer though he cant come up to you in skating however dancing isnt everything dance as well as he may he doesnt stand as high in the good graces of florence grant as he would like to do i always noticed that he seemed partial to florence yes but it isnt returned how about yourself luke luke being a modest boy blushed i certainly think florence a very nice girl he said i was sure of that said linton smiling but i dont want to stand in your way linton continued luke with a smile no danger luke florence is a year older than i am now you are nearly two years older than she and are better matched so you neednt consider me in the matter of course this was all a joke it was true however that of all the girls in groveton luke was more attracted by florence grant than by any other and they had always been excellent friends it was well known that randolph also was partial to the young lady but he certainly had never received much encouragement finally the boys got out and were very soon at the door of mrs grants handsome cottage it was large upon the ground with a broad veranda in the southern style in fact mrs grant was southern by birth and erecting the house herself had it built after the fashion of her southern birthplace most of the young visitors had arrived when luke and linton put in an appearance they had been detained longer than they were aware by the dancinglesson randolph and sam noble were sitting side by side at one end of the room facing the entrance look said randolph with a satirical smile to his companion there comes the young janitor in his dress suit just look at his coatsleeves and the legs of his trousers they are at least two inches too short any other boy would be ashamed to come to a party in such ridiculous clothes sam looked and tittered lukes face flushed for though he did not hear the words he guessed their tenor but he was made to forget them when florence came forward and greeted linton and himself with unaffected cordiality chapter vii florence grants party lukes uncomfortable consciousness of his deficiencies in dress soon passed off he noticed the sneer on randolphs face and heard sams laugh but he cared very little for the opinion of either of them no other in the company appeared to observe his poor dress and he was cordially greeted by them all with the two exceptions already named the janitor ought to know better than to intrude into the society of his superiors said randolph to sam he seems to enjoy himself said sam this was half an hour after the party had commenced when all were engaged in one of the plays popular at a country party i am going to have a party myself in a short time continued randolph but i shall be more select than florence in my invitations i shall not invite any working boys right you are randolph said the subservient sam i hope you wont forget me oh no i shall invite you of course you dont move exactly in my circle but at any rate you dress decently if sam noble had had proper pride he would have resented the insolent assumption of superiority in this speech but he was content to play second fiddle to randolph duncan his family like himself were ambitious to be on good terms with the leading families in the village and did not mind an occasional snub shall you invite tom harper he asked he felt a little jealous of tom who had vied with him in flattering attentions to randolph no i dont think so tom isnt here is he he received an invitation but ever since his accident he has been troubled with severe headaches and i suppose that keeps him away he isnt up to my standard said randolph consequentially he comes of a low family you and he have been together a good deal oh i have found him of some service but i have paid for it yet this was the boy who at his own personal risk had obtained for randolph the prize at the skatingmatch privately sam thought randolph ungrateful but he was nevertheless pleased at having distanced tom in the favor of the young aristocrat after an hour spent in various amusements one of the company took her place at the piano and dancing began now is your time luke said linton secure a partner it is only a quadrille i feel a little nervous said luke perhaps i had better wait till the second dance oh nonsense dont be afraid meanwhile randolph with a great flourish had invited florence to dance thank you she answered taking his arm randolph took his place with her as head couple linton and annie comray faced them to randolphs amazement luke and fanny pratt took their places as one of the side couples randolph who was aware that luke had never taken lessons remarked this with equal surprise and disgust his lip curled as he remarked to his partner really i didnt know that luke larkin danced nor i answered florence i am sorry he is in our set why asked florence regarding him attentively he will probably put us out by his clownish performance wouldnt it be well to wait and see whether he does or not responded florence quietly randolph shrugged his shoulders i pity his partner at any rate he said i cant join in any such conversation about one of my guests said florence with dignity here the first directions were given and the quadrille commenced luke felt a little nervous it must be confessed and for that reason he watched with unusual care the movements of the head couples he was quick to learn and ordinarily cool and selfpossessed besides he knew that no one was likely to criticize him except randolph he saw the latter regarding him with a mocking smile and this stimulated him to unusual carefulness the result was that he went through his part with quite as much ease and correctness as any except the most practiced dancers florence said nothing but she turned with a significant smile to randolph the latter looked disappointed and mortified his mean disposition would have been gratified by lukes failure but this was a gratification he was not to enjoy the dance was at length concluded and luke as he led his partner to a seat felt that he had scored a success may i have the pleasure of dancing with you next time florence asked randolph thank you but i should not think it right to slight my other guests said the young lady just then luke came up and preferred the same request he would not have done so if he had not acquitted himself well in the first quadrille florence accepted with a smile i was not aware that dancing was one of your accomplishments luke she said nor i till this evening answered luke there stands my teacher and he pointed to linton you do credit to your teacher said florence i should not have known you were such a novice luke was pleased with this compliment and very glad that he had been spared the mortification of breaking down before the eyes of his illwisher randolph duncan it is hardly necessary to say that he did equally well in the second quadrille though he and florence were head couple the next dance was the virginia reel here florence had linton for a partner and luke secured as his own partner a very good dancer from prudence however he took his place at some distance from the head and by dint of careful watching he acquitted himself as well as in the quadrilles really luke you are doing wonderfully well said linton when the dance was over i can hardly believe that you have taken but one lesson and that from so poor a teacher as i am i couldnt have had a better teacher lin said luke i owe my success to you didnt you say luke couldnt dance asked sam noble of randolph later in the evening he cant answered randolph irritably he gets along very well i am sure he dances as well as i do that isnt saying much answered randolph with a sneer he could not help sneering even at his friends and this was one reason why no one was really attached to him sam walked away offended the party broke up at halfpast ten it was an early hour but late enough considering the youth of the participants luke accompanied home one of the girls who had no brother present and then turned toward his own home he had nearly reached it when a tall figure moving from the roadside put a hand on his shoulder you are luke larkin said the stranger in questioning tone yes sir is the tin box safe yes sir that is all for the present and the stranger walked quickly away who can he be thought luke in wonder and why should he have trusted a complete stranger and a boy evidently there was some mystery about the matter had the stranger come honestly by the box or was luke aiding and abetting a thief he could not tell chapter viii miss sprague discovers a secret about this time it became known to one person in the village that the larkins had in their possession a tin box contents unknown this is the way it happened among the bestknown village residents was miss melinda sprague a maiden lady who took a profound interest in the affairs of her neighbors she seldom went beyond the limits of groveton which was her world she had learned the business of dressmaking and often did work at home for her customers she was of a curious and prying disposition and nothing delighted her more than to acquire the knowledge of a secret one day a few days after florence grants party mrs larkin was in her own chamber she had the trunk open having occasion to take something from it when with a light step miss sprague entered the room the widow who was on her knees before the trunk turning recognized the intruder not without displeasure i hope youll excuse my coming in so unceremoniously mrs larkin said melinda effusively i knocked but you didnt hear it being upstairs and i took the liberty being as we were so well acquainted to come upstairs in search of you yes certainly answered mrs larkin but her tone was constrained she quickly shut the lid of the trunk there was only one thing among its contents which she was anxious to hide but that miss melindas sharp eyes had already discovered unfortunately the tin box was at one side in plain sight what on earth does mrs larkin do with a tin box she asked herself with eager curiosity can she have property that people dont know of i always thought she was left poor melinda asked no questions the sudden closing of the trunk showed her that the widow would not be inclined to answer any questions i wont let her think i saw anything she said to herself perhaps shell get anxious and refer to it we will go downstairs melinda said mrs larkin it will be more comfortable if you have anything to do up here i beg you wont mind me said the spinster no i have nothing that wont wait so the two went down into the sittingroom and how is luke asked miss sprague in a tone of friendly interest very well thank you luke was always a great favorite of mine continued the spinster such a manly boy as he is he is a great help to me said mrs larkin no doubt he is he takes care of the schoolhouse doesnt he yes how much pay does he get a dollar a week i hope he will be able to keep the position what do you mean melinda asked the widow not without anxiety you know doctor snodgrass has resigned on the school committee and squire duncan has been elected in his place well mrs flanagan went to him yesterday to ask to have her son tim appointed janitor in place of luke and i heard that she received considerable encouragement from the squire do they find any fault with luke asked mrs larkin jealously no not as ive heard but mrs flanagan said luke had had it for a year and now some one else ought to have the chance are you quite sure of this melinda miss sprague though over forty was generally called by her first name not as a tribute to her youth but to the fact of her being still unmarried yes i am i had it from mrs flanagan herself i dont think tim would do as well as luke he has never been able to keep a place yet just so but of course his mother thinks him a polygon probably miss sprague meant a paragon she was not very careful in her speech but mrs larkin did not smile at her mistake she was too much troubled at the news she had just heard a dollar a week may seem a ridiculous trifle to some of my readers but where the entire income of the family was so small it was a matter of some consequence i dont think luke has heard anything of this said the widow he has not mentioned it to me perhaps there wont be any change after all said melinda i am sure tim flanagan wouldnt do near as well as luke miss melinda was not entirely sincere she had said to mrs flanagan that she quite agreed with her that luke had been janitor long enough and hoped tim would get the place she was in the habit of siding with the person she chanced to be talking with at the moment and this was pretty well understood luke however had heard of this threatened removal for this it may be said randolph was partly responsible just after mrs flanagans call upon the squire to solicit his official influence prince duncan mentioned the matter to his son how long has luke larkin been janitor at the schoolhouse he asked about a year why do you ask does he attend to the duties pretty well i suppose so hes just fit to make fires and sweep the floor answered randolph his lip curling mrs flanagan has been here to ask me to appoint her son tim in lukes place youd better do it pa said randolph quickly why you say luke is well fitted for the position oh anybody could do as well but luke puts on airs he feels too big for his position i suppose mrs larkin needs the money so does mrs flanagan said randolph what sort of a boy is tim i have heard that he is lazy oh i guess hell do of course i am not well acquainted with a boy like him said the young aristocrat but im quite disgusted with luke he was at florence grants party the other evening and was cheeky enough to ask her to dance with him did she do so yes i suppose it was out of pity he ought to have known better than to attend a party with such a suit his coat and pantaloons were both too small for him but he flourished around as if he were fashionably dressed squire duncan made no reply to his sons comments but he felt disposed for reasons of his own to appoint tim flanagan he was hoping to be nominated for representative at the next election and thought the appointment might influence the irish vote in his favor shall you appoint tim pa asked randolph i think it probable it seems only right to give him a chance rotation in office is a principle of which i approve thats good thought randolph with a smile of gratification it isnt a very important place but luke will be sorry to lose it the first time i see him i will give him a hint of it randolph met luke about an hour later in the village street he did not often stop to speak with our hero but this time he had an object in doing so chapter ix luke loses his position luke larkin luke turned on hearing his name called and was rather surprised to see randolph hastening toward him how are you randolph he said politely where are you going asked randolph not heeding the inquiry to the schoolhouse to sweep out how long have you been janitor asked randolph abruptly about a year luke answered in surprise thats a good while luke was puzzled why should randolph feel such an interest all at once in his humble office i suppose you know that my father is now on the school committee randolph continued yes i heard so he thinks of appointing tim flanagan janitor in your place lukes face showed his surprise and concern the loss of his modest income would as he knew be severely felt by his mother and himself the worst of it was there seemed no chance in groveton of making it up in any other way did your father tell you this he asked after a pause yes he just told me answered randolph complacently why does he think of removing me are there any complaints of the way i perform my duties really my good fellow said randolph languidly i cant enlighten you on that point youve held the office a good while you know you are very kind to tell me this bad news said luke pointedly oh dont mention it good morning were you fatigued after your violent exercise at florence grants party no were you i didnt take any said randolph haughtily i danced i didnt jump round thank you for the compliment is there anything more you wish to say to me no then good morning when luke was left alone he felt serious how was he going to make up the dollar a week of which he was to be deprived the more he considered the matter the further he was from thinking anything he was not quite sure whether the news was reliable or merely invented by randolph to tease and annoy him upon this point however he was soon made certain the next day as he was attending to his duties in the schoolhouse tim flanagan entered heres a note for you luke he said luke opened the note and found it brief but significant it ran thus luke larkin i have appointed the bearer timothy flanagan janitor in your place you will give him the key of the schoolhouse and he will at once assume your duties prince duncan well tim said luke calmly it appears that you are going to take my place yes luke but i dont care much about it my mother went to the squire and got me the job the pays a dollar a week isnt it yes that isnt enough it isnt very much but there are not many ways of earning money here in groveton what do you have to do make the fire every morning and sweep out twice a week then theres dusting splitting up kindlings and so on i dont think ill like it i aint good at makin fires squire duncan writes you are to begin at once shure im afraid i wont succeed ill tell you what tim ill help you along till youve got used to the duties after a while theyll get easy for you will you now youre a good feller luke i thought you would be mad at losin the job i am not mad but i am sorry i needed the money but no doubt you do also i have no grudge against you luke had just started in his work he explained to tim how to do it and remained with him till it was done ill come again tomorrow tim he said i will get you well started for i want to make it easy for you tim was by no means a model boy but he was warmhearted and he was touched by lukes generous treatment i say luke he exclaimed i dont want to take your job say the word and ill tell mother and the squire i dont want it no tim its your duty to help your mother take it and do your best on his way home luke chanced to meet the squire walking in his usual dignified manner toward the bank of which he was president squire duncan he said walking up to him in a manly way i would like to speak a word to you say on young man tim flanagan handed me a note from you this morning ordering me to turn over my duties as janitor to him very well i have done so but i wish to ask you if i have been removed on account of any complaints that my work was not well done i have heard no complaints answered the squire i appointed timothy in your place because i approved of rotation in office it wont do any good for you to make a fuss about it i dont intend to make a fuss squire duncan said luke proudly i merely wished to know if there were any charges against me there are none then i am satisfied good morning sir stay young man is timothy at the schoolhouse yes sir i gave him some instruction about the work and promised to go over tomorrow to help him very well squire duncan was rather relieved to find that luke did not propose to make any fuss his motive as has already been stated was a political one he wished to ingratiate himself with irish voters and obtain an election as representative not that he cared so much for this office except as a steppingstone to something higher luke turned his steps homeward he dreaded communicating the news to his mother for he knew that it would depress her as it had him however it must be known sooner or later and he must not shrink from telling her mother he said as he entered the room where she was sewing i have lost my job as janitor i expected you would luke said his mother soberly who told you asked luke in surprise melinda sprague was here yesterday and told me tim flanagan was to have it miss sprague seems to know everything that is going on yes she usually hears everything have you lost the place already tim brought me a note this morning from squire duncan informing me that i was removed and he was put in my place it is going to be a serious loss to us luke said mrs larkin gravely yes mother but i am sure something will turn up in its place luke spoke confidently but it was a confidence he by no means felt it is a sad thing to be so poor as we are said mrs larkin with a sigh it is very inconvenient mother but we ought to be glad that we have perfect health i am young and strong and i am sure i can find some other way of earning a dollar a week at any rate we will hope so luke luke went to bed early that night the next morning as they were sitting at breakfast melinda sprague rushed into the house and sank into a chair out of breath have you heard the news no what is it the bank has been robbed a box of united states bonds has been taken amounting to thirty or forty thousand dollars luke and his mother listened in amazement chapter x melinda makes mischief where did you hear this melinda asked mrs larkin i called on mrs duncan just now i was doing some work for her and she told me isnt it awful was the bank broken open last night miss sprague asked luke i dont know when it was entered i dont understand it at all said luke looking puzzled all i know is that on examining the safe the box of bonds was missing then it might have been taken some time since yes it might the same thought came to luke and his mother at once was the mysterious stranger the thief and had he robbed the bank and transferred the tin box to luke it might be so but as this happened more than a fortnight since it would have been strange in that case that the box had not been missed sooner at the bank luke longed to have miss sprague go that he might confer with his mother on this subject he had been told to keep the possession of the box secret and therefore he didnt wish to reveal the fact that he had it unless it should prove to be necessary were any traces of the robber discovered he added not that i heard of but i pity the thief whoever he is remarked melinda when hes found out he will go to jail without any doubt i cant understand for my part how an outside party could open the safe said mrs larkin it seems very mysterious theres many things we cant understand said melinda shaking her head sagely all crimes are mysterious i hope theyll find out who took the bonds said the widow did they belong to the bank no they belonged to a gentleman in cavendish who kept them in the bank thinking they would be safer than in his own house little did he know what iniquity there was even in quiet country places like groveton surely melinda you dont think any one in groveton robbed the bank said mrs larkin theres no knowing said miss sprague solemnly theres those that we know well or think we do but we cannot read their hearts and their secret ways have you any suspicions miss sprague asked luke considerably amused at the portentous solemnity of the visitor i may and i may not luke answered melinda with the air of one who knew a great deal more than she chose to tell but it isnt proper for me to speak at present just then miss sprague saw some one passing who she thought had not heard of the robbery and hastily excusing herself she left the house what do you think luke asked his mother after the spinster had gone do you think the box we have was taken from the bank no i dont mother i did think it possible at first but it seems very foolish for the thief if he was one to leave the box in the same village in the charge of a boy it would have been more natural and sensible for him to open it take out the bonds and throw it away or leave it in the woods there is something in that said mrs larkin thoughtfully there is certainly a mystery about our box but i cant think it was stolen from the bank meanwhile miss sprague had formed an important resolve the more she thought of it the more she believed the missing box was the one of which she had caught a glimpse of in mrs larkins trunk true luke and the widow had not betrayed that confusion and embarrassment which might have been anticipated when the theft was announced but she had noticed the look exchanged between them and she was sure it meant something above all her curiosity was aroused to learn how it happened that a woman as poor as the widow larkin should have a tin box in her trunk the contents of which might be presumed to be valuable i dont like to get luke and his mother into trouble melinda said to herself but i think it my duty to tell all i know at any rate they will have to tell how the box came into their possession and what it contains ill go to the bank and speak to squire duncan prince duncan had called an extra meeting of the directors to consider the loss which had been discovered and they were now seated in the bank parlor there were three of them present all of whom resided in groveton mr manning the hotelkeeper mr bailey a storekeeper and mr beane the groveton lawyer miss sprague entered the bank and went up to the little window presided over by the payingteller is squire duncan in the bank she asked yes miss sprague i would like to speak with him that is impossible he is presiding at a directors meeting still i would like to see him persisted melinda you will have to wait said the payingteller coldly he had no particular respect or regard for miss sprague being quite familiar with her general reputation as a gossip and busybody i think he would like to see me said melinda nodding her head with mysterious significance there has been a robbery at the bank hasnt there do you know anything about it miss sprague demanded the teller in surprise maybe i do and maybe i dont but ive got a secret to tell to squire duncan i dont believe it amounts to anything thought the teller well i will speak to squire duncan he said aloud he went to the door of the directors room and after a brief conference with prince duncan he returned with the message you may go in miss sprague she nodded triumphantly and with an air of conscious importance walked to the bank parlor prince duncan and his associates were sitting round a mahogany table melinda made a formal curtsy and stood facing them i understand miss sprague that you have something to communicate to us in reference to the loss the bank has just sustained said the squire clearing his throat i thought it my duty to come and tell you all i knew squire duncan and gentlemen said melinda quite right miss sprague now what can you tell us the article lost was a tin box was it not yes about so long continued miss sprague indicating a length of about fifteen inches yes what was there in it government bonds i know where there is such a box said miss sprague slowly where please be expeditious miss sprague a few days since i was calling on mrs larkin lukes mother just happened in as i may say and not finding her downstairs went up into her chamber i dont think she heard me for when i entered the chamber and spoke to her she seemed quite flustered she was on her knees before an open trunk and in that trunk i saw the tin box the directors looked at each other in surprise and squire duncan looked undeniably puzzled i knew the box was one such as is used to hold valuable papers and bonds proceeded melinda and as i had always looked on the widow as very poor i didnt know what to make of it did you question mrs larkin about the tin box asked mr beane no she shut the trunk at once and i concluded she didnt want me to see it then you did not say anything about it no but i went in just now to tell her about the bank being robbed how did it seem to affect her asked mr bailey she and luke luke was there too looked at each other in dismay it was evident that they were thinking of the box in the trunk melinda continued her story and the directors were somewhat impressed i propose said mr manning that we get out a searchwarrant and search mrs larkins cottage that box may be the one missing from the bank chapter xi luke is arrested just after twelve oclock when luke was at home eating dinner a knock was heard at the front door ill go mother said luke and he rose from the table and going into the entry opened the outer door his surprise may be imagined when he confronted squire duncan and the gentlemen already mentioned as directors of the groveton bank did you wish to see mother he asked yes we have come on important business said squire duncan pompously walk in if you please luke led the way into the little sittingroom followed by the visitors the dinnertable was spread in the kitchen adjoining the room looked very much filled up with the unwonted company all being large men mother called luke here are some gentlemen who wish to see you the widow entered the room and looked with surprise from one to another all waited for squire duncan as the proper person from his official position to introduce the subject of their visit mrs larkin said the squire pompously it has possibly come to your ears that the groveton bank of which you are aware that i am the president has been robbed of a box of bonds yes sir i was so informed by miss melinda sprague this morning i am also informed that you have in your custody a tin box similar to the one that has been taken he expected to see mrs larkin show signs of confusion but she answered calmly i have a box in my custody but whether it resembles the one lost i cant say ha you admit that you hold such a box said the squire looking significantly at his companions certainly why should i not are you willing to show it to us yes we are willing to show it said luke taking it upon himself to answer but i have no idea that it will do you any good that is for us to decide young man said squire duncan do you suppose it is the box missing from the bank sir it may be when did you miss the box only this morning but it may have been taken a month ago this box has been in our possession for a fortnight such is your statement luke it is the truth said luke flushing with indignation my boy said mr beane dont be angry i for one have no suspicion that you have done anything wrong but it is our duty to inquire into this matter who told you that we had such a box mr beane miss melinda sprague was the informant i thought so mother said luke she is a prying old maid and it is just like her miss sprague only did her duty said the squire but we are losing time we require you to produce the box i will get it gentlemen said the widow calmly while she was upstairs mr manning inquired where did you get the box luke if you identify it as the box taken from the bank answered luke i will tell you otherwise i should prefer to say nothing for it is a secret of another person matters look very suspicious in my opinion gentlemen said squire duncan turning to his associates not necessarily said mr beane who seemed inclined to favor our hero luke may have a good reason for holding his tongue here mrs larkin presented herself with the missing box instantly it became an object of attention it looks like the missing box said the squire of course i can offer no opinion said mr beane not having seen the one lost such boxes however have a general resemblance to each other have you the key that opens it asked the squire no sir squire duncan asked mr beane have you the key unlocking the missing box no sir answered squire duncan after a slight pause then i dont think we can decide as to the identity of the two boxes the trustees looked at each other in a state of indecision no one knew what ought to be done what course do you think we ought to take squire duncan asked mr bailey i think said the bank president straightening up that there is sufficient evidence to justify the arrest of this boy luke i have done nothing wrong sir said luke indignantly i am no more of a thief than you are do you mean to insult me you young jackanapes demanded mr duncan with an angry flush on his face i intend to insult no one but i claim that i have done nothing wrong that is what all criminals say sneered the squire luke was about to make an angry reply but mr beane waving his hand as a signal for our hero to be quiet remarked calmly i think duncan in justice to luke we ought to hear his story as to how the box came into his possession that is my opinion said mr bailey i dont believe luke is a bad boy prince duncan felt obliged to listen to that suggestion mr bailey and mr beane being men of consideration in the village young man he said we are ready to hear your story from whom did you receive this box from a man named roland reed answered luke the four visitors looked at each other in surprise and who is roland reed asked the president of the bank it seems very much like a fictitious name it may be for aught i know said luke but it is the name given me by the person who gave me the box to keep for him state the circumstances said mr beane about two weeks since i was returning from the house of miss almira clark where i had gone on an errand for my mother to shorten my journey i took my way through the woods i had nearly passed through to the other side when a tall man darkcomplexioned whom i had never seen before stepped up to me he asked me my name and upon my telling him asked if i would do him a favor this was to take charge of a tin box which he carried under his arm the one before us asked mr manning yes sir did he give any reason for making this request he said he was about to leave the neighborhood and wished it taken care of he asked me to put it under lock and key did he state why he selected you for this trust asked mr beane no sir he paid me for my trouble however he gave me a banknote which when i reached home i found to be a tendollar bill and you havent seen him since once only when was that on the evening of florence grants party on my way home the same man came up to me and asked if the box was safe i answered yes he said that is all for the present and disappeared i have not seen him since that is a very pretty romance said prince duncan with a sneer i can confirm it said mrs larkin calmly i saw luke bring in the box and at his request i took charge of it the story he told at that time is the same that he tells now very possibly said the bank president it was all cut and dried you seem very much prejudiced against luke said mrs larkin indignantly by no means mrs larkin i judge him and his story from the standpoint of common sense gentlemen i presume this story makes the same impression on you as on me mr beane shook his head it may be true it is not impossible he said you believe then there is such a man as roland reed there may be a man who calls himself such if there is such a man he is a thief it may be so but that does not necessarily implicate luke he would be a receiver of stolen property not knowing it to be such at all events i feel amply justified in causing the arrest of luke larkin on his own statement surely you dont mean this exclaimed mrs larkin in dismay dont be alarmed mother said luke calmly i am innocent of wrong and no harm will befall me chapter xii luke as a prisoner prince duncan who was a magistrate directed the arrest of luke on a charge of robbing the groveton bank the constable who was called upon to make the arrest performed the duty unwillingly i dont believe a word of it luke he said its perfect nonsense to say you have robbed the bank id as soon believe myself guilty luke was not taken to the lockup but was put in the personal custody of constable perkins who undertook to be responsible for his appearance at the trial you mustnt run away or youll get me into trouble luke said the goodnatured constable its the last thing id be willing to do mr perkins said luke promptly then everybody would decide that i was guilty i am innocent and want a chance to prove it what was to be done with the tin box was the next question i will take it over to my house said squire duncan i object said mr beane do you doubt my integrity demanded the bank president angrily no but it is obviously improper that any one of us should take charge of the box before it has been opened and its contents examined we are not even certain that it is the one missing from the bank as mr beane was a lawyer prince duncan though unwillingly was obliged to yield the box therefore was taken to the bank and locked up in the safe till wanted it is hardly necessary to say that the events at the cottage of mrs larkin and lukes arrest made a great sensation in the village the charge that luke had robbed the bank was received not only with surprise but with incredulity the boy was so well and so favorably known in groveton that few could be found to credit the charge there were exceptions however melinda sprague enjoyed the sudden celebrity she had achieved as the original discoverer of the thief who had plundered the bank she was inclined to believe that luke was guilty because it enhanced her own importance most people call luke a good boy she said but there was always something about him that made me suspicious there was something in his expression i cant tell you what that set me to thinkin all wasnt right appearances are deceitful as our old minister used to say they certainly are if luke is a bad boy and a thief retorted the other indignantly you might be in better business melinda than trying to take away the character of a boy like luke i only did my duty answered melinda with an air of superior virtue i had no right to keep secret what i knew about the robbery you always claimed to be a friend of the larkins only last week you took tea there thats true i am a friend now but i cant consent to cover up inquiry do you know whether the bank has offered any reward for the detection of the thief no said the other shortly with a look of contempt at the eager spinster even if it did and poor luke were found guilty it would be bloodmoney that no decent person would accept really mrs clark you have singular ideas said the discomfited melinda i aint after no money i only mean to do my duty but if the bank should recognize the value of my services it would be only right and proper there was another who heard with great satisfaction of lukes arrest this was randolph duncan as it happened he was late in learning that his rival had got into trouble not having seen his father since breakfast this is great news about luke said his friend sam noble meeting him on the street what news i have heard nothing said randolph eagerly he has been arrested you dont say so exclaimed randolph what has he done robbed the bank of a tin box full of bonds it was worth an awful lot of money well well ejaculated randolph i always thought he was a boy of no principle the tin box was found in his mothers trunk what did luke say did he own up no he brazened it out he said the box was given him to take care of by some mysterious stranger thats too thin how was it traced to luke it seems old maid sprague it was lucky for melindas peace of mind that she did not hear this contemptuous reference to her went to the widow larkins house one day and saw the tin box in her trunk she didnt leave the trunk open did she no but she had it open looking into it when old melinda crept upstairs softly and caught her at it i suppose luke will have to go to states prison said randolph with a gratified smile i hope it wont be quite so bad as that said sam who was not equal in malice to his aristocratic friend i havent any pity for him said randolph decidedly if he chooses to steal he must expect to be punished just then mr hooper the grammarschool teacher came up mr hooper said randolph eagerly have you heard about luke i have heard that he has been removed from his janitorship and im sorry for it if he goes to jail he wouldnt be able to be janitor said randolph goes to jail what do you mean demanded the teacher sharply hereupon randolph told the story aided and assisted by sam noble to whom he referred as his authority this is too ridiculous said mr hooper contemptuously luke is no thief and if he had the tin box he has given the right explanation of how he came by it i know he is a favorite of yours mr hooper but that wont save him from going to jail said randolph tartly if he is a favorite of mine said the teacher with dignity it is for a very good reason i have always found him to be a highminded honorable boy and i still believe him to be so in spite of the grave accusation that has been brought against him there was something in the teachers manner that deterred randolph from continuing his malicious attack upon luke mr hooper lost no time in inquiring into the facts of the case and then in seeking out luke whom he found in the constables house luke he said extending his hand i have heard that you were in trouble and i have come to see what i can do for you you are very kind mr hooper said luke gratefully i hope you dont believe me guilty i would as soon believe myself guilty of the charge luke thats just what i said mr hooper said constable perkins just as if there wasnt more than one tin box in the world you never told any one that you had a tin box in your custody i suppose luke no sir the man who asked me to take care of it especially cautioned me to say nothing about it what was his name roland reed do you know where to find him it would be of service to you if you could obtain his evidence it would clear you at once i wish i could sir but i have no idea where to look for him that is unfortunate said the teacher knitting his brows in perplexity when are you to be brought to trial tomorrow i hear well luke keep up a good heart and hope for the best i mean to sir chapter xiii in the courtroom it was decided that luke should remain until his trial in the personal custody of constable perkins except for the name of it his imprisonment was not very irksome for the perkins family treated him as an honored guest and mrs perkins prepared a nicer supper than usual when mr perkins went out he said to his wife with a quizzical smile i leave luke in your charge dont let him run away ill look out for that said mrs perkins smiling perhaps i had better leave you a pistol my dear i am afraid i should not know how to use it you might tie my hands suggested luke that wouldnt prevent your walking away then my feet it wont be necessary husband said mrs perkins ive got the poker and tongs ready but though treated in this jesting manner luke could not help feeling a little anxious for aught he knew the tin box taken from his mothers trunk might be the same which had been stolen from the bank in that case roland reed was not likely to appear again and his story would be disbelieved it was a strange one he could not help admitting to himself yet he could not believe that the mysterious stranger was a burglar if he were it seemed very improbable that he would have left his booty within half a mile of the bank in the very village where the theft had been committed it was all very queer and he could not see into the mystery i should like to do something thought luke its dull work sitting here with folded hands isnt there something i can do mrs perkins he said i am not used to sitting about the house idle well you might make me some pies said mrs perkins youd never eat them if i did i can boil eggs and fry potatoes isnt there some wood to saw and split plenty out in the shed i understand that at any rate have you any objection to my setting to work no if you wont run away send out charlie to watch me charlie was a youngster about four years of age and very fond of luke who was a favorite with most young children yes that will do charlie go into the shed and see luke saw wood yes mama dont let him run away no i wont said charlie gravely luke felt happier when he was fairly at work it took his mind off his troubles as work generally does and he spent a couple of hours in the shed then mrs perkins came to the door and called him luke she said a young lady has called to see the prisoner a young lady who is it florence grant lukes face brightened up with pleasure he put on his coat and went into the house oh luke what a shame exclaimed florence hastening to him with extended hand i only just heard of it then youre not afraid to shake hands with a bank burglar said luke no indeed what nonsense it is who do you think told me of your arrest randolph duncan you have guessed it what did he say did he seem to be shocked at my iniquity i think he seemed glad of it of course he believes you guilty i supposed he would or pretend to at any rate i think his father is interested to make me out guilty i hope you dont think there is any chance of it of course not luke i know you too well id sooner suspect randolph he wanted to know what i thought of you now and what did you answer that i thought the same as i always had that you were one of the best boys in the village i admire your taste said randolph with a sneer then i gave him a piece of my mind i should like to have heard you florence i dont know you have no idea what a virago i am when i am mad now sit down and tell me all about it luke obeyed and the conversation was a long one and seemed interesting to both in the midst of it linton tomkins came in have you come to see the prisoner also linton asked florence yes florence what a desperatelooking ruffian he is i dont dare to come too near how did you break into the bank luke first luke smiled then he became grave after all it is no joke to me linny he said think of the disgrace of being arrested on such a charge the disgrace is in being a burglar not in being arrested for one luke of course its absurd father wants me to say that if you are bound over for trial he will go bail for you to any amount your father is very kind linny i may need to avail myself of his kindness the next day came and at ten oclock luke accompanied by constable perkins entered the room in which squire duncan sat as trial justice a considerable number of persons were gathered for it was a trial in which the whole village was interested among them was mrs larkin who wore an anxious perturbed look oh luke she said sorrowfully how terrible it is to have you here dont be troubled mother said luke we both know that i am innocent and i rely on god to stand by me luke said mr beane though i am a bank trustee i am your friend and believe you innocent i will act as your lawyer thank you mr beane i shall be very glad to accept your services the preliminary proceedings were of a formal character then miss melinda sprague was summoned to testify she professed to be very unwilling to say anything likely to injure her good friends luke and his mother but managed to tell quite dramatically how she first caught a glimpse of the tin box did mrs larkin know that you saw it asked the squire she didnt know for certain answered melinda but she was evidently afraid i would for she shut the trunk in a hurry and seemed very much confused i thought of this directly when i heard of the bank robbery and i went over to tell luke and his mother how did they receive your communication they seemed very much frightened and you inferred that they had not come honestly by the tin box it grieves me to say that i did said melinda putting her handkerchief to her eyes to brush away an imaginary tear finally melinda sat down and witnesses were called to testify to lukes good character there were more who wished to be sworn than there was time to hear mr beane called only mr hooper mr tomkins and lukes sundayschool teacher then he called luke to testify in his own defense luke told a straightforward story the same that he had told before replying readily and easily to any questions that were asked him i submit squire duncan said mr beane that my clients statement is plain and frank and explains everything i hold that it exonerates him from all suspicion of complicity with the robbery i differ with you said squire duncan acidly it is a wild improbable tale that does not even do credit to the prisoners invention in my opinion this mysterious stranger has no existence is there any one besides himself who has seen this roland reed at this moment there was a little confusion at the door a tall darkcomplexioned stranger pushed his way into the courtroom he advanced quickly to the front i heard my name called he said there is no occasion to doubt my existence i am roland reed chapter xiv an important witness the effect of roland reeds sudden appearance in the courtroom close upon the doubt expressed as to his existence was electric every head was turned and every one present looked with eager curiosity at the mysterious stranger they saw a darkcomplexioned slender but wiry man above the middle height with a pair of keen black eyes scanning not without sarcastic amusement the faces turned toward him luke recognized him at once thank god he ejaculated with a feeling of intense relief now my innocence will be made known squire duncan was quite taken aback his face betrayed his surprise and disappointment i dont know you he said after a pause perhaps not mr duncan answered the stranger in a significant tone but i know you were you the man who gave this tin box to the defendant wouldnt it be well since this is a court to swear me as a witness asked roland reed quietly of course of course said the squire rather annoyed to be reminded of his duty by this stranger this being done mr beane questioned the witness in the interest of his client do you know anything about the tin box found in the possession of luke larkin he asked yes sir did you commit it to his charge for safekeeping i did were you previously acquainted with luke i was not was it not rather a singular proceeding to commit what is presumably of considerable value to an unknown boy it would generally be considered so but i do many strange things i had seen the boy by daylight though he had never seen me and i was sure i could trust him why if you desired a place of safekeeping for your box did you not select the bank vaults roland reed laughed and glanced at the presiding justice it might have been stolen he said does the box contain documents of value the contents are valuable to me at any rate mr beane said squire duncan irritably i think you are treating the witness too indulgently i believe this box to be the one taken from the bank you heard the remark of the justice said the lawyer is this the box taken from the bank it is not answered the witness contemptuously and no one knows this better than mr duncan the justice flushed angrily you are impertinent witness he said it is all very well to claim this box as yours but i shall require you to prove ownership i am ready to do so said roland reed quietly is that the box on the table it is has it been opened no the key has disappeared from the bank the key is in the hands of the owner where it properly belongs with the permission of the court i will open the box i object said squire duncan quickly permit me to say that your refusal is extraordinary said mr beane pointedly you ask the witness to prove property and then decline to allow him to do so squire duncan who saw that he had been betrayed into a piece of folly said sullenly i dont agree with you mr beane but i withdraw my objection the witness may come forward and open the box if he can roland reed bowed slightly advanced to the table took a bunch of keys from his pocket and inserting one of the smallest in the lock easily opened the box those who were near enough including the justice craned their necks forward to look into the box the box contained papers certificates of stock apparently and a couple of bankbooks the box missing from the vault contained government bonds as i understand squire duncan said the lawyer yes answered the justice reluctantly are there any government bonds in the box mr reed you can see for yourself sir the manner of the witness toward the lawyer was courteous though in the tone in which he addressed the court there had been a scarcely veiled contempt i submit then that my young client has been guilty of no wrong he accepted the custody of the box from the rightful owner and this he had a clear right to do how do you know that the witness is the rightful owner of the box demanded the justice in a cross tone he may have stolen it from some other quarter there is not a shadow of evidence of this said the lawyer in a tone of rebuke i am not sure but that he ought to be held you will hold me at your peril mr duncan said the witness in clear resolute tones i have a clear comprehension of my rights and i do not propose to have them infringed squire duncan bit his lips he had only a smattering of law but he knew that the witness was right and that he had been betrayed by temper into making a discreditable exhibition of himself i demand that you treat me with proper respect he said angrily i am ready to do that answered the witness in a tone whose meaning more than one understood it was not an apology calculated to soothe the ruffled pride of the justice i call for the discharge of my young client squire duncan said the lawyer the case against him as i hardly need say has utterly failed he is discharged said the justice unwillingly instantly lukes friends surrounded him and began to shower congratulations upon him among them was roland reed my young friend he said i am sincerely sorry that by any act of mine i have brought anxiety and trouble upon you but i cant understand how the fact that you had the box in your possession became known this was explained to him i have a proposal to make to you and your mother said roland reed and with your permission i will accompany you home we shall be glad to have you sir said mrs larkin cordially as they were making their way out of the courtroom melinda sprague the cause of lukes trouble hurried to meet them she saw by this time that she had made a great mistake and that her course was likely to make her generally unpopular she hoped to make it up with the larkins i am so glad you are acquitted luke she began effusively i hope mrs larkin you wont take offense at what i did i did what i thought to be my duty though with a bleeding heart no one is more rejoiced at dear lukes vindication miss sprague said she if you think you did your duty let the consciousness of that sustain you i do not care to receive any visits from you hereafter how cruel and unfeeling you are mrs larkin said the spinster putting her handkerchief to her eyes mrs larkin did not reply miss sprague found herself so coldly treated in the village that she shortly left groveton on a prolonged visit to some relatives in a neighboring town it is to be feared that the consciousness of having done her duty did not wholly console her what she regretted most however was the loss of the reward which she had hoped to receive from the bank chapter xv the larkins are in luck luke and his mother accompanied by roland reed took their way from the courtroom to the widows modest cottage you may take the tin box luke said the stranger if you are not afraid to keep in your charge what has given you so much trouble alls well that ends well said luke yes i dont think it will occasion you any further anxiety roland reed walked in advance with mrs larkin leaving luke to follow what sort of a man is this mr duncan he asked abruptly squire duncan yes if that is his title he is upon the whole our foremost citizen answered the widow after a slight hesitation is he popular i can hardly say that he is president of the bank is he not yes how long has he lived in groveton nearly twenty years was he born in this neighborhood i think he came from the west does he say from what part of the western country he says very little about his past life roland reed smiled significantly perhaps he has his reasons he said meditatively is he thought to be rich he asked after a pause yes but how rich no one knows he is taxed for his house and grounds but he may have a good deal of property besides it is generally thought he has he does not appear to be friendly toward your son no answered mrs larkin with a trace of indignation though i am sure he has no cause to dislike him he seemed convinced that luke had come by your tin box dishonestly it seemed to me that he was prejudiced against luke how do you account for it perhaps his son randolph has influenced him so he has a son how old almost lukes age he thinks luke beneath him though why he should do so except that luke is poor i cant understand not long since there was a skating match for a prize of a waterbury watch offered by the grammarschool teacher which luke would have won had not randolph arranged with another boy to get in his way and leave the victory to him so randolph won the watch yes i suppose he had a watch of his own already yes a silver one while luke had none this makes it meaner in him i dont mind it now mother said luke who had overheard the last part of the conversation he is welcome to his watches i can wait has squire duncan shown his hostility to luke in any other way inquired the stranger yes luke has for over a year been janitor at the schoolhouse it didnt bring much only a dollar a week but it was considerable to us lately squire duncan was appointed on the school committee to fill a vacancy and his first act was to remove luke from his position not in favor of his son i conclude luke laughed randolph would be shocked at the mere supposition he said he is a young man who wears kid gloves and the duties of a school janitor he would look upon as degrading i really think luke you have been badly treated said roland reed with a friendly smile i have thought so too sir but i suppose i have no better claim to the office than any other boy you needed the income however yes sir by this time they were at the door of the cottage wont you come in sir asked mrs larkin cordially thank you i will not only do so but as i dont care to stay at the hotel i will even crave leave to pass the night under your roof if you dont mind our poor accommodations you will be very welcome i am not likely to complain mrs larkin i have not been nursed in the lap of luxury for two years i was a california miner and camped out for that long period i did not know what it was to sleep in a bed i used to stretch myself in a blanket and lie down on the ground you wont have to do that here mr reed said luke smiling but it must have been great fun how can you say so luke expostulated his mother it must have been very uncomfortable and dangerous to the health i wouldnt mind it a bit mother said luke stoutly roland reed smiled i am not surprised that you and your mother regard the matter from different points of view he said it is only natural women are not adapted to roughing it boys like nothing better and so with young men but there comes a time when a man passes forty when he sets a higher value on the comforts of life i dont mind confessing that i wouldnt care to repeat my old mining experiences i hope you were repaid for your trouble and privations sir yes i was handsomely repaid i may soon be as rich as your local magnate prince duncan but i have had to work harder for it probably so you know the squires name said mrs larkin in some surprise i must have heard it somewhere remarked roland reed have i got it right yes its a peculiar name when they reached the cottage mrs larkin set about getting supper in honor of her guest she sent out for some steak and baked some biscuit so that the table presented an inviting appearance when the three sat down to it after supper was over roland reed said i told you that i wished to speak to you on business mrs larkin it is briefly this are you willing to receive a boarder i am afraid sir that you would hardly be satisfied with our humble accommodations oh i am not speaking of myself but of a child i am a widower mrs larkin and have a little daughter eight years of age she is now boarding in new york but i do not like the people with whom i have placed her she is rather delicate also and i think a country town would suit her better than the city air i should like to have her under just such nice motherly care as i am sure you would give her i shall be very glad to receive her said mrs larkin with a flush of pleasure and for the terms i would rather you would name them sir then i will say ten dollars a week ten dollars exclaimed the widow in amazement it wont be worth half that i dont pay for board merely but for care and attendance as well she may be sick and that would increase your trouble she would in that case receive as much care as if she were my own daughter but i dont ask such an exorbitant rate of board it isnt exorbitant if i choose to pay it mrs larkin said mr reed smiling i am entirely able to pay that price and prefer to do so it will make me feel quite rich sir said the widow gratefully i shall find it useful especially as luke has lost his situation luke may find another position when do you wish your daughter to come asked mrs larkin luke will accompany me to the city tomorrow and bring her back with him by the way i will pay you four weeks in advance he drew four tendollar bills from his pocket and put them into the widows hand i am almost afraid this is a dream said mrs larkin you have made me very happy you mustnt become purseproud mother said luke because you have become suddenly rich can you be ready to take the first train to new york with me in the morning luke asked roland reed yes sir it starts at halfpast seven your breakfast will be ready on time said the widow and luke will call you chapter xvi lukes visit to new york the morning train to new york carried among its passengers luke and his new friend the distance was thirtyfive miles and the time occupied was a trifle over an hour the two sat together and luke had an opportunity of observing his companion more closely he was a man of middle age dark complexion with keen black eyes and the expression of one who understood the world and was well fitted to make his way in it he had already given the larkins to understand that he had been successful in accumulating money as for luke he felt happy and contented the tide of fortune seemed to have turned in his favor or rather in favor of his family the handsome weekly sum which would be received for the board of mr reeds little daughter would be sufficient of itself to defray the modest expenses of their household if he too could obtain work they would actually feel rich luke said his companion does your mother own the cottage where you live yes sir free of incumbrance not quite there is a mortgage of three hundred dollars held by squire duncan it was held by deacon tibbetts but about three months since squire duncan bought it what could be his object in buying it i dont know sir perhaps the deacon owed him money i am surprised then that he deprived you of your position as janitor since it would naturally make it more difficult for you to meet the interest that is true sir i wondered at it myself your house is a small one but the location is fine it would make a building lot suitable for a gentlemans summer residence yes sir there was a gentleman in the village last summer who called upon mother and tried to induce her to sell did he offer her a fair price no sir he said he should have to take down the cottage and he only offered eight hundred dollars mother would have sold for a thousand tell her not to accept even that offer but to hold on to the property some day she can obtain considerably more she wont sell unless she is obliged to replied luke a few days since i thought we might have to do it now with the generous sum which you allow for your little girls board there will be no necessity has squire duncan broached the subject to your mother he mentioned it one day but he wanted her to sell for seven hundred dollars he is evidently sharp at a bargain yes sir he is not considered liberal there was one thing that troubled luke in spite of the pleasure he anticipated from his visit to new york he knew very well that his clothes were shabby and he shrank from the idea of appearing on broadway in a patched suit too small for him but he had never breathed a word of complaint to his mother knowing that she could not afford to buy him another suit and he did not wish to add to her troubles it might have happened that occasionally he fixed a troubled look on his clothes but if roland reed noticed it he did not make any comment but when they reached new york and found themselves on broadway his companion paused in front of a large clothing store with large plateglass windows and said quietly come in luke i think you need some new clothes lukes face flushed with pleasure but he said i have no money mr reed i have said roland reed significantly you are very kind sir said luke gratefully it costs little to be kind when you have more money than you know what to do with said reed i dont mean that i am a vanderbilt or an astor but my income is much greater than i need to spend on myself a suit was readily found which fitted luke as well as if it had been made for him it was of gray mixed cloth made in fashionable style you may as well keep it on luke then to the shopman have you a nice suit of black cloth and of the same size yes sir answered the salesman readily he may as well have two while we are about it as to the old suit it is too small and we will leave it here to be given away to some smaller boy luke was quite overwhelmed by his new friends munificence i dont think mother will know me he said as he surveyed himself in a long mirror then i will introduce you or give you a letter of introduction have you a watch luke no sir you know i did not get the prize at the skating match true then i must remedy the deficiency they took the roadway stage down below the astor house it was before the days of jacob sharps horse railway and got out at benedicts there mr reed made choice of a neat silver watch manufactured at waltham and bought a plated chain to go with it put that in your vest pocket he said it may console you for the loss of the waterbury how can i ever repay you for your kindness mr reed said luke overjoyed i have taken a fancy to you luke said his companion i hope to do more for you soon now we will go uptown and i will put my little girl under your charge luke had dreaded making a call at a nice city house in his old suit now he looked forward to it with pleasure especially after his new friend completed his benefactions by buying him a new pair of shoes and a hat luke asked his companion as they were on their way uptown in a sixth avenue car do you know who owned the box of bonds taken from the groveton bank i have heard that it was a mr armstrong now traveling in europe how did he come to leave the box in a village bank he is some acquaintance of squire duncan and spent some weeks last summer at the village hotel then probably he left the box there at the suggestion of duncan the president i dont know sir but i think it very likely humph this is getting interesting the contents of the box were government bonds i have heard i heard squire duncan say so were they coupon or registered what difference would that make sir the first could be sold without trouble by the thief while the last could not be disposed of without a formal transfer from the owner then it would not pay to steal them just so luke do you know a strange idea has come into my head what is it sir i think prince duncan knows more about how those bonds were spirited away than is suspected luke was greatly surprised you dont think he took them himself do you he asked that remains to be seen it is a curious affair altogether i may have occasion to speak of it another time are you a good writer fair i believe sir i have recently come into possession of a business in a city in ohio which i carry on through a paid agent among other things i have bought out the old accounts i shall need to have a large number of bills made out covering a series of years which i shall then put into the hands of a collector and realize so far as i can this work with a little instruction i think you can do i shall be very glad to do it sir you will be paid fairly for the labor i dont need any pay mr reed you have already paid me handsomely you refer to the clothing and the watch those are gifts i will pay you thirty cents an hour for the time employed leaving you to keep the account the books of the firm i have at the house where my daughter is boarding you will take them back to groveton with you this is a fortunate day for me said luke it will pay me much better than the janitorship do your duty luke and your good fortune will continue but here is our street they left the car at the corner of fourteenth street and sixth avenue and turning westward paused in front of a fourstory house of good appearance chapter xvii randolph is mystified in an hour luke with the little girl under his charge was on his way to the depot accompanied by mr reed who paid for their tickets and bade them goodbye promising to communicate with luke rosa reed was a bright little girl of about eight years of age she made no opposition to going with luke but put her hand confidently in his and expressed much pleasure at the prospect of living in the country she had been under the care of two maiden ladies the misses graham who had no love for children and had merely accepted the charge on account of the liberal terms paid them by the father they seemed displeased at the withdrawal of rosa and clearly signified this by their cold stiff reception of mr reed and luke the old girls dont like to part with rosa he said with a smile as they emerged into the street are you sorry to leave them rosa he inquired no they aint a bit pleasant answered the little girl decidedly were they strict with you asked luke yes they were always saying little girls should be seen and not heard they didnt want me to make a bit of noise and wouldnt let me have any little girls in to play with me are there any little girls at your home no but there are some living near by and they will come to see you that will be nice said rosa with satisfaction directions were left to have the little girls trunk go to groveton by express and therefore luke was encumbered only by a small satchel belonging to his new charge of the details of the journey it is unnecessary to speak the two young travelers arrived at groveton and as it chanced reached lukes cottage without attracting much observation the door was opened by the widow whose kind manner at once won the favor of the child i like you much better than miss graham she said with childish frankness i am glad of that my child said mrs larkin i will try to make this a pleasant home for you i like luke too said rosa really rosa you make me blush said luke i am not used to hearing young ladies say they like me i think he is a good boy said rosa reflectively isnt he mrs larkin i think so my dear said the widow smiling then i suppose i shall have to behave like one said luke do you think i have improved in appearance mother i noticed your new suit at once luke i have another in this bundle mother and that isnt all do you see this watch i shant mourn the loss of the waterbury any longer mr reed is certainly proving a kind friend luke we have much reason to be grateful he has also provided me with employment for a time mother and then luke told his mother about the copying he had engaged to do it is hardy necessary to say that the heart of the widow was unfeignedly thankful for the favorable change in their fortunes and she did not omit to give thanks to providence for raising up so kind and serviceable a friend about the middle of the afternoon luke made his appearance in the village street though i hope my readers will not suspect him of being a dude he certainly did enjoy the consciousness of being well dressed he hoped he should meet randolph anticipating the surprise and disappointment of the latter at the evidence of his prosperity when luke was arrested randolph rejoiced as only a mean and spiteful boy would be capable of doing at the humiliation and anticipated disgrace of a boy whom he disliked he had indulged in more than one expression of triumph and sought every opportunity of discussing the subject to the disgust of all fairminded persons even sam noble protested though a toady of randolph look here randolph he said i dont like luke overmuch and i know he doesnt like me but i dont believe hes a thief and i am sorry he is in trouble then you are no friend of mine said randolph looking black oh i say randolph you know better than that havent i always stood up for you and done whatever you wanted me to if you were my friend you wouldnt stand up for luke i am not a friend of his and i am a friend of yours but i dont want him to go to prison i do if he deserves it i dont believe he does deserve it that is what i complain of in you the fact is randolph you expect too much if you want to break friendship all right randolph was amazed at this unexpected independence on the part of one whom he regarded as his bond slave but being hardly prepared to part with him especially as his other follower tom harper had partially thrown off his allegiance thought it prudent to be satisfied with sams expressions of loyalty even if they did not go as far as he wished randolph missed luke at school on the day after the trial of course he had no idea that our hero was out of school and hastily concluded that on account of his trial he was ashamed to show himself i dont wonder he doesnt want to show himself he remarked to tom harper why not he has been acquitted never mind he has been under arrest and may yet be guilty in spite of his acquittal have you seen him today no probably he is hiding at home well it shows some sort of shame on his way home from school randolph was destined to be surprised not far from his own house he met luke arrayed in his new suit with a chain that looked like gold crossing his waistcoat instead of looking confused and ashamed luke looked uncommonly bright and cheerful randolph was amazed what could it all mean he had intended not to notice luke but to pass him with a scornful smile but his curiosity got the better of him why were you not at school today he asked abruptly luke smiled i didnt think you would miss me randolph i didnt but wondered at your absence i was detained by business i expect to have the pleasure of seeing you there tomorrow humph you seem to have invested in a new suit yes my old suit was getting decidedly shabby as you kindly remarked at florence grants party where did you get them in new york in new york repeated randolph in surprise when did you go there this morning it was that which detained me from school i see youve got a new watchchain too randolph emphasized the word chain satirically being under the impression that no watch was attached yes you may like to see my new watch and luke with pardonable triumph produced his new watch which was a stemwinder whereas randolphs was only a keywinder randolph condescended to take the watch in his hands and examine it where was this bought he asked at benedicts you seem to have plenty of money he said with unpleasant significance i should like more only you are rather imprudent in making such extensive purchases so soon after your trial what do you mean demanded luke quickly what should i mean it is evident that you robbed the bank after all i shall tell my father and you may find your trouble is not over look here randolph duncan said luke sternly i look upon that as an insult and i dont mean to be insulted i am no more a thief than you are and that you know do you mean to charge me with being a thief fumed randolph no i only say you are as much a thief as i am if you repeat your insult i shall be obliged to knock you down you impudent loafer screamed randolph youll be sorry for this ill have you arrested over again i have no doubt you would if you had the power i shant lie awake nights thinking of it if you have nothing more to say i will leave you randolph did not reply probably because he was at a loss what to say but went home angry and mystified where could luke have got his watch and new suit he asked himself this many times but no possible explanation suggested itself scarcely had luke parted with randolph when he met his friend linton who surveyed lukes improved appearance with pleasure and surprise i say luke are you setting up for a dude i thought a little of it answered luke with a smile and then he explained the cause of his good fortune i have only one regret he added randolph seems to be grieved over it he liked me better in my old suit besides i have a new watch and it turns out to be better than his here he displayed his new silver watch linton felt a generous pleasure in lukes luck and it may truly be said rejoiced more at it than he would at any piece of good fortune to himself by the way luke he said i am going to give a party next thursday evening and i give you the very first invitation it is my birthday you know i accept with pleasure sir i look upon you as my warmest friend and as long as i retain your friendship i shall not care for randolphs malice chapter xviii mr duncans secret about two weeks later prince duncan sat at his desk with a troubled look open before him were letters one was postmarked london and ran as follows my dear sir i have decided to shorten my visit and shall leave liverpool next saturday en route for new york you will see therefore that i shall arrive nearly as soon as the letter i am now writing i have decided to withdraw the box of securities i deposited in your bank and shall place it in a safedeposit vault in new york you may expect to see me shortly yours in haste john armstrong drops of perspiration gathered on the brow of prince duncan as he read this letter what would mr armstrong say when he learned that the box had mysteriously disappeared that he would be thoroughly indignant and make it very unpleasant for the president of groveton bank was certain he would ask among other things why mr duncan had not informed him of the loss by cable and no satisfactory explanation could be given he would ask furthermore why detectives had not been employed to ferret out the mystery and here again no satisfactory explanation could be given prince duncan knew very well that he had a reason but it was not one that could be disclosed he next read the second letter and his trouble was not diminished it was from a wall street broker informing him that the erie shares bought for him on a margin had gone down two points and it would be necessary for him to deposit additional margin or be sold out why did i ever invest in erie thought duncan ruefully i was confidently assured that it would go up that it must go up and here it is falling and heaven knows how much lower it will go at this point the door opened and randolph entered he had a special favor to ask he had already given his father several hints that he would like a gold watch being quite dissatisfied with his silver watch now that luke larkin possessed one superior to his he had chosen a very unfavorable moment for his request as he soon found out father he said i have a favor to ask what is it asked prince duncan with a frown i wish you would buy me a gold watch oh you do sneered his father i was under the impression that you had two watches already so i have but one is a waterbury and the other a cheap silver one well they keep time dont they yes then what more do you want luke larkin has a silver watch better than mine a stemwinder suppose he has i dont want a working boy like him to outshine me where did he get his watch i dont know he wont tell will you buy me a gold one father then i can look down upon him again no i cant money is very scarce with me just now then i dont want to wear a watch at all said randolph pettishly suit yourself said his father coldly now you may leave the room i am busy randolph left the room he would have slammed the door behind him but he knew his fathers temper and he did not dare to do so what am i to do prince duncan asked himself anxiously i must send money to the brokers or they will sell me out and i shall meet with a heavy loss after a little thought he wrote a letter enclosing a check but dated it two days ahead they will think it a mistake he thought and it will give me time to turn around now for money to meet the check when it arrives prince duncan went upstairs and locking the door of his chamber opened a large trunk in one corner of the room from under a pile of clothing he took out a tin box and with hands that trembled with excitement he extracted therefrom a dozen government bonds one was for ten thousand dollars one for five and the remainder were for one thousand dollars each if they were only sold and the money deposited in the bank to my credit he thought i am almost sorry i started in this thing the risk is very great but but i must have money at this moment some one tried the door prince duncan turned pale and the bonds nearly fell from his hands whos there he asked it is i papa answered randolph then you may go downstairs again answered his father angrily i dont want to be disturbed wont you open the door a minute i just want to ask a question no i wont clear out exclaimed the bank president angrily what a frightful temper father has thought the discomfited randolph there was nothing for it but to go downstairs and he did so in a very discontented frame of mind it seems to me that something is going contrary said duncan to himself it is clear that it wont do to keep these bonds here any longer i must take them to new york tomorrow and raise money on them on second thought tomorrow he decided only to take the fivethousanddollar bond and five of the one thousand fearing that too large a sale at one time might excite suspicion carefully selecting the bonds referred to he put them away in a capacious pocket and locking the trunk went downstairs again there is still time to take the elevenoclock train he said consulting his watch i must do it seeking his wife he informed her that he would take the next train for new york isnt this rather sudden she asked in surprise a little perhaps but i have a small matter of business to attend to besides i think the trip will do me good i am not feeling quite as well as usual i believe i will go too said mrs duncan unexpectedly i want to make some purchases at stewarts this suggestion was very far from agreeable to her husband really i am he said i must disappoint you my time will be wholly taken up by matters of business and i cant go with you you dont need to i can take care of myself and we can meet at the depot at four oclock besides i cant supply you with any money for shopping i have enough i might have liked a little more but i can make it do perhaps it will look better if we go in company thought prince duncan she neednt be in my way for we can part at the station very well jane he said quietly if you wont expect me to dance attendance upon you i withdraw my objections the elevenoclock train for new york had among its passengers mr and mrs duncan there was another passenger whom neither of them noticed a small insignificantlooking man who occasionally directed a quick glance at the portly bank president chapter xix effecting a loan prince duncan was unusually taciturn during the railroad journey so much so that his wife noticed it and inquired the reason business my dear answered the bank president i am rather perplexed by a matter of business business connected with the bank mr duncan asked his wife no private business have you heard anything yet of the stolen bonds not yet have you any suspicion none that i am at liberty to mention answered duncan looking mysterious i suppose you no longer suspect that boy luke i dont know the man who owns to having given him the tin box for safekeeping is in my opinion a suspicious character i shouldnt be at all surprised if he were a jailbird the small man already referred to who occupied a seat just across the aisle here smiled slightly but whether at the presidents remark is not clear what did he call himself roland reed no doubt an alias it seems to me you ought to follow him up and see if you cant convict him of the theft you may be sure jane that the president and directors of the groveton bank will do their duty in this matter said mr duncan rather grandiloquently by the way i have received this morning a letter from mr armstrong the owner of the stolen bonds saying that he will be at home in a few days does he know of the loss not yet how will he take it really jane you are very inquisitive this morning i presume he will be very much annoyed the car had become quite warm and mr duncan who had hitherto kept on his overcoat rose to take it off unfortunately for him he quite forgot the bonds he had in the inside pocket and in his careless handling of the coat the package fell upon the floor of the car one slipping out of the envelope a bond for one thousand dollars prince duncan turned pale and stooped to pick up the package but the small man opposite was too quick for him he raised the package from the floor and handing it to the bank president with a polite bow said with a smile you wouldnt like to lose this sir no answered duncan gruffly angry with the other for anticipating him it was awkward of me mrs duncan also saw the bond and inquired with natural curiosity do they belong to the bank mr duncan no they are my own i am glad of that what are you going to do with them hush it is dangerous to speak of them here some one might hear and i might be followed i am very much annoyed that they have been seen at all this closed mrs duncans mouth but she resolved to make further inquiries when they were by themselves prince duncan looked askance at his opposite neighbor he was a man who had come to groveton recently and had opened a billiard saloon and bar not far from the bank he was not regarded as a very desirable citizen and had already excited the anxiety of parents by luring into the saloon some of the boys and young men of the village among them though squire duncan did not know it was his own son randolph who had already developed quite a fondness for playing pool and even occasionally patronized the bar this had he known it would have explained randolphs increased applications for money whether tony denton his full name was anthony denton had any special object in visiting new york i am unable to state at all events it appeared that his business lay in the same direction as that of prince duncan for on the arrival of the train at the new york depot he followed the bank president at a safe distance and was clearly bent upon keeping him in view mr duncan walked slowly and appeared to be plunged in anxious thought his difficulties were by no means over he had the bonds to dispose of and he feared the large amount might occasion suspicion they were coupon bonds and bore no name or other evidence of ownership yet the mere fact of having such a large amount might occasion awkward inquiries heres yer mornin papers called a negro newsboy thrusting his bundle in front of the country banker give me a herald said mr duncan opening the paper his eye ran hastily over the columns it lighted up as he saw a particular advertisement the very thing he said to himself this was the advertisement loan office we are prepared to loan sums to suit on firstclass security at a fair rate of interest call or address sharp ketchum no wall street third floor i will go there prince duncan suddenly decided i will borrow what i can on these bonds and being merely held on collateral they will be kept out of the market at the end of six months say i will redeem them or order them sold and collect the balance minus the interest having arrived at this conclusion he quickened his pace his expression became more cheerful and he turned his steps toward wall street what did the old fellow see in the paper thought tony denton who still undiscovered followed mr duncan closely it is something that pleased him evidently he beckoned the same newsboy bought a herald also and turning to that part of the paper on which the bankers eyes had been resting discovered sharp ketchums advertisement thats it ill bet a hat he decided he is going to raise money on the bonds ill follow him when duncan turned into wall street tony denton felt that he had guessed correctly he was convinced when the bank president paused before the number indicated in the advertisement it wont do for me to follow him in he said to himself nor will it be necessary i can remember the place and turn it to my own account by and by prince duncan went upstairs and paused before a door on which was inscribed sharp ketchum bankers loans negotiated he opened the door and found the room furnished in the style of a private bankingoffice is mr sharp or mr ketchum in he inquired of a sharpfaced young clerk the son as it turned out of the senior partner yes sir mr sharp is in is he at leisure i wish to see him on business go in there sir said the clerk pointing to a small private room in the corner of the office following the directions mr duncan found himself in the presence of a man of about fifty with a hatchet face much puckered with wrinkles and a very foxy expression i am mr sharp he said in answer to an inquiry prince duncan unfolded his business he wished to borrow eight or nine thousand dollars on ten thousand dollars worth of united states government bonds why dont you sell at once asked sharp keenly because i wish for special reasons to redeem these identical bonds say six months hence they are your own asked mr sharp they are a part of my wifes estate of which i have control i do not however wish her to know that i have raised money on them answered duncan with a smooth falsehood of course that makes a difference however i will loan you seven thousand dollars and you will give me your note for seven thousand five hundred at the usual interest with permission to sell the bonds at the end of six months if the note remains unpaid then i to hand you the balance prince duncan protested against these terms as exorbitant but was finally obliged to accede to them on the whole he was fairly satisfied the check would relieve him from all his embarrassments and give him a large surplus so far so good said tony denton as he saw mr duncan emerge into the street if i am not greatly mistaken this will prove a lucky morning for me chapter xx luke talks with a capitalist luke worked steadily on the task given him by his new patron during the first week he averaged three hours a day with an additional two hours on saturday making in all twenty hours making at thirty cents per hour six dollars this luke considered fair pay considering that he was attending school and maintaining good rank in his classes why dont we see more of you luke asked his friend linton one day you seem to stay in the house all the time because i am at work linny last week i made six dollars how asked linton surprised by copying and making out bills for mr reed that is better than being janitor at a dollar a week yes but i have to work a good deal harder i am afraid you are working too hard i shouldnt like to keep it up but it is only for a short time if i gave up school i should find it easy enough but i dont want to do that no i hope you wont i should miss you and so would all the boys including randolph duncan i dont know about that by the way i hear that randolph is spending a good deal of his time at tony dentons billiard saloon i am sorry to hear it it hasnt a very good reputation one day luke happened to be at the depot at the time of the arrival of the train from new york a small elderly man stepped upon the platform whom luke immediately recognized as john armstrong the owner of the missing box of bonds he was surprised to see him having supposed that he was still in europe mr armstrong as already stated had boarded for several weeks during the preceding summer at groveton he looked at luke with a halfglance of recognition havent i seen you before he said what is your name my name is luke larkin i saw you several times last summer then you know me yes sir you are mr armstrong but i thought you were in europe so i was till recently i came home sooner than i expected luke was not surprised he supposed that intelligence of the robbery had hastened mr armstrongs return i suppose it was the news of your box that hurried you home luke ventured to say no i hadnt heard of it till my arrival in new york can you tell me anything about the matter has the box been found not that i have heard sir was or is anybody suspected i was suspected answered luke smiling but i dont think any one suspects me now you exclaimed the capitalist in evident astonishment what could induce any one to suspect a boy like you of robbing a bank there was some ground for it said luke candidly a tin box of the same appearance as the one lost was seen in our house i was arrested on suspicion and tried you dont say so how did you prove your innocence the gentleman who gave me the box in charge appeared and testified in my favor but for that i am afraid i should have fared badly that is curious who was the gentleman luke gave a rapid history of the circumstances already known to the reader i am glad to hear this being principally interested in the matter however i never should have suspected you i claim to be something of a judge of character and physiognomy and your appearance is in your favor your mother is a widow i believe yes sir and you are the janitor of the schoolhouse mr armstrong was a close observer and though having large interests of his own made himself familiar with the affairs of those whom others in his position would wholly have ignored i was janitor luke replied but when mr duncan became a member of the school committee he removed me for what reason asked mr armstrong quickly i dont think he ever liked me and his son randolph and i have never been good friends you mean mr duncan the president of the bank yes sir why are not you and his son friends i dont know sir he has always been in the habit of sneering at me as a poor boy a working boy and unworthy to associate with him you dont look like a poor boy you are better dressed than i was at your age besides you have a watch i judge from the chain yes sir but all that is only lately i have found a good friend who has been very kind to me who is he roland reed the owner of the tin box i referred to roland reed i never heard the name where is he from from the west i believe though at present he is staying in new york how much were you paid as janitor a dollar a week that is very little is the amount important to you no sir not now and then luke gave particulars of the good fortune of the family in having secured a profitable boarder and furthermore in obtaining for himself profitable employment this mr reed seems to be a kindhearted and liberal man i am glad for your sake i sympathize with poor boys can you guess the reason were you a poor boy yourself sir i was and a very poor boy when i was a boy of thirteen and fourteen i ran around in overalls and barefooted but i dont think it did me any harm the old man added musingly it kept me from squandering money on foolish pleasures for i had none to spend it made me industrious and selfreliant and when i obtained employment it made me anxious to please my employer i hope it will have the same effect on me sir i hope so and i think so what sort of a boy is this son of mr duncan if his father were not a rich man i think he would be more agreeable as it is he seems to have a high idea of his own importance so his father has the reputation of being a rich man eh yes sir we have always considered him so without knowing much about it yes sir we judged from his style of living and from his being president of a bank that amounts to nothing his salary as president is only moderate i am sorry you should have met with such a loss mr armstrong so am i but it wont cripple me still a man doesnt like to lose twentyfive thousand dollars and over was there as much as that in the box sir asked luke in surprise yes i dont know why i need make any secret of it there were twentyfive thousand dollars in government bonds and these at present rates are worth in the neighborhood of thirty thousand dollars that seems to me a great deal of money said luke it is but i can spare it without any diminution of comfort i dont feel however like pocketing the loss without making a strong effort to recover the money i didnt expect to meet immediately upon arrival the only person hitherto suspected of accomplishing the robbery he smiled as he spoke and luke saw that so far as mr armstrong was concerned he had no occasion to feel himself under suspicion are you intending to remain long in groveton mr armstrong he asked i cant say i have to see mr duncan about the tin box and concoct some schemes looking to the discovery of the person or persons concerned in its theft have there been any suspicious persons in the village during the last few weeks not that i know of sir what is the character of the men employed in the bank the cashier and teller they seem to be very steady young men sir i dont think they have been suspected the most dangerous enemies are those who are inside for they have exceptional opportunities for wrongdoing moreover they have the best chance to cover up their tracks i dont think there is anything to charge against mr roper and mr barclay they are both young married men and live in a quiet way never speculate in wall street eh one of the soberest steadiest bank cashiers i ever knew who lived plainly and frugally and was considered by all to be a model man wrecked the man he was connected with a small country banker and is now serving a term in states prison the cause was wall street speculation this is more dangerous even than extravagant habits of living a part of this conversation took place on the platform of the railroadstation and a part while they were walking in the direction of the hotel they had now reached the village inn and bidding our hero good morning mr armstrong entered and registered his name ten minutes later he set out for the house of prince duncan chapter xxi the dreaded interview mr duncan had been dreading the inevitable interview with mr armstrong he knew him to be a sharp man of business clearsighted and keen and he felt that this part of the conference would be an awkward and embarrassing one he had tried to nerve himself for the interview and thought he had succeeded but when the servant brought mr armstrongs card he felt a sinking at his heart and it was in a tone that betrayed nervousness that he said bring the gentleman in my dear sir he said extending his hand and vigorously shaking the hand of his new arrival this is an unexpected pleasure unexpected didnt you get my letter from london said mr armstrong suffering his hand to be shaken but not returning the arm pressure certainly in which i mentioned my approaching departure yes certainly but i didnt know on what day to expect you pray sit down it seems pleasant to see you home safe and well humph returned armstrong in a tone by no means as cordial have you found my box of bonds not yet but permit me to ask you why you allowed me to remain ignorant of so important a matter i was indebted to the public prints to which my attention was directed by an acquaintance for a piece of news which should have been communicated to me at once my dear sir i intended to write you as soon as i heard of your arrival i did not know till this moment that you were in america you might have inferred it from the intimation in my last letter why did you not cable me the news because replied duncan awkwardly i did not wish to spoil your pleasure and thought from day to day that the box would turn up you were very sparing of my feelings said armstrong dryly too much so i am not a child or an old woman and it was your imperative duty in a matter so nearly affecting my interests to apprise me at once i may have erred in judgment said duncan meekly but i beg you to believe that i acted as i supposed for the best leaving that out of consideration at present let me know what steps you have taken to find out how the box was spirited away or who was concerned in the robbery i think that you will admit that i acted promptly said the bank president complacently when i say that within twentyfour hours i arrested a party on suspicion of being implicated in the robbery and tried him myself who was the party asked the capitalist not betraying the knowledge he had already assessed on the subject a boy in the village named luke larkin humph what led you to think a boy had broken into the bank that does not strike me as very sharp on your part i had positive evidence that the boy in question had a tin box concealed in his house in his mothers trunk his poverty made it impossible that the box could be his and i accordingly had him arrested well what was the result of the trial i was obliged to let him go though by no means satisfied of his innocence why a man a stranger a very suspiciouslooking person presented himself and swore that the box was his and that he had committed it to the charge of this boy well that seems tolerably satisfactory doesnt it that is if he furnished evidence confirming his statement did he open the box in court yes and the bonds were not there the bonds were not there only some papers and what appeared to be certificates of stock yet you say you are still suspicious of this man and boy yes explain your grounds i thought replied the president rather meekly he might have taken the bonds from the box and put in other papers that was not very probable moreover he would hardly be likely to leave the box in the village in the charge of a boy the boy might have been his confederate what is the boys reputation in the village has he ever been detected in any act of dishonesty not that i know of but there is one suspicious circumstance to which i would like to call your attention well since this happened luke has come out in new clothes and wears a silver watch the family is very poor and he could not have had money to buy them unless he obtained some outside aid what then do you infer that he has been handsomely paid for his complicity in the robbery what explanation does he personally give of this unusual expenditure he admits that they were paid for by this suspicious stranger has the stranger what is his name by the way roland reed he calls himself but this probably is not his real name well has this reed made his appearance in the village since if so he has come during the night and has not been seen by any of us i cant say i share your suspicion against mr reed your theory that he took out the bonds and substituted other papers is farfetched and improbable as to the boy i consider him honest and reliable do you know luke larkin asked mr duncan quickly last summer i observed him somewhat and never saw anything wrong in him appearances are deceitful said the bank president sententiously so i have heard returned mr armstrong dryly but let us go on what other steps have you taken to discover the lost box i have had the bank vaults thoroughly searched answered duncan trying to make the best of a weak situation of course it is hardly to be supposed that it has been mislaid even if it had been it would have turned up before this did you discover any traces of the bank being forcibly entered no but the burglar may have covered his tracks there would have been something to show an entrance what is the character of the cashier and teller i know nothing to their disadvantage then neither have fallen under suspicion not as yet answered the president pointedly it is evident thought john armstrong that mr duncan is interested in diverting suspicion from some quarter he is willing that these men should incur suspicion though it is clear he has none in his own mind well what else have you done have you employed detectives asked armstrong impatiently i was about to do so answered mr duncan in some embarrassment when i heard that you were coming home and i thought i would defer that matter for your consideration giving time in the meanwhile for the thief or thieves to dispose of their booty this is very strange conduct mr duncan i acted for the best said prince duncan you have singular ideas of what is best then observed mr armstrong coldly it may be too late to remedy your singular neglect but i will now take the matter out of your hands and see what i can do will you employ detectives asked duncan with evident uneasiness armstrong eyed him sharply and with growing suspicion i cant say what i will do have you the numbers of the missing bonds asked duncan anxiously i am not sure i am afraid i have not was it imagination or did the bank president look relieved at this statement john armstrong made a mental note of this after eliciting the particulars of the disappearance of the bonds john armstrong rose to go he intended to return to the city but he made up his mind to see luke first he wanted to inquire the address of roland reed chapter xxii luke secures a new friend luke was engaged in copying when mr armstrong called though he felt surprised to see his visitor luke did not exhibit it in his manner but welcomed him politely and invited him into the sittingroom i have called to inquire the address of your friend mr roland reed said mr armstrong then seeing a little uneasiness in lukes face he added quickly dont think i have the slightest suspicion of him as regards the loss of the bonds i wish only to consult him being myself at a loss what steps to take he may be able to help me of course luke cheerfully complied with his request has anything been heard yet at the bank he asked nothing whatever in fact it does not appear to me that any very serious efforts have been made to trace the robber or robbers i am left to undertake the task myself if there is anything i can do to help you mr armstrong i shall be very glad to do so said luke i will bear that in mind and may call upon you as yet my plans are not arranged perhaps mr reed whom i take to be an experienced man of the world may be able to offer a suggestion you seem to be at work he added with a look at the table at which luke had been sitting yes sir i am making out some bills for mr reed is the work likely to occupy you long no sir i shall probably finish the work this week and then your time will be at your disposal yes sir pardon me the question but i take it your means are limited yes sir till recently they have been very limited now thanks to mr reed who pays a liberal salary for his little girls board we are very comfortable and can get along very well even if i do not immediately find work i am glad to hear that if i should hear of any employment likely to please you i will send you word thank you sir would you object to leave home no sir there is little or no prospect in groveton and though my mother would miss me she now has company and i should feel easier about leaving her if you can spare the time wont you walk with me to the depot with great pleasure sir and luke went into the adjoining room to fetch his hat at the same time apprising his mother that he was going out on the way to the depot mr armstrong managed to draw out luke with a view to getting better acquainted with him and forming an idea of his traits of character luke was quite aware of this but talked frankly and easily having nothing to conceal a thoroughly good boy and a smart boy too said armstrong to himself i must see if i cant give him a chance to rise he seems absolutely reliable on the way to the depot they met randolph duncan who eyed them curiously he recognized mr armstrong as the owner of the stolen bonds and was a good deal surprised to see him in such friendly conversation with luke knowing mr armstrong to be a rich man he determined to claim acquaintance how do you do mr armstrong he said advancing with an ingratiating smile this is randolph duncan said luke whom by the way randolph had not thought it necessary to notice i believe i have met the young gentleman before said mr armstrong politely but not cordially yes sir i have seen you at our house continued randolph my father is president of the groveton bank he will be very glad to see you wont you come home with me i have already called upon your father said mr armstrong i am very sorry your bonds were stolen mr armstrong not more than i am i assure you returned mr armstrong with a quizzical smile could i speak with you a moment in private sir asked randolph with a significant glance at luke certainly luke will you cross the road a minute now young man probably you dont know that the boy you are walking with was suspected of taking the box from the bank i have heard so but he was acquitted of the charge wasnt he my father still believes that he had something to do with it and so do i added randolph with an emphatic nod of his head isnt he a friend of yours asked mr armstrong quietly no indeed we go to the same school though father thinks of sending me to an academy out of town soon but there is no friendship between us he is only a working boy humph that is very much against him observed mr armstrong but it was hard to tell from his tone whether he spoke in earnest or ironically oh well he has to work for the family is very poor hes come out in new clothes and a silver watch since the robbery he says the strange man from whom he received a tin box just like yours gave them to him and you think he didnt get them in that way yes i think they were leagued together i feel sure that man robbed the bank dear me it does look suspicious remarked armstrong if luke was guiding you to the train i will take his place sir thank you but perhaps i had better keep him with me and crossexamine him a little i suppose i can depend upon your keeping your eyes upon him and letting me know of any suspicious conduct on his part yes sir i will do it with pleasure randolph announced promptly he felt sure that he had excited mr armstrongs suspicions and defeated any plans luke might have cherished of getting in with the capitalist have you anything more to communicate asked mr armstrong politely no sir i thought it best to put you on your guard i quite appreciate your motives master randolph i shall keep my eyes open henceforth and hope in time to discover the real perpetrator of the robbery now luke i have dished you young fellow thought randolph with a triumphant glance at the unconscious luke he walked away in high selfsatisfaction luke said mr armstrong as they resumed their walk randolph seems a very warm friend of yours i never thought so said luke with an answering smile i am glad if he has changed what arrangements do you think i have made with him i dont know sir i have asked him to keep his eye on you and if he sees anything suspicious to let me know luke would have been disturbed by this remark had not the smile on mr armstrongs face belied his words does he think you are in earnest sir oh yes he has no doubt of it he warned me of your character and said he was quite sure that you and your friend mr reed were implicated in the bank robbery i told him i would crossexamine you and see what i could find out randolph told me that you were only a working boy which i pronounced to be very much against you luke laughed outright i think you are fond of a practical joke mr armstrong he said you have fooled randolph very neatly i had an object in it said mr armstrong quietly i may have occasion to employ you in the matter and if so it will be well that no arrangement is suspected between us randolph will undoubtedly inform his father of what happened this morning as i said before sir i am ready to do anything that lies in my power luke could not help feeling curious as to the character of the service he would be called upon to perform he found it difficult to hazard a conjecture but one thing at least seemed clear and this was that mr armstrong was disposed to be his friend and as he was a rich man his friendship was likely to amount to some thing they had now reached the depot and in ten minutes the train was due dont wait if you wish to get to work luke said mr armstrong kindly my work can wait it is nearly finished said luke the ten minutes passed rapidly and with a cordial goodbye the capitalist entered the train leaving luke to return to his modest home in good spirits i have two influential friends now he said to himself mr reed and mr armstrong on the whole luke larkin you are in luck your prospects look decidedly bright even if you have lost the janitorship chapter xxiii randolph and his credit or though randolph was pleased at having as he thought put a spoke in lukes wheel and filled mr armstrongs mind with suspicion he was not altogether happy he had a little private trouble of his own he had now for some time been a frequenter of tony dentons billiard saloon patronizing both the table and the bar he had fallen in with a few young men of no social standing who flattered him and therefore stood in his good graces with them he played billiards and drank after a time he found that he was exceeding his allowance but in the most obliging way tony denton had offered him credit of course mr duncan randolph felt flattered at being addressed in this way of course mr duncan your credit is good with me if you havent the ready money and i know most young gentlemen are liable to be short i will just keep an account and you can settle at your convenience this seemed very obliging but i am disposed to think that a boys worst enemy is the one who makes it easy for him to run into debt randolph was not wholly without caution for he said but suppose tony i am not able to pay when you want the money oh dont trouble yourself about that mr duncan said tony cordially of course i know the standing of your family and i am perfectly safe some time you will be a rich man yes i suppose i shall said randolph in a consequential tone and it is worth something to me to have my saloon patronized by a young gentleman of your social standing evidently tony denton understood randolphs weak point and played on it skillfully he assumed an air of extra consequence as he remarked condescendingly you are very obliging tony and i shall not forget it tony denton laughed in his sleeve at the boys vanity but his manner was very respectful and randolph looked upon him as an humble friend and admirer he is a sensible man tony he understands what is due to my position he said to himself after dentons visit to new york with prince duncan and the knowledge which he then acquired about the president of the groveton bank he decided that the time had come to cut short randolphs credit with him the day of reckoning always comes in such cases as i hope my young friends will fully understand debt is much more easily contracted than liquidated and this randolph found to his cost one morning he was about to start on a game of billiards when tony denton called him aside i would like to speak a word to you mr duncan he said smoothly all right tony said randolph in a patronizing tone what can i do for you my rent comes due tomorrow mr duncan and i should be glad if you would pay me a part of your account it has been running some time randolphs jaw fell and he looked blank how much do i owe you he asked tony referred to a long ledgerlike accountbook turned to a certain page and running his fingers down a long series of items answered twentyseven dollars and sixty cents it cant be so much ejaculated randolph in dismay surely you have made a mistake you can look for yourself said tony suavely just reckon it up i may have made a little mistake in the sum total randolph looked over the items but he was nervous and the page swam before his eyes he was quite incapable of performing the addition simple as it was in his then frame of mind i dare say you have added it up all right he said after an abortive attempt to reckon it up but i can hardly believe that i owe you so much many a little makes a mickle as we scotch say answered tony cheerfully however twentyseven dollars is a mere trifle to a young man like you come if youll pay me tonight ill knock off the sixty cents its quite impossible for me to do it said randolph ill at ease pay me something on account say ten dollars i havent got but a dollar and a quarter in my pocket oh well you know where to go for more money said tony with a wink the old gentlemans got plenty i am not so sure about that i mean that he is willing to pay out of course hes got plenty of money invested added randolph who liked to have it thought that his father was a great financial magnate well he can spare some for his son i am sure cant you let it go for a little while longer tony asked randolph awkwardly really mr duncan i couldnt i am a poor man as you know and have my bills to pay i take it as very disobliging tony i shant care to patronize your place any longer said randolph trying a new tack tony denton shrugged his shoulders i only care for patrons who are willing to pay their bills he answered significantly it doesnt pay me to keep my place open free of course not but i hope you are not afraid of me certainly not i am sure you will act honorably and pay your bills if i thought you wouldnt i would go and see your father about it no you mustnt do that said randolph alarmed he doesnt know i come here and he wont know from me if you pay what you owe matters were becoming decidedly unpleasant for randolph the perspiration gathered on his brow he didnt know what to do that his father would not give him money for any such purpose he very well knew and he dreaded his finding out where he spent so many of his evenings oh dont trouble yourself about a trifle said tony smoothly just go up to your father frankly and tell him you want the money he wouldnt give me twentyseven dollars said randolph gloomily then ask for ten and ill wait for the balance till next week cant you put it all off till next week no i really couldnt mr duncan what does it matter to you this week or next randolph wished to put off as long as possible the inevitable moment though he knew it would do him no good in the end but tony denton was inflexible and he finally said well ill make the attempt but i know i shall fail thats all right i knew you would look at it in the right light now go ahead and play your game no i dont want to increase my debt oh i wont charge you for what you play this evening tony denton can be liberal as well as the next man only i have to collect money to pay my bills randolph didnt know that all this had been prearranged by the obliging saloonkeeper and that in now pressing him he had his own object in view the next morning randolph took an opportunity to see his father alone father he said will you do me a favor what is it randolph let me have ten dollars his father frowned what do you want with ten dollars he asked i dont like to go round without money in my pocket it doesnt look well for the son of a rich man who told you i was a rich man said his father testily why you are arent you everybody in the village says so i may or may not be rich but i dont care to encourage my son in extravagant habits you say you have no money dont you have your regular allowance it is only two dollars a week only two dollars a week repeated the father angrily let me tell you young man that when i was of your age i didnt have twentyfive cents a week that was long ago people lived differently from what they do now how did they they didnt live in any style they didnt spend money foolishly as they do now i dont see for my part what you can do with even two dollars a week oh it melts away one way or another i am your only son and people expect me to spend money it is expected of one in my position so you can i consider two dollars a week very liberal youd understand better if you were a young fellow like me how hard it is to get along on that i dont want to understand returned his father stoutly one thing i understand and that is that the boys of the present day are foolishly extravagant think of luke larkin do you think he spends two dollars even in a month i hope you dont mean to compare me with a working boy like luke randolph said scornfully i am not sure but luke would suit me better than you in some respects you are speaking of luke said randolph with a lucky thought well even he working boy as he is has a better watch than i who am the son of the president of the groveton bank do you want the ten dollars to buy a better watch asked prince duncan yes answered randolph ready to seize on any pretext for the sake of getting the money then wait till i go to new york again and i will look at some watches i wont make any promise but i may buy you one i dont care about luke outshining you this by no means answered randolphs purpose wont you let me go up to the city myself father he asked no i prefer to rely upon my own judgment in a purchase of that kind it had occurred to randolph that he would go to the city and pretend on his return that he had bought a watch but had his pocket picked of course his father would give him more than ten dollars for the purpose and he could privately pay it over to tony denton but this scheme did not work and he made up his mind at last that he would have to tell tony he must wait he did so tony denton who fully expected this and for reasons of his own did not regret it said very little to randolph but decided to go round and see prince duncan himself it would give him a chance to introduce the other and more important matter it was about this time that lintons birthdayparty took place randolph knew of course that he would meet luke but he no longer had the satisfaction of deriding his shabby dress our hero wore his best suit and showed as much ease and selfpossession as randolph himself what airs that boy luke puts on ejaculated randolph in disgust i believe he thinks he is my equal in this randolph was correct luke certainly did consider himself the social equal of the haughty randolph and the consciousness of being well dressed made him feel at greater ease than at florence grants party he had taken additional lessons in dancing from his friend linton and being quick to learn showed no awkwardness on the floor lintons parents by their kind cordiality contributed largely to the pleasure of their sons guests who at the end of the evening unanimously voted the party a success chapter xxiv a commission for luke upon his return to the city john armstrong lost no time in sending for roland reed the latter though rather surprised at the summons answered it promptly when he entered the office of the old merchant he found him sitting at his desk mr armstrong he said inquiringly thats my name you i take it are roland reed yes no doubt you wonder why i sent for you said mr armstrong is it about the robbery of the groveton bank you have guessed it you know i suppose that i am the owner of the missing box of bonds so i was told have you obtained any clue i have not had time i have only just returned from europe i have done nothing except visit groveton what led you to send for me pardon my curiosity but i cant help asking an interview with a protege of yours luke larkin you know that luke was arrested on suspicion of being connected with the robbery though there are those who pay me the compliment of thinking that i may have had something to do with it i think you had as much to do with it as luke larkin said armstrong deliberately i had just as much said reed with a smile luke is a good boy mr armstrong i quite agree with you if i had a son i should like him to resemble luke give me your hand on that mr armstrong said roland reed impulsively excuse my impetuosity but ive taken a fancy to that boy there then we are agreed now mr reed i will tell you why i have taken the liberty of sending for you from what luke said i judged that you were a sharp shrewd man of the world and might help me in this matter which i confess puzzles me you know the particulars and therefore without preamble i am going to ask you whether you have any theory as regards this robbery the box hasnt walked off without help now who took it from the bank if i should tell you my suspicion you might laugh at me i will promise not to do that then i believe that prince duncan president of the groveton bank could tell you if he chose what has become of the box extraordinary ejaculated john armstrong i supposed you would be surprised probably indignant if you are a friend of duncan but nevertheless i adhere to my statement you mistake the meaning of my exclamation i spoke of it as extraordinary because the same suspicion has entered my mind though i admit without a special reason i have a reason may i inquire what it is i knew prince duncan when he was a young man though he does not know me now in fact i may as well admit that i was then known by another name he wronged me deeply at that time being guilty of a crime which he successfully laid upon my shoulders no one in groveton no one of his recent associates knows the real nature of the man as well as i do you prefer not to go into particulars not at present at all events you can give me your advice to suspect amounts to little we must bring home the crime to him it is here that i need your advice i understand that the box contained government bonds yes what were the denominations one ten thousand dollar bond one five and ten of one thousand each it seems to me they ought to be traced i suppose of course they were coupon not registered you are right had they been registered i should have been at no trouble nor would the thief have reaped any advantage if coupon they are of course numbered wont that serve as a clue supposing an attempt is made to dispose of them you touch the weak point of my position they are numbered and i had a list of the numbers but that list has disappeared it is either lost or mislaid of course i cant identify them that is awkward wouldnt the banker of whom you bought them be able to give you the numbers yes but i dont know where they were bought i had at the time in my employ a clerk and bookkeeper a steadygoing and methodical man of fiftyodd who made the purchase and no doubt has a list of the numbers of the bonds then where is your difficulty asked roland reed in surprise go to the clerk and put the question what can be simpler but i dont know where he is dont know where he is echoed reed in genuine surprise no james harding this is his name left my employ a year since having through a life of economy secured a competence and went out west to join a widowed sister who had for many years made her residence there now the west is a large place and i dont know where this sister lives or where james harding is to be found yet he must be found you must send a messenger to look for him but whom shall i send in a matter of this delicacy i dont want to employ a professional detective those men sometimes betray secrets committed to their keeping and work up a false clue rather than have it supposed they are not earning their money if now some gentleman in whom i had confidence someone like yourself would undertake the commission i should esteem myself fortunate thank you for the compliment mr armstrong more especially as you are putting confidence in a stranger but i have important work to do that would not permit me to leave new york at present but i know of someone whom i would employ if the business were mine well luke larkin but he is only a boy he cant be over sixteen he is a sharp boy however and would follow instructions john armstrong thought rapidly he was a man who decided quickly i will take your advice he said as i dont want to have it supposed that he is in my employ will you oblige me by writing to him and preparing him for a journey let it be supposed that he is occupied with a commission for you i will attend to the matter at once the next morning luke received the following letter my dear luke i have some work for you which will occupy some time and require a journey you will be well paid bring a supply of underclothing and assure your mother that she need feel under no apprehensions about you unless i am greatly mistaken you will be able to take care of yourself your friend roland reed luke read the letter with excitement and pleasure he was to go on a journey and to a boy of his age a journey of any sort is delightful he had no idea of the extent of the trip in store for him but thought he might possibly be sent to boston or philadelphia and either trip he felt would yield him much pleasure he quieted the natural apprehensions of his mother and satchel in hand waited upon his patron in the course of a day by him he was taken over to the office of mr armstrong from whom he received instructions and a supply of money chapter xxv mr j madison coleman luke didnt shrink from the long trip before him he enjoyed the prospect of it having always longed to travel and see distant places he felt flattered by mr armstrongs confidence in him and stoutly resolved to deserve it he would have been glad if he could have had the company of his friend linton but he knew that this was impossible he must travel alone you have a difficult and perplexing task luke said the capitalist you may not succeed i will do my best mr armstrong that is all i have a right to expect if you succeed you will do me a great service of which i shall show proper appreciation he gave luke some instructions and it was arranged that our hero should write twice a week and if occasion required oftener so that his employer might be kept apprised of his movements luke was not to stop short of chicago there his search was to begin and there if possible he was to obtain information that might guide his subsequent steps it is a long ride to chicago as luke found he spent a part of the time in reading and a part in looking out of the window at the scenery but still at times he felt lonely i wish linton tomkins were with me he reflected what a jolly time we would have but linton didnt even know what had become of his friend lukes absence was an occasion for wonder at groveton and many questions were asked of his mother he was sent for by mr reed answered the widow he is at work for him mr reed is in new york isnt he yes it was concluded therefore that luke was in new york and one or two persons proposed to call upon him there but his mother professed ignorance of his exact residence she knew that he was traveling but even she was kept in the dark as to where he was nor did she know that mr armstrong and not mr reed was his employer some half dozen hours before reaching chicago a young man of twentyfive or thereabouts sauntered along the aisle and sat down in the vacant seat beside luke nice day he said affably very nice responded luke i suppose you are bound to chicago yes i expect to stay there awhile going farther i cant tell yet going to school out there no perhaps you are traveling for some business firm though you look pretty young for that no im not a drummer if thats what you mean still i have a commisison from a new york business man a commission of what kind drawled the newcomer it is of a confidential character said luke ha closemouthed thought the young man well ill get it out of him after awhile he didnt press the question not wishing to arouse suspicion or mistrust just so he replied you are right to keep it to yourself though you wouldnt mind trusting me if you knew me better is this your first visit to chicago yes sir suppose we exchange cards this is mine he handed luke a card bearing this name j madison coleman at the bottom of the card he wrote in pencil representing h b claflin co of course youve heard of our firm he said certainly i dont have the firm name printed on my card for claflin wont allow it you will notice that i am called for old president madison he was an old friend of my grandfather in fact grandfather held a prominent office under his administration collector of the port of new york i have no card with me responded luke but my name is luke larkin good name do you live in new york no a few miles in the country and whom do you represent myself for the most part answered luke with a smile good no one has a better right to i see theres something in you luke youve found it out pretty quick thought luke and i hope we will get better acquainted if youre not permanently employed by this party whose name you dont give i will get you into the employ of claflin co if you would like it thank you answered luke who thought it quite possible that he might like to obtain a position with so eminent a firm how long have you been with them ten years ever since i was of your age promptly answered mr coleman is promotion rapid luke asked with interest well that depends on a mans capacity i have been pushed right along i went there as a boy on four dollars a week now im a traveling salesman drummer as it is called and i make about four thousand a year thats a fine salary said luke feeling that his new acquaintance must be possessed of extra ability to occupy so desirable a position yes but i expect next year to get five thousand claflin knows i am worth it and as he is a liberal man i guess he will give it sooner than let me go i suppose many do not get on so well mr coleman i should say so now there is a young fellow went there the same time that i did his name is frank bolton we were schoolfellows together and just the same age that is nearly he was born in april and i in may well we began at the same time on the same salary now i get sixty dollars a week and he only twelve and he is glad to get that too i suppose he hasnt much business capacity thats where youve struck it luke he knows about enough to be clerk in a country store and i suppose hell fetch up there some day you know what that means selling sugar and tea and dried apples to old ladies and occasionally measuring off a yard of calico or selling a spool of cotton if i couldnt do better than that id hire out as a farm laborer luke smiled at the enumeration of the duties of a country salesman it was clear that mr coleman though he looked citybred must at some time in the past have lived in the country perhaps that is the way i should turn out he said i might not rise any higher than your friend mr bolton oh yes you would youre smart enough ill guarantee you might not get on so fast as i have for it isnt every young man of twentysix that can command four thousand dollars a year but you would rise to a handsome income i am sure i should be satisfied with two thousand a year at your age i would be willing to guarantee you that asserted mr coleman confidently by the way where do you propose to put up in chicago i have not decided yet youd better go with me to the ottawa house is it a good house theyll feed you well there and only charge two dollars a day is it centrally located it isnt as central as the palmer or sherman or tremont but it is convenient to everything i ought to say here that i have chosen to give a fictitious name to the hotel designated by mr coleman come what do you say i have no objection answered luke after a slight pause for reflection indeed it was rather pleasant to him to think that he would have a companion on his first visit to chicago who was well acquainted with the city and could serve as his guide though he should not feel justified in imparting to mr coleman his special business he meant to see something of the city and would find his new friend a pleasant companion thats good said coleman well pleased i shall be glad to have your company i expected to meet a friend on the train but something must have delayed him and so i should have been left alone i suppose a part of your time will be given to business suggested luke yes but i take things easy when i work i work i can accomplish as much in a couple of hours as many would do in a whole day you see i understand my customers when soft sawder is wanted i am soft sawder when i am dealing with a plain businesslike man i talk in a plain businesslike way i study my man and generally i succeed in striking him for an order even if times are hard and he is already well stocked he certainly knows how to talk thought luke in fact he was rather disposed to accept mr coleman at his own valuation though that was a very high one do you smoke not at all not even a cigarette not even a cigarette i was intending to ask you to go with me into the smokingcar for a short time i smoke a good deal it is my only vice you know we must all have some vices luke didnt see the necessity but he assented because it seemed to be expected i wont be gone long youd better come along too and smoke a cigarette it is time you began to smoke most boys begin much earlier luke shook his head i dont care to learn he said oh youre a good boy one of the sundayschool kind said coleman with a slight sneer youll get over that after a while youll be here when i come back luke promised that he would and for the next half hour he was left alone as his friend mr coleman left the car he followed him with his glance and surveyed him more attentively than he had hitherto done the commercial traveler was attired in a suit of fashionable plaid wore a showy necktie from the center of which blazed a diamond scarfpin a showy chain crossed his vest and to it was appended a large and showy watch which looked valuable though appearances are sometimes deceitful he must spend a good deal of money thought luke i wonder that he should be willing to go to a twodollaraday hotel luke for his own part was quite willing to go to the ottawa house he had never fared luxuriously and he had no doubt that even at the ottawa house he should live better than at home it was nearer an hour than half an hour before coleman came back i stayed away longer than i intended he said i smoked three cigars instead of one seeing you wasnt with me to keep me company i found some social fellows and we had a chat mr coleman absented himself once or twice more finally the train ran into the depot and the conductor called out chicago come along luke said coleman the two left the car in company coleman hailed a cab gave the order ottawa house and in less than five minutes they were rattling over the pavements toward their hotel chapter xxvi the ottawa house there was one little circumstance that led luke to think favorably of his new companion as the hackman closed the door of the carriage luke asked how much is the fare fifty cents apiece gentlemen answered cabby luke was about to put his hand into his pocket for the money when coleman touching him on the arm said never mind luke i have the money and before our hero could expostulate he had thrust a dollar into the cabdrivers hand all right thanks said the driver and slammed to the door you must let me repay you my part of the fare mr coleman said luke again feeling for his pocketbook oh its a mere trifle said coleman ill let you pay next time but dont be so ceremonious with a friend but i would rather pay for myself objected luke oh say no more about it i beg claflin provides liberally for my expenses its all right but i dont want claflin to pay for me then i assure you ill get it out of you before we part will that content you luke let the matter drop but he didnt altogether like to find himself under obligations to a stranger notwithstanding his assurance which he took for a joke he would have been surprised and startled if he had known how thoroughly coleman meant what he said about getting even the fifty cents he had with such apparent generosity paid out for luke he meant to get back a hundredfold his object was to gain lukes entire confidence and remove any suspicion he might possibly entertain in this respect he was successful luke had read about designing strangers but he certainly could not suspect a man who insisted on paying his hack fare i hope you will not be disappointed in the ottawa house observed mr coleman as they rattled through the paved streets it isnt a stylish hotel i am not used to stylish living said luke frankly i have always been used to living in a very plain way when i first went on the road i used to stop at the tiptop houses such as the palmer at chicago the russell house in detroit etc but its useless extravagance claflin allows me a generous sum for hotels and if i go to a cheap one i put the difference into my own pocket is that expected asked luke doubtfully its allowed at any rate no one can complain if i choose to live a little plainer when it pays in the way of business to stop at a big hotel i do so of course your boss pays your expenses yes then youd better do as i do put the difference in your own pocket i shouldnt like to do that why not it is evident you are a new traveler or you would know that it is a regular thing luke did not answer but he adhered to his own view he meant to keep a careful account of his disbursements and report to mr armstrong without the addition of a single penny he had no doubt that he should be paid liberally for his time and he didnt care to make anything by extra means the ottawa house was nearly a mile and a half distant it was on one of the lower streets near the lake it was a plain building with accommodations for perhaps a hundred and fifty guests this would be large for a country town or small city but it indicated a hotel of the third class in chicago i may as well say here however that it was a perfectly respectable and honestly conducted hotel notwithstanding it was selected by mr coleman who could not with truth be complimented so highly i will also add that mr colemans selection of the ottawa in place of a more pretentious hotel arose from the fear that in the latter he might meet someone who knew him and who would warn luke of his undesirable reputation jumping out of the hack j madison coleman led the way into the hotel and taking pen in hand recorded his name in large flourishing letters as from new york then he handed the pen to luke who registered himself also from new york give us a room together he said to the clerk luke did not altogether like this arrangement but hardly felt like objecting he did not wish to hurt the feelings of j madison coleman yet he considered that having known him only six hours it was somewhat imprudent to allow such intimacy but he who hesitates is lost and before luke had made up his mind whether to object or not he was already part way upstairs there was no elevator following the bellboy who carried his luggage the room which was on the fourth floor was of good size and contained two beds so far so good after the ride he wished to wash and put on clean clothes mr coleman did not think this necessary and saying to luke that he would find him downstairs he left our hero alone i wish i had a room alone thought luke i should like it much better but i dont want to offend coleman ive got eighty dollars in my pocketbook and though of course he is all right i dont want to take any risks on the door he read the regulations of the hotel one item attracted his attention it was this the proprietors wish distinctly to state that they will not be responsible for money or valuables unless left with the clerk to be deposited in the safe luke had not been accustomed to stopping at hotels and did not know that this was the usual custom it struck him however as an excellent arrangement and he resolved to avail himself of it when he went downstairs he didnt see mr coleman your friend has gone out said the clerk he wished me to say that he would be back in half an hour all right answered luke can i leave my pocketbook with you certainly the clerk wrapped it up in a piece of brown paper and put it away in the safe at the rear of the office marking it with lukes name and the number of his room there thats safe thought luke with a feeling of relief he had reserved about three dollars as he might have occasion to spend a little money in the course of the evening if he were robbed of this small amount it would not much matter a newsboy came in with an evening paper luke bought a copy and sat down on a bench in the office near a window he was reading busily when someone tapped him on the shoulder looking up he saw that it was his roommate j madison coleman ive just been taking a little walk he said and now i am ready for dinner if you are too let us go into the diningroom luke was glad to accept this proposal his long journey having given him a good appetite chapter xxvii coleman acts suspiciously after dinner coleman suggested a game of billiards but as this was a game with which luke was not familiar he declined the invitation but went into the billiardroom and watched a game between his new acquaintance and a stranger coleman proved to be a very good player and won the game after the first game coleman called for drinks and invited luke to join them thank you answered luke but i never drink oh i forgot youre a good boy said coleman well im no puritan whisky straight for me luke was not in the least troubled by the sneer conveyed in colemans words he was not altogether entitled to credit for refusing to drink having not the slightest taste for strong drink of any kind about halfpast seven coleman put up his cue saying thatll do for me now luke suppose we take a walk luke was quite ready not having seen anything of chicago as yet they strolled out and walked for an hour coleman to do him justice proved an excellent guide and pointed out whatever they passed which was likely to interest his young companion but at last he seemed to be tired its only halfpast eight he said referring to his watch ill drop into some theater it is the best way to finish up the evening then ill go back to the hotel said luke i feel tired and mean to go to bed early youd better spend an hour or two in the theater with me no i believe not i prefer a good nights rest do you mind my leaving you not at all can you find your way back to the hotel alone if youll direct me i think i can find it the direction was given and coleman was turning off when as if it had just occurred to him he said by the way can you lend me a five ive nothing less than a fiftydollar bill with me and i dont want to break that luke congratulated himself now that he had left the greater part of his money at the hotel i can let you have a dollar he said coleman shrugged his shoulders but answered all right let me have the one luke did so and felt now that he had more than repaid the fifty cents his companion had paid for hack fare though coleman had professed to have nothing less than fifty luke knew that he had changed a fivedollar bill at the hotel in paying for the drinks and must have over four dollars with him in small bills and change why then thought he did coleman want to borrow five dollars of me if luke had known more of the world he would have understood that it was only one of the tricks to which men like coleman resort to obtain a loan or rather a gift from an unsuspecting acquaintance i suppose i shall not see my money back thought luke well it will be the last that he will get out of me he was already becoming tired of his companion and doubted whether he would not find the acquaintance an expensive one he was sorry that they were to share the same room however it was for one night only and tomorrow he was quite resolved to part company shortly after nine oclock luke went to bed and being fatigued with his long journey was soon asleep he was still sleeping at twelve oclock when coleman came home coleman came up to his bed and watched him attentively the kids asleep he soliloquized hes one of the good sundayschool boys i can imagine how shocked he would be if he knew that instead of being a traveler for h b claflin i have been living by my wits for the last halfdozen years he seems to be half asleep i think i can venture to explore a little he took lukes trousers from the chair on which he had laid them and thrust his fingers into the pockets but brought forth only a penknife and a few pennies he keeps his money somewhere else it seems said coleman next he turned to the vest and from the inside vest pocket drew out lukes modest pocketbook oh here we have it thought coleman with a smile cunning boy he thought nobody would think of looking in his vest pocket well let us see how much he has got he opened the pocketbook and frowned with disappointment when he discovered only a twodollar bill what does it mean surely he hasnt come to chicago with only this paltry sum exclaimed coleman he must be more cunning than i thought he looked in the coat pockets the shoes and even the socks of his young companion but found nothing except the silver watch which luke had left in one of his vest pockets confound the boy hes foiled me this time muttered coleman shall i take the watch no it might expose me and i could not raise much on it at the pawnbrokers he must have left his money with the clerk downstairs he wouldnt think of it himself but probably he was advised to do so before he left home ill get up early and see if i cant get in ahead of my young friend coleman did not venture to take the twodollar bill as that would have induced suspicion on the part of luke and would have interfered with his intention of securing the much larger sum of money which as he concluded rightly was in the safe in the office he undressed and got into bed but not without observation as he was bending over lukes clothes examining them our heros eyes suddenly opened and he saw what was going on it flashed upon him at once what kind of a companion he had fallen in with but he had the wisdom and selfcontrol to close his eyes again immediately he reflected that there was not much that coleman could take and if he took the watch he resolved to charge him openly with it to make a disturbance there and then might be dangerous as coleman who was much stronger than he might illtreat and abuse him without his being able to offer any effectual resistance chapter xxviii colemans little plan though coleman went to bed late he awoke early he had the power of awaking at almost any hour that he might fix he was still quite fatigued but having an object in view overcame his tendency to lie longer and swiftly dressing himself went downstairs luke was still sleeping and did not awaken while his companion was dressing coleman went downstairs and strolled up to the clerks desk youre up early said that official yes its a great nuisance but i have a little business to attend to with a man who leaves chicago by an early train i tried to find him last night but he had probably gone to some theater that is what has forced me to get up so early this morning i am always up early said the clerk then you are used to it and dont mind it it is different with me coleman bought a cigar and while he was lighting it remarked as if incidentally by the way did my young friend leave my money with you last evening he left a package of money with me but he didnt mention it was yours forgot to i suppose i told him to leave it here as i was going out to the theater and was afraid i might have my pocket picked smart fellows those pickpockets i claim to be rather smart myself but there are some of them smart enough to get ahead of me i was relieved of my pocketbook containing over two hundred dollars in money once by jove i was mad enough to knock the fellows head off if i had caught him it is rather provoking i think ill trouble you to hand me the money the boy left with you as i have to use some this morning mr coleman spoke in an easy offhand way that might have taken in some persons but hotel clerks are made smart by their positions i am sorry mr coleman said the clerk but i can only give it back to the boy i commend your caution my friend said coleman but i can assure you that its all right i sent it back by luke when i was going to the theater and i meant of course to have him give my name with it however he is not used to business and so forgot it when did you hand it to him asked the clerk with newborn suspicion about eight oclock no doubt he handed it in as soon as he came back to the hotel how much was there this question posed mr coleman as he had no idea how much money luke had with him i cant say exactly he answered i didnt count it there might have been seventyfive dollars though perhaps the sum fell a little short of that i cant give you the money mr coleman said the clerk briefly i have no evidence that it is yours really thats ludicrous said coleman with a forced laugh you dont mean to doubt me i hope and madison coleman drew himself up haughtily that has nothing to do with it the rule of this office is to return money only to the person who deposited it with us if we adopted any other rule we should get into no end of trouble but my friend said coleman frowning you are putting me to great inconvenience i must meet my friend in twenty minutes and pay him a part of this money i have nothing to do with that said the clerk you absolutely refuse then i do answered the clerk firmly however you can easily overcome the difficulty by bringing the boy down here to authorize me to hand you the money it seems to me that you have plenty of red tape here said coleman shrugging his shoulders however i must do as you require coleman had a bright thought which he proceeded to carry into execution he left the office and went upstairs he was absent long enough to visit the chamber which he and luke had occupied together then he reported to the office again the boy is not dressed he said cheerfully however he has given me an order for the money which of course will do as well he handed a paper the loose leaf of a memorandum book on which were written in pencil these words give my guardian mr coleman the money i left on deposit at the office luke larkin that makes it all right doesnt it asked coleman jauntily now if youll be kind enough to hand me my money at once ill be off it wont do mr coleman said the clerk how am i to know that the boy wrote this dont you see his signature the clerk turned to the hotel register where luke had enrolled his name the handwriting is not the same he said coldly oh confound it exclaimed coleman testily cant you understand that writing with a pencil makes a difference i understand said the clerk that you are trying to get money that does not belong to you the money was deposited a couple of hours sooner than the time you claim to have handed it to the boy just after you and the boy arrived youre right said coleman unabashed i made a mistake you cannot have the money you have no right to keep it from me said coleman wrathfully bring the boy to the office and it shall be delivered to him then if he chooses to give it to you i have nothing to say but i tell you he is not dressed he seems to be said the clerk quietly with a glance at the door through which luke was just entering colemans countenance changed he was now puzzled for a moment then a bold plan suggested itself he would charge luke with having stolen the money from him chapter xxix mr coleman is foiled in his attempt luke looked from coleman to the clerk in some surprise he saw from their looks that they were discussing some matter which concerned him you left some money in my charge yesterday mr larkin said the clerk yes your friend here claims it am i to give it to him lukes eyes lighted up indignantly what does this mean mr coleman he demanded sternly it means answered coleman throwing off the mask that the money is mine and that you have no right to it if luke had not witnessed colemans search of his pockets during the night he would have been very much astonished at this brazen statement as it was he had already come to the conclusion that his railroad acquaintance was a sharper i will trouble you to prove your claim to it said luke not at all disturbed by colemans impudent assertion i gave it to you yesterday to place in the safe i did not expect you would put it in in your own name continued coleman with brazen hardihood when did you hand it to me asked luke calmly when we first went up into the room this change in his original charge coleman made in consequence of learning the time of the deposit this is an utter falsehood exclaimed luke indignantly take care young fellow blustered coleman your reputation for honesty isnt of the best i dont like to expose you but a boy who has served a three months term in the penitentiary had better be careful how he acts lukes breath was quite taken away by this unexpected attack the clerk began to eye him with suspicion so confident was colemans tone mr lawrence said luke for he had learned the clerks name will you allow me a word in private i object to this said coleman in a blustering tone whatever you have to say you can say before me yes answered the clerk who did not like colemans bullying tone i will hear what you have to say he led the way into an adjoining room and assumed an air of attention this man is a stranger to me luke commenced i saw him yesterday afternoon for the first time in my life but he says he is your guardian he is no more my guardian than you are indeed i would much sooner select you how did you get acquainted he introduced himself to me as a traveler for h b claflin of new york i did not doubt his statement at the time but now i do especially after what happened in the night what was that asked the clerk pricking up his ears luke went on to describe colemans search of his pockets did you say anything no i wished to see what he was after as i had left nearly all my money with you i was not afraid of being robbed i presume your story is correct in fact i detected him in a misstatement as to the time of giving you the money but i dont want to get into trouble ask him how much money i deposited with you suggested luke he has no idea and will have to guess i have asked him the question once but will do so again the clerk returned to the office with luke coleman eyed them uneasily as if he suspected them of having been engaged in a conspiracy against him well he said are you going to give me my money state the amount said the clerk in a businesslike manner i have already told you that i cant state exactly i handed the money to luke without counting it you must have some idea at any rate said the clerk of course i have there was somewhere around seventyfive dollars this he said with a confidence which he did not feel for it was of course a mere guess you are quite out in your estimate mr coleman it is evident to me that you have made a false claim you will oblige me by settling your bill and leaving the hotel do you think i will submit to such treatment demanded coleman furiously i think youll have to returned the clerk quietly you can go in to breakfast if you like but you must afterward leave the hotel john this to a bellboy go up to number fortyseven and bring down this gentlemans luggage you and the boy are in a conspiracy against me exclaimed coleman angrily i have a great mind to have you both arrested i advise you not to attempt it you may get into trouble coleman apparently did think better of it half an hour later he left the hotel and luke found himself alone he decided that he must be more circumspect hereafter chapter xxx a discovery luke was in chicago but what to do next he did not know he might have advertised in one or more of the chicago papers for james harding formerly in the employ of john armstrong of new york but if this should come to the knowledge of the party who had appropriated the bonds it might be a revelation of the weakness of the case against them again he might apply to a private detective but if he did so the case would pass out of his hands luke had this piece of information to start upon he had been informed that harding left mr armstrongs employment june and as was supposed at once proceeded west if he could get hold of a file of some chicago daily paper for the week succeeding he might look over the last arrivals and ascertain at what hotel harding had stopped this would be something where can i examine a file of some chicago daily paper for mr lawrence he asked of the clerk right here answered the clerk mr goth the landlord has a file of the times for the last ten years would he let me examine the volume for asked luke eagerly certainly i am busy just now but this afternoon i will have the papers brought down to the readingroom he was as good as his word and at three oclock in the afternoon luke sat down before a formidable pile of papers and began his task of examination he began with the paper bearing date june and examined that and the succeeding papers with great care at length his search was rewarded in the paper for june luke discovered the name of james harding and what was a little singular he was registered at the ottawa house luke felt quite exultant at this discovery it might not lead to anything to be sure but still it was an encouragement and seemed to augur well for his ultimate success he went with his discovery to his friend the clerk were you here in june mr lawrence he asked yes i came here in april of that year of course you could hardly be expected to remember a casual guest i am afraid not what is his name james harding james harding yes i do remember him and for a very good reason he took a very severe cold on the way from new york and he lay here in the hotel sick for two weeks he was an elderly man about fiftyfive i should suppose that answers to the description given me do you know where he went to from here there you have me i cant give you any information on that point luke began to think that his discovery would lead to nothing stay though said the clerk after a moments thought i remember picking up a small diary in mr hardings room after he left us i didnt think it of sufficient value to forward to him nor indeed did i know exactly where to send can you show me the diary asked luke hopefully yes i have it upstairs in my chamber wait five minutes and i will get it for you a little later a small blackcovered diary was put in lukes hand he opened it eagerly and began to examine the items jotted down it appeared partly to note down daily expenses but on alternate pages there were occasional memorandums about the fifteenth of may appeared this sentence i have reason to think that my sister mrs ellen ransom is now living in franklin minnesota she is probably in poor circumstances her husband having died in poverty a year since we two are all that is left of a once large family and now that i am shortly to retire from business with a modest competence i feel it will be alike my duty and my pleasure to join her and do what i can to make her comfortable she has a boy who must now be about twelve years old come said luke triumphantly i am making progress decidedly my first step will be to go to franklin minnesota and look up mr harding and his sister after all i ought to be grateful to mr coleman notwithstanding his attempt to rob me but for him i should never have come to the ottawa house and thus i should have lost an important clue luke sat down immediately and wrote to mr armstrong detailing the discovery he had made a letter which pleased his employer and led him to conclude that he had made a good choice in selecting luke for this confidential mission the next day luke left chicago and journeyed by the most direct route to franklin minnesota he ascertained that it was forty miles distant from st paul a few miles off the railroad the last part of the journey was performed in a stage and was somewhat wearisome he breathed a sigh of relief when the stage stopped before the door of a twostory inn with a swinging sign bearing the name franklin house luke entered his name on the register and secured a room he decided to postpone questions till he had enjoyed a good supper and felt refreshed then he went out to the desk and opened a conversation with the landlord or rather submitted first to answering a series of questions propounded by that gentleman youre rather young to be travelin alone my young friend said the innkeeper yes sir where might you be from from new york then youre a long way from home travelin for your health no answered luke with a smile i have no trouble with my health you do look pretty rugged thats a fact goin to settle down in our state i think not i reckon youre not travelin on business youre too young for a drummer the fact is i am in search of a family that i have been told lives or used to live in franklin whats the name the lady is a mrs ransom i wish to see her brotherinlaw mr james harding sho youll have to go farther to find them dont they live here now asked luke disappointed no they moved away six months ago do you know where they went asked luke eagerly not exactly you see there was a great stir about gold being plenty in the black hills and mr harding though he seemed to be pretty well fixed thought he wouldnt mind pickin up a little he induced his sister to go with him that is her boy wanted to go and so she not wantin to be left alone concluded to go too so they went to the black hills do you think it would be hard to find them no james harding is a man thats likely to be known wherever he is just go to where the miners are thickest and i allow youll find him luke made inquiries and ascertaining the best way of reaching the black hills started the next day if i dont find james harding its because i cant he said to himself resolutely chapter xxxi tony dentons call leaving luke on his way to the black hills we will go back to groveton to see how matters are moving on there tony denton had now the excuse he sought for calling upon prince duncan ostensibly his errand related to the debt which randolph had incurred at his saloon but really he had something more important to speak of it may be remarked that squire duncan who had a high idea of his own personal importance looked upon denton as a low and insignificant person and never noticed him when they met casually in the street it is difficult to play the part of an aristocrat in a country village but that is the role which prince duncan assumed had he been a prince in reality as he was by name he could not have borne himself more loftily when he came face to face with those whom he considered his inferiors when in answer to the bell the servant at squire duncans found tony denton standing on the doorstep she looked at him in surprise is the squire at home asked the saloon keeper i believe so said the girl doubtfully i would like to see him say mr denton wishes to see him on important business the message was delivered mr denton repeated the squire in surprise is it tony denton yes sir what can he wish to see me about he says its business of importance sir well bring him in prince duncan assumed his most important attitude and bearing when his visitor entered his presence mr ahem denton i believe he said as if he found difficulty in recognizing tony the same i am ahem surprised to hear that you have any business with me yet so it is squire duncan said tony not perceptibly overawed by the squires grand manner elucidate it said prince duncan stiffly you may not be aware squire duncan that your son randolph has for some time frequented my billiard saloon and has run up a sum of twentyseven dollars i was certainly not aware of it had i been i should have forbidden his going there it is no proper place for my son to frequent well i dont know about that its respectable enough i guess at any rate he seemed to like it and at his request for he was not always provided with money i trusted him till his bill comes to twentyseven dollars you surely dont expect me to pay it said the squire coldly he is a minor as you very well know and when you trusted him you knew you couldnt legally collect your claim well squire i thought id take my chances said tony carelessly i didnt think youd be willing to have him owing bills around the village youre a gentleman and i was sure youd settle the debt then sir you made a very great mistake such bills as that i do not feel called upon to pay was it all incurred for billiards no a part of it was for drinks worse and worse how can you have the face to come here mr denton and tell me that i dont think it needs any face squire its an honest debt you deliberately entrapped my son and lured him into your saloon where he met low companions and squandered his money and time in drinking and low amusements come squire youre a little too fast billiards aint low did you ever see schaefer and vignaux play no sir i take no interest in the game in coming here you have simply wasted your time you will get no money from me then you wont pay your sons debt asked tony denton no instead of rising to go tony denton kept his seat he regarded squire duncan attentively i am sorry sir said prince duncan impatiently i shall have to cut short this interview i will detain you only five minutes sir have you ascertained who robbed the bank i have no time for gossip no sir i suppose you would welcome any information on the subject duncan looked at his visitor now with sharp attention do you know anything about it he asked well perhaps i do were you implicated in it was the next question tony denton smiled a peculiar smile no i wasnt he answered if i had been i dont think i should have called upon you about the matter but i think i know who robbed the bank who then demanded the squire with an uneasy look tony denton rose from his chair advanced to the door which was a little ajar and closed it then he resumed one night late it was after midnight i was taking a walk having just closed my saloon when it happened that my steps led by the bank it was dark not a soul probably in the village was awake save myself when i saw the door of the bank open and a muffled figure came out with a tin box under his arm i came closer yet unobserved and peered at the person i recognized him you recognized him repeated the squire mechanically his face pale and drawn yes do you want to know who it was prince duncan stared at him but did not utter a word it was you the president of the bank continued denton nonsense man said duncan trying to regain his selfcontrol it is not nonsense i can swear to it i mean that it is nonsense about the robbery i visited the bank to withdraw a box of my own of course you can make that statement before the court said tony denton coolly but but you wont think of mentioning this circumstance muttered the squire will you pay randolphs bill yes yes ill draw a check at once so far so good but it isnt far enough i want more you want more ejaculated the squire yes i want a thousanddollar government bond its cheap enough for such a secret but i havent any bonds you can find me one said tony emphatically or ill tell what i know to the directors you see i know more than that what do you know asked duncan terrified i know that you disposed of a part of the bonds on wall street to sharp ketchum i stood outside when you were up in their office great beads of perspiration gathered upon the bankers brow this blow was wholly unexpected and he was wholly unprepared for it he made a feeble resistance but in the end when tony denton left the house he had a thousanddollar bond carefully stowed away in an inside pocket and squire duncan was in such a state of mental collapse that he left his supper untasted randolph was very much surprised when he learned that his father had paid his bill at the billiard saloon and still more surprised that the squire made very little fuss about it chapter xxxii on the way to the black hills just before luke started for the black hills he received the following letter from his faithful friend linton it was sent to new york to the care of mr reed and forwarded it not being considered prudent to have it known at groveton where he was dear luke the letter commenced it seems a long time since i have seen you and i can truly say that i miss you more than i would any other boy in groveton i wonder where you are your mother does not seem to know she only knows you are traveling for mr reed there is not much news groveton you know is a quiet place i see randolph every day he seems very curious to know where you are i think he is disturbed because you have found employment elsewhere he professes to think that you are selling newspapers in new york or tending a peanut stand adding kindly that it is all you are fit for i have heard a rumor that he was often to be seen playing billiards at tony dentons but i dont know whether it is true i sometimes think it would do him good to become a poor boy and have to work for a living we are going to orchard beach next summer as usual and in the fall mamma may take me to europe to stay a year to learn the french language wont that be fine i wish you could go with me but i am afraid you cant sell papers or peanuts enough which is it to pay expenses how long are you going to be away i shall be glad to see you back and so will florence grant and all your other friends of whom you have many in groveton write soon to your affectionate friend linton this letter quite cheered up luke who in his first absence from home naturally felt a little lonely at times linny is a true friend he said he is just as well off as randolph but never puts on airs he is as popular as randolph is unpopular i wish i could go to europe with him upon the earlier portions of lukes journey to the black hills we need not dwell the last hundred or hundred and fifty miles had to be traversed in a stage and this form of traveling luke found wearisome yet not without interest there was a spice of danger too which added excitement if not pleasure to the trip the black hills stage had on more than one occasion been stopped by highwaymen and the passengers robbed the thought that this might happen proved a source of nervous alarm to some of excitement to others lukes fellow passengers included a large portly man a merchant from some western city a clergyman with a white necktie who was sent out by some missionary society to start a church at the black hills two or three laboring men of farmerlike appearance who were probably intending to work in the mines one or two others who could not be classified and a genuine dude as far as appearance went a slenderwaisted softvoiced young man dressed in the latest style who spoke with a slight lisp he hailed from the city of new york and called himself mortimer plantagenet sprague as next to himself luke was the youngest passenger aboard the stage and sat beside him the two became quite intimate in spite of his affected manners and somewhat feminine deportment luke got the idea that mr sprague was not wholly destitute of manly traits if occasion should call for their display one day as they were making three miles an hour over a poor road the conversation fell upon stage robbers what would you do colonel braddon one passenger asked of the western merchant if the stage were stopped by a gang of ruffians shoot em down like dogs sir was the prompt reply if passengers were not so cowardly stages would seldom be robbed all the passengers regarded the valiant colonel with admiring respect and congratulated themselves that they had with them so doughty a champion in case of need for my part said the missionary i am a man of peace and i must perforce submit to these men of violence if they took from me the modest allowance furnished by the society for traveling expenses no doubt sir said colonel braddon you are a minister and men of your profession are not expected to fight as for my friend mr sprague and he directed the attention of the company derisively to the new york dude he would no doubt engage the robbers singlehanded i dont know drawled mortimer sprague i am afraid i couldnt tackle more than two dont you know there was a roar of laughter which did not seem to disturb mr sprague he did not seem to be at all aware that his companions were laughing at him perhaps with the help of my friend mr larkin he added i might be a match for three there was another burst of laughter in which luke could not help joining i am afraid i could not help you much mr sprague he said i think mr sprague said colonel braddon that you and i will have to do the fighting if any attack is made if our friend the minister had one of his sermons with him perhaps that would scare away the highwaymen it would not be the first time they have had an effect on godless men answered the missionary mildly and there was another laugh this time at the colonels expense what takes you to the black hills my young friend asked colonel braddon addressing luke other passengers awaited lukes reply with interest it was unusual to find a boy of sixteen traveling alone in that region i hope to make some money answered luke smiling i suppose that is what we are all after he didnt think it wise to explain his errand fully are you going to dig for gold mr larkin asked mortimer sprague its awfully dirty dont you know and must be dreadfully hard on the back probably i am more used to hard work than you mr sprague answered luke i never worked in my life admitted the dude i really dont know a shovel from a hoe then if i may be permitted to ask said colonel braddon what leads you to the black hills mr sprague i thought id better see something of the country you know besides i had a bet with another feller about whether the hills were weally black or not i bet him a dozen bottles of champagne that they were not black after all this statement was received with a round of laughter which seemed to surprise mr sprague who gazed with mild wonder at his companions saying weally i cant see what you fellers are laughing at i thought id better come myself because the other feller might be colorblind dont you know here mr sprague rubbed his hands and looked about him to see if his joke was appreciated it seems to me that the expense of your journey will foot up considerably more than a dozen bottles of champagne said one of the passengers weally i didnt think of that youve got a great head old fellow after all a fellers got to be somewhere and by jove whats that this ejaculation was produced by the sudden sinking of the two left wheels in the mire in such a manner that the ponderous colonel braddon was thrown into mr spragues lap you see i had to go somewhere said braddon humorously weally i hope we shant get mixed gasped sprague if its all the same to you id rather sit in your lap just a little incident of travel my dear sir said braddon laughing as he resumed his proper seat i should call it rather a large incident said mr sprague recovering his breath i suppose said braddon who seemed rather disposed to chaff his slender traveling companion if you like the black hills you may buy one of them i may answered mr sprague letting his glance rest calmly on his big companion suppose we buy one together colonel braddon laughed but felt that his joke had not been successful the conversation languished after awhile it was such hard work riding in a lumbering coach over the most detestable roads that the passengers found it hard to be sociable but a surprise was in store the coach made a sudden stop two horsemen appeared at the window and a stern voice said well trouble you to get out gentlemen well take charge of what money and valuables you have about you chapter xxxiii two unexpected champions it may well be imagined that there was a commotion among the passengers when this stern summons was heard the highwaymen were but two in number but each was armed with a revolver ready for instant use one by one the passengers descended from the stage and stood trembling and panicstricken in the presence of the masked robbers there seems to be something in a mask which inspires added terror though it makes the wearers neither stronger nor more effective luke certainly felt startled and uncomfortable for he felt that he must surrender the money he had with him and this would be inconvenient though the loss would not be his but his employers but singularly enough the passenger who seemed most nervous and terrified was the stalwart colonel braddon who had boasted most noisily of what he would do in case the stage were attacked he nervously felt in his pockets for his money his face pale and ashen and said imploringly spare my life gentlemen i will give you all i have all right old man said one of the stage robbers as he took the proffered pocketbook havent you any more money no on my honor gentlemen it will leave me penniless hand over your watch with a groan colonel braddon handed over a gold stemwinder of waltham make couldnt you leave me the watch gentlemen he said imploringly it was a present to me last christmas cant spare it make your friends give you another next came the turn of mortimer sprague the young dude hand over your spondulics young feller said the second gentleman of the road weally im afraid i cant without a good deal of twouble oh curse the trouble do as i bid or ill break your silly head you see gentlemen i keep my money in my boots dont you know take off your boots then and be quick about it i cant that is without help theyre awfully tight dont you know which boot is your money in asked the road agent impatiently the right boot hold it up then and ill help you the road agent stooped over not suspecting any danger and in doing so laid down his revolver in a flash mortimer sprague electrified not only his assailants but all the stage passengers by producing a couple of revolvers which he pointed at the two road agents and in a stern voice wholly unlike the affected tones in which he had hitherto spoken said get out of here you ruffians or ill fire the startled road agent tried to pick up his revolver but sprague instantly put his foot on it and repeated the command the other road agent who was occupied with the minister turned to assist his comrade when he too received a check from an unexpected source the minister who was an old man had a stout staff which he used to guide him in his steps he raised it and brought it down with emphasis on the arm which held the revolver exclaiming the sword of the lord and of gideon i smite thee thou bold bad man not in anger but as an instrument of retribution well done reverend doctor exclaimed mortimer sprague between us we will lay the rascals out luke who was close at hand secured the fallen revolver be fore the road agents arm had got over tingling with the paralyzing blow dealt by the minister who in spite of his advanced age possessed a muscular arm now git you two exclaimed mortimer sprague git if you want to escape with whole bones never perhaps did two road agents look more foolish than these who had suffered such a sudden and humiliating discomfiture from those among the passengers whom they had feared least the young dude and the old missionary had done battle for the entire stageload of passengers and vanquished the masked robbers before whom the rest trembled stop said colonel braddon with a sudden thought one of the rascals has got my pocketbook which one asked mortimer the colonel pointed him out instantly the dude fired and a bullet whistled within a few inches of the road agents head drop that pocketbook he exclaimed or ill send another messenger for it that was only a warning with an execration the thoroughly terrified robber threw down the pocketbook and the relieved owner hastened forward to pick it up i thought id fetch him dont you know said the dude relapsing into his soft drawl by this time both the road agents were at a safe distance and the rescued passengers breathed more freely really mr sprague said colonel braddon pompously you are entitled to a great deal of credit for your gallant behavior you did what i proposed to do of course i had to submit to losing my pocketbook but i was just preparing to draw my revolver when you got the start of me if id only known it colonel drawled mr sprague id have left the job for you weally it would have saved me a good deal of trouble but i think the reverend doctor here is entitled to the thanks of the company i never knew exactly what the sword of the lord and of gideon was before but i see it means a good stout stick i was speaking figuratively my young friend said the missionary i am not sure but i have acted unprofessionally but when i saw those men of violence despoiling us i felt the natural man rise within me and i smote him hip and thigh i thought you hit him on the arm doctor said mr sprague again i spoke figuratively my young friend i cannot say i regret yielding to the impulse that moved me i feel that i have helped to foil the plans of the wicked doctor said one of the miners youve true grit when you preach at the black hills count me and my friends among the listeners were all willing to help along your new church for youre one of the right sort my friends i will gladly accept your kind proposal but i trust it will not be solely because i have used this arm of flesh in your defense mr sprague and i have but acted as humble instruments in the hands of a higher power well gentlemen said colonel braddon i think we may as well get into the stage again and resume our journey what shall i do with this revolver asked luke indicating the one he had picked up keep it said the colonel youll make better use of it than the rascal who lost it ive got an extra one here said mortimer sprague raising the one on which he had put his foot i dont need it myself so i will offer it to the reverend doctor the missionary shook his head i should not know how to use it he said nor indeed am i sure that i should feel justified in doing so may i have it sir asked one of the miners certainly if you want it said mr sprague i couldnt afford to buy one but i see that i shall need one out here in five minutes the stage was again on its way and no further adventures were met with about the middle of the next day the party arrived at deadwood chapter xxxiv fentons gulch deadwood at the time of lukes arrival looked more like a mining camp than a town the first settlers had neither the time nor the money to build elaborate dwellings anything however rough that would provide a shelter was deemed sufficient luxury was not dreamed of and even ordinary comforts were only partially supplied luke put up at a rude hotel and the next morning began to make inquiries for mr harding he ascertained that the person of whom he was in search had arrived not many weeks previous accompanied by his sister the latter however soon concluded that deadwood was no suitable residence for ladies and had returned to her former home or some place near by mr harding remained with a view of trying his luck at the mines the next point to be ascertained was to what mines he had directed his steps this information was hard to obtain finally a man who had just returned to deadwood hearing luke making inquiries of the hotel clerk said i say young chap is the man you are after an old party over fifty with gray hair and a long nose i think that is the right description said luke eagerly can you tell me anything about him the party i mean he may be harding or may be somebody else is lying sick at fentons gulch about a days journey from here say twenty miles sick what is the matter with him he took a bad cold and being an old man couldnt stand it as well as if he were twenty years younger i left him in an old cabin lying on a blanket looking about as miserable as you would want to see are you a friend of his i am not acquainted with him answered luke but i am sent out by a friend of his in the east i am quite anxious to find him can you give me directions i can do better i can guide you there i only came to deadwood for some supplies and i go back tomorrow morning if you will let me accompany you i will be very much obliged you can come with me and welcome i shall be glad of your company are you alone yes seems to me youre rather a young chap to come out here alone i suppose i am returned luke smiling but there was no one else to come with me if i find mr harding i shall be all right i can promise you that it aint likely he has got up from his sickbed and left the mines i reckon youll find him flat on his back as i left him luke learned that his mining friend was known as jack baxter he seemed a sociable and agreeable man though rather rough in his outward appearance and manners the next morning they started in company and were compelled to travel all day toward sunset they reached the place known as fentons gulch it was a wild and drearylooking place but had a good reputation for its yield of gold dust thats where youll find the man youre after said baxter pointing to a dilapidated cabin somewhat to the left of the mines luke went up to the cabin the door of which was open and looked in on a pallet in the corner lay a tall man pale and emaciated he heard the slight noise at the door and without turning his head said come in friend whoever you are upon this luke advanced into the cabin is this mr james harding he asked the sick man turned his head and his glance rested with surprise upon the boy of sixteen who addressed him have i seen you before he asked no sir i have only just arrived at the gulch you are mr harding yes that is my name but how did you know it i am here in search of you mr harding how is that asked the sick man quickly is my sister sick not that i know of i come from mr armstrong in new york you come from mr armstrong repeated the sick man in evident surprise have you any message for me from him yes but that can wait i am sorry to find you sick i hope that it is nothing serious it would not be serious if i were in a settlement where i could obtain a good doctor and proper medicines everything is serious here i have no care or attention and no medicines do you feel able to get away from here it would be better for you to be at deadwood than here if i had anyone to go with me i might venture to start for deadwood i am at your service mr harding the sick man looked at luke with a puzzled expression you are very kind he said after a pause what is your name luke larkin and you know mr armstrong yes i am his messenger but how came he to send a boy so far it is not like him luke laughed no doubt you think him unwise he said the fact was he took me for lack of a better besides the mission was a confidential one and he thought he could trust me young as i am you say you have a message for me queried harding yes what is it first can i do something for your comfort cant i get you some breakfast the message first i will give it at once do you remember purchasing some government bonds for mr armstrong a short time before you left his employment yes what of them have you preserved the numbers of the bonds luke inquired anxiously why do you ask because mr armstrong has lost his list and they have been stolen till he learns the numbers he will stand no chance of identifying or recovering them i am sure i have the numbers feel in the pocket of my coat yonder and you will find a wallet take it out and bring it to me luke obeyed directions the sick man opened the wallet and began to examine the contents finally he drew out a paper which he unfolded here is the list i was sure i had them lukes eyes lighted up with exultation it was clear that he had succeeded in his mission he felt that he had justified the confidence which mr armstrong had reposed in him and that the outlay would prove not to have been wasted may i copy them he asked certainly since you are the agent of mr armstrong or you may have the original paper i will copy them so that if that paper is lost i may still have the numbers and now what can i do for you the resources of fentons gulch were limited but luke succeeded in getting together materials for a breakfast for the sick man the latter brightened up when he had eaten a sparing meal it cheered him also to find that there was someone to whom he could look for friendly services to make my story short on the second day he felt able to start with luke for deadwood which he reached without any serious effect except a considerable degree of fatigue arrived at deadwood where there were postal facilities luke lost no time in writing a letter to mr armstrong enclosing a list of the stolen bonds he gave a brief account of the circumstances under which he had found mr harding and promised to return as soon as he could get the sick man back to his farm in minnesota when this letter was received roland reed was in the merchants office look at that mr reed said armstrong triumphantly that boy is as smart as lightning some people might have thought me a fool for trusting so young a boy but the result has justified me now my course is clear with the help of these numbers i shall soon be able to trace the theft and convict the guilty party chapter xxxv back in groveton meanwhile some things occurred in groveton which require to be chronicled since the visit of tony denton and the knowledge that his secret was known prince duncan had changed in manner and appearance there was an anxious look upon his face and a haggard look which led some of his friends to think that his health was affected indeed this was true for any mental disturbance is likely to affect the body by way of diverting attention from the cause of this altered appearance mr duncan began to complain of overwork and to hint that he might have to travel for his health it occurred to him privately that circumstances might arise which would make it necessary for him to go to canada for a lengthened period with his secret in the possession of such a man as tony denton he could not feel safe besides he suspected the keeper of the billiardroom would not feel satisfied with the thousanddollar bond he had extorted from him but would after awhile call for more in this he was right scarcely a week had elapsed since his first visit when the servant announced one morning that a man wished to see him do you know who it is mary asked the squire yes sir its tony denton prince duncans face contracted and his heart sank within him he would gladly have refused to see his visitor but knowing the hold that tony had upon him he did not dare offend him you may tell him to come in he said with a troubled look what can the master have to do with a man like that thought mary wondering i wouldnt let him into the house if i was a squire tony denton entered the room with an assumption of ease which was very disagreeable to mr duncan i thought id call to see you squire he said take a seat mr denton said the squire coldly tony did not seem at all put out by the coldness of his reception i spose you remember what passed at our last meeting mr duncan he said in a jaunty way well sir responded prince duncan in a forbidding tone we came to a little friendly arrangement if you remember continued denton well sir there is no need to refer to the matter now pardon me squire but i am obliged to keep to it why because ive been unlucky i suppose mr denton said the squire haughtily you are capable of managing your own business if you dont manage it well and meet with losses i certainly am not responsible and i cannot understand why you bring the matter to me you see squire said tony with a grin i look upon you as a friend and so it is natural that i should come to you for advice i wish i dared kick the fellow out of the house thought prince duncan he is a low scamp and i dont like the reputation of having such visitors under ordinary circumstances and but for the secret which tony possessed he would not have been suffered to remain in the squires study five minutes but conscience makes cowards of us all and mr duncan felt that he was no longer his own master ill tell you about the bad luck squire tony resumed you know the bond you gave me the last time i called mr duncan winced and he did not reply i see you remember it well i thought i might have the luck to double it so i went up to new york and went to see one of them wall street brokers i asked his advice and he told me id better buy two hundred shares of some kind of stock leaving the bond with him as margin he said i was pretty sure to make a good deal of money and i thought so myself but the stock went down and yesterday i got a letter from him saying that the margin was all exhausted and i must give him another or he would sell out the stock mr denton you have been a fool exclaimed mr duncan irritably you might have known that would be the result of your insane folly youve lost your thousand dollars and what have you got to show for it you may be right squire but i dont want to let the matter end so i want you to give me another bond you do eh said duncan indignantly so you want to throw away another thousand dollars do you if i make good the margin the stockll go up likely and i wont lose anything you can do as you please of course but you will have to go elsewhere for your money will i asked tony coolly there is no one else who would let me have the money i wont let you have another cent you may rely upon that exclaimed prince duncan furiously i guess youll think better of that squire said tony fixing his keen black eyes on the bank president why should i retorted duncan but his heart sank within him for he understood very well what the answer would be because you know what the consequences of refusal would be denton answered coolly i dont understand you stammered the squire but it was evident from his startled look that he did i thought you would returned tony denton quietly you know very well that my evidence would convict you as the person who robbed the bank hush ejaculated prince duncan in nervous alarm tony denton smiled with a consciousness of power i have no wish to expose you he said if you will stand my friend in that moment prince duncan bitterly regretted the false step he had taken to be in the power of such a man was indeed a terrible form of retribution explain your meaning he said reluctantly i want another government bond for a thousand dollars but when i gave you the first you promised to preserve silence and trouble me no more i have been unfortunate as i already explained to you i dont see how that alters matters you took the risk voluntarily why should i suffer because you were imprudent and lost your money i cant argue with you squire said tony with an insolent smile you are too smart for me all i have to say is that i must have another bond suppose i should give it to you what assurance have i that you will not make another demand i will give you the promise in writing if you like knowing that i could not make use of any such paper with out betraying myself well there is that objection certainly but i cant do anything better what do you propose to do with the bond deposit it with my broker as i have already told you i advise you not to do so make up your mind to lose the first and keep the second in your own hands i will consider your advice squire but it was very clear that tony denton would not follow it all at once prince duncan brightened up he had a happy thought should it be discovered that the bonds used by tony denton belonged to the contents of the stolen box might he not succeed in throwing the whole blame on the billiardsaloon keeper and have him arrested as the thief the possession and use of the bonds would be very damaging and tonys reputation was not such as to protect him here seemed to be a rift in the clouds and it was with comparative cheerfulness that mr duncan placed the second bond in the hands of the visitor of course he said it will be for your interest not to let any one know from whom you obtained this all right i understand well good morning squire im glad things are satisfactory good morning mr denton when tony had left the room prince duncan threw himself back in his chair and reflected his thoughts were busy with the man who had just left him and he tried to arrange some method of throwing the guilt upon denton yet perhaps even that would not be necessary so far as mr duncan knew there was no record in mr armstrongs possession of the numbers of the bonds and in that case they would not be identified if i only knew positively that the numbers would not turn up i should feel perfectly secure and could realize on the bonds at any time he thought i will wait awhile and i may see my way clear chapter xxxvi a letter from luke theres a letter for you linton said henry wagner as he met linton tomkins near the hotel i just saw your name on the list in the groveton postoffice as in many country offices it was the custom to post a list of those for whom letters had been received it must be from luke thought linton joyfully and he bent his steps immediately toward the office no one in the village outside of lukes family missed him more than linton though luke was two years and a half older they had always been intimate friends lintons family occupied a higher social position but there was nothing snobbish about linton as there was about randolph and it made no difference to him that luke lived in a small and humble cottage and till recently had been obliged to wear old and shabby clothes in this democratic spirit linton was encouraged by his parents who while appreciating the refinement which is apt to be connected with liberal means were too sensible to undervalue sterling merit and good character linton was right his letter was from luke it read thus dear linny i was very glad to receive your letter it made me homesick for a short time at any rate it made me wish that i could be back for an hour in dear old groveton i cannot tell you where i am for that is a secret of my employer i am a long way from home i can tell you that much when i get home i shall be able to tell you all you will be glad to know that i have succeeded in the mission on which i was sent and have revived a telegram of thanks from my employer it will not be long now before i am back in groveton i wonder if my dear friend randolph will be glad to see me you can remember me to him when you see him it will gratify him to know that i am well and doing well and that my prospects for the future are excellent give my regards to your father and mother who have always been kind to me i shall come and see you the first thing after i return if you only knew how hard i find it to refrain from telling you all where i am and what adventures i have met with how i came near being robbed twice and many other things you would appreciate my selfdenial but you shall know all very soon i have had a good time the best time in my life let mother read this letter and believe me dear lin your affectionate friend luke larkin lintons curiosity was naturally excited by the references in lukes letter where can luke be he asked i wish he were at liberty to tell linton never dreamed however that his friend was two thousand miles away in the wild west it would have seemed to him utterly improbable he was folding up the letter as he was walking homeward when he met randolph duncan whats that linton he asked a loveletter not much i havent got so far along it is a letter from luke larkin oh sneered randolph i congratulate you on your correspondent is he in new york the letter is postmarked in new york but he is traveling traveling where is he traveling he doesnt say this letter is forwarded by mr reed the man who robbed the bank what makes you say that what proof have you that he robbed the bank i cant prove it but my father thinks he is the robber there was something very suspicious about that tin box which he handed to luke it was opened in court and proved to contain private papers oh thats easily seen through he took out the bonds and put in the papers i suppose he has experience in that sort of thing does your father think that yes he does what does luke say wait a minute and i will read you a paragraph said linton with a mischievous smile thereupon he read the paragraph in which randolph was mentioned what does he mean by calling me his dear friend exclaimed randolph indignantly i never was his dear friend and never want to be i believe you randolph shall i tell you what he means yes he means it for a joke he knows you dont like him and he isnt breaking his heart over it its pretty cheeky in him just tell him when you write that he neednt call me his dear friend again you might hurt his feelings said linton gravely that for his feelings said randolph with a snap of his fingers you say hes traveling shall i tell you what i think he is doing if you like i think he is traveling with a blackingbox in his hand its just the business for him i dont think you are right he wouldnt make enough in that way to pay traveling expenses he says he has twice come near being robbed randolph laughed derisively a thief wouldnt make much robbing him he said if he got twentyfive cents hed be lucky you forget that he has a nice silver watch randolph frowned this with him was a sore reflection much as he was disposed to look down upon luke he was aware that lukes watch was better than his and though he had importuned his father more than once to buy him a gold watch he saw no immediate prospect of his wish being granted oh well ive talked enough of luke larkin he said snappishly he isnt worth so many words i am very much surprised that a gentlemans son like you linton should demean himself by keeping company with such a boy there is no boy in the village whom i would rather associate with said linton with sturdy friendship i dont admire your taste then said randolph i dont believe your father and mother like you to keep such company there you are mistaken said linton with spirit they have an excellent opinion of luke and if he should ever need a friend i am sure my father would be willing to help him well i must be going said randolph by no means pleased with this advocacy of luke come round and see me soon you never come to our house linton answered politely but did not mean to become intimate with randolph who was by no means to his taste he knew that it was only his social position that won him the invitation and that if his father should suddenly lose his property randolphs cordiality would be sensibly diminished such friendship he felt was not to be valued what are you thinking about you seem in a brown study said a pleasant voice looking up linton recognized his teacher mr hooper i was thinking of luke larkin answered linton by the by where is luke i have not seen him for some time he is traveling for mr reed i believe the man who committed the tin box to his care yes sir do you know where he is no sir i have just received a letter from him but he says he is not at liberty to mention where he is will he be home soon yes i think so i shall be glad to see him he is one of the most promising of my pupils lintons expressive face showed the pleasure he felt at this commendation of his friend he felt more gratified than if mr hooper had directly praised him luke can stand randolphs depreciation he reflected with such a friend as mr hooper linton was destined to meet plenty of acquaintances scarcely had he parted from mr hooper when tony denton met him the keeper of the billiardroom was always on the alert to ingratiate himself with the young people of the village looking upon them as possible patrons of his rooms he would have been glad to draw in linton on account of his fathers prominent position in the village good day my young friend he said with suavity good day mr denton responded linton who thought it due to himself to be polite though he did not fancy mr denton i should be very glad to have you look in at my billiardroom mr linton continued tony thank you sir but i dont think my father would like to have me visit a billiardsaloon at any rate till i am older oh ill see that you come to no harm if you dont want to play you can look on at any rate i am obliged to you for your polite invitation oh i like to have the nice boys of the village around me your friend randolph duncan often visits me so i have heard replied linton well i wont keep you but remember my invitation i am not very likely to accept thought linton i have heard that randolph visits the billiardroom too often for his good chapter xxxvii an incident on the cars as soon as possible luke started on his return to new york he had enjoyed his journey but now he felt a longing to see home and friends once more his journey to chicago was uneventful he stayed there a few hours and then started on his way home on his trip from chicago to detroit he fell in with an old acquaintance unexpectedly when about thirty miles from detroit having as a seatmate a very large man who compressed him within uncomfortable limits he took his satchel and passing into the car next forward took a seat a few feet from the door he had scarcely seated himself when looking around he discovered in the second seat beyond his old chicago acquaintance mr j madison coleman he was as smooth and affable as ever and was chatting pleasantly with a rough farmerlikelooking man who seemed very much taken with his attractive companion i wonder what mischief coleman is up to now thought luke he was so near that he was able to hear the conversation that passed between them yes my friend said mr coleman i am well acquainted with detroit business has called me there very often and it will give me great pleasure to be of service to you in any way what business are you in inquired the other i am traveling for h b claflin co of new york of course you have heard of them they are the largest wholesale drygoods firm in the united states you dont say so returned the farmer respectfully do you get pretty good pay i am not at liberty to tell just what pay i get said mr coleman but i am willing to admit that it is over four thousand dollars you dont say so ejaculated the farmer my i think myself pretty lucky when i make a thousand dollars a year oh well my dear sir your expenses are very light compared to mine i spend about ten dollars a day on an average jehu ejaculated the farmer well that is a pile do all the men that travel for your firm get as much salary as you oh no i am one of the principal salesmen and am paid extra i am always successful if i do say it myself and the firm know it and pay me accordingly they know that several other firms are after me and would get me away if they didnt pay me my price i suppose you know all about investments being a business man yes i know a great deal about them answered mr coleman his eyes sparkling with pleasure at this evidence that his companion had money if you have any money to invest i shall be very glad to advise you well you see ive just had a note for two hundred and fifty dollars paid in by a neighbor whos been owin it for two years and i thought id go up to detroit and put it in the savingsbank my good friend the savingsbank pays but a small rate of interest i think i know a business man of detroit who will take your money and pay you ten per cent ten per cent exclaimed the farmer joyfully my i didnt think i could get over four or six so you cant in a general way answered coleman but business men who are turning over their money once a month can afford to pay a good deal more but is your friend safe he inquired anxiously safe as the bank of england answered coleman ive lent him a thousand dollars at a time myself and always got principal and interest regularly i generally have a few thousand invested he added in a matterofcourse manner id be glad to get ten per cent said the farmer that would be twentyfive dollars a year on my money exactly i dare say you didnt get over six per cent on the note i got seven but i had to wait for the interest sometimes youll never have to wait for interest if you lend to my friend i am only afraid he wont be willing to take so small a sum still ill speak a good word for you and he will make an exception in your favor thank you sir said the farmer gratefully i guess ill let him have it you couldnt do better hes a highminded responsible man i would offer to take the money myself but i really have no use for it i have at present two thousand dollars in bank waiting for investment you dont say so said the farmer eying coleman with the respect due to so large a capitalist yes ive got it in the savingsbank for the time being if my friend can make use of it i shall let him have it hes just as safe as a savingsbank the farmers confidence in mr coleman was evidently fully established the young man talked so smoothly and confidently that he would have imposed upon one who had seen far more of the world than farmer jones im in luck to fall in with you mr coleman said the drummer with suavity j madison coleman my grandfather was a cousin of president james madison and that accounts for my receiving that name the farmers respect was further increased it was quite an event to fall in with so near a relative of an illustrious expresident and he was flattered to find that a young man of such lineage was disposed to treat him with such friendly familiarity are you going to stay long in detroit asked the farmer two or three days i shall be extremely busy but i shall find time to attend to your business in fact i feel an interest in you my friend and shall be glad to do you a service you are very kind and im obleeged to you said the farmer gratefully now if you will excuse me for a few minutes i will go into the smokingcar and have a smoke when he had left the car luke immediately left his seat and went forward to where the farmer was sitting excuse me he said but i saw you talking to a young man just now yes answered the farmer complacently hes a relative of president madison i want to warn you against him i know him to be a swindler what exclaimed the farmer eying luke suspiciously who be you youre nothing but a boy that is true but i am traveling on business this mr coleman tried to rob me about a fortnight since and nearly succeeded i heard him talking to you about money yes he was going to help me invest some money i have with me he said he could get me ten per cent take my advice and put it in a savingsbank then it will be safe no man who offers to pay ten per cent for money can be relied upon perhaps you want to rob me yourself said the farmer suspiciously do i look like it asked luke smiling isnt my advice good to put the money in a savingsbank but i will tell you how i fell in with mr coleman and how he tried to swindle me and then you can judge for yourself this luke did briefly and his tone and manner carried conviction the farmer became extremely indignant at the intended fraud and promised to have nothing to do with coleman i will take my old seat then said luke i dont want coleman to know who warned you presently coleman came back and was about to resume his seat beside the farmer you see i have come back he said you neednt have troubled yourself said the farmer with a lowering frown you nearly took me in with your smooth words but ive got my money yet and i mean to keep it your friend cant have it what does all this mean my friend asked coleman in real amazement is it possible you distrust me why i was going to put myself to inconvenience to do you a service then you neednt i know you you wanted to swindle me out of my two hundred and fifty dollars sir you insult me exclaimed coleman with lofty indignation what do i a rich man want of your paltry two hundred and fifty dollars i dont believe you are a rich man didnt i tell you i have been warned against you who dared to talk against me asked coleman indignantly then casting his eyes about he noticed luke for the first time now it was all clear to him striding up to lukes seat he said threateningly have you been talking against me you young jackanapes yes mr coleman i have answered luke steadily i thought it my duty to inform this man of your character i have advised him to put his money into a savingsbank curse you for an impertinent meddler said coleman wrathfully ill get even with you for this you can do as you please said luke calmly coleman went up to the farmer and said abruptly youve been imposed upon by an unprincipled boy hes been telling you lies about me he has given me good advice said the farmer sturdily and i shall follow it you are making a fool of yourself that is better than to be made fool of and lose my money coleman saw that the game was lost and left the car he would gladly have assaulted luke but knew that it would only get him into trouble chapter xxxviii lukes return mr armstrong was sitting in his office one morning when the door opened and luke entered his face flushed with health and his cheeks browned by exposure you see ive got back mr armstrong he said advancing with a smile welcome home luke exclaimed the merchant heartily grasping our heros hand cordially i hope you are satisfied with me said luke satisfied i ought to be you have done yourself the greatest credit it is seldom a boy of your age exhibits such good judgment and discretion thank you sir said luke gratefully i was obliged to spend a good deal of money he added and i have arrived in new york with only three dollars and seventyfive cents in my pocket i have no fault to find with your expenses said mr armstrong promptly nor would i have complained if you had spent twice as much the main thing was to succeed and you have succeeded i am glad to hear you speak so said luke relieved to me it seemed a great deal of money you gave me two hundred dollars and i have less than five dollars left here it is and luke drew the sum from his pocket and tendered it to the merchant i cant take it said mr armstrong you dont owe me any money it is i who am owing you take this on account and he drew a roll of bills from his pocketbook and handed it to luke here are a hundred dollars on account he continued this is too much mr armstrong said luke quite overwhelmed with the magnitude of the gift let me be the judge of that said mr armstrong kindly there is only one thing luke that i should have liked to have you do what is that sir i should like to have had you bring me a list of the numbers certified to by mr harding lukes answer was to draw from the inside pocket of his vest a paper signed by the old bookkeeper containing a list of the numbers regularly subscribed and certified to is that what you wished sir he asked you are a wonderful boy said the merchant admiringly was this your idea or mr hardings i believe i suggested it to him said luke modestly that makes all clear sailing said mr armstrong here are fifty dollars more you deserve it for your thoughtfulness you have given me enough already said luke drawing back my dear boy it is evident that you still have something to learn in the way of business when a rich old fellow offers you money which he can well afford you had better take it that removes all my objections said luke but i am afraid you will spoil me with your liberality mr armstrong i will take the risk of it but here is another of your friends the door had just opened and roland reed entered there was another cordial greeting and luke felt that it was pleasant indeed to have two such good friends when are you going to groveton luke asked mr reed i shall go this afternoon if there is nothing more you wish me to do i am anxious to see my mother that is quite right luke your mother is your best friend and deserves all the attention you can give her i shall probably go to groveton myself tomorrow after luke had left the office mr reed remained to consult with the merchant as to what was the best thing to do both were satisfied that prince duncan the president of the bank was the real thief who had robbed the bank there were two courses open a criminal prosecution or a private arrangement which should include the return of the stolen property the latter course was determined upon but should it prove ineffective severer measures were to be resorted to chapter xxxix how luke was received lukes return to groveton was received with delight by his mother and his true friend linton naturally randolph displayed the same feelings toward him as ever it so chanced that he met luke only an hour after his arrival he would have passed him by unnoticed but for the curiosity he felt to know where he had been and what he was intending to do humph so youre back again he remarked yes answered luke with a smile i hope you havent missed me much randolph oh ive managed to live through it returned randolph with what he thought to be cutting sarcasm i am glad of that where were you asked randolph abruptly i was in new york a part of the time said luke where were you the rest of the time i was traveling that sounds large perhaps you were traveling with a handorgan perhaps i was well what are you going to do now thank you for your kind interest in me randolph i will tell you as soon as i know oh you neednt think i feel interest in you then i wont you are impertinent said randolph scowling it dawned upon him that luke was chaffing him i dont mean to be if i have been i apologize if you know of any situation which will pay me a fair sum i wish you would mention me ill see about it said randolph in an important tone he was pleased at lukes change of tone i dont think you can get back as janitor for my father doesnt like you couldnt you intercede for me randolph why the fact is you put on so many airs for a poor boy that i shouldnt feel justified in recommending you it is your own fault well perhaps it is said luke i am glad you acknowledge it i dont know but my father will give you a chance to work round our house make fires and run errands what would he pay asked luke in a businesslike tone he might pay a dollar and a half a week im afraid i couldnt support myself on that oh well thats your lookout its better than loafing round doing nothing youre right there randolph ill just mention it to father then no thank you i shouldnt wonder if mr reed might find something for me to do oh the man that robbed the bank said randolph turning up his nose it may soon be discovered that some one else robbed the bank i dont believe it here the two boys parted luke said linton the same day have you decided what you are going to do not yet but i have friends who i think will look out for me because my father says he will find you a place if you fail to get one elsewhere tell your father that i think he is very kind there is no one to whom i would more willingly be indebted for a favor if i should find myself unemployed i will come to him all right i am going to drive over to coleraine the next town this afternoon will you go with me i should like nothing better what a difference there is between randolph and linton thought luke chapter xl the bank robber is found tony denton lost no time in going up to the city with the second bond he had extracted from the fears of prince duncan he went directly to the office of his brokers gay sears and announced that he was prepared to deposit additional margin the bond was received and taken to the partners in the back office some four minutes elapsed and the clerk reappeared mr denton will you step into the back office he said certainly answered tony cheerfully he found the two brokers within this is mr denton said the senior partner yes sir you offer this bond as additional margin on the shares we hold in your name yes of course mr denton said mr gay searchingly where did you get this bond where did i get it repeated denton nervously why i bought it how long since about a year the two partners exchanged glances where do you live mr denton in groveton ahem mr sears will you be kind enough to draw out the necessary papers tony denton felt relieved the trouble seemed to be over mr gay at the same time stepped into the main office and gave a direction to one of the clerks mr sears drew out a large sheet of foolscap and began in very deliberate fashion to write he kept on writing for some minutes tony denton wondered why so much writing should be necessary in a transaction of this kind five minutes later a young man looked into the office and said addressing mr gay all right upon that mr sears suspended writing mr denton said mr gay are you aware that this bond which you have brought us was stolen from the groveton bank i dont believe it gasped denton turning pale the numbers of the stolen bonds have been sent to all the bankers and brokers in the city this is one and the one you brought us not long since is another do you persist in saying that you bought this bond a year ago no no exclaimed denton terrified did you rob the bank no i didnt ejaculated the terrified man wiping the perspiration from his brow where then did you get the bonds i got them both from prince duncan president of the bank both partners looked surprised one of them went to the door of the office and called in mr armstrong who as well as a policeman had been sent for tony dentons statement was repeated to him i am not surprised he said i expected it tony denton now made a clean breast of the whole affair and his words were taken down are you willing to go to groveton with me and repeat this in presence of mr duncan asked mr armstrong yes will you not have him arrested asked mr gay no he has every reason to keep faith with me it was rather late in the day when mr armstrong accompanied by tony denton made their appearance at the house of prince duncan when the bankers eyes rested on the strangely assorted pair his heart sank within him he had a suspicion of what it meant we have called on you mr duncan on a matter of importance said mr armstrong very well answered duncan faintly it is useless to mince matters i have evidence outside of this mans to show that it was you who robbed the bank of which you are president and appropriated to your own use the bonds which it contained this is a strange charge to bring against a man in my position where is your proof demanded duncan attempting to bluster i have mr dentons evidence that he obtained two thousanddollar bonds of you very well suppose i did sell him two such bonds they were among the bonds stolen it is not true they were bonds i have had for five years your denial is useless the numbers betray you you did not have the numbers of the bonds so you think but i have obtained them from an old bookkeeper of mine now at the west i sent a special messenger out to obtain the list from him would you like to know who the messenger was who was it luke larkin that boy exclaimed duncan bitterly yes that boy supplied me with the necessary proof and now i have a word to say i can send you to prison but for the sake of your family i would prefer to spare you but the bonds must be given up i havent them all in my possession then you must pay me the market price of those you have used the last one given to this man is safe it will reduce me to poverty said prince duncan in great agitation nevertheless it must be done said mr armstrong sternly moreover you must resign your position as president of the bank and on that condition you will be allowed to go free and i will not expose you of course squire duncan was compelled to accept these terms he saved a small sum out of the wreck of his fortune and with his family removed to the west where they were obliged to adopt a very different style of living randolph is now an office boy at a salary of four dollars a week and is no longer able to swagger and boast as he has done hitherto mr tomkins lintons father was elected president of the groveton bank in place of mr duncan much to the satisfaction of luke roland reed much to the surprise of luke revealed himself as a cousin of mr larkin who for twentyfive years had been lost sight of he had changed his name on account of some trouble into which he had been betrayed by prince duncan and thus had not been recognized you need be under no anxiety about luke and his prospects he said to mrs larkin i shall make over to him ten thousand dollars at once constituting myself his guardian and will see that he is well started in business my friend mr armstrong proposes to take him into his office if you do not object at a liberal salary i shall miss him very much said mrs larkin though i am thankful that he is to be so well provided for he can come home every saturday night and stay until monday morning said mr reed who by the way chose to retain his name in place of his old one will that satisfy you it ought to surely and i am grateful to providence for all the blessings which it has showered upon me and mine there was another change mr reed built a neat and commodious house in the pleasantest part of the village and there mrs larkin removed with his little daughter of whom she still had the charge no one rejoiced more sincerely at lukes good fortune than linton who throughout had been a true and faithful friend he is at present visiting europe with his mother and has written an earnest letter asking luke to join him but luke feels that he cannot leave a good business position and must postpone the pleasure of traveling till he is older mr j madison coleman the enterprising drummer has got into trouble and is at present an inmate of the state penitentiary at joliet illinois it is fortunate for the traveling public so many of whom he has swindled that he is for a time placed where he can do no more mischief so closes an eventful passage in the life of luke larkin he has struggled upward from a boyhood of privation and selfdenial into a youth and manhood of prosperity and honor there has been some luck about it i admit but after all he is indebted for most of his good fortune to his own good qualities
