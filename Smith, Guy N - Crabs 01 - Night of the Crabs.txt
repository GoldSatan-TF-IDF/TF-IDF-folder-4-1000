chapter the sunlight sparkled and shimmered on the deep blue of the incoming tide the waves lapping gently at the harbour wall fishingsmacks bobbed lazily on the slight swell and flocks of seagulls screeched noisily as they anticipated the titbits which would be thrown overboard as the latest catch was unloaded behind the range of mountains where the deep green of summer and the purple heather was just coming into full bloom jan wright rested his elbows on the harbour railings and idly watched the outboard motorboat which served as a ferry between fairbourne and barmouth chugging its way across the estuary leaving a trail of foam in its wake he was in his early twenties and his broad handsome face was already tanned to a deep mahogany after less than a week of exposure to these welsh coast seabreezes penny for your thoughts the attractive redhaired freckledfaced girl dressed in jeans and sweater nudged him in the ribs with her elbow she was roughly the same age as himself and her slim perfectly proportioned figure had already caused many a male holidaymaker to glance in her direction nothing much he smiled back at her i was only thinking how nice it would be to spend another week here instead of going back to london on saturday well she wrinkled her nose i must say i agree with you but i dont think your uncle cliff would he would be the first one to blow his top if we didnt turn up at the laboratory on monday morning dear old uncle cliff ian laughed not so much of the old julie slipped an arm around his waist he may be one of the countrys leading botanists but he isnt forty yet hes very much your mothers younger brother youre right ian sighed cliff is almost like a brother to me and hes hip too to quote a modern phrase he didnt even raise an eyebrow when he discovered that we were going away together for a week have a good dirty week he said as i left on friday night i dont expect youll be good but try and be careful i dont want julie to have to pack up work just yet you wouldnt find many uncles taking that attitude well julie winked we have been careful havent we or at least i hope you have they both laughed and then their attention was diverted by a train crossing the estuary over the viaduct a mile away one more day julie sighed and you still havent taken me to shell island they say the bathing there is superb well go tomorrow ian promised solemnly and began steering his fiancee in the direction of davy joness locker a cavelike caf overlooking the harbour saturday dawned with those same cloudless blue skies and blazing sunshine ian and julie were grateful for the coolness of the open red mg as it glided along the narrow coast roads after about twenty minutes ian slowed down as they approached the small village of llanbedr and noticed a sign off to the left which read mochras thats welsh for shell island he shouted above the roar of the engine and then they were turning off down an even narrower road soon the tarmac gave way to rough shale and they could see the tide already lapping at the edges of the causeway whats that julie pointed to some buildings and grass runways which were cordoned off by extensive barbedwire fencing almost like some concentration camp from the last war war department tan said as he slowed down uncle cliff told me all about it when he heard we were coming here its a pilotless aircraft base see those small planes over there well they fly them by remote control all very hushhush though youd need a wd pass in triplicate to get even as far as the first checkpoint uncle cliff said some lads who were camping on shell island went on an exploration trip one night and ran into the guards they nearly got shot and then had to undergo an extensive interrogation before they were allowed to leave with severe warnings ringing in their ears it sounds awfully creepy julie shuddered in spite of the warm sunshine i hope well be away from here before dark no need to worry about that place ian saw the water across the road ahead of them reduced his speed still more and drove slowly on to shell island itself youll forget that place even exists when you see the real beauty of shell island shell island was a veritable maze of narrow roads with ample parking places everywhere tents were pitched as campers made the most of the unexpected heat wave a signpost stated that the south end lay to the left and the north end to the right ian swung the steeringwheel hard over to the left noting the sign guiding them to the bathing beaches half a mile further on he turned off the road and parked the car on the top of a steep rise which afforded them a view of sanddunes and an extensive golden beach beneath isnt it marvellous julie breathed the welcome stiffening breeze ruffling her auburn hair all these people camping here yet weve almost got the beach to ourselves theyve probably all had their early morning dip and are snoozing it off ian stretched now lets have that picnic and then well see how warm the water really is half an hour later clad in their bathingcostumes they were racing across the beach towards the incoming tide laughing and shouting as they splashed ankledeep through the white foam its really warm julie laughed shall we go for a nice long swim suits me ian glanced down at the front of his bathingcostume julie always made him like that damn her he thought of stripping off showing her what she had seen in the bedroom only last night why the hell shouldnt he there wasnt a soul about all the same somebody might have a pair of fieldglasses and the watcher might be prudish as well as being a busybody and report him he thought of all the publicity uncle cliff he shrugged off the thought and splashed after julie god what a figure she had enough to make any man want her badly really badly julie the water up to the top half of her bikini turned back to him come on she yelled whats keeping you race you round that headland maybe theres a quiet cove there where we can tan never heard the rest of the sentence for with a seductive smile she dived backwards and began kicking out with her legs yes he smiled to himself maybe there is a quiet little cove just around the headland where we can he plunged into a crawl losing sight of his fianc–πe as his head went under water he powered on heading out to sea about a couple of hundred yards and then he would veer left following the coastline maybe even catching up with her julie coles was a strong swimmer too she even matched tan for speed and after ten minutes or so there were still a good fifty yards between them of course she had got a good start on him he increased his efforts clawing the salt water as he strove to narrow the distance ten minutes or so later he paused damn these waves he couldnt see her turn you fool turn he swore inwardly were far enough out to sea still she persevered with a direct course stupid bitch he gasped aloud youll be too far out he closed his eyes and mouth as a wave enveloped him the swell was getting stronger out here now he couldnt see her at all he began to swim desperately overtaking her was no longer a game their very lives might depend upon it occasionally he caught glimpses of her amidst the rising swell at last he breathed a sigh of relief at feast she was turning now even though she had come too far out to sea he decided to strike out diagonally and head her off a faint stirring down in his bathingcostume told him that things were getting back to normal soon they would be lying on the sundrenched golden sand of some desolate cove far from prying eyes where they could strip off and her shrill scream disrupted his daydreaming a wave obscured his view of her christ if she got cramp out here he trod water looking for her suddenly the sea around him was empty there was no sign of julie coles julie he yelled desperately a note of panic starting to creep into his voice julie for the first time in his life he felt completely helpless she was gone how the hell was he to look for her here strangely even this far out the water was comparatively shallow as he trod water he realised that he could just touch the bottom he was above some sort of sandbank then he espied a large ripple between the everincreasing waves heading towards him he blinked and looked again there was no doubt about it it had to be julie what a stupid trick she had screamed to frighten him and now she was trying to sneak upon him underwater he rested his feet on the sandy bottom and laughed almost hysterically well so long as she was all right suddenly he staggered back his own piercing scream muffled by the water as his head went under he fought to free himself from whatever it was that had a hold on his left leg that could only be compared with a pair of garden shears with serrated blades biting deeper into the bone with every second he fell full length on to the seabed already gulping down mouthfuls of the murky sandy water he began to panic kicking out with his free leg there was no escape that much was quite clear to him furthermore he knew that he was going to die he knew too that whatever it was that was attacking him had also claimed julie coles there was a red mist before his eyes no it wasnt a mist he could taste it taste it like that time in his boyhood when hed fallen on the beach and cut his lip if was blood for a second he almost felt that he was free that grip had lessened he made one last desperate effort to surface being wrenched back instantly as his right leg was grasped by his unknown attacker it was as consciousness began to slip from his fearcrazed mind that he realised what had happened to his left leg it had been amputated then he felt his right leg cracking mercifully he lost consciousness cliff davenport was in his laboratory shortly before seven oclock on that monday morning there were certain tasks that had to be attended to before ian and julie arrived at nine certain specimens from sea plants had to be removed from the glass tanks and allowed to dry before the next stage of discovering their nutritional benefits could be started they would be ready for his two assistants to get to grips with as soon as they got back from holiday as he worked the botanist caught a glimpse of his reflection in the water he smiled at least he didnt think that he looked any older those lines in his lean aquiline face marked the passing of his dear wife they could never be erased like his memory of her his receding hairline and the odd flecks of grey in his dark hair were all that denoted his age his lithe figure was as sprightly as ever and the pipe drooping out of the corner of his mouth reminded him of the time when he had portrayed sherlock holmes in a local amateur dramatic societys presentation of the speckled band his task completed he retired to his study there he poured himself a cup of black coffee and relit his pipe he felt vaguely hungry but he knew that julie would automatically prepare him something to eat once she and ian arrived the morning wore on and still there was no sign of ian wright and julie coles cliff became impatient yet he was not unduly worried probably they had lingered over a last night somewhere together and slept late as a result of it by lunchtime however he was becoming increasingly worried no longer were sexual procrastinations uppermost in his mind instead his thoughts dwelt on road accidents ian had always been inclined to drive far too fast in that old heap of an mg of his it was shortly after three oclock in the afternoon that the doorbell rang as cliff davenport saw the two blue uniforms through the frosted glass his stomach muscles tightened the mg professor davenport the thinfaced sergeant had an expression on his face that boded distinct illtidings yes yes cliffs tone could not conceal his anxiety im afraid sir the officer said as he stepped over the threshold without being invited to do so we might have some rather grave news for you might well er the policeman shuffled his feet awkwardly the merioneth force have reason to believe that a red mg sports car registration number mno is the property of mr ian wright your nephew who resides at this address the vehicle in question was found abandoned on shelf island the gentleman in questions clothing was found in it along with those of a lady a search has been made in fact its still going on the coast guards are using helicopters they er they havent found anything yet it appears that your nephew and his lady friend have been washed out to sea whilst bathing cliff davenport sat down on a nearby chair his face was ashen his whole body trembled impossible his dry croak lacked conviction im afraid the sergeant began but stopped as he saw the look in the others eye thank you sergeant cliff was on his feet as though he had instantly shrugged off the sudden shock perhaps you will let me know at once if you find anything the two policemen stepped outside into the bright sunlight both heaved sighs of relief it had been easier than they had anticipated the professor had taken the news admirably inside the house cliff davenport stood with his back to the closed door he knew in his heart that he would never see either ian wright or julie coles again chapter two cliff davenport remained at his west hampstead home for three days he did no work and he ate little he consumed on average an ounce of tobacco a day those lines on his face deepened he was hardened to grief but it was the very fact of not knowing that troubled him if ian and julie were dead then for a short while he would succumb to grief if they were discovered alive then he would rejoice until then he would endure untold mental agony each day he rang the police headquarters at harlech the answer was always the same in the end the inspector there told him that they would telephone him the moment they had any news that meant they were not hopeful of finding the couple alive by saturday morning the telephone had still not rung cliff roused himself from the armchair which had by now been his sleeping place for five nights he knew that he could not endure another night of waiting the restless pacing up and down of the feeling of utter helplessness he went upstairs to his small untidy bedroom and dragged a dusty suitcase from beneath the bed pulling open drawers at random he began throwing items of clothing into it it was scarcely nine oclock when he backed the cortina estate car out of the garage the petrol gauge showed that the tank was full he could be in llanbedr by teatime the prospect of some kind of action was comforting and his spirits soared as he finally left london behind him the hotel in llanbedr was not an hotel as such few holiday makers were aware of its existence and the friendly widowed mrs jones preferred to keep it that way she had her regular guests who returned year after year and that was how she wanted it goodness me she stood aghast as she recognised cliff davenport getting out of his car professor this is a surprise hallo mum the professor greeted her cliff always called mrs jones mum much to her delight im sorry to arrive unannounced like this its urgent though of course if you havent any room i shant grumble itll have to be the atticroom mrs jones was slightly embarrassed ive got a full house and if id known the attic will do fine cliff assured her lifting his suitcase out of the car i dont want to put you to any trouble ill put the kettle on she declared as she went indoors ahead of him now mum cliff sipped his tea thankfully and regarded her with a pair of steelyblue eyes tell me what you know about the missing bathers nothing that the papers havent already reported she busied herself with laying the table if folks will go swimming where theres dangerous currents there arent any dangerous currents of the south end of shell island cliff davenport snapped and they were both firstclass swimmers how dyou know that mrs jones paused it isnt that whats brought you here is it professor it is he replied ian wright was my nephew and the girl was his fianc–πe oh mrs jones sat down suddenly on the nearest chair i didnt know oh im terribly sorry professor you werent to know the professor smiled wanly but its almost a week now since they disappeared and everybody seems to have abandoned the search content just to let the tide wash them up in its own time well im not satisfied that everythings just as it should be i intend to poke around a bit i dont know what it is but ive got a funny feeling that theres more to this than meets the eye i also know in my own mind that theyre both dead grimly he continued drinking his tea sergeant hughes looked up from his desk as the tall man with the receding hairline walked into the police station yes sir he grunted automatically not bothering to rise to his feet what can i do for you if you could find my nephew ian wright and his girl friend i should be delighted professor davenports tone was terse i have been waiting for a call from you and as nothing transpired i thought that i had better come down to llanbedr oh youre professor davenport the sergeant rose to his feet and pulled thoughtfully at his moustache everything that can be done is being done there was no need for you to i prefer to cliff snapped they were both excellent swimmers and there are no dangerous currents to speak of off the south end where their car was parked any bathing is dangerous the sergeant stated adamantly theyre not the first to be drowned on this part of the coast you know and i have a strange feeling that they wont be the last cliff turned on his heel no doubt we shall meet again during the course of my stay here sergeant good day cliff was angry as he walked back towards the village of course it could have been an accident even the most experienced swimmers met with accidents yet he still had that strange feeling at the back of his mind the following morning after breakfast cliff went on to shell island he went on foot feeling it hardly worth the trouble of taking the car from mrs joness place to the south end of the island a journey of possibly two miles it was a bright sunny morning and had it not been for the sense of foreboding which clouded his mind he would have entered into the spirit of a holidaymaker his binoculars slung over his shoulders and carrying a long stick of ash a favourite companion on long hikes he strode along campers barely gave him a passing glance as he crossed the sanddunes and finally reached the long wide rolling beach the tide was well out quickly he scanned the waters edge through his binoculars a flock of oystercatchers gulls nothing not a movement otherwise to his left some children were making sandcastles but he ignored them it was way out there where the answers to his many questions lay and he knew that he wouldnt solve them from the edge of the dunes the sand beneath his feet was firm as he began walking out towards the distant tideline virgin sand untouched since the last tide had ebbed peaceful and yet a few hundred yards further on the surface began to get softer his walking boots squelched beneath his weight yet there was no hint of any quicksands the oystercatchers rose in alarm at his approach the gulls wheeled screaming their insults at him at last the water lapped at his feet there was a huge ridge of sandbank on his right resembling a colossal defensive wall built by an ancient people he glanced behind him at the distant shoreline of shell island surely he muttered they would have swum no further than this suddenly a deafening screaming sound filled the sky becoming louder all the time he ducked instinctively then straightened with a chuckle as the tiny aircraft passed less than fifty feet above him heading back towards shell island damned unmanned aircraft he murmured then his eye caught something in the sand about twenty yards away it was a mark of some kind maybe three feet long and nearly as wide it had been made since the tide had gone out a fresh scuffing of damp sand the birds his eyes widened as he saw another and then he began walking quickly towards them my god he gasped so excited that the words poured out aloud theyre all along the tideline claw marks but what in the name of heaven could have left a print that size its its like a crab only dozens of them and a hundred times as big he dropped to his knees eager to examine the nearest one it had the shape and markings of a crabs claw but the very size of it was beyond comprehension cliff davenport shook his head in bewilderment it was fantastic impossible there had to be an explanation and for a scientist a rational one at that then the water was lapping at his feet again the tide had turned he moved back a few paces and watched as the incoming sea slowly began to cover those weird marks in the sand erasing them forever cliff knew that he had no alternative other than to retreat he had seen these bizarre crazy marks with his own eyes and now they were being removed the evidence was disappearing if only hed brought a camera but nobody would believe him now reluctantly he retreated before the tide two more pilotless aircraft passed over him dipping down towards the island vaguely he wondered if they could have had anything to do with the strange markings in the sand a new type of undercarriage that made landings feasible on soft ground marshes and beaches it was a possibility even if it was an improbability there was only one way to find out he unslung his binoculars and altered his course heading towards that large barbedwire compound for some reason the visitors to the island seemed to keep well clear of the wd compound perhaps they felt that it was not in keeping with the relaxation which they sought or maybe they had an inbuilt fear of military authority cliff davenport was not one of the latter at that moment he cared neither for authority nor the scenic beauty all he knew was that he had to take a closer look at one of those pilotless aircraft paying particular attention to its undercarriage the discovery of some unorthodox landing device would ease his troubled mind somewhat when he was within fifty yards of the nearest barbedwire fence he saw the guard the man was dressed in raf uniform and had his back to the professor cliff noted with a faint tingling of his spine that he carried a rifle he did not doubt that it was loaded and that the sentry would use it at the first threat to security cliff sank down slowly until he was lying fulllength in the long grass as he parted the tufts in front of him and began focusing his binoculars he felt more secure the man could not see him even if he chanced to turn around two of the aircraft he sought were standing motionless on a runway to his left all he had to do was to examine them through the highpowered lenses and then crawl away discreetly he could not help thinking how easy it would be for foreign spies to adopt this same procedure he brought his powerful binoculars to bear on the nearest of the small aircraft already it was shimmering in the midday heat and everything seemed utterly still and peaceful he began to examine the plane it was shaped like a jet and yet was hardly larger than the average glider nevertheless it had a sinister appearance as if it might be playing some secret role in all that had happened recently like some silent mechanical bird of prey disappointment welled up inside him as he studied the undercarriage it was so conventional just two wheels in fact no different from those on a mini if it landed in soft ground it certainly wouldnt take off again he looked at the other plane standing next to it it was exactly the same his spine tingled again if those crablike prints out on the sands had not been made by one of these pilotless crafts then there could only be one answer and that was almost unbelievable dont move the terse command close behind him made him start involuntarily and the binoculars slipped from his grasp he turned his head slightly a blueuniformed man knelt up in the grass less than five yards away from him and in his hand he held something black and shiny which was trained unwaveringly on the professors back there was no mistaking the snub shape of a automatic pistol all right the airmans voice was almost a hiss on your feet slowly dont make any sudden movement just take it easy cliff davenport rose to his feet and then he sensed another uniformed man only a foot or so away he hadnt even heard him move this guy was an expert where stealth was concerned that was why he hadnt even suspected the initial stalking it would be a foolish man indeed who made a sudden bolt for it go on something decidedly menacing prodded cliff in the small of his back walk slowly towards that gate over there dont try anything armed men appeared from all directions as he entered the enclosure they werent taking any chances vaguely cliff wondered how he had been spotted it certainly wasnt by the first guard probably somebody was scanning the area constantly from a concealed vantage point in the distance he could see holidaymakers playing ball pitching tents cooking food totally unaware of the drama which was being enacted only a few hundred yards away from them still he walked on dazed at the suddenness of it all every time he slowed up something hard and menacing bored into his back forcing him to move again now there was a uniformed man on either side of him nobody spoke it was almost as if the arrest of an intruder was an everyday occurrence smooth efficiency merciless they were heading towards a concrete building that stood apart from the main block it was completely square and flatroofed rather like the kind of foreign legion detention blocks which one sees in the movies cliff had visions of men sweating within as the sun climbed higher and the temperature inside rose to intolerable heights a man came from behind and unlocked the door it swung back on welloiled hinges for a second everybody paused in the doorway cliff noted the interior with some misgiving four walls a ceiling and a floor all drab grey concrete not even a window a sudden push sent him sprawling inside he fell headlong and then as he picked himself up darkness closed in on him the door swung shut and that same lock clicked hack into place boyhood dreams of the foreign legion suddenly started to become reality chapter three cliff davenport sat with his back to the wall in total darkness his surroundings had a claustrophobic effect on his mind he couldnt think clearly maybe it was all a dream secret aircraft bases giant crabs he stretched out a hand and ran his fingers along the concrete no the walls werent padded that discovery was a relief in some respects it meant too that all this was horribly real time dragged the face of his watch was not luminous so he had no means of knowing what time of day it was the useless watch merely emitted a continuous ticking that after a time began to have the same effect upon him as the infamous chinese watertorture he wanted to scream call them all kinds of bastards under the sun instead he just remained silent waiting for what he knew not all the time he could hear the regular footsteps of a patrolling sentry they were taking no chances he thought of attracting the guards attention telling him who he was and why he had approached the base but he knew it would do no good eventually he lost track of time and just sat staring into the darkness it was hot and stuffy at last there were more footsteps and the key turned in the lock again the door was flung wide open and cliff davenport was momentarily blinded by the sudden sunlight he threw up his hands to cover his eyes yet managed to notice the five men who stood in the doorway they all carried automatics step this way please a tall man with a clipped moustache seemed to be in command his voice was authoritative and the other four evidently would act on such orders as he might give cliff struggled to his feet blinking and still unable to focus properly a uniformed man moved to his side both helping and pushing him at the same time the cramped position in which he had been for some immeasurable time had numbed davenports leg and now the pins and needles were agonising he stumbled almost fell and then two of his captors seized him and dragged him across the compound another squat building only slightly more civilised in appearance stood less than thirty yards away from where he had been imprisoned at least it had windows one of the guards opened the door two more hustled him inside the interior was neatly but sparsely furnished coconut matting lay on the floor filing cabinets were ranged around the walls and a large mahogany desk dominated the centre cliff davenport gazed at the man who sat behind it he was wellbuilt totally bald and his cleanshaven face reminded the botanist of the typical gestapo chief portrayed in films and books of world war ii hard ruthless fishlike eyes that totally concealed his innermost thoughts above all he wore no uniform his lightgrey wellworn suit made his appearance all the more sinister somebody shut the door who are you the man behind the desk had a flat expressionless voice my name is professor clifford davenport cliff drew himself up to his full height his indignation beginning to return now thai he was no longer imprisoned in a darkened cell i live in west hampstead and i am staying with mrs jones of llanbedr you were displaying interest in our aircraft his interrogator stated holding up the pair of binoculars which had been confiscated on his capture i want to know why you were so interested in them cliff paused just in time he checked the reply that was on the top of his tongue hell he couldnt start raving on about giant crabs just what was he to say there were two courses open to him he could either condemn himself as a spy or else commit himself to an asylum he drew a deep breath everybody was watching him intently hesitation would be interpreted at guilt he expelled a long sigh well you know the two bathers who went missing last sunday which two bathers god didnt they read the papers or were they just inhuman a young man and his fianc–πe their car was found on the south end of the island was it of course it bloody well was he felt his temper rising but knew that he must keep a tight rein on it he fought back an angry retort and tried to appear more relaxed yes he said even essaying a smile it was the police and the coastguards have been searching since then but they havent found the bodies how does that relate to the fact that you were examining our aircraft through binoculars there was neither emotion nor sympathy in his interrogators voice or expression it doesnt except that that cliff fought for a plausible explanation i had been out on the sands looking for signs of the missing bathers all morning and i wondered if well if any of your planes might be utilised in the search somebody behind him was trying hard not to snigger you were observed to be studying the planes in question for quite some considerable time i was tired that was certainly the truth i had been walking for miles all morning i was glad of the opportunity to rest and as a boy i was fanatically interested in aircraft there has been a terrible mistake and i can only offer my profuse apologies the man in the grey suit stroked his chin showing neither belief nor disbelief i shall need proof of your identity he remarked at last sergeant hughes of your local force knows me cliff replied failing that i must refer you to sir ronald bradley of whitehall who is a personal friend of mine i take it you have heard of him the professor felt a sudden surge of hope as surprise registered for a brief second on that deadpan face a brief flicker and it was gone then a decisive move the receiver of the telephone on the desk was lifted and a long slender forefinger began to dial a brief pause the ringing of the phone on the other end of the line could be heard brr brr brr on and on it went nobody seemed to be in a hurry nobody moved at fast there was a distant crackling and a voice was speaking the words were inaudible sir ronald there was now even a note of respect in the grimfaced mans tone a relaxing of tension myerscough here sir shell island do you know a professor davenport sir silence again except for a jumble of distant conversation myerscough listened intently a frown appeared on his face one of disappointment yes yes sir ronald he was almost humble now your description fits him perfectly no no sir ill take your word for it there appears to have been some mistake yes yes of course sir im sorry to have troubled you he replaced the receiver and shook his head slowly then he smiled it was merely a movement of facial muscles there was no humour in his expression there appears to have been some mistake professor davenport he said you are free to go you may take your binoculars also please though for your own sake do not go examining our aircraft again cliff davenport walked back to the hotel in llanbedr shortly before six oclock he felt physically and mentally fatigued above all he had gained nothing he was even inclined to believe that he had imagined those claw prints along the tide line maybe a band of foraging gulls had disturbed the sand after all the small dining room was full when he came down to dinner ah professor said mrs jones as she suddenly emerged from the kitchen there you are i was getting worried about you when you didnt come in to lunch i had a lot of ground to cover he shook his head sadly im afraid were a bit pushed for room mrs jones leaned close so that she would not be heard by the other guests i know you wont mind sharing a table theres a mrs benson over there in the corner her husband left her last year a real rotter he was too im sure youll like her tm sure i will cliff replied his eyes were already on the darkhaired petite girl who sipped tomato juice a wistful expression on her face she was wearing a cotton blouse above a tartan skirt and he saw the outline of her small arm breasts it wasnt often these days he noticed such things he put her age at about twentyfive hallo professor she greeted him smiling up at him as he paused nervously at the table ive been hearing all about you from mrs jones please sit down my names pat within a matter of minutes the tension had ebbed from him he felt relaxed he wanted to talk to someone and she was the perfect listener sympathetic and interested he hadnt meant to tell a soul about his experiences inside that compound he felt that they were humiliating but he told her just the same my god she exclaimed her eyes twinkling its getting like a police state if they dont want folks looking at their aircraft why the hell dont they keep them out of sight i mean anybody might focus a pair of binoculars on one of those planes of course it could have been a decoy he pointed out although the thought had only just occurred to him maybe they were expecting someone in particular to show an interest in it and i just happened along and blundered right into the trap then he told her about ian and julie oh how terrible she paused a biscuit spread with cheese halfway to her mouth ive been bathing off the south end myself only this afternoon a frown creased her brow as she recalled her afternoon spent on those golden sands with the deep blue sea creeping relentlessly back towards the shore there there was something i noticed she murmured something very strange it might be nothing but go on he urged well she continued wrinkling her nose as a kid ive often sat and watched crabs crawling across the beach i know the sort of tracks they make in wet sand the imprints of their pincers well out there today i saw some marks they looked like crabs only well the size of them if they had been crabs then theyd have to have been the size of i dont know sheep my god cliff davenport blanched and his knuckles became bloodless as he gripped the edge of the table so i was right after all i didnt dream it my god what sort of creatures are they youve seen the marks too her jaw dropped in amazement this morning he replied and another thing theres a full moon at present now the moon affects the movements of crabs just as it has a pull on the tides it was as though a herd of them had been crawling along the tide line but it cant be no such creatures could exist you should know better than i do professor she smiled but nobody has really explored the bed of the ocean properly there could be a submarine life around these very islands which mankind has never dreamt of there must be thousands of caves capable of hiding creatures as big as battleships after all theyre still not certain about the loch ness monster youre right he muttered yet its so incredible ive been amazed at some of my discoveries regarding plant life i have to be sure though a few marks in the sand isnt proof id be ridiculed suddenly her hand rested on his as though such contact was the most natural thing in the world he noticed subconsciously the mark where she had once worn a ring on the third finger of her left hand i wont ridicule you cliff she smiled and he felt a stirring within himself that he had almost forgotten existed suppose we team up do some investigating ive nothing else to do i came here to try and forget start life all over again ill help you to search for ian and julie too he felt his eyes misting over thank you he glanced away automatically so that she would not see his emotions his weaknesses id be glad of that suppose we bathe together tomorrow no no wed better keep clear of the water its too dangerous until we know we must explore the beach and look for more signs fine she squeezed his hand and rose to her feet see you at breakfast in the morning then both cliff davenport and pat benson rose late the following morning most of the other guests had already breakfasted and departed by the time they sat down and made a start on their respective melons suddenly the headline of a newspaper lying on an adjacent table caught the professors eye bathers missing off welsh coast he snatched up the paper with trembling hands almost knowing what he was about to read following the disappearance of two swimmers off shell island last weekend further people have been reported missing at borth fairbourne and barmouth late yesterday afternoon extensive searches are still going on but none of the five people have been recovered experts believe that dangerous currents have appeared in these waters and have claimed unwary swimmers my god cliff exclaimed take a look at this he said passing the newspaper across to pat benson its already begun the crabs are attacking chapter four by tenthirty cliff davenport and pat benson were walking out towards the distant shimmering sea her hand rested in his they spoke little to an outside observer they were just another couple going for a bathe several times they saw the coastguard helicopters the search for the missing bathers was still going on i cant understand it pat remarked this has always been one of the best coasts to bathe from a few dangerous currents but if you know where they are youre all right then suddenly therere all these horrific claw prints appearing plus people disappearing right left and centre its only just starting cliff observed and shook his head something a freak of nature maybe but whatever it is this is only the beginning how long are you staying here it seemed as though there were a note of anxiety in her voice almost as if his answer would be of great importance to her i dont know he watched her carefully as he spoke it depends on what i find out whether there is anything in my hunch well i suppose i could be staying for some time how about you im booked in for a fortnight she replied i only came yesterday morning like you though it depends on what i find out now ive got no ties nothing to go back home for on top of all that ive got a streak of the nosyparker in me so he observed grinning and slipping an arm around her were both dedicated to the cause then eventually they reached the sea the tide had not yet turned and the last fifty yards or so were a mass of sticky wet mud that was just beginning to dry out in the sun look pat benson was the first to spot the marks in the sand away to the left giving the smooth surface the appearance of a plot of land somebody had tried to plough up with a mechanical cultivator before giving it up as a bad job cliff nodded her grip tightened on his hand as they changed direction and began to walk towards the object of their search christ cliff davenports lips were bloodless and his face was grim as they stood and looked down at the marks in the sand pat benson felt an urge to back away to run as fast as she could back to the mainland before something more horrific than mankind had ever witnessed emerged from the incoming tide but she stayed maybe it was only because she was with cliff davenport but she stayed all the same just just look at the size of them she gasped she felt herself trembling and hoped that the man at her side would not notice its crabs all right the professor stated stooping and probing with his fingers in the muddy tracks look heres a fragment of shell and another judging by the way theyve churned up this stretch of beach there mustve been a hundred or so of em you can see for yourself how right you were they must be as big as sheep but but pats voice trembled why hasnt anybody seen them for two reasons i should say cliff paused and slowly filled his pipe packing the tobacco down tightly in the bowl and then proceeding to light it firstly as ive already mentioned theyve only just appeared on this part of the coast secondly they move and feed at night particularly when theres a full moon but cant we advise the authorities pat spread her hands in despair the army for instance cliff davenport laughed but there was no mirth in his laughter you can just imagine the sort of reaction wed get he chided puffing out thick clouds of smoke theyre more concerned about the fact that i took a peep at one of their pilotless aircraft through my binoculars than some tomfool tale that i thought there were giant crabs in the area thought pat snapped theres no thought about it its a certainty we need proof he replied positive proof that will convince them and im going to get it how i shall come back here tonight he said after the moon has risen i shall be prepared for a long vigil it may be futile probably it will be the crabs may not show up here again for weeks once ive seen them with my own eyes ill be prepared to try and convince somebody and maybe get some action of some sort before more lives are needlessly lost we could watch from those dunes over there pat pointed back towards shell island wed be sheltered and we could see without being seen we im coming with you make no mistake about that now look here said cliff sternly grasping her by the shoulders this is no job for a woman these creatures have claimed several uves already theyre deadly dangerous the risks im coming she looked him straight in the face and dont you try to stop me cliff davenport were in this together you werent the only one to discover those marks all right he sighed i suppose i cant stop you coming along but youll have to do as i say were just going to look nothing more she nodded fair enough she said thats fine by me hey somebodys coming cliff wheeled round about two hundred yards away a man was following the tideline heading towards them he had a loping shambling gait and his body seemed to be twisted from the waist downwards as though he was deformed he was clad in a torn crimson shirt the tails flapping in the sea breeze ragged denim trousers and his feet were bare with his long matted hair and unkempt beard he reminded them of robinson crusoe as he came closer they could see his features plainly his eyes were large and staring his nose little more than two nostrils situated above thin lips which were unable to hide the battered stumps of decayed and broken teeth every so often he paused to pick up a piece of driftwood a beachcomber cliff commented what a strange fellow the man was wheezing and grunting as he kept up a fast pace glancing in their direction with glassy staring eyes but not acknowledging then presence he passed them striding through the maze of crab tracks but seemingly totally unaware of the fact they stood and watched him until about a quarter of a mile further on he turned shore wards wed better be getting back pat observed she shivered in spite of the heat of the day yes theres not much to be gained by staying here her companion slipped an arm around her slim waist and together they walked slowly back towards the sand dunes the soft sand of the dunes was warm to then feet they were sheltered from the breeze and some of the hollows offered shade in fact it was an ideal place to sit down and rest their original plan had been to return straight away to mrs joness for lunch yet somehow there was a temptation to remain in the solitude of the dunes they sat down for a time they said nothing each busy with then own thoughts cliffs arm remained about her and his senses responded to her closeness it was a long time since a woman had excited him there was a stirring in his loins and his heart was beating faster than it usually did suddenly he wanted to kiss her to crush his lips against hers to feel her body pressed against his own her breasts on his chest he turned his head to look at her trying to pluck up courage his mouth dry his pulse racing as he moved her face came up towards his was it his imagination or were those full red lips a smile hovering upon them parted in anticipation of his next move impulsively he bent and kissed her their lips met and lingered her arms came up and encircled his neck holding him close her body was shuddering with emotion and he could feel her fingernails digging deep into his back at last they parted her face was flushed their gaze met and for some moments they just sat and looked at each other do do you ever get lonely she sighed burying her head in his chest yes cliff admitted but i have learnt to overcome it i just work and work and work i love my work its the only thing thats kept me going without it i should have died long ago but youre still lonely she muttered as she stroked the nape of his neck t know believe me i know sometimes it has been too awful for words but i knew that someday i would meet somebody else at her words he felt his spirits soaring a new life dawning for him conceived here in the sanddunes of shell island i i words failed him she kissed him again this time his long slim fingers stroked her body through her clothing lingering on those delightful breasts yet fearing to progress further his loins were fully charged with emotion and he would dearly have loved to have taken her but wed better be getting back to lunch he stated firmly and helped her to her feet fearful lest his impulses would lead him to actions that might spoil everything that had gone before their arms entwined around each other they set off on the long walk back to llanbedr yet their minds were not easy both of them remembered those tracks in the sand and they could not help wondering what horrors lay beneath the surface of that stretch of scintillating blue sea enjoyed your morning on the beach have you mrs jones smiled as she served up two plates of fresh crab and salad cliff davenport smiled wryly obviously they were not going to be allowed to forget what they had seen that morning as if that were possible we met a strange fellow out on the sand he remarked partly for politeness sake and partly because he was curious a beachcomber oh mrs jones shook her head a look of disapproval on her kindly face thatd be bartholomew bartholomew cliff had no intention of leaving it at that bartholomew who just bartholomew the landlady paused almost as if she had no wish to discuss the matter any further and was regretting having entered into the conversation in the first place hes been around for three years now never bothers nobody spends his life on the beaches all along this coast lives in caves i suppose does a few odd jobs around the harbour at barmouth from time to tune so they tell me he er isnt exactly given to conversation cliff went on oh um and she blushed as though bartholomew was a personal embarrassment to her he cant hes deaf and dumb simple in the head too but he never bothers anybody so nobody can do anything about him not that they want to anyway with that she swept on to the next table and began collecting dirty crockery bartholomew eh cliff reiterated when she was out of earshot everything about this business gets creepier and creepier i wish youd stay behind tonight pat and let me go it alone well i wont she spoke adamantly as she tackled her food wrinkling her nose and then pushing the crab to one side and concentrating on the salad ugh she shuddered crabs give me the shudders ill never eat one again tm only going on reconnaissance cliff went on just to have a look im not going to do anything all the more reason for me to come pat interjected furthermore cliff davenport if you dont let me come with you ill go alone all right he conceded well go together but wed better get some rest this afternoon it could be a very long night particularly if nothing shows up it was after eleven oclock when they left mrs joness private hotel the night was warm and the moon was just beginning to come up over the mountains casting its silvery glow across the whole countryside cliff davenport had a sports jacket over his opennecked shirt and was wearing flannels and pumps pat benson wore a polonecked sweater and jeans they did not take the car preferring the lengthy walk to shell island through the moonlit countryside what a beautiful night pat remarked as they passed alongside the barbedwire fence which enclosed war department property if only we didnt have to worry about giant crabs cliff pulled her closer and kissed her maybe we wont have to he said with more conviction than he felt probably itll turn out to be a white elephant after all and the marks in the sand were made by bartholomew searching for mussels pat laughed but she felt uneasy bartholomew certainly hadnt made those prints in the sand as they crossed the island they could see oil lamps burning in most of the tents as the campers prepared to turn in for the night transistor radios were playing somebody started to sing a dog barked they moved on making a detour to avoid the tents and eventually arrived at the top of the sanddunes rabbits scuttled away in the long grass then they paused to take pleasure in the sheer beauty of the scene which lay before them less than three hundred yards away the silver sea was claiming the wide empty stretch of sand each breaker bringing it nearer and nearer to the line of heaped seaweed and washedup debris that was its boundary except in times of high tides there was not a soul in sight at that moment they felt that they might have been the last two people remaining upon earth gradually the sound of radios and singing died away in the distance shell island slept any time now the crabs would walk chapter they settled down in a hollow similar to that in which they had made known their feelings towards each other that morning indeed it might even have been the same one cliff glanced at his watch he could see the dial plainly in the bright moonlight it was just halfpast twelve he turned to pat well be all right here he said its nice and sheltered and weve a good view of the whole beach if anything moves we cant fail to spot it her reply was two warm lips seeking his and groping hands that were far more daring than they had been earlier on that day he felt his manhood stiffening under her touch god he hadnt come all this way just to do that they could have stopped at llanbedr and been comfortable in bed all the same he was aroused now and no man could have withstood such an advance they rolled back into the grass lying side by side facing each other i havent done this for a long time pat breathed feeling at his hardness through his trousers his hands came from behind her and travelled slowly up the inside of her sweater until they reached the clasp of her bra unfastening it with an expertise he had almost forgotten and then feeling the tenderness of her swelling nipples she moaned softly with delight then lay back with her eyes closed her fingers were active though cliff felt that thrilling sensation of his zip being pulled down her fingers groping inside the open vent and then the coolness of the night air on his warm moistness he gasped with pleasure pat benson certainly knew what she was doing their lips met again tongues probing and entwining both of them were experiencing the awakening of something which had lain dormant in them for so long rapidly they were getting out of control nothing else mattered not even the giant crabs cliff withdrew his left hand from the warmth of pats sweater and felt for the fastener on her jeans then he pulled her zip down and she lifted herself up slightly off the ground so that he could unclothe her the whiteness of her thighs was in itself seductive in the soft moonlight the darker triangle of soft fluffy hair between them seeming to withhold secrets from him secrets of men who had lain there men who had been sexually satisfied beyond their wildest dreams and of one man who had walked away in preference for another woman cliff rolled in between her open legs she still had a grip on his hardness and now she was guiding it down where she wanted it bathing it first in her warm river of desire and then sliding it down further until it disappeared inch by inch into her after that nothing else mattered their bodies bucked and heaved as they murmured sweet nothings in each others ear before finally convulsing in a violent eruption that left them quivering and still yearning for each other reluctantly they parted and adjusted their clothing pat her hair awry and her cheeks flushed looked more beautiful to cliff than ever before im more than glad i let you come with me tonight he whispered as he zipped himself up again tm afraid though that we must still keep an eye open for those crabs he scrambled to the top of the hollow and gazed out along the shore the sea was much nearer now a hundred yards maybe less the soft swish of the incoming tide was sweet in his ears somewhere a curlew uttered its solitary unmistakable call a call so fitting to the loneliness of the vast expanse of open sea which lay in front of them then he saw a movement it was a long way off back along the disappearing sands towards the north end at first he thought that it might have been a shadow cast by the moon as the fluffy white cirrus cloud floated by he saw it again it shambled stopped a minute passed two then it moved again something on all fours that was following the line of the incoming tide rearing upright dropping down again my god he hissed what is it pat benson was at his side her arms around his waist her chin on his shoulder what can you see cliff over there he pointed watch carefully itll move again in a second its behind that pile of seaweed there it goes she followed his pointing finger in the moonlight it was difficult to discern a definite shape it just shambled along pausing every few seconds heading towards them it its and relief and surprise were in her strangled gasp a man youre right cliff stared at the awkwardly moving shape in front of them its its bartholomew she breathed the beachcomber they watched fascinated as the grotesque form of the man whom they had met earlier in the day grovelled amidst the heapedup stinking seaweed he came closer and closer until they could see his features plainly those wide staring eyes darting eagerly about him as he searched amongst the debris remaining from the last tide all the time he grunted unintelligibly like some snuffling beast of prey on a fresh scent cliff pulled pat down low into the long grass he could not explain his feelings but he did not want bartholomew to spot them shivers ran freely up and down his spine mrs jones had said that the man was harmless yet he warranted she had never seen an expression like that on his face cliff suddenly felt himself wishing that he had brought along his old service revolver he had never been afraid of any man in his life but he prayed now that bartholomew would not spot them the beachcomber glanced in their direction but gave no sign that he was aware of their presence he drew level with them and passed on sometimes he travelled on all fours but for the most part he resorted to that now familiar shamble dragging one leg behind him look pats whispered cry brought cliffs head round again she was pointing back in the direction from which bartholomew had come her next exclamation gurgled in her throat her hand covered her mouth her eyes wide with sheer terror then cliff davenport saw them they were emerging from the edge of the tide like a host of behemoths rising up from the mighty deep the giant crabs had arrived they were no more than fifty yards away their pincers waving in the air as though they were beckoning colleagues still hidden by the sea to follow them cliff began to count he reached forty but more were still appearing their shells were a deep sandy colour glinting in the moonlight then the watchers saw the faces of the creatures with a cry pat benson clasped her hands to her face she had never thought of them as such to her crabs had always been scuttling shells with legs but the expressions on these faces were almost human evil deepset eyes glowed missing nothing they remained stationary as if awaiting some command not even a pincer moving now big as sheep cliff davenport laughed hysterically theyre as big as bloody cows oh my god pat clung to him theyre real they actually exist quiet he commanded holding her close to him not a sound they watched more and more crabs slunk out of the sea they grouped together each one remaining motionless as soon as it was on dry land whats going on cliff whispered its bizarre its as though theyre waiting for something the crabs remained motionless there cliff had spotted another movement amongst the waves somethings oh my god just look at that one i dont i cant believe it pat benson was close to hysteria its just not possible its a nightmare oh cliff please tell me please it isnt all real its real enough he said grimly i wish to god it wasnt though just look at the size of that fellow king crab nobody could have doubted the latest arrivals right to rule half as big again as the rest of those nightmarish creatures this one was the very personification of evil it waddled slowly to the front of the others its pincers waving menacingly as though defying any one of them to challenge its authority some of them moved back huddling together theyre even theyre frightened of it cliff exclaimed its got the whole lot of them just where it wants them the horrific leaders eyes the size of saucers glinted in the bright moonlight by some means it was communicating with the others giving orders then it shuffled forwards turning round two or three times scuffling the sand with its claws it faced them again one pincer circling waving they began to move forward forming into columns and groups somethings up cliff muttered its as though its scented something the professors mind was uneasy he glanced back at the uneven ground which lay between them and the main island the causeway and safety the sand was soft and deep it would impede a mans progress he wondered how fast the giant crabs would be able to move over such terrain whether he and pat would be able to outdistance them pat whispered urgently you dont think theyve scented us i dont know he replied i wouldnt have thought so but get ready to run hold on to me the giant crabs were on the move advancing in a distinct military formation they made some sort of clicking noise as they moved they were covering the ground fairly quickly but cliff davenport had a nagging feeling that they were moving at only halfspeed on and on they came he gripped pats clammy hand tightly the crabs were almost level with them now moving parallel to them and following a course that would take them to the south end tip of the island he braced himself at the very first sign that king crab was ordering his troops to move inshore cliff would haul pat to her feet and run as he had never run before mentally he cursed himself for having brought her in the first place but he knew in his heart that nothing would have made her remain behind at llanbedr the monster crab was barely twenty yards in front of them suddenly it paused cliffs muscles tensed and he was on the point of starting a mad dash for safety when the huge creature increased its pace again that fearful clicketyclick sound echoing across the dunes they havent spotted us cliff breathed a sigh of relief as the waddling army continued on its parallel course theyre on to something though look theyre almost running it was true the horrific creatures had broken into a fast shamble moving with a precision that spoke of a definite purpose this was no casual foray on land cliff and pat found themselves unable to take their eyes off the monstrous leader its waving pincer directed every movement of the other crabs they obeyed it instantly veering to left or right speeding up or slowing down something else moved on that moonlit beach some distance ahead of the crabs something that shambled and lurched with an ungainliness similar to their own christ cliff davenport adopted a kneeling posture a look of fear and helplessness on his lean face thats what theyre after bartholomew he hasnt seen them either it was true bartholomew dragging one leg behind him pausing every few yards to search amongst piles of seaweed was barely twenty yards ahead of the advancing crabs oh my god no pat benson clung to cliff cant we do something at least warn him he shook his head slowly no he breathed theres nothing whatever we can do hes deaf he cant hear he hasnt even seen them theyre almost on him oh my god the absence of bartholomews scream was the most horrific factor of all cliff and pat had an unrestricted view of everything that happened one moment the man was beachcombing the next a mighty pincer had caught him by his game leg king crab was claiming him for his own the crack of splintering bone was audible above the clattering of the excited crabs for one split second bartholomew was free cliff and pat saw him roll over away from his attacker his one leg a bloody stump from which scarlet fluid pumped glowing like best vintage claret in the moonlight they had a full view of his face as he saw the crabs for the first time the large eyes widened and the malformed mouth formed silent curses perhaps pleas maybe even prayers he clutched at the place his leg had been and his fingers came away scarlet king crab moved in again on his helpless victim the rest of the crabs just stood back in complete silence they made no move towards the dismembered man obviously such a prize was royal property with amazing speed that razorsharp pincer caught the other leg amputating it with even greater ease two bloody stumps an arm made a token resistance another snap then another a helpless pitiful trunk of humanity squirmed on the bloodsoaked sand eyes that pleaded for death king crab was in no hurry he picked up a leg held it aloft seemed fascinated by the dripping blood and then with a move that was almost too fast for the eye to follow the limb sailed through the air into the midst of the clustered crabs excited clicking a sudden rush they began quarrelling over the tasty morsel they need not have worried another leg and two arms fell amongst them the clicking was like rapid machinegun fire the monster crab ignored them he had what he wanted bartholomews life was ebbing from him fast but unconsciousness still cruelly eluded him the bloody pincer gouged downwards and then upwards entrails dangling from it before they disappeared between the cavernous jaws again and again only when all the flesh had gone was the crunching of bone audible to the watching humans the giant crabs did not believe in waste chapter suddenly the clicking and crunching of bone ceased the silence was even more terrible than had been the sounds of carnage the crabs just squatted on the sand as though paying homage to their king his eyes were on them his countenance evilly bloated of bartholomew there was no sign not even a splinter of bone remained on the silver sand there was a large dark patch but even this was fast disappearing as the tide stretched over it as though thirsting for the last remains of the beachcomber how how awful the words came in a tortured gasp from pat she felt as though she was about to faint she was glad of cliff davenports comforting arm together they vomited into the spiky grass of the sanddunes all the time fearful that the sound of their spewing would be heard by the nightmare army of horrors from the deep what are they doing she whispered at length peering over the top of the dunes nothing cliff replied at the moment anyway maybe theyre satisfied now that theyve feasted or perhaps theyll search for more hadnt we better go while we can she urged he nodded he knew it was the logical thing to do yet somehow it was like being hypnotised he just had to stay and watch the clicking began again slower this time king crabs claw was in the air circling slowing down like some pointer of doom seeking another victim instinctively cliff ducked pulling pat down with him the pincer came round faltered as it centred on the place where they lay hidden and then passed on the two humans sighed with relief they had not been singled out as crabfood the monstrous creatures claw came to a halt pointing out to sea immediately the clicking began again a mass of shambling shuffling shells was on the move quickly the incoming tide covered them as they headed back to the deep except king crab only he remained behind after the rest had gone almost as though he was reluctant to leave dry land perhaps gloatingly surveying it as a possible future addition to his watery domain at last he too slid into the water almost gracefully and disappeared from sight the waves lapped over the spot where he had stood well cliff stood up helping pat to her feet also theyve gone it was ghastly revolting horrible she was trembling violently oh cliff whats it all mean have they gone for good do you think there was false hope in the last question theyll be back he said grimly and began leading her across the sanddunes picking his way with ease the full moon was directly above them and they could see every detail of the landscape clearly tents flapped gently in the breeze as their occupants slept totally unaware of what had gone on so very close to them theyll be back cliff davenport repeated nothings so goddam certain theyve discovered a taste for human flesh and bone and they wont let up now so far its only been unlucky people who have perished like bartholomew and ian and julie its only the beginning did you see the size and strength of them imagine what they could do if they ventured inland in force that big fellow wasnt just any other crab he knew what he was doing he can think hes capable of organising them into a welldrilled army oh god she gulped it it doesnt bear thinking about we cant just ignore what weve seen cliff weve got to do something do you hear me weve got to do something anything there was a wildness in her voice he tried to calm her rising hysteria as they came in sight of llanbedr the village had an eerie appearance seeming to proclaim that it knew as though it had known all along and was just waiting yes he nodded im fully aware of my responsibilities what weve seen tonight is one of the most terrible sights ever witnessed by human beings we still have no proof but that doesnt matter im going to do my damnedest to convince the authorities that these creatures actually exist how first we must rest he paused in the doorway of their hotel then first thing in the morning i shall make a phone call to london the ministry of defence ive already called on a friend of mine to get me out of a scrape recently he would help me again but im afraid he just isnt high enough i must go right to the top i shall be ridiculed to begin with but i must insist and insist and insist i we she reminded him thank you pat he squeezed her hand we shall be ridiculed we have no actual proof except the evidence of what our own eyes have seen tonight perhaps we shall manage to convince them in the end if not he smiled wryly then we shall at least have clear consciences when when he left the sentence unfinished youd better come to my room he whispered as they tiptoed upstairs id prefer you not to sleep on your own after what you have seen tonight they stripped off and squeezed into the single bed suddenly they realised just how exhausted they were physically and mentally even the feel of their naked bodies against each other did not fully arouse their desires within minutes they had fallen into an uneasy sleep cliff davenport was downstairs fully dressed and shaved before mrs jones had begun cooking the breakfast goodness me professor she looked startled as he poked his head round the kitchen door youre up early you id like to use your phone mum his smile could not hide the gravity in his eyes why yes of course carry on is anything the matter professor she asked urgent business mum he replied a call to london the phones through there she added as she began cracking some eggs help yourself the tall greyhaired man had barely entered his office when the telephone rang he tutted in annoyance marjorie should have known better than to have put the call through she knew that he didnt like to be disturbed before ten oclock at the earliest grisedale he snapped as he lifted the receiver im terribly sorry to trouble you sir his secretarys voice answered him but theres a gentleman on the line who simply will not be put off he says he must speak to you at once on a matter of national urgency does he by jove grisedales jaw tightened a crank no doubt he gave his name as professor davenport she went on hes ringing from somewhere in wales and he said youd know his name put him through grisedale barked a puzzled expression replacing the one of irritation clifford he boomed the moment they were connected what the devils the meaning of phoning me at this hour you what oh well i suppose ill have to listen then go ahead ill try not to laugh for fully ten minutes grisedale listened to what cliff davenport had to say he ummed and aahed and clicked his tongue but he did not laugh a worried frown appeared on his face as one handed he fished a cigarette out of his case and lit it christ he exclaimed at last if it was anybody else but you cliff id have them certified and put away for spreading rumours liable to cause panic among the public i believe you though but whether anybody else will is a different matter yes yes i know im number one up here but im still only a servant of the government everything has to go before a bunch of born sceptics yes yes of course i realise the urgency of it hold on a moment he paused reached a diary out of his desk and began flipping through the pages im flying to belgium tomorrow top level talks ill send colonel goode down no no its the best i can do the only thing i can do in fact you wont like him hes a sarcastic sod i hate his guts but if theres anything in what you say hes the man to deal with it hell have half the troops stationed in this country down there by this time tomorrow all right then ring me when i get back on friday if anything further crops up best of luck old boy grisedale replaced the receiver and lit another cigarette i hope hes not going off his rocker he muttered he dialled a number on the internal telephone it was late afternoon when colonel goode arrived in llanbedr he was a short thickset man a heavy moustache adorning his upper lip and his ruddy complexion had not been caused by the sun whisky was his only love in life and it was the uppermost thought in his mind as he got out of his car colonel goode i presume he looked up to see cliff davenport coming down the steps hand outstretched and a smile on his face so this is the bloody nutcase in person the man from the ministry of defence decided old grizzly seems to think hes sane too i could do with a drink goode wiped his brow whisky im parched im afraid this place isnt licensed cliff was taking an instant dislike to this pompous individual theres a place not licensed colonel goode interrupted what have i come to when i heard your story from commander grisedale i thought maybe they had whisky on the house down here cliff davenport clenched his fists and fought to control his temper how could he possibly hope to convince a man like this that there was a race of monster crabs lurking somewhere along this coast well im going into the village to get a drink the colonel turned back to his car and lifted out a small overnight case take this up to my room ill see you later the professor stood and watched as goode drove off in the direction of the village he heard pat benson come up behind him and then her arm slipped through his i might as well not have bothered he murmured still we shall have to try and convince him just the same colonel goode had obviously found his whisky that was evident to both pat benson and cliff davenport as the man from the ministry lowered himself into an armchair in the lounge all the other guests had retired for the night and mrs jones sensing that something important was afoot had made sure that they were left in peace the colonel hiccupped and his eyelids drooped now he said whats all this nonsense about firstly colonel cliff began as he seated himself on the edge of the table it isnt nonsense both mrs benson and i have seen these crabs last night we watched them catch and devour a local beachcomber by the name of bartholomew the whisky goode laughed unpleasantly thats what whisky does for you does it for me too ive seen those crabs on plenty of occasions especially when ive been eating them dont let it worry you they wont hurt you theyre always gone by morning colonel cliff brought his fist down on the table i am not joking human life is at stake it might even stretch further than that oh rubbish goode waved a hand in the air and his eyelids began to droop again all rubbish bloody rubbish i didnt like to tell old grizzly so after all you dont get an expenses paid trip to the coast every day gotta get back tomorrow though gotta be up early and on the road must turn in now colonel cliff banged the table again in an attempt to keep the other awake we want you to come with us tonight across to shell island we want to show you these creatures then perhaps youll believe us im going to bed colonel goode rose unsteadily to his feet if you want to go and sit on the beach dont let me stop you he staggered to the door and held on to it as he turned back to look at them order me an early breakfast gotta be on the road early cliff and pat sat in silence and listened to his footsteps as he went up to his room well thats that then cliff hung his head and thrust his hands deep down into his pockets so much for our attempt to warn the authorities now well just have to wait and see what happens next colonel goode as it transpired sat down to a late breakfast blearyeyed he gazed venomously at his two companions who had already progressed as far as the toast and marmalade weve just been listening to the news the professor leaned across the table two more swimmers have disappeared this time as far north as rhyl what do you say now colonel huh the colonel began spooning his porridge into his mouth people want to learn to swim before they start buggering about in the water bring back conscription i say teach em all to swim cliff sighed and helped himself to some more marmalade now they were really up against it his warning had gone unheeded his first reaction was to head back to london himself yet he knew he could not he would have to see it through now and besides he wasnt going to leave pat benson on her own crabs or no crabs chapter seven the sentry was bored night duty always bored him it wasnt really as if there was anything to stand guard over a few unmanned aircraft which the boffins liked to mess about with it was their way of playing at model aircraft in this case at the taxpayers expense christ nobody would want to pinch one of those still that chap had been snooping about the other day as crazy as a coot he couldnt understand why theyd let him go particularly as there had been a bombalert earlier in the week he yawned and leaned against the corner of the concrete blockhouse that damned rifle was too heavy to hold all night he leaned it up against the wall and delved into the top pocket of his tunic for a crushed pack of cigarettes he found one straightened it out and lit it he drew deeply strictly against regulations of course but a chap would go barmy if he didnt have a smoke between sunset and sunrise he couldnt understand why they wouldnt let him sit in one of the huts probably thought hed doze off he might do that anyway his eyelids felt heavy the moon was bright again tonight he looked at it and couldnt understand why anybody would want to go messing about up there bloody crazy he wouldnt have gone never knew what you might find pissing about in space all sorts of weird monsters clcketyclick he straightened up what was that sounded like somebody using oldfashioned morse code he picked up his rifle click click clicketyclick blimey those cattle had broken in through the fence they were always rubbing themselves up against it never thought theyd actually manage to get inside he sighed better go and shoo em out again then he saw the first pair of eyes it reminded him of a groundhog shining like the cos landrover headlights there were more of them scores of them he stopped in his tracks the nearest was no more than fifteen feet away whats goin on he gulped christ fucking crabs his rifle came to his shoulder they wouldnt have much answer to that he squeezed the trigger the report was deafening echoing around the concrete buildings and dying away somewhere far out to sea he couldnt believe it the bastard hadnt budged wrong it was coming towards him they were all coming towards him waddling not hurrying he fired again twice three tunes he kept on shooting until the magazine was empty run he turned his heart nearly gave out he felt his senses reeling it wasnt the fact that his retreat was cut off that would have been bad enough it was the creature barring his way that caused him to cross over that thin borderline which separates sanity from madness he screamed at the top of his voice wielding his rifle by the barrel the stock smashed to matchwood on that armourplated pincer he backed away and then he started laughing he adopted a fighting pose his fists clenched ah right he yelled come on then you bastards lets see how good you are in a straight fucking fight mercifully the slashing claw of king crab caught him directly on top of the head splitting his skull in two he was dead before he hit the ground and escaped the torture that bartholomew had suffered as he was dismembered the searchlight was just in time to reveal the last of the mutilation to the two horrified gunners in the tower they did not recognise that last joint of human meat disappearing into the jaws of the monster crab as belonging to their colleague all they saw were the crabs that was enough fucking hell the sergeant cried as he brought the light machinegun to bear on the crawling mass what the hell are they thisll sort them out the clatter of machinegun fire rent the night air click click clicketyclick the whole camp was awake by now someone had opened the armoury men with rifles were rushing to every available vantage point and opening fire a battery of gunfire exploded click click clicketyclick hailstones or bullets they were all the same to the giant crabs they just bounced off they did not like the sensation of having things vibrating on their shells though it made them angry very angry they didnt like the noise and the flashes either above it all though they sensed the prospect of sweet tender human flesh christ the machinegunner in the tower swore as he paused to reload it hasnt bloody touched em might as well use a peashooter suddenly he heard a cracking of timber below and felt himself and the machinegun starting to slide theyve wrecked the fucking tower the sergeant screamed and then they were sailing through the air hurtling down to the waiting jaws and pincers two snipers threw down their empty rifles and made a run for the gate beyond lay the causeway they would probably have made it had not the gate been closed they started to scramble up it vicious pincers snapped at them legless they fell back king crab waved his claws and clicked loudly instantly his minions became silent looking to him for orders not daring to disobey halfeaten humans were forgotten a wave of a great claw pointing to the shore retreat seconds later the seawards shamble had begun there were no obstacles in their way the barbedwire fence had been flattened in the attack a few shots more in anger than anything else followed them and then as the ominous clicking became fainter shell island began to count its losses an emergency call to the mainland brought ambulances speeding to the scene nevertheless they had to wait half an hour for the tide to uncover the causeway before they could cross crowds gathered from the nearby camping areas the majority were genuine helpers bringing their own firstaid kits with them but among the throng were also the ghouls those who loved scenes of disaster those who loved to gloat over the mutilations the losses were slight in comparison to the ferocity and size of the attack five dead the first sentry the two machinegunners and the two hapless snipers who had been foolish enough to try and reach the mainland police followed the ambulances good lord the easygoing sergeant hughess features were paler than any of the locals had ever seen what in the name of heaven were they crabs a serviceman paused to light a muchneeded cigarette bloody great crabs as big as horses it wasnt long before the telephone lines to london were buzzing im sorry clifford grisedale said as he sipped his whisky in the victoria in llanbedr and regarded cliff davenport and pat benson im sorry i doubted you believe you me they fetched me back from belgium in the early hours of this morning and i came here post haste that bloody fool goode dont blame him cliff drew deeply on his pipe even if he had believed me and wed gone out on to the sands we wouldnt have been able to stop the attack more than likely wed have been caught up in the invasion and wouldnt be here now to tell the tale you always did look for the better side in people the other remarked with a smile the fact is this things serious now the place is crawling with police troops and the press every newspaper is carrying the most farfetched yarn imaginable and crowds are pouring in weve had to evacuate the island consequently every hotel between rhyl and borth is bursting at the seams and caravans and campers are everywhere if theres another of these invasions his voice tailed off cliff davenport nodded in front of him he had a map of the welsh coast spread out on the table lets start at the beginning he said we first saw these crabs a week ago my nephew and his girlfriend disappeared the week before that so we can safely say that these creatures arrived here no more than a fortnight ago theyre a freak species never before known in history we can do little more than hazard a guess at their origin underwater nuclear experiments in another part of the world causing them to grow to tremendous proportions thats just a theory of mine but at this stage were not so much concerned with that as to how we are going to deal with them if and when we locate their underwater hideout it must be somewhere on this coast between rhyl and borth but where there must be thousands of caves below the sea which could hide a million of them personally grisedale interrupted i think they bit off more than they could chew when they attacked the wd base grisedale lit another cigarette maybe they wont venture ashore again dont you believe it the professor replied they didnt suffer one casualty they survived rifle and machinegun fire now theres a colossal crab which leads them ive named him king crab believe you me he thinks hes cunning that attack was more of an experiment than anything else theyve found bathers easy prey and now they want to see how they fare on land theyve discovered that bullets cant hurt them so next tune theyll be more venturesome the invasion will be on a much bigger scale and theyll hit one of the towns theyll rue the day they do grisedale quipped the army have got tanks stationed at every village and town on this coast plus troops standing by with mortars and grenades and if that doesnt put paid to em then the raf will give em some stick from the air theyve backed a loser i wouldnt be too sure of that cliffs expression was serious you havent seen these monsters grisedale if you had youd know what i mean id have to see em blown to smithereens with my own eyes before id believe theyre not invincible well i take it you wont be going back to london just yet the ministry of defence man observed lightly as he noted cliffs hand squeezing pats thigh no cliff assented i guess well be around for a bit yet ive no doubt in my mind what happened to ian and julie and id like to see this thing through to the end good man grisedale stood up well ive got a meeting in barmouth this afternoon so i must push along keep in touch shortly after midnight that night cliff davenport let himself quietly out of his bedroom as he tiptoed along the corridor in his stockinged feet he hoped that nobody would hear him his heart pounded wildly and his mouth was dry for once he was not thinking of those horrific crabs the army was here to deal with them now he paused outside the door of room four he knew that pat wanted him to come to her yet since that night in the sanddunes nothing had happened between them their minds had been too occupied with the present horrors of course the logical thing would have been for him and pat to have shared a room but that sort of thing wasnt possible at mrs joness she knew everything that went on and she most certainly would not have approved his hand trembled as it rested on the handle of the door and then he entered closing it quietly behind him cliff pats welcome whisper allayed all his fears the night was warm and she was lying naked on top of the sheets the silvery light filtering through the small window not nearly so bright now that the full moon was waning was sufficient for him to see every detail of her body her breasts were perfectly rounded her thighs were parted and almost guiltily she snatched her hand from between them i was thinking about you she sighed as he seated himself on the bed beside her he bent and kissed her slim fingers felt at the front of his trousers perhaps to determine the purpose of his visit and she laughed softly as she found that everything was to her satisfaction he began to take off his clothes her eyes followed his every movement at last he stood before her as adam had once stood before eve tempting her to tempt him her fingers closed over his erection and drew her to him he rolled on to the bed and then she was dragging him on top of her youre in an awful hurry he gasped as she helped him to attain an immediate penetration ive been waiting for you to come to me for three nights now she breathed i was beginning to think that you had decided upon a platonic friendship after all he thrust madly unable to hold back any longer does that answer your question he murmured but her reply was lost in the moans and the writhings of their united bodies as they reached the ultimate possible peak of pleasure which any man and woman can climb afterwards they just lay quiet still joined delighting in their closeness cliff pat was the first to speak after some considerable time what what will happen when the army have cleared up this crab business i mean what about us there wont be anything to keep us here any longer will there no he kissed her again there wont be anything to keep us here i guess well go back to london then we her voice trembled at the very question which had plagued her since the first time they had made love we he assured her her fingers went down to him again in an attempt to arouse him a second time chapter eight sam owen always fished by night he had done so ever since he was a youth experience had taught him that his catches were heavier and there was more room to move in and about barmouth harbour without that cursed ferry churning up the estuary and disturbing the shoals of fish every halfhour besides that he just liked being afloat on moonlight nights he was fortytwo and a strong silent man he lived for the sea and his one wish was that he would not die on dry land when his time came he wanted to pass away peacefully in his little fishing smack out on the open sea maybe hed drift away for ever and theyd never find him the warnings of the police and the armed forces didnt worry him ok so something had happened on shell island that was their worry it was ten miles away up the coast that was far enough away and those stupid bathers who got lost off the beach cramp probably sam owen was at peace with the world as his boat bobbed just outside the harbour entrance at the mouth of the estuary by tomorrow night the moon would be no good for nightfishing he lit his pipe and relaxed it had been a good week half an hour later he knew hed got the catch of his life there was something big in the net and the boat was listing to stern as a result whatever it was it was threshing madly he had visions of hauling in another moby dick as he set about trying to land his catch the water foamed the bows were right up in the air now and he struggled to keep his balance hell there was only one thing for it he would have to cut the net free and lose whatever was in it as well the moonlight flashed on the steel blade of his pocketknife he leaned over and began to slash at the netting he could see something struggling in the mesh christ what was it his knife was blunt had it been sharp he might have cut through the net quickly and escaped instead he had to saw with the blade as he leant overboard something clasped his wrist something that was razorsharp before he realised it his bloody hand and the knife had dropped into the sea with a dull plop the silvery water had a spreading dull red patch on it he staggered back screaming blood spouted into the night air like an oil strike in vain he grabbed at the stump and tried to stem the flow with an oily rag the blood spurted into his face blinding him the boat lurched again as a huge claw appeared over the stern and two glowing eyes regarded the man who was now easy prey the giant crab could smell blood human blood awkwardly it began to clamber aboard sam owen caught a glimpse of the advancing creature through a red haze blind panic seied him he staggered to the bows blood still pumping fiercely from his severed wrist he was going to die one way or another he would either bleed to death or this nightmarish monstrosity from the deep would mutilate him and eat him his thoughts turned to the sea he decided that he would die in the way he had always wanted to with salt water filling his lungs and the fish which had provided him with his living feeding off his body his strength ebbing fast he pulled himself up over the side of the boat a pincer fastened over his ankle and he knew his foot was gone what did it matter though the coolness of the sea seemed to revive him temporarily instinctively he tried to swim but it was impossible without the full use of his limbs he felt himself going down down down he touched the bottom the red mist was before him again eyes were glowing all around him something gripped his neck it was sharp hed once read a book about the french revolution it had said that the guillotine was painless he would soon find out then blackness surged over him at am the invasion of barmouth began the waning moonlight was in the crabs favour a few nights ago they would have been spotted earlier not that the outcome would have been any different the soldiers in the tank on the quayside were the first to see the creatures look the gunner shook his mate into instant wakefulness theyre here it was a matter of seconds to bring the big gun to bear on the nearest crab the sights were adjusted and at that range it was impossible to miss the gun spat out its shell the crab keeled over fragments of shell flying through the air got him the gunner yelled jubilantly invincible a load of balls thisll sort the bastards out as he reloaded and brought his gun to bear on the crawling crabs again a movement caught his eye he paused shit he gasped the bastards getting up again the creature had indeed struggled upright with the help of its companions it had regained us balance its eyes glowed venomously and apart from some shards chipped from its shell it appeared to be all right it couldnt the corporal grunted incredulously nothing could withstand that not at that range anyway well it has the gunner snapped taking another sighting see that big sod the one the size of a fucking house well lets see what it does to him the quayside shook with the explosion king crab was thrown backwards yet did not roll over for a few seconds he just squatted dazed and then he advanced his army well in excess of a hundred crabs followed him the clicking was deafening mindsearing the large claw waved and came to rest pointing directly at the tank there was no mistaking his command shut that hatch the gunner yelled theyre coming at us the hatch clanged shut the soldiers felt secure the enemy was too close for another shot they would just have to hold out until reinforcements arrived the corporal lit a cigarette his hands were shaking they cant get at us in here his laugh was strained and hollow inside the confined space remember the time we broke down sarge they couldnt tow us and had to repair us on the spot took em two days shut up the sergeants nerves were stretched to breaking point he didnt like the look of those crabs one little bit they heard claws scraping on the steel come on you bastards the corporal yelled hysterically try and shift us for christs sake shut your bloody trap the gunners fist caught the corporal in the mouth and his head hit the steel wall with a dull clang he slumped back in his seat the gunner felt the tank move impossible he looked out dozens of crabs were gathered around the mobile steel fortress he felt it move again upwards theyve theyve lifted it up he cast a glance at his companions the corporal was still unconscious he shook him roughly wake up he snarled panic starting to creep into his voice wake up theyre carrying us the tank shook and swayed as crabs crawled beneath it while others lifted their shells provided an ideal means of transport as they set off in the direction of the harbour wall the sergeant started to scream slapping his comatose mate frantically but the corporals head merely lolled from side to side then they stopped the tank lurched forward and seemed to be suspended in midair for a split second before it hurtled downwards a mighty splash and it was sinking the murky waters closed over it a bonejarring thud followed as it became embedded in the deep mud and started to sink inside all was silent all three men were dead the armed forces swung into smooth action following the first report of the tanks gun hardly had its echoes died away before two truckloads of troops were speeding to the scene it took them only three minutes to reach the harbour it had taken the crabs less than two to deal with the tank the driver of the first truck was braking the moment he saw the crabs they were everywhere the road was packed with them and they were advancing towards the town he started to reverse but his progress was delayed by the driver of the second truck who had difficulty in going backwards at any speed there was no hope of evading the columns of advancing horrors soldiers jumped to the ground grenades were hurled automatic rifles were brought into action the promenade and harbour shuddered under the explosions vivid flashes lit the night sky smoke billowed out in clouds as a disintegrated seafront shelter caught fire relentlessly the giant crabs advanced burning debris lay before them but the flames went unheeded they were impervious to fire captain oliver of the royal shropshire light infantry holstered his smoking pistol his face was smokeblackened and his hat was missing they had failed that much was obvious and he was not prepared to sacrifice his men needlessly he shouted above the din for them to retreat the trucks were abandoned as the soldiers fell back behind them lay a piece of waste ground on which stood an amusement arcade swings dodgems and coffee stalls they headed towards it everywhere people were fleeing in panic men in pyjamas and dressinggowns hustled their families away from the battleground women and children screamed captain oliver watched as the two heavy transport trucks shared the same fate as the tank the crabs lifted them with ease hurling them over the harbour wall the fire began to spread rows of buildings became a blazing inferno a burning beam fell across one of the crabs it brushed it aside and carried it on its way not even fire can stop them oliver muttered its as though theyve come from hell itself more soldiers were arriving from the north they set up a mortar and scored a direct hit with the first shot the scuttling ranks parted but came together again almost immediately there was not a single casualty at am king crab sounded the retreat with a clicking and waving of his pincers like a welldisciplined army the creatures headed back to the harbour and within a few minutes not a single one was to be seen the battle of barmouth was over the fireengines moved in and the demoralised troops began moppingup operations those whose homes remained returned to them many wept over their losses and everybody wondered when the crabs would return as surely they would inside the town hall it was hot and stuffy the men seated on either side of the long table sweated profusely outside they could hear gangs of workmen attempting to clear the debris the streets were crowded with holidaymakers who were intent only on viewing the results of the invasion they constantly ignored police warnings to keep clear cliff davenport loosened his tie and looked around him the large room was crowded there must have been two hundred in there mostly they were from the armed forces from top brass down as far as mere captains the mayor was present along with his councillors naturally the press was not missing out on it either gentlemen grisedale stood up and addressed the gathering last night this town suffered an attack far worse than anything it has ever experienced in its history we had anticipated a move of this sort ever since the invasion of shell island the precautions taken were it seemed beforehand perfectly adequate however we had underestimated the enemy it now appears that they are immune to the weapons of warfare nor it seems do they fear fire there is therefore only one course open to us we shall take immediate steps to locate their underwater hideout and once this has been discovered i have no doubt that they will be unable to survive the charges which we shall explode beneath the surface of the sea you mean a nuclear device of some sort a reporter asked i said nothing of the kind grisedale retorted however he was well aware of the story which the early editions would carry we have among us he went on professor davenport the wellknown marine biologist it was he who first discovered the presence of these creatures on our shores and he has agreed to collaborate with us in our attempt to exterminate them i feel sure that his knowledge of the ocean bed will be invaluable to us in seeking out these terrible creatures i would add that while for the moment their reign of terror is confined to this part of the coast it could spread much further they will breed if they are not destroyed not only this country but the whole world would be in peril then a murmur ran through the listeners heads turned to look at cliff davenport for once in his life he felt slightly embarrassed proud too the safety of the human race lay in his hands he was being asked to deliver them from this peril of the deep it was one helluva responsibility but yon dont have to dive down there do you a look of dismay spread across pat bensons face when cliff returned to llanbedr and told her over dinner what had transpired at the meeting well i cant examine the seabed by sitting safely in a motor launch he smiled in that case she replied t shall be sitting in the launch youre not leaving me out of this now he sighed already he was learning that it was futile to argue with pat once her mind was made up chapter nine the sea was calm there was barely a swell as the welsh queen chugged out of barmouth harbour it was hotter than ever that day the sun blazed mercilessly down but cliff davenport knew that before long he would be down there in the cool depths where it rarely penetrated another world altogether they were five of them in the launch pat bensons face was white and strained she gazed seawards preferring not to look back at the devastation on the quayside the man at the helm wore a navy blue sweater and slacks his complexion was the colour of tanned leather from a lifetime spent ferrying trippers between barmouth and fairbourne the other two were from the ministry of defence young fellows who glanced uneasily at each other their job was to assist the professor in his diving behind them purred another boat much sleeker in appearance a speedboat in case it was necessary to get away from the scene in a hurry a gunboat kept level with them grey and forbidding occasionally a helicopter flew over circling around them and then heading back in the direction of barmouth but supposing you do find them pat voiced her thoughts what will you do i mean they might not just be in one place they could be living in dozens of caves somehow i dont think so cliff replied you remember that monstrosity of a leader they have well hes got them organised at his beck and call night and day its my guess that theyll all be together if i find them but suppose she had difficulty in getting the words out suppose they find you first he shrugged his shoulders someones got to look for them he smiled and patted her thigh after half an hour or so he began stripping off and donning his frogmans suit the seamen looked round at him expectantly head inshore towards those tall cliffs the professor shouted above the roar of the engine well make a start there the launch changed course the speedboat and the gunboat followed twenty yards from the cliff face engines were switched off and anchors dropped pat stepped up to cliff and their lips met he looked at her clad in sweater and jeans she was the most desirable thing in his life he thought about what lay ahead of him in the murky fathoms why did it have to be him why couldnt he and pat go back to london and leave the authorities to deal with the giant crabs he knew though that there was no other answer he thought again of tan and julie as soon as the creatures were destroyed he could learn to live again ill be careful he promised the two men helped him over the side the last thing he saw was pats anxious face and then the dark green waters swallowed him up it was then that he realised that he was alone everything depended upon him alone there was nobody to help him down here the gunboat might as well have been a million miles away soon he was on the seabed feeling his way along the base of the cliff a tiny crab scuttled away at his approach he shuddered involuntarily he pressed on there were numerous caves many were so small that a glance inside was sufficient to reveal in the beam of his waterproof torch that they housed nothing more dangerous than seaanemones he moved cautiously where the larger caves were concerned it was not however just a simple case of systematic searching he was looking for signs on the seabed that would reveal the presence of a large number of crabs claw prints would be washed away by the currents rather he was looking for marks on boulders that would be caused by the constant scratching of hundreds of huge pincers passing regularly to and fro after an hour he surfaced nothing doing there was relief in pats voice as she helped him aboard and handed him a mug of tea not yet he chided humorously i didnt expect it to be that easy but youve got to make a start somewhere two hundred miles of coast will taken an awful long time this way how long are you keeping it up for she asked noting one of the others producing a fresh cylinder of oxygen oh ill probably try four or five dives today he tried to appear casual then tomorrow well make an early start she sighed and began helping him back into his diving gear the rest of that day revealed nothing and as they chugged back into the remains of barmouth harbour they noted tanks taking up positions on the wrecked quayside the british army did not acknowledge defeat the following morning they started their search immediately after breakfast the night had been quiet and along the welsh coast there had been not a single alert maybe theyve given up and gone back where they came from pat remarked hopefully as cliff donned his diving suit i very much doubt it he replied its the moon as ive said before it lures them out last night was moonless too much cloud and the full moons gone anyway that doesnt mean that they wont attack in the dark its just that the inclination isnt so strong they might even attack in daytime if it comes to that then cliff davenport dived aware that for the rest of that day he would spend many hours deep down in the murky depths other divers were searching as far a field as colwyn bay and borth he feared though that inexperience might cause them to overlook the slumbering crabs it was during the afternoon of the second day that he discovered the gigantic caverns the bed of the sea in that particular area was composed of soft sand with few rocks and boulders and there was no sign of any crabs movements he didnt even realise when he shone his torch into the first cavern that it was anything more than just a large cave with only one entrance until he noticed the circular gap in the far corner the roof was approximately fifteen feet above his head the walls slimy and covered with underwater growth he crossed to the exit opposite and shone his torch into it it was a passage maybe ten feet wide by twelve feet high and he could not see beyond the first bend he ventured further there was another bend and the floor was beginning to slope downwards bend after bend and all the time the tunnel was becoming larger it was pitch black now and without his torch he would not have been able to see at all he moved warily he tried to estimate how far he had come he judged it must be about three or four hundred yards at least suddenly the tunnel widened out into another huge cavern he could only guess at its size for the beam of his powerful torch did not reach as far as the opposite wall then one of his flippers kicked against something it was too light to be a rock and too heavy to be an undersea plant he shone his beam down his stomach muscles tightened and the shivers running up and down his spine were not due to the coldness of the water before him lay a piece of shell it was flesh coloured and roughly the size and shape of a car mudguard there was no mistaking where it had come from it was a piece off one of the shells of the giant crabs he appeared to be standing on a ledge of some sort a protruding shelf of rock about two or three yards wide with a drop below him he shone his torch over the edge and then doused it immediately below him slumbered the objects of his search hundreds of the giant crabs all clustered together at least he hoped they were asleep they certainly hadnt been moving when he had caught that quick glimpse of them and he prayed that the light from his torch had gone unnoticed they appeared to have withdrawn into their shells he stepped back and rested his back against the rock wall his mission was over all he had to do now was to make his way back to the launch report his find and the authorities would do the rest he wondered if they really had considered a controlled nuclear explosion it wouldnt be necessary here all that would be required would be a powerful depth charge in that outer tunnel to bring the roof down and seal those freaks of nature in a watery tomb from which even they would be unable to escape suddenly he sensed a movement it came from the tunnel through which he had entered something was stirring coming in the direction of this massive cavern something that caused the water to churn and swirl he dared not use his torch not that he needed to he knew what it was one of the crabs was in the tunnel maybe it was returning from a foray in the open sea or perhaps it was a sentry which somehow he had passed by unnoticed whatever the creatures duty in this crab army one thing was certain cliff davenports retreat was cut off he pressed himself back against the wall there was absolutely nothing he could do except wait he could feel it getting closer and closer something brushed against his leg and he flinched the thing had actually touched him with its pincer he braced himself almost praying that the end would come quickly nothing happened he edged back slowly the creature was stationary now perhaps it was waiting just gloating over him preparing to pounce cliff felt a gap in the wall of the cave behind him and reaching out with his hand he explored it it was a narrow crack a kind of alcove he eased himself into it having to bend his shoulders to do so it was silly but he felt a lot safer in there nothing moved he didnt know whether or not the giant crab was still in the entrance to the passage there was he reflected only one way in which he could find out it was not a pleasant thought time passed he began to get anxious he wished that he had some means of calculating the time since he had dived he knew there could not be much oxygen left in the cylinder now he had a choice he could either venture forth and take his chance with the crab on sentryduty or he could stay where he was and suffocate he straightened up and started to move back along the ledge towards the tunnel he should have been back by now pat benson muttered anxiously as she glanced at her wristwatch for the hundredth time she looked nervously at the two defence men what can have happened to him his oxygen must be running low said stan williams the younger of the two smiling and trying to allay her fears maybe though hes stopping down the full limit in order to cover as much ground as possible i make it he can last another twenty minutes yet the minutes ticked slowly by pat felt her frustration building up her impulse was to dive overboard going down as deep as she could and at least make some attempt to search for the man she loved the fact that she was not doing anything at all made her feel totally helpless ten minutes stan williams stood up and moved towards the small cabin i reckon ill just put on a small reserve supply but i dont want to leave it till the very last minute when he emerged on deck again he was wearing his frogmans outfit somehow to pat he looked sinister more frightening even than the prospect of meeting up with the giant crabs it was as though she tried not to think of it in that way he sensed that cliff davenport wouldnt be returning and was merely making a token dive to search for him bob wildman the other diver helped williams adjust the breathing apparatus pat stood as though hypnotised watching him clamber over the side and gradually lowering himself down into the water do you do you think she couldnt get the words out the professor will probably bob up any minute wildman replied taking care not to let her see the worried look in his eyes then well all be sitting here for the next hour or so waiting for stan to come back would you care for a cup of tea while we wait diving was just a job to stan williams like writing out reports or filing ledgers away it was something one did without actually thinking about it he wasnt too keen on meeting up with the crabs but after all it was like looking for a needle in a haystack probably by now they were miles away he moved along the seabed much faster than cliff had done it was not his job to examine this underwater terrain for signs of the crab colony he was simply looking for a man he kept his torch on the whole time if he didnt spot cliff then maybe cliff would see him he reached the rock face and moved along it in a southerly direction that was the way the man he was looking for would have gone eventually he came to the big cave he shone his torch inside and then he spotted the tunnel for a minute he debated whether or not it was worthwhile venturing further in the end he decided to take a look it was just the sort of place the professor would have explored ten to one he had discovered some form of rare plant life and had dallied while he examined it oblivious to everything else that was the trouble with his sort just as he reached the first bend he felt a movement in the water coming towards him he held up his torch professor davenport had not taken as much finding as hed anticipated then his relief turned to horror as the giant crab loomed up in the black waters chapter ten cliff davenport could sense that the monster was still there some sixth sense warned him that it was squatting in the only exit from that terrible place how great was its vigilance he would discover in the next few seconds still keeping to the wall he edged his way slowly into the tunnel his flipper brushed against something hard and he knew without a doubt that it was one of the crabs claws he had to fight down his panic judging its position he lifted his leg as though he was straddling a fence again he brushed against the pincer and then he was past it he continued to move slowly his instincts told him to start swimming back to the sea as fast as he could but he feared that any sudden movement might draw the creatures attention to his presence obviously the crabs felt secure in these caverns and did not anticipate an attack of any kind they were all asleep he reached the huge outer cavern still following the walls and declining to use his torch he knew that he had escaped the clutches of those that still slumbered behind him but there was always the chance of meeting up with the odd one returning from a constitutional on the ocean bed the blackness of the water was turning to a deep murky green gradually it became lighter and it was with immense relief that he emerged from those cliif caves the tension of the past halfhour had made him ignore such basic things as the efficiency of his breathing apparatus as he leaned against a rock for a moment to recover he realised with a start that his oxygen was running out the air he was breathing was thick and stale he knew also that he would never be able to make it back to the welsh queen not below the surface anyway he struck upwards air was top priority if he surfaced alongside the cliffs he would then be able to swim out to the launch and pat never had he gulped in fresh air with such gratitude he trod water gasping in the cool sea breeze and unable to open his eyes fully in the bright sunlight at last refreshed his eyes finally accustomed to the brightness he looked out towards the spot where the welsh queen should have been bobbing at her moorings there was no sign of it the gunboat and the speedboat were not to be seen either the sunlight sparkled and danced on an empty bay stan williams had lightning reflexes had this not been the case the first blow from that mighty pincer would surely have killed him there and then even as he gazed horrified at the monstrosity which confronted him he was backpedalling treading water fast the claw grazed his shoulder as he turned and began to swim in the opposite direction he was forced to leave on the light in his headpiece without it he would most certainly have swum straight into the wall at the very next bend however not only did it serve to show him the way but it also acted as a guide for the pursuing crab the diver had the advantage in the tunnel for he could negotiate the bends much quicker than his pursuer still stan williams would never have believed that a crab could scuttle along with such speed every so often he felt the striking claws missing him by inches he had no alternative other than to swim as fast as he could yet once they were in the open it just didnt bear thinking about across the big cavern and then the exit loomed before him he tried to increase his speed but he knew that he was tiring quickly he dared not look behind him he knew only too well that it was gaining on him if only he could beat this thing through the entrance and strike upwards immediately he was clear of the cavern he knew that he stood a chance he felt the rubber flipper on his left foot being ripped to shreds but he was still unscathed freedom lay ahead of him one final spurt he started to rise it was that which was his undoing the giant crab gained another couple of feet as its prey changed course and its one last despairing lunge made contact blinding pain surged through williams he knew that his left leg had gone just below the knee desperately he tried to put the pain out of his mind and then he was shooting upwards leaving hisattacker far behind him a dull red trail followed him there pat benson screamed as she saw the frogman surface she had no idea which of the two men it was she just prayed that it was cliff davenport wildman was focusing a pair of binoculars on the distant black object a puzzled look appeared on his face its williams he snapped hes hes in trouble haul that anchor up hell never make it across here but the speedboat beat them to it by the time the welsh queen reached the place where stan williams had surfaced he had already been hauled on board the other craft as they drew alongside they could see him lying on the deck amidst a crowd of helpers his right leg a ragged stump from which blood was pumping the flow of blood was slowing up as they clambered on to the speedboat the frogmans face was deathly white and his eyes were closed crabs he stammered the words barely audible down there big cave tunnel where man where grisedale knelt beside him but the information was not forthcoming stan williams was dead grisedale rose to his feet and looked at the others theyre down there his voice was low but where shall i go down and have a look wildmans question lacked enthusiasm it was the last thing in the world he wanted to do but duty made him offer no grisedale shook his head weve lost two men already today something else must be done submarines perhaps pat benson turned away she didnt cry that would only have been an outward show of her emotions she wished she could die she would willingly have donned a frogmans suit and gone down below well head back grisedale announced theres not much more we can do here at the moment minutes later the tiny convoy was on its way back to barmouth once again the enemy had triumphed cliff davenport rested on the rocks until he felt his strength returning the cliffs above him were too steep to climb there was only one way back and that was to swim along the rocky coastline until he came to somewhere where he could clamber ashore a quarter of an hour later he found the place he sought a small shingle beach leading up to some sheep fields as he dragged himself on to dry land he glanced down and grinned pausing he removed his flippers and goggles perhaps anyone who saw him now would take him for an eccentric bather for one of the few times in his life he felt ridiculous he followed the shoreline until eventually barmouth came into view he could see the wrecked promenade and the small fairground it came as a grim reminder of what he had seen down in those caverns he quickened his step there was no time to be lost the sooner he imparted the information which he had gained and something was done to destroy the crabs the better people gazed at him in astonishment children pointed and ran away as he passed by the harbour he noticed the welsh queen and the speedboat moored to the quayside he could not understand it he felt angry why had his colleagues abandoned him there had to be a reason he had difficulty in convincing the soldier on the town hall steps of his identity i want to see commander grisedale cliff demanded impatiently my name is professor davenport professor davenport the squaddies eyes widened in surprise did you say professor davenport sir thats right cliff snapped now but but the uniformed man stuttered his eyes wide in disbelief the crabs got you did they now the professor laughed hollowly so everybody thought id been eaten up did they thats why they cleared off home in such a hurry worried lest they might be late for tea i suppose without further ado he pushed past the startled sentry and mounted the wide stairs leading to the first floor across the landing behind the closed double doors was grisedales temporary headquarters cliff davenport did not hesitate without even knocking he pushed them open and entered the occupants of the room whirled round expressions of annoyance changing to incredulity my god grisedales jaw dropped it cant be but it is thought i was a goner didnt you cliff sneered you didnt waste much time looking for me we um we the ministry of defence boss gave up talking and just gaped the words he sought eluded him wheres pat cliff snapped his words cutting through the air like a whiplash come on answer me one of you where is she shes been taken back to llanbedr wildman answered shes suffering from shock i should bloody well think she is there were seven or eight men in the room for the most part they were highranking officials from the armed forces every manjack of them just stood and stared unable to believe that professor clifford davenport stood before them alive i think it would be better if we both told our respective stories grisedale said at length closing the door obviously things are not what we thought they were half an hour later grisedale rose to his feet remarkable he commented totally remarkable of course when we pulled williams aboard and saw what had happened to him we naturally presumed that they had got you too cliff and of course you wouldnt have spotted the blood because your torch was out itll be a simple matter to destroy them now a controlled nuclear explosion in those caves im afraid i shall have to ask you to go below water again to show our chaps the way though that wont be necessary cliff replied a limpet mine will do the trick all thats needed is an explosion large enough to collapse the tunnel leading to the cave where these horrors are hiding out then theyll be sealed in there for all time i could manage it myself without any trouble it would be best to leave it until tomorrow though if we tried it tonight theyd probably be out feeding during the nocturnal hours and then wed just be wasting our time as well as turning them loose on the whole world without even their home to return to theres no knowing where they might go that makes sense said grisedale turning to the others nods and murmurs of assent followed right then grisedale turned to cliff ill run you back to llanbedr in my car and you can put mrs bensons mind at rest id like to make an early start in the morning though the sooner we blast these hellspawned creatures the better ill like it pat benson was sobbing quietly on the bed when cliff entered her room at first she showed no surprise presuming it to be all part of her dream about the man she loved it was only when he sat down beside her and touched her that she started up cliff she cried i you no im not a ghost he squeezed her hand and kissed her tm real flesh and blood and nothing really terrible happened to me down there she clung to him desperately as though fearful that he might vanish suddenly like some sea sprite which had been sent to torment her what what happened she sobbed he told her the whole nerveracking story oh cliff she cried as she flung her arms around him dont go back down there please let them plant the bomb youve done more than your share already they wouldnt be able to find the cave he explained besides there wont be any danger this time all ive got to do is to stick a limpet mine in the tunnel and get away itll be timed to go off about an hour later and that will really be the end of them the finish cliff davenport assured her the giant crabs will be no more gently his hands began unfastening zips and clasps together they slid into the cool inviting bed as they came together they were living for the present only that which had gone before and that which awaited them on the morrow was pushed out of their minds just one more day that was all that stood between them and a life of happiness together time was running out for the giant crabs chapter eleven a sea mist hung over the bay as the gunboat put out from barmouth this time there was no need for the launch or the speedboat the mission was simple cliff davenport would dive and place the mine they would be back in harbour by the time it went off in a way it seemed almost like shooting a sitting rabbit pat benson had remained behind at llanbedr with mrs jones for once her insistence on accompanying cliff had been overruled theres no point the professor had told her i shall be back here well before lunchtime as they dropped anchor cliff began donning his frogmans suit youre sure you wouldnt like me to send wildman along with you grisedale asked for the umpteenth time positive cliff replied theres no point in risking two lives not that theres any real risk the crabs should be sleeping but one never knows the distant mountains were invisible behind a thick bank of hillfog it was drizzling slightly cliff shuddered a bit of sunshine would have made all the difference to everybodys spirits the water closed over his head strapped to his waist was a circular object roughly twice the size of a mills bomb attached to it was a flat rubber suction pad simple yet deadly cliff davenport was uneasy as he followed the base of the cliff along to the entrance to the big cave it was all too straightforward in fact it seemed ludicrous that the giant crabs which had withstood the weapons of modern warfare with such invincibility could be destroyed by a device which had been rarely used since world war ii however he could see no way in which they could escape he had to summon up every ounce of courage which he possessed to enter that opening at the base of the cliffs again every shadow seemed to hide a sleeping monster he fought to control his nerves the mission had to be carried out effectively the bomb had to be placed in exactly the right place in the tunnel this time he knew what lay deep within the caves previously it had been uncertainty the comfort of searching for something which he would probably never find anyway he entered the tunnel breathing a sigh of relief when he saw that it was devoid of life his only fear now was that the crabs would see the reflection of his light in the water and come to investigate he knew however that his task would not take more than a couple of minutes at the very most he unstrapped the limpetmine and decided on a suitable place to fix it a straight smooth area of rock on a level with his own head and shoulders seemed ideal he pressed the suction pad on to it and tested it for firmness it held with trembling fingers he set the dial of the timing device one hour he began to make his way back to the open sea the crabs had only a short time left then the world would be safe well grisedale wore an anxious expression on his face as cliff was helped on board the gunboat ok said cliff and grinned i think that should do it now lets get going it may only be a limpet mine but id rather not be around when it goes off it could start an avalanche an hour later cliff heaved a sigh of relief of course they would not hear the explosion but if everything had gone according to plan it should be all over by now in his office in the town hall grisedale poured out two whiskies their glasses clinked together they looked at each other and smiled words would have been superfluous well pat benson sighed as she sipped her coffee after dinner that evening i guess its all over now thats the end of the crabs for all time i hope cliff davenport noted the regret in her voice he understood it wasnt that she was in any way sympathetic towards the giant crabs it was just that there was no longer any common bond to hold them in llanbedr now they could drift apart at any time they wished telephone professor mrs jones poked her head round the diningroom door thatll be grizzly cliff remarked and rose to his feet scraping his chair back he said hed give me a ring this evening theyve put a couple of divers down to see what the result of our little explosion was be back in a minute when he returned to the table a few minutes later he was grinning and rubbing his hands together in obvious glee bang on he put two spoonfuls of sugar into his cup not only has it brought the roof of the tunnel down but the outer cave has also collapsed nothing could get out of those caverns its an even bet that the inner cave has fallen in too and crushed the crabs beneath millions of tons of rock grisedales back in london he went by air so that really is it pat lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply the case is closed then almost slowly and carefully he stuffed tobacco into the bowl of his pipe except for us her heart leapt you mean its a beautiful evening he said grateful for the opportunity to glance out of the window i was just thinking how pleasant it would be walking it wont be dark for another couple of hours yet not on the island she rested her hand on his no he replied ive had quite enough of shell island for the time being suppose we take the car along the coast road and walk from there id love that she said stubbing her cigarette out in the ashtray come on whatre we waiting for we cant just drift apart pat cliff davenport spoke the thoughts which had been troubling him all evening i mean i know its been rough meeting in these circumstances but as the old saying goes its an ill wind that blows nobody any good i er i yes she moved closer to him and for some moments they stood on the cliff path admiring the sunset the golden rays reflected on the calmness of the bay the sea mist that had prevailed all day now having disappeared i think the fine spells going to continue he murmured that isnt what you were going to say she squeezed his hand you said something about an ill wind er yes he was nervous now far more so than he had been at the prospect of meeting up with the giant crabs again earlier that day there is something positively terrifying in asking a woman straight out if she will marry you he went on right now my knees are knocking and i feel as if im going to faint how soon she kissed him dont make me wait too long cliff as soon as we get back to london he promised expelling a long sigh of relief i was thinking that maybe we might start back the day after tomorrow i cant get back quick enough she sighed and then surrendered to a long embrace they walked on they felt as though they just wanted to keep on walking forever their course took them along the cliff tops until in the gathering dusk they could spy the lights of barmouth in the distance maybe wed better be getting back cliff said as they stood watching a colony of rabbits playing on a grassy part of the cliffs i could stay here forever pat murmured dreamily couldnt we just sit down awhile and relax we havent relaxed once since weve been together they sat down with their backs against a large rock beneath a grassy knoll the rabbits kept on playing either they were unaware of them or else they had no cause to fear them suddenly as if at a given signal a dozen or more white tails bobbed in the air and then the rabbits were disappearing down the entrances to a nearby warren goodness pat frowned what on earths up with them weve been here for nearly half an hour we didnt frighten them cliff davenports eyes were scanning the sky maybe a sparrowhawk a couple of seagulls lazily flew over their heads on their way out to roost on the mudflats otherwise the sky was empty of bird life perhaps a stoat or a fox as his sharp eyes searched the sloping ground in front of them down as far as the hollow a hundred yards away and then upwards to the rocky peaks on the skyline he caught a movement it was becoming dark by now and whatever it was it was hidden by the shadows of the towering crags just a patch of deeper darkness he watched it carefully it definitely moved of course the nearby farmers took advantage of this type of hilly ground to graze a few extra sheep this was bigger than a sheep though maybe a pony that had broken its tetherings and frolicked forth in search of freedom it moved on to some lighter ground and then he could see it clearly my god he hissed what in the name of pat its one of the crabs oh no she followed his gaze it was true enough a giant crab squatted amidst a patch of rough mountain grass and bracken suddenly it was joined by a second then a third appeared behind and above the first two where the hell are they coming from cliff breathed they cant have scaled the cliffs not even they could do that theres nowhere else though its as if theyre just appearing out of the ground its impossible pat wailed hoping against hope that she would wake up and discover that they had fallen asleep in the grass and dreamt it all they couldnt you said yourself they couldnt get out of that cave cliff davenport was silent he just could not accept that these creatures were free even that they were alive but it was true enough more and more crabs were appearing on the hillside opposite they just seemed to materialise out of the ground grouping together hardly moving waiting for what king crab the professor cursed see the devil twice as big as any of the others hes more cunning than any human being somehow hes got them out of there but how what do we do now pat benson whispered i mean we were just congratulating ourselves on having cleared it all up and then bang were back where we started cliff davenport glanced at his watch he could just determine the position of the two hands in the deep dusk it was nine oclock grisedale will be back in his london flat his whisper incorporated everything that his strained nerves had experienced during the past three weeks i guess ill just have to phone him and tell him to get back here as quick as he can its back to square one im afraid the troops moved out this afternoon as well just a few stayed behind to help with the clearing up everybody will have to be recalled lets just watch these horrors they cant stop here forever i want to see which way they go the crabs seemed quite content to remain bunched together on that stretch of hillside more and more of them appeared out of the darkness squatting together some even withdrew intotheir shells they were in no hurry to go anywhere then darkness cast its cloak over them and the watchers were unable even to discern the shapes of the foe which had returned from the dead come on said cliff helping pat to her feet wed better be leaving i dont like the idea of stumbling about in the dark with those creatures crawling around are you sure man grisedales voice was strained with the fatigue of his long journey and the fact that all their efforts now appeared to have been in vain of course im sure cliff expostulated i wouldnt have rung you if i wasnt we saw them with our own eyes but how i can only hazard a guess beyond the big cave where they lived there must have been another tunnel leading upwards theyre out in the open now christ knows where theyll go they just squatted there until it got too dark for us to see them any more theyll have to get back to salt water eventually though maybe theyll just go back to the sea and leave us in peace maybe grisedale groaned and maybe not ill come back first thing in the morning in the meantime ill notify the ministry of defence god knows what were going to do now though short of dropping a nuclear bomb on them i havent a clue maybe theyd even survive that pat stooped and kissed cliff as he replaced the receiver and sunk his head into his hands youve done everything you could possibly have done she consoled him its not your fault cant we just go away and leave them to it he shook his head no he sighed ive got to see it through im afraid well have to postpone that wedding maybe itll only take a few days perhaps somebody will come up with something i understand her voice trembled and he sensed that she was very close to tears im stopping on with you though whatever crops up well see it through together make no mistake about that he nodded he had not got the heart to tell her that he felt that it was just beginning all over again chapter twelve not a sign of them not a bloody sign cliff davenport and pat benson paused on the top of the hillside where they had sat and viewed the giant crabs the previous evening soon after first light the two of them had set out from llanbedr using the binoculars frequently in an attempt to locate the crab army the hills were deserted except for some rabbits probably those they had seen peacefully grazing the tough wiry grass lets see if we can find out where they came up cliff suggested he began walking towards the opposite slope if there is a tunnel it shouldnt be too hard to find it wasnt amidst a clump of gorse and bracken they discovered the overgrown mouth of a shaft some twelve feet in circumference the undergrowth which had hidden it was flattened and in a patch of soft earth they discovered those only too familiar claw prints it slopes down fairly gradually cliff remarked as he peered down into the gloomy opening no doubt potholers have been having a whale of a time here for years why ever didnt i think of something like this nobody would have done pat exclaimed consolingly all the brains of the civil service and the ministry of defence studied your plan at length they even had a map of the area in front of them its just one of those things one of those things that could prove costly cliff retorted as he straightened up well wed better get back and have some breakfast we cant do any more at the moment all the same id love to know where the crabs are at this very moment after breakfast they had a visitor as they left the diningroom cliff recognised a car which had just pulled to a standstill in the drive outside colonel matthews he muttered to pat push along darling and amuse yourself for half an hour no doubt grizzlys been giving his telephone bill a bashing already colonel matthews was a short stocky selfimportant individual at fortyseven it was his considered opinion that he should have risen much higher hi the british army than he had already the giant crabs had presented a challenge to him his resentment towards the professor had been only too evident the previous day when the limpet mine had been planted now he was bolstered by fresh hope of glory it didnt work then he boomed his eyes betraying his gloating well get em this time though if you can find em cliff countered as he ushered the other into the deserted lounge at the moment they seem to have vanished off the face of the earth oh nonsense the colonel retorted i only wish theyd sent me here in the first place what happened in barmouth was totally unnecessary the troops were badly placed one tank a mortar which was brought on the scene too late tanks and mortars are worse than useless against this type of enemy cliff replied that has already been proved rubbish colonel matthews went red in the face it was the fools who were in charge of them who were responsible for the failure if the weaponry had been used effectively those creatures would never have got further than the harbour have it your own way cliff sighed i take it commander grisedale has been liasing with the services and weve got to get together again thats about the size of it matthews grunted too many cooks are liable to spoil the broth though priority number one is to locate the enemy obviously theyve gone back to the sea so my first move will be to reinforce the troops in barmouth its just a question of waiting for them to come to us then i thought that in the meantime it would be beneficial to search the remaining underwater caves along this stretch of coastline i reckon thats where well find em might save ourselves a lot of time and trouble please yourself said cliff davenport with resignation he shook his head slowly if you want to send divers down thats up to you quite frankly though i think weve learnt our lesson regarding undersea warfare against them so youre not going to dive again colonel matthewss bottom lip twisted in a sneer thats all right by me professor i can get plenty of men wholl go down though what youre going to do in the meantime beats me finding them is only half the battle cliff observed trying not to show his annoyance exterminating them is quite another matter colonel that you will discover in due course a week passed the inhabitants of the welsh coast from colwyn bay to borth began to relax public opinion held that the crabs had left for good maybe they could crop up elsewhere in a far land across the mighty ocean if so then that was not their worry the heatwave broke on the following wednesday with one of the most violent thunderstorms on record the skies darkened thunder crashed and forked lightning flashed then the rain fell in torrents the streets of barmouth were awash within an hour strewth cliff davenport hustled pat benson into the welcome shelter of davy joness locker i reckon this could be what weve been waiting for whys that she asked as she shrugged herself out of her sodden raincoat and spooned sugar into her coffee crabs are instinctively governed by the elements cliff explained as he began to fill his pipe deep down on the ocean bed they are fully aware what is happening above the habits of our friendly little common crab can be compared with these horrors of that i feel sure the crab fishermen know that after a stormy night his catches will be increased tenfold they will seek shelter in the rock pools and on the beaches of sheltered bays thats why i feel that this larger species will develop a sudden desire to be on the move again wherever they have been resting up theyll decide that its time for action once more well my love said pat reaching under the table and squeezing his hand if it means that our wedding date will be brought forward then im all for it they both laughed uneasily the sun broke through the low clouds later that afternoon the mountains however remained screened by a thick hill mist it was warm and sultry and the atmosphere was pregnant with menace as though still charged with the tension from the electric storms earlier it was a time of waiting a lull the evening was hot and stifling cliff and pat used the car after dinner in preference for embarking upon a constitutional which would have been nothing better than an obstacle course of puddles and thick mud they drove southwards parking on a headland which offered them a view of the coastline as far as barmouth yet with the coming of dusk their thoughts turned to matters other than the ever present threat of the giant crabs the morning dawned dull and foggy during the night hours a sea mist had crept in reducing visibility to less than twenty yards a traindrivers job is at its most hazardous at such times dai peters was due to retire at the end of the month he had been looking forward to the day when he would no longer have to drive the early morning train to barmouth from dolgelly in those thick peasoupers which were liable to start any time after september and now this just like a winters morning bang in the middle of august he cursed as the train halted at the whistlestop station of arthog morning dai the porter called as he threw a parcel into the guards van and then approached the engine whats it like back there bloody awful dai grimaced the speed weve come you couldve walked it quicker the train moved on even more slowly dai peters had never liked the estuary crossing it was a silly feeling and he would never have dared let his fears be known amongst his fellow drivers but well he didnt trust the old bridge it was looked after regularly and the experts said it was good for another century but that did not prevent him having nightmares about it he had lost count of the number of times that hed woken up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat shouting in abject terror his wife was used to it and it was she who always calmed his fears almost the dream was always the same high tide the water muddy and deep in the estuary below swirling like a whirlpool gone berserk the train going at a snails pace in spite of the fact that he was giving it full throttle slowing to a crawl for some unaccountable reason then the creaking of over laden timbers as the engine finally came to a halt a splintering and cracking beneath the bridge sagging and then snapping in the middle a lurching the train hurtling down towards the estuary the screaming his loudest of all the water closing over his head that was when he usually woke up on a morning like this morning his dreams did not seem to be altogether the figments of a fevered slumbering brain they could so easily become reality he hated the crossing less than five minutes on a clear morning it might have been five hours on one such as this five hours of bloody torture he eased the throttle right down ten miles an hour he looked down through the grey drifting vapour he could see the estuary below grim and forbidding he shivered he forced his gaze on to the track ahead the parapet of steel girders on either side they looked strong enough anyway all the same he would be glad when it was all over and they drew into barmouth station suddenly a shape materialised out of the fog ahead of the train automatically he started to brake with an agonised shriek the wheels began slowing down whatever it was it was still on the line right in their path and refusing to budge an inch it looked as though somebodys cow had wandered on to the bridge when nobody was looking if it didnt move soon it was bound to be run over stupid bloody animal trains cant just stop dead in their tracks he could see it more clearly now christ that was no cow it was too big wrong shape fucking hell he cursed aloud its one of those bastard crabs the train was nearly at a standstill he could see the crab every detail its face its eyes the thing knew knew he would stop well hed show it his hand left the brake and returned to the throttle full speed ahead more of them on the line up in front bloody crowds of em show em all crush em to pulp the engine had picked up to mph when it made contact with king crab another screech of anguished metal a jolt that threw all the passengers forward dai peters sprawled on the floor of his cab for a split second everything seemed to stop tune stood still then the engine was rearing upwards its wheels spinning uselessly in the air carriages buckled into one another overturning rolling sideways against the steel girders people were screaming dai peters tried to grab the controls brake throttle anything the engine was lurching at a crazy angle almost as if it was running on a model railway and the owner was picking his toys up the driver just clung on for his very life he could see the water below him again the current swirling as though ready to receive him another crash steel girders flying through the air hurtling spinning still hanging on that same dream he started to yell emma emma wake me up the bridge the water for gods sake wake me up amid a pile of falling debris the train slid into the water like links of sausage being carelessly tossed into a pan a mighty splash the murky waters foaming and then a sudden silence nothing moved except the crabs scuttling down the bent and broken supports they dropped back into the water hastening to claim the prize that was theirs tender human flesh fucking hell its getting thicker the man in the bows of the leading lifeboat peered through the gloom cant see anything wait theres the bridge christ almighty the second boat drew alongside debris was floating everywhere not a sign of the train or its occupants it was impossible to see down into the muddy depths cant see a bloody thing the second lifeboat skipper called hey whats rocking the boat the lifeboat lurched to one side its occupants being thrown together in an ungainly heap on the deck bloody hell whats going on the first lifeboat had its bows clear of the water men tumbled everywhere two were flung overboard more screams and yells its its the bloody crabs the skipper lost his precarious hold and was just in time to see the vicious claws before they claimed him everybody was in the water panic reigned men were being dragged down some managing to avoid the fate of their comrades for a few minutes but their escape was only temporary the end was inevitable the capsized lifeboats began to float with the current here and there the brown water was tinged with red a row of seagulls perching on a mudbank rose into the air circled and headed seawards some strange sense had warned them that this was no place for them chapter thirteen they were in the estuary all the time grisedale banged his fist on the table while weve been scanning the shore with troops and having heavy artillery placed along the coast theyve been lying low in the estuary he looked at cliff davenport and shook his head this fog isnt helping any either he groaned of all the times to choose a sea mist has to descend upon us now thats what king crab was waiting for the professor commented hes the most cunning enemy the world has ever met and he doesnt intend to confine himself to the welsh coast alone id stake my bank balance on that what can we do there was despair in grisedales voice now as he gazed out of the window of his hotel room on to the promenade the swirling mist hid the sea from his view theres an emergency meeting at halfpast two all the top brass the troops and munitions are already on the way but are they going to be any good against these bloody crabs im afraid not cliff drummed on the desk with his fingers somehow somewhere there must be an answer they just cant be totally invincible they must have an achilles heel its just a question of finding it this meetings going to be awkward grisedale put in ive worked night and day collaborated with all the armed forces but everybodys saying grizzly isnt doing anything quite frankly i just cant think of anything except a nuclear bomb and that just isnt on their raids are commando style the professor mused a quick attack and back to the sea ive been asking myself why they dont venture further a field it isnt the fear of counterattacks which makes them retreat its simply that they cant exist out of salt water for more than a limited period take an ordinary crab he can survive on a beach between tides say twelve hours these monsters it appears cant last much longer maybe not as long perhaps their resistance out of water is not as great in that respect they can stand up to heavy artillery but well take the battle of barmouth or the shell island invasion they werent ashore for more than a few hours on either occasion i cant even see how that helps us grisedale commented all it means is that if you live far enough inland youre safe that being the case apart from air travel well all be prisoners on this island once they start breeding not even the big ships will be safe theyll increase in numbers rule the oceans and spread a reign of terror along every stretch of coast around the globe nevertheless cliff davenport said determinedly as he stood up im going to work on this somehow there must be a way there must be something so simple that we havent even thought of it towards midafternoon the sea mist began to disperse as a freshening breeze sprang up from the sea weak sunlight filtered through the low cloud the village of arthog was a hive of activity detachments of troops passed through on their way down to the beach at fairbourne cranes and other heavy machinery arrived so that repairs to the bridge could be started with the minimum of delay the villagers could not resist clustering on the platform of the tiny station from there they could see right across the estuary barmouth now appearing on the opposite side through the thinning mist men were clambering over the skeleton of the wrecked bridge shouting and cursing the tide began to ebb gradually at first so that it almost went unnoticed then the mudbanks came into view more and more of them becoming visible every minute the watching people moved closer something was sticking up above the surface of the receding water a carriage buckled and twisted almost beyond recognition then they saw the engine its nose buried deep m the sucking mud rowing boats were being dragged down to the waters edge a gasp of horror ran through the crowd brave men where had the crabs gone nervously they looked about them everywhere was peaceful even the rushing current had been reduced to a gentle trickle the boats reached the wreckage men clambered on to the remnants of the train they wrenched open carriage doors and smashed windows some went inside minutes later they emerged shaking their heads and climbed back into the bobbing rowingboats they had found no bodies the night passed peacefully except for the rumble of tanks and troops arriving to reinforce those already there nobody in arthog slept they just lay and listened to the noises feeling more secure at the sound of each new arrival of either soldiers or artillery a destroyer was stationed at the mouth of the estuary two more patrolled the open sea aircraft were passing to and fro all the time this time the people were confident that the crabs were finished certainly the horrific creatures were trapped in the estuary the choice was theirs they could either stay there or die or try to escape and be blasted off the face of the earth either way it spelt disaster for king crab and his terrible army two days passed the heatwave returned work on the bridge was progressing well new girders were replacing the old heavy cranes had retrieved most of the wrecked train twentyfour people including the crew of the two lifeboats were reported missing not a single body had been recovered and still the armed forces waited everybody waited the weather became still hotter the open sea sparkled a deep blue even the muddy estuary seemed less formidable all bathing had been curtailed but still the holidaymakers poured in with the same eagerness with which they would have gathered around a horrific road accident troops and police formed a wide cordon to keep the people away from the beaches altogether tents appeared on the slopes of the hills in the background adding a bizarre carnival atmosphere to the whole situation roads were blocked by tenmile traffic jams only the complete and utter destruction of the giant crabs would bring a permanent aura of peace back to that part of the welsh coast again the bastards have got to make a move sometime colonel matthews stated puffing his chest out as he addressed his senior officers in their temporary billet in fairbourne they cant stay in the estuary forever unless they arent in there at all a young captain spoke up maybe they went back to the sea after they wrecked the lifeboats nonsense colonel matthews snapped and turned back to his wall map if they dont show up in twentyfour hours were going to start dragging for them while colonel matthews talked on something was happening in the estuary it was low tide the lowest for weeks leaving only a narrow channel of sluggish flowing water between the large sloping mudbanks those repairing the bridge took advantage of the brief period when the supports would be more easily accessible suddenly the current began to increase its pace those working with the water up to their waists had to grasp at the steel struts above them to prevent themselves being swept away hey one gasped as he clung desperately to a rusty girder theres a bloody tidal wave starting look heads turned a large wave enveloped the men leaving them gasping for breath another was following in its wake in comparison the severn bore would have seemed a ripple in a woodland stream something was churning the water into a foaming cauldron someone up on the bridge was shouting those on the bridge began running back along the structure to safety the men in the water were less fortunate the next wave swept them away there was no hope of being able to swim the pounding waves tossed them up and then dragged them down into the deep mud the crabs the crabs are coming the fearful cries of the terrified workers carried across the estuary soldiers who had waited patiently throughout the long period of inactivity reached for their weapons this was it like a neverending column of soldierants the crabs marched out of the estuary in single file in fact only in such formation could they have remained hidden for so long during the low tides their method of concealment was a mystery no longer on and on they came a hundred two three four it was impossible to count them clicketyclick clicketyclick the five men on the bridge ran for their lives with luck they would be on terra firma ahead of the advancing crabs which waddled with astounding speed across the mud beneath them they might have made it had not one of them stumbled and the other four stopped to help him as they pulled the fallen man to his feet they realised that their last hope had gone two of the crabs had turned back and come up to the bridge after them the rest of the everincreasing column continued its advance on arthog the men ran back the way they had come their pursuers seemed to be in no hurry possibly they realised that there was no escape whatsoever for the humans what do we do now the men in overalls pulled up abruptly on the brink of the jagged gap in the bridge it was too wide to leap across he looked back a steady clickclicking filled the air as the crabs deliberately slowed their pace two pairs of evil eyes glinted in the bright sunlight jump it was the man with the twisted ankle who spoke into the water swim for it as one they leapt into space accomplished swimmers all they made a perfect landing perhaps they would have made it had not it been for the three massive crabs perfectly camouflaged against the background of mud which slid towards them in the distance the first shot rang out cliff davenport and pat benson strolled down to barmouth harbour there was little else to do until something happened without each others company life could have become considerably boring cliff bought a paper from a stall and they sat on a bench overlooking the harbour restoration work was in full swing and already evidence of the invasion of the crabs was becoming erased except from the memories of those who had witnessed it idly cliff opened his newspaper naturally the welsh coast was still commanding front page space on most of the london dailies where are the giant crabs now the leading headline ran he skimmed through the article rapidly the whereabouts of the crabs was certainly not going to be pinpointed by fleet street pat was reading over his shoulder poor kiddy she muttered whats that he grunted being more concerned with the ridiculous views of some reporter who surmised that the crabs might be hiding out in the mountains there she said pointing with her finger to a small paragraph at the foot of the page child drinks weedkiller and dies he read an eightyearold girl who drank a solution of paraquat weedkiller last week in her parents garden in surrey died this morning there is no known antidote parents are warned he broke off and suddenly his hand gripped pats until she gasped in pain ouch she snatched her hand away whatevers up cliff its a terrible thing to happen i know but theres no need to paraquat he banged his fist into the palm of his other hand paraquat weedkiller deadly to all forms of life kills through the pores rots the lungs i wonder whatever are you getting at she asked have you taken leave of your senses or something no he rose to his feet and smiled ive only just come to them come on lets go and see grisedale at once weve no time to lose you could be right grisedale observed after he had listened eagerly to cliff davenports theory its worth a try anyway grisedale consulted a wellthumbed telephone directory and then picking up the receiver he dialled a number after some delay he succeeded in being put through to the department he requested the person at the other end of the line listened while the professors theory was repeated good good grisedale sounded well pleased how soon can you have it down here today excellent yes we shall required the sprays as well thank you he replaced the receiver the farm supplies are delivering it at once he was interrupted as the phone jangled again grisedale he barked an expression of irritation on his face an expression which quickly turned to one of amazement and horror good grief right well deploy all available troops right away that he said turning to cliff and pat his face ashen was colonel matthews the crabs are making a daylight raid on arthog not only have they withstood close range fire from a centurion tank but they have also rolled it down into the estuary they are forcing the troops back he crossed to the window and opened it across the estuary they could hear the firing theres only one hope left now cliff murmured slipping an arm around pat i just hope that farm supplies truck gets here before its too late chapter fourteen the toppling of the centurion tank was the signal for the troops to withdraw forsaking their positions along the banks of the estuary if the centurion could not repel the invaders nothing could reinforcements began to arrive just as quickly they fell back the crabs were almost at the station moving slowly the firing ceased as abruptly as it had begun it was just a waste of ammunition between the station and the first houses lay several acres of waste ground mostly it was covered with long grass tinderdry from the scorching of the recent heat wave set fire to that grass colonel matthews roared quickly before they reach it fire doesnt affect them an officer replied at barmouth set fire to it the colonel snarled or else youll find yourself on a charge a match flared the flames licked hungrily at the dry grass the slight breeze fanned it within minutes a wall of fire sprung up in the path of the advancing crabs thatll stop em matthewss laughter was almost maniacal thatll king crab himself was the first to enter the blazing area smoke billowed as he moved he did not even hasten his waddle others began to follow him impossible colonel matthews drew his revolver his hand was shaking as he took aim and the pistol bucked six times he fired and then the hammer was clicking on an empty chamber only then did he order his men to fall back to the road his earlier confidence had abandoned him the driver of the farm supplies lorry from dolgelly cursed as he caught up with the traffic jam he could see the hundreds of cars bumper to bumper snaking in front of him until they disappeared over the brow of the next hill three hundred yards further on lay the toll bridge it was closed two soldiers in khaki uniform carrying rifles stood at the entrance then he saw the blue flashing lights motorcycle police two of them coming towards him slowing when they saw the lettering on the front of his vehicle ok sir they shouted not even bothering to dismount just follow us against the line of oncoming traffic well take the toll bridge road he scratched his head as he let in the clutch god it must be bloody urgent somebody was really getting in a panic over their weeds the man at his side said nothing he was only too well aware what lay ahead of them here it is now the relief was evident in grisedales voice as he saw the lorry with its police escort turning into the small field where the helicopter stood the pilot was leaning against it smoking a cigarette lets get cracking we havent got much time two men began to unload the lorry carrying metal cannisters across to the helicopter a cropsprayer had already been fitted it was only a question of connecting everything up the pilot dropped his cigarette on to the ground and put his foot on it well grisedale said i guess were all set just the four of us we two the pilot and this feller here from farm supplies to work the spray look out crabs here we come two minutes later they were airborne and heading out towards the estuary colonel matthews realised that the road was only their first line of retreat the crabs were still advancing ignoring the village itself this time the creatures were not bent solely on destruction they practically ignored the houses all they wanted was to kill their taste for human flesh overruled everything else the colonel gave another order to retreat this time the troopsmoved inland to have gone down to the beaches at fairbourne would only have been to invite disaster taking the battle to the crabs own domain christ the colonel ejaculated when he saw the packed line of cars which jammed the road beyond the first military barrier the stupid bloody fools he realised immediately how complicated the situation had become their retreat would be hampered by the civilians already people were abandoning their cars and moving back up the road abandon all equipment he ordered move on foot only from now on get a move on the crabs had reached the road now they were barely a quarter of a mile behind the troops and they were turning inland this time they gave no indication that they would be returning to the sea after a quick sortie people began to panic some tried to turn their cars but finding it an impossibility left them and fled on foot soldiers threaded their way between the vehicles in some cases clambering over them the crabs reached the cars there was no hesitation metal crunched as they crushed the vehicles beneath their advance flattening the various models out of all recognition the shooting had stopped even the rawest recruit realised that he was simply wasting ammunition and losing ground by pausing to fire look colonel matthews pointed to a distant speck in the sky theyve sent a bloody helicopter to see whats going on the helicopter was flying low barely skimming the tops of trees and houses great scott grisedale gasped as he saw what was happening below them were only just in time those crabs are barely two hundred yards behind the soldiers another ten minutes and go in low cliff davenport shouted in the pilots ear and then turned to give his instructions to the agricultural engineer who sat patiently at the controls of the spraying equipment let em have it now a fine film of spray gushed from the nozzle of the spraygun for a few seconds a cloud of vapour hung in the air and it began to drift slowly downwards the man increased the pressure the vapour became thicker more condensed thats the stuff cliff davenport cried enthusiastically gripping his seat until his knuckles showed white go down lower make sure the big feller gets it king crab previously unperturbed by any attacks from land sea or air sensed that this was no ordinary puny human assault the spray caught him in the face stinging and almost blinding him the machine hovered only a few feet above him his pincers waved wildly it was almost as if there was something personal in the way he was being attacked even he sensed that he squatted down all his instincts telling him to withdraw into his shell yet he knew he would be finished if he did they had to return to the ocean bed as quickly as possible the advance of the crabs was halted blindly they huddled together for protection it was as if all their resistance had suddenly been destroyed perhaps without their leader they would have stayed and died where they were with a supreme effort king crab turned back and shambled amongst his demoralised followers viciously his pincers struck out striking shell after shell the crabs were shaken out of their lethargy like robots they followed in the wake of the one whom they believed to be the supreme being slowly the column headed back the way it had come claws dragged gouging great scars in the tarmac surface of the road they scarcely gave arthog a glance as they passed by their instincts no longer craved for plunder and carnage survival was all that mattered keep at em cliff davenport shouted above the noise of the helicopter keep spraying em until theyre in the water the most bizarre retreat in the history of warfare shambling clicking crabs the helicopter keeping pace with them barely ten feet above them spraying them with paraquat weedkiller the whole tune past arthog veering to avoid the bridge and then as the monsters sensed the presence of salt water they increased their speed a last desperate effort so that they might die in their own domain king crab remained motionless squatting alone on the bank as his subjects entered the muddy water still in single file and disappeared from view even then he did not move only his glinting eyes gave any sign that he was still alive go in on the bastard cliff shouted give him everything youve got the helicopter went still lower paraquat gushing from the spray the sandycoloured monster crab became covered in foam he rolled over then he righted himself again his evil eyes raised towards the men and the machine responsible for his final overthrow a claw was raised a gesture of defiance an expression of unbelievable malignance he might be thwarted but he refused to concede he moved scarcely able to drag himself down to the edge of the lapping water then he was gone with scarcely a ripple to show that he had ever been cliff davenport turned to the pilot the professors face was lined and haggard but he was smiling we can go home now he said two evenings later cliff davenport pat benson and grisedale dined together at mrs joness hotel in llanbedr on the morrow they would all be returning to london well grisedale started beaming with pleasure as he sipped his coffee and lit a cigarette it seems that paraquat was the answer after all id have preferred to have seen em all lying dead in the roadway but it was not to be the stuff isnt an instant killer i just wish i knew where theyd gone to die just to satisfy myself that theyre really finished weve had divers down but there isnt a trace of them not a single corpse youve heard of the legendary elephants burial ground in africa cliff asked a thoughtful expression on his face people have been searching for it for centuries nobodys ever found it one never comes across a dead elephant either out in the bush theres a place somewhere where they go to die when they know their time is up its the same with these crabs i reckon god knows where they came from in the first place maybe theyve gone back there to die i sincerely hope so grisedale asserted we certainly dont want a second crab war pat yawned cant say ill be sorry to be leaving she said resting her hand on cliffs its had its compensations though id better be getting back grisedale said tactfully he looked at his watch ive got to be on the road early im flying back to belgium again tomorrow evening dont forget to be back in time for the wedding pat reminded him i wont miss that he laughed so long as there are no crab sandwiches at the reception afterwards no fear of that pat grimaced i never want to see another crab again as long as i live ugh next morning as cliff and pat headed back along the coast road the sea was a deep blue scarcely a wave rippled its surface i wonder pat mused i wonder just what lies out there deep down on the seabed cliff dropped his left hand on to her thigh and squeezed it gently perhaps its better not to know he replied the secrets of the deep are better left undisturbed
