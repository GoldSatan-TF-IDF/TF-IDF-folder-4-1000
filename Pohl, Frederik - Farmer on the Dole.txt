farmer on the dole by frederik pohl stretching east to the horizon a thousand acres was all soybeans across the road to the west another thousand acres all corn zeb kicked the irrigation valve moodily and watched the meter register the change in flow damn weather why didnt it rain he sniffed the air deeply and shook his head frowning eightyfive percent relative humidity no closer to eightyseven and not a cloud in the sky from across the road his neighbor called afternoon zeb zeb nodded curtly he was soy and wally was corn and they didnt have much to talk about but you had to show some manners he pulled his bandanna out of his hip pocket and wiped his brow had to rise up the flow he offered for politeness sake me too only good thing cozs up so wes gettin good carbon metabolizin zeb grunted and bent down to pick up a clod of earth crumbling it in his fingers to test for humus breaking off a piece and tasting it cobalts a tad low again he said meditatively but wally wasnt interested in soil chemistry zeb you aint heard anything bout what bout anything you know zeb turned to face him you mean aint i heard no crazy talk bout closin down the farms when everybody knows they cant never do that no i aint heard nothin like that an if i did i wouldnt give it heed yeah zeb but theys sayin they can say whatever they likes wally i aint listenin and i got to get back to the lines fore becky and the kids start worryin evenin nice talkin to you and he turned and marched back toward the cabins uncle tin wally called sneeringly but zeb wouldnt give him the satisfaction of noticing all the same he pulled out his bandanna and mopped his brow again it wasnt sweat zeb never sweated his arms his back his armpits were permanently dry in any weather no matter how hard or how long he worked the glistening film on his forehead was condensed from the air the insulation around the supercooled josephson junctions that made up his brain was good but not perfect when he was doing more thinking than usual the refrigeration units worked harder and zeb was doing a lot of thinking close down the farms why youd have to be crazy to believe that you did your job you tilled the fields and planted them or else you cleaned and cooked in bosss house or taught bosss children or drove miz boss when she went to visit the other bosses wives that was the way things were on the farm and it would go on that way forever wouldnt it zeb found out the answer the next morning right after church since zeb was a class a robot with an effective iq of one hundred thirtyfive though limited in its expression by the builtin constraints of his assigned function he really should not have been surprised especially when he discovered that reverend harmswallow had taken his text that morning from matthew specifically the beatitudes and in particular the one about how the meek would inherit the earth the reverend was a plump pinkfaced man whose best sermons dwelt on the wages of sin and the certainty of hellfire it had always been a disappointment to him that the farmhands who made up his congregation werent physically equipped to sin in any interesting ways but he made up for it by extra emphasis on the importance of being humble even he finished his babyfine hair flying all around his pink scalp when things dont go the way you think they ought to now were going to sing old one hundred and then you soy people will meet in the gymnasium and corn people in the secondfloor lounge your bosses have some news for you so it shouldnt have been surprising and as a matter of fact zeb wasnt surprised at all some part of the cry circuits inside his titanium skull had long noted the portents scant rain falling levels of soil minerals thinning of the topsoil the beans grew fat because there was an abundance of carbon in the air for them to metabolize but no matter how much you irrigated they dried up fast in the hot breezes and those were only the physical signs bosss body language said more sighing when he should have been smiling at the threelegged races behind the big house not even noticing when one of the cabins needed a new coat of whitewash or the flower patches showed a few weeds zeb observed it all and drew the proper conclusions his constraints did not forbid that they only prevented him from speaking of them or even of thinking of them on a conscious level zeb was not programmed to worry it would have interfered with the happy smiling face he bore for boss and miz boss and the chillen so when boss made his announcement zeb looked as thunderstruck as all the other hands youve been really good people boss said generously his pale professorial face incongruous under the plantation straw hat i really wish things could go on as they always have but it just isnt possible its the agricultural support program he explained those idiots in washington have cut it down to the point where it simply isnt worthwhile to plant here anymore his expression brightened but its not all bad youll be glad to know that theyve expanded the soil bank program as a consequence so miz boss and the children and i are well provided for as a matter of fact and he beamed well be a little better off than before moneywise days good oh hebben be praised the doleful expressions broke into grins as the farmhands nudged one another relieved but then zeb spoke up boss scuse my askin but whats gone happen to us folks you gonna keep us on boss looked irritated oh thats impossible we cant collect the soilbank money if we plant so theres just no sense in having all of you around dont you see silence then another farmhand ventured how bout cornpatch boss he need some good workers you know us hates corn but we could get reprogrammed quicks anything boss shook his head hes telling his people the same thing right now nobody needs you the farmhands looked at one another preacher he needs us one of them offered wes his whole congregation im afraid reverend harmswallow doesnt need you anymore boss said kindly because hes been wanting to go into missionary work for some time and hes just received his call no youre superfluous that all superfluous redundant unnecessary theres no reason for you to be here boss told them so trucks will come in the morning to take you all away please be outside your cabins ready to go by ohsevenhundred silence again then zeb where they takes us boss boss shrugged theres probably some place i think then he grinned but ive got a surprise for you miz boss and i arent going to let you go without having a party so tonight were going to have a good oldfashioned square dance with new bandannas for the best dancers and then youre all going to come back to the big house and sing spirituals for us i promise miz boss and the children and i are going to be right there to enjoy it the place they were taken to was a grimy white cinderblock building in des plaines the driver of the truck was a beefy taciturn robot who wore a visored cap and a leather jacket with the sleeves cut off he hadnt answered any of their questions when they loaded onto his truck at the farm and he again answered none when they offloaded in front of a chainlink gate with a sign that read receiving just stand over there he ordered you all out okay and he slapped the tailboard up and drove off leaving them in a gritty misty sprinkle of warm rain and they waited fourteen prime working robots hes and shes and three little ones too dispirited to talk much zeb wiped the moisture off his face and mutttered couldnve rained down where we needed it has to rain up here where it dont do a body no good atall but not all the moisture was rain not zebs and not that on the faces of the others because they were all thinking really hard the only one not despairing was lem the most recent arrival lem had been an estate gardener in urbana until his people decided to emigrate to the oneill space colonies hed been lucky to catch on at the farm when a turnedover tractor created an unexpected vacancy but he still talked wistfully about life in glamorous champaign urbana now he was excited des plaines why thats practically chicago the big time friends state street the loop the gold coast they gone have jobs for us in chicago zeb asked doubtfully jobs why man who cares bout jobs thats chicago well have a ball zeb nodded thoughtfully although he was not convinced he was willing to be hopeful that was part of his programming too he opened his mouth and tasted the drizzle he made a face sour high in particulate matter a lot more carbon dioxide and no than he was used to what kind of a place was this where the rain didnt even taste good it must be cars he thought not sticking to the good old fusion electric power but burning gasoline so all the optimism had faded by the time signs of activity appeared in the cinderblock building cars drove in through another entrance lights went on inside then the corrugatedmetal doorway slid noisily up and a short dark robot came out to unlock the chainlink gate the robot looked the farmers over impassively and opened the gate come on you redundancies he said lets get you reprogrammed when it came zebs turn he was allowed into a white walled room with an ominous sort of plastictopped cot along the wall the rrr or redundancy reprogramming redirector assigned to him was a blonde goodlooking sherobot who wore a white coat and long crystal earrings like tiny chandeliers she sat zeb on the edge of the cot motioned him to lean forward and quickly inserted the redpainted fingernail of her right forefinger into his left ear he quivered as the readonly memory emptied itself into her own internal scanners she nodded youve got a simple profile she said cheerfully well have you out of here in no time open your shirt zebs soilgrimed fingers slowly unbuttoned the flannel shirt before he got to the last button she impatiently pushed his hands aside and pulled it wide the button popped and rolled away youll have to get new clothes anyway she said sinking long scarlet nails into four narrow slits on each side of his rib cage the whole front of his chest came free in her hands the rrr laid it aside and peered at the hookup inside she nodded again no problem she said pulling chips out with quick sure fingers now this will feel funny for a minute and you wont be able to talk but hold still funny it felt to zeb as if the bare room were swirling into spirals and not only couldnt he speak he couldnt remember words or thoughts he was nearly sure that just a moment before he had been wondering whether he would ever again see thethe what he couldnt remember then he felt a gentle sensation of something within him being united to something else not so much a click as the feeling of a foot fitting into a shoe and he was able to complete the question the farm he found he had said the words out loud and the rrr laughed see youre halfreoriented already he grinned back thats really astonishing he declared can you credit it i was almost missing that rural existence as though the charms of bucolic life had any meaning forgood heavens why am i talking like this the sherobot said well you wouldnt want to talk like a farmhand when you live in the big city would you oh granted zeb cried earnestly but one must pose the next question the formalisms of textual grammar the imagery of poetics can one deem them appropriate to my putative new career the rrr frowned its a literarycritic vocabulary store she said defensively look somebody has to use them up but one asks why me its all ive got handy and thats that now youll find there are other changes too im taking out the quantitative soilanalysis chips and the farmmachinery subroutines i could leave you the spirituals and the square dancing if you like why retain the shadow when the substance has fled he said bitterly now zeb she scolded you dont need this specialized stuff thats all behind you and youll never miss it because you dont know yet what great things youre getting in exchange she snapped his chest back in place and said give me your hands one could wish for specifics he grumbled watching suspiciously as the rrr fed his hands into a hole in her control console he felt a tickling sensation why not infrared vision for one thing she said proudly watching the digital readouts on her console so you can see in the dark plus twenty percent hotter circuit breakers in your motor assemblies so youll be stronger and can run faster plus the names and addresses and phone numbers of six good bail bondsmen and the public defender she pulled his hands out of the machine and nodded toward them the grime was scrubbed out of the pores the soil dug out from under the fingernails the calluses smoothed away they were city hands now the hands of someone who had never done manual labor in his life and for what destiny is this new armorarium required zeb asked for your new work its the only vacancy weve got right now but its good work and steady youre going to be a mugger after his first night on the job zeb was amused at his own apprehensions the farm had been nothing like this he was assigned to a weaselfaced herobot named timothy for onthejob training and timothy took the term literally come on kid he said as soon as zeb came to the anteroom where he was waiting and he headed out the door he didnt wait to see whether zeb was following no chainlink gates now zeb had only the vaguest notion of how far chicago was or in which direction but he was pretty sure that it wasnt something you walked to are we going to entrust ourselves to the iron horse he asked with a little tingle of anticipation trains had seemed very glamorous as they went by the farmproduce trains freight trains passenger trains that set a farmhand to wondering where they might be going and what it might be like to get there timothy didnt answer he gave zeb a look that mixed pity and annoyance and contempt as he planted himself in the street and raised a peremptory hand a huge greenandwhite checkered hovercab dug down its braking wheels and screeched to a stop in front of them timothy motioned him in and sat silently next to him while the driver whooshed down kennedy expressway the sights of the suburbs of the city flashed past zebs fascinated eyes they drew up under the marquee of a splashy bright hotel with handsome couples in expensive clothing strolling in and out when timothy threw the taxi driver a bill zeb observed that he did not wait for change timothy did not seem in enough of a hurry to justify the expense of a cab he stood rocking on his toes under the marquee for a minute beaming benignly at the robot tourists then he gave zeb a quick look turned and walked away once again zeb had to be fast to keep up he turned the corner after timothy almost too late to catch the action the weaselfaced robot had backed a welldressed couple into the shadows and he was relieving them of wallet watches and rings when he had everything he faced them to the wall kicked each of them expertly behind a knee joint and as they fell turned and ran soundless in softsoled shoes back to the bright lights he was fast and he was abrupt but by this time zeb had begun to recognize some of the elements of his style he was ready he was following on timothys heels before the robbed couple had begun to scream past the marquee lost in a crowd in front of a theater timothy slowed down and looked at zeb approvingly good reflexes he complimented you got the right kind of class kid youll make out as a soidisant common cutpurse zeb asked somewhat nettled at the other robots peremptory manner timothy looked him over carefully you talk funny he said they stick you with one of those surplus vocabularies again never mind you see how its done zeb hesitated craning his neck to look for pursuit of which there seemed to be none well one might venture that that is correct he said okay now you do it timothy said cheerfully and he steered zeb into the alley for the hotel tourist traps stage door by midnight zeb had committed five felonies of his own had been an accomplice in two more and had watched the smaller robot commit eight singlehanded and the two muggers were dividing their gains in the darkest cornernot very darkof an allnight mcdonalds on north michigan avenue you done good kid timothy admitted expansively for a green kid anyway lets see your share comes to six watches eight pieces of jewelry counting the fake coral necklace you shouldnt have bothered with and looks like six to seven hundred in cash as well as quite a few credit cards zeb said eagerly forget the credit cards you only keep what you can spend or what doesnt have a name on it think youre ready to go out on your own one hesitates to assume such responsibility because youre not so forget it the nights work done timothy seemed to have become actually garrulous bet you cant tell me why i wanted you backing me up those two times one acknowledges a certain incomprehension zeb confessed there is an apparent dichotomy when there were two victims or even three you chose to savage them singlehanded yet for solitary prey you elected to have an accomplice right and you know why you dont so ill tell you you get a he and a she or even two of each and the hes going to think about keeping the she from getting hurt thats the way the program reads so no trouble but those two hes by themselveshell if id gone up against either of those mothers he mightve taken my knife away from me and picked my nose with it you got to understand robot nature kid thats what the job is all about dont you want a big mac or something zeb shifted uncomfortably i should think not thank you he said but the other robot was looking at him knowingly no foodtract subsystems right well my dear timothy in the agricultural environment i inhabited there was no evident need you dont need them now but you ought to have them also liquidintake tanks and maybe an aircycling system so you can smoke cigars and get rid of that faggoty vocabulary they stuck you with youre in a class occupation he said earnestly and you got to live up to your station right no subway trains no counting out the pennies when you get change you dont take change now you dont want to make trouble your first day on the job so well let you go until youve finished a whole week but then you go back to that bleachedblonde threer and well get you straightened out he promised now lets go fence our jewels and stuff and call it a night all in all zeb was quite pleased with himself his pockets lined with big bills he read menus outside fancy restaurants to prepare himself for his newattachments he was looking forward to a career at least as distinguished as timothys own that was his third night on the gold coast he never got a chance at a fourth his last marks of the evening gave him a little argument about parting with a diamond ring so as taught zeb backhanded the he and snarled at the she and used a little more force than usual when he ripped the ring off the finger two minutes later and three blocks away he took a quick look at his loot under a streetlight he recoiled in horror there was a drop of blood on the ring that victim had not been a robot she had been a living true human female being and when he heard all the police sirens in the world coming straight at him he was not in the least surprised you people said the rehab instructor have been admitted to this program because a you have been unemployed for not less than twentyone months b have not fewer than six unexcused absences from your place of training or employment c have a conviction for a felony and are currently on parole or d are of a date of manufacture eighteen or more years past choice of any of the above thats what the regulations say and what they mean she said warming to her work is youre scum scum is hopeless shiftless dangerous a social liability do you all understand that much at least she gazed angrily around the room at her seven students she was short dumpy redhaired with bad skin why they let shes like this one off the production line zeb could not understand he fidgeted in his seat craning his neck to see what his six fellow students were like until her voice crackled at him you with the yellow sweater zeb he finched pardon me madam she said with gloomy satisfaction i know your type youre a typical recidivist lumpenprole you are cant even pay attention to somebody whos trying to help you when your whole future is at stake whatve i got seven of you slugs i can see whats coming i guarantee two of you will drop out without finishing the course and ill ave to expell two more because you skip classes or come in late and the other threell be back on the streets or in the slarnmer in ninety days why do i do it she shook her head and then lifting herself ponderously went to the blackboard and wrote her three commandments on time every day even when you dont want to she turned around leaning on the back of her chair those are your golden rules you slugs youll obey them as gods commandments and dont you forget it youre here to learn how to be responsible socially valuable creations andwhat the skinny old herobot in the seat next to zeb was raising a trembling hand it was easy to see how he qualified for the rehabilitation program he was a thirtyyear old model at least with ball joints in the shoulders and almost no facial mobility at all he quavered what if we just cant teacher i mean like weve got a sudden cryogenic warmup and have to lie down or havent had a lube job or you give me a pain the instructor told him nodding to show that pain was exactly what she had expected from the likes of him those are typical excuses and theyre not going to be accepted in this group now if you have something really wrong with you what you have to do is call up at least two hours before class and get yourself excused is that so hard to remember but you wont do it when push comes to shove because you slugs never do the ancient said obstinately two hours is a pretty long time i cant always tell that far ahead teacher a lot can happen and dont call me teacher she turned back to the board and wrote dr elena mincus bsc ma phd you can call me dr mincus or you can call me maam now pay attention and zeb did because the ten nights in the county jail before he got his hearing and his first offenders parole had convinced him he didnt want to go back there again the noise the crowding the brutality of the jailers there was nothing you could do about that either because some of them were human beings maybe most of them were looked at in a certain way there probably wouldnt even have been a jail if some human beings hadnt wanted to be jail guards what was the sense of punishing a robot by locking him up so he paid attention and kept on paying attention even when dr mincuss lessons were about such irrelevant niceties of civilized employed persons behavior as why you should always participate in an office pool how to stand in line for tickets to a concert and what to do at a company christmas party not all of his classmates were so well behaved the little ancient next to him gave very little trouble being generally sunk in gloom but the two sherobots the ones with the beaded handbags and the miniskirts richly deserved to be the ones to fulfill dr mincuss statistical predictions by being expelled from the course the one with the green eye makeup snickered at almost everything the instructor said and made faces behind her back the one with the black spitcurl across her forehead gossiped with the other students and even dared to talk back to the teacher reprimanded for whispering she said lazily hell lady this whole things a shuck aint it what are you doing it for dr mincuss voice trembled with indignation and with the satisfaction of someone who sees her gloomiest anticipations realized for what why because im trained in psychiatric social work and because its what i want to do and because im a human being and dont any of you ever let that get out of your mind the course had some real advantages zeb discovered when he was ordered back to the robot replacement depot for new fittings the blonde rrr muttered darkly to herself as she pulled pieces out of his chest and thrust others in when he could talk again he thanked her suddenly aware that now we had an appetite a real appetite he wanted food which meant that some of those new pieces included a whole digestive systemand that she had muted the worst part of his overdainty vocabulary she pursed her lips and didnt answer while she clamped him up again but then he discovered too that it did not relieve him of his duties they think because youre handicapped the r r r smirked youre forced to get into trouble so now youve got all this firstrate equipment and if you want to know what i think i think its wasted the bums in that class always revert to type she told him and if you want to try td be the exception to the rules youre going to have to apply yourself when youre back on the job mugging what else are you fit for although she added pensively twisting the crystal that dangled from her right ear around a fingertip i did have an opening for a freshman english composition teacher if i hadnt replaced your vocabulary unit ill take mugging please she shrugged might as well but you cant expect that good a territory again you know not after what you did so rain or dry zeb spent every six pm to midnight lurking around the old robert taylor houses relieving old shes of their rent money and old hes of whatever pitiful possessions were in their pockets once in a while he crossed to the illinois institute of technology campus on the trail of some nightschool student or professor but he was always careful to ask them whether they were robot or human before he touched them the next offense he knew would allow him no parole there was no freespending taxi money from such pickings but on nights when zeb made his quota early he would sometimes take the bus to the loop or the gold coast livice he saw timothy but the little robot after one look of disgustturned away now and then he would drift down to amalfi amadeus park along the lakefront where green grass and hedges reminded him of the good old days in the soy fields but the urge to chew samples of soil was too strong and the frustration over not being able to too keen so he would drift back to the bright lights and the crowds try as he might zeb could not really tell which of the welldressed figures thronging water tower place and lake shore drive were humans clinging to life on the planet earth instead of living in one of the fashionable orbital colonies and which were robots as signed to swell the crowds nor was dr mincus any help when he dared to put up a hand in class to ask her she was outraged tell the difference you mean you dont know the difference between a human person and a hunk of machinery that doesnt have any excuse for existence except to do the things people dont want to do and help them enjoy doing the things they do holy god zeb when i think of all the time i put in learning to be empathetic and patient and supportive with you creeps it just turns my stomach now pay attention while i try to show you heslugs the difference between dressing like a human person of good taste and dressing like a pimp at the end of the class lori the hooker with the green eye shadow thrust her arm through his and commiserated old bitchs giving you a hard time hon i almost got right up and told her to leave you alone would have too if i wasnt just one black mark from getting kicked out already well thanks lori now that zeb had a set of biochemical accessories suitable for a city dandy rather than a farmhand he discovered that she wore heavy doses of perfumemusk his diagnostic sensors told him with trace amounts of hibiscus bergamot and extract of vanilla smelling perfume was not at all like sniffing out the levels of co ozone water vapor and particulate matter in the air over the soy fields it made him feel quite uncomfortable he let her tug him through the front door and she smiled up at him i knew wed get along real well if youd only loosen up a little sweetie do you like to dance zeb explored his asyetunpracticed stores of skills why yes i think i do he said surprised listen why dont we go somewhere where we can just sit and get to know each other you know well lori i certainly wish we could but im supposed to get down to my territory down southside right thats just fine she cried squeezing his arm because i know a really great place right near there come on nobodys going to violate you for starting a teeny bit late one night flag that taxi why dont you the really great place was a low ceanentblock building that had once been a garage it stood on a corner facing a shopping center that had seen better days and the liquid crystal sign over the door read southside shelter and community center god loves you its a church zeb cried joyously his mind flooding with memory of the happy days when he sang in reverend harmswallows choir well sort of a church lori conceded as she paid the cabbie they dont bother you much though come on in and meet the gang and youll see for yourself the place was not really that much of a church zeb observed it was more like the secondfloor lounge over reverend harmswallows main meeting room back on the farm even more likehe rummaged through his new data stores a neighborhood social club trestle tables were scattered around a large low room with folding chairs around the tables a patch in the middle of the room had been left open for dancing and at least a dozen hes and shes were using it for that the place was crowded most of the inhabitants were a lot more like zebs fellow rehab students than like reverend harmswallows congregation a tiredlooking fadedlooking female was drowsing over a table of religious tracts by the door in spite of a blast of noise that made zebs auditorygaincontrol cut in at once there were no other signs of religiosity present the noise turned out to be heavily amplified music from a tenpiece band with six singers studying the musicians carefully zeb decided that at least some of them were human too was that the purpose of the place to give the humans an audience for their talents or an outlet for their spiritual benevolence very likely he decided but he could not see that it affected the spirit of the crowd besides the dancers there were groups playing cards clots of robots talking animatedly among themselves sometimes laughing sometimes deeply earnest sometimes shouting at one another in fury as they entered a short skinny he looked up from one of the earnest groups seated around a table it was timothy and a side of timothy that zeb had not seen before impassioned angry and startled zeb how come youre here hello timothy zeb was cautious but the other robot seemed really pleased to see him he pulled out a chair beside him and patted it but loris hand on zebs aim held him back hey man we going to dance or not lady said timothy go dance with somebody else for a while i want zeb to meet my friends this big fellows milt then theres harry alexandra walter x the kids sally and this ones sue weve got a kind of a discussion group going zeb lori said but zeb shook his head ill dance in a minute he said looking around the table as he sat down it was an odd group the one called sally had the form of a sixyearold but the patches and welds that marred her face and arms showed a long history the others were of all kinds big and little new and old but they had one thing in common none of them were smiling neither was timothy if the gladness to see zeb was real it did not show in expression excuse me for mentioning it zeb said but the last time we ran into each other you didnt act all that friendly timothy added embarrassment to the other expressions he wore it was a considerable tribute to his facial flexibility that was then he said then was only three nights ago zeb pointed out yeah things change timothy explained and the hulk he had called milt leaned toward zeb the exploited have to stick together zeb milt said the burden of oppression makes us all brothers and sisters tiny sally piped up sisters too right were all rejects together and all we got to look forward to is recycling or the stockpile ask timothy here couple nights ago when he first came here he was as excuse me zeb as ignorant as you are he cant be blamed for that any more than you can you come off the line and they slide their programming into you and you try to be a good robot because thats what theyve told you to want we all went through that timothy had been nodding eagerly now as he looked past zeb his face fell oh god shes back he said it was lori returning from the bar with two foaming tankards of beer you got two choices zeb she said you can dance or you can go home alone zeb hesitated taking a quick sip of the beer to stall for time he was not so rich in friends that he wanted to waste any and yet there was something going on at this table that he wanted to know more about well zeb she demanded ominously he took another swallow of the beer it was an interesting sensation the cold gassy liquid sliding down his new neck piping and thudding into the storage tank in his right hip the chemosensors in the storage tank registered the alcoholic content and put a tiny bias on his propriocentric circuits so that the music buzzed in his ear and the room seemed brighter good stuff lori he said his words suddenly a little thick you said you could dance zeb she said time you showed me timothy looked exasperated oh go ahead get her off your back then come back and well pick it up from there yes he could dance damn he could dance up a storm he discovered subroutines he had not known he had been given the waltz the lindy the monkey a score of steps with names and a whole set of heuristic circuits that let him improvise and whatever he did lori followed as good as he youre great he panted in her ear you ever think of going professional what the hell do you mean by that zeb she demanded i mean as a dancer oh yeah well thats kind of what i was programmed for in the first place but theres no work human beings do it when they want to and sometimes you can catch on with a ballet company or maybe a nightclub chorus line when they organize one but then they get bored you see and then theres no more job how bout another beer big boy they sat out a set or rather stood it out bellied up to the crowded bar while zeb looked around this is a funny place he said although actually he recognized it could have been the funny feelings in all his sensors and actuators that made it seem so whos that ugly old lady by the door lori glanced over the top of her tankard it was a female sitting at a card table loaded with what even at this distance clearly were religious tracts part of the staff dont worry bout her by this time every night shes drunk anyway zeb shook his head repelled by the fat the pallid skin the stringy hair you wonder why they make robots as badlooking as that he commented robot hell she aint no robot shes real flesh and blood this is how she gets her kicks you know if it wasnt for her and maybe half a dozen other human beings who think theyre dogooders there wouldnt be any community center here at all about ready to dance some more zeb was concentrating on internal sensations he had never experienced before well actually he said uneasily i feel a little funny he put his hand over his hip tank dont know what it is exactly but its kind of like i had a powerstore failure you know and it all swelled up inside me only thats not where my power store is lori giggled you just arent used to drinking beer are you hon you got to decant thats all see that door over there marked he you just go in there and if you cant figure out what to do you just ask somebody to help you zeb didnt have to ask for help however the process was all new to him and it did require a lot of trial and error so it was some time before he came back into the noisy crowded room lori was spinning around the room with a big darkskinned he which relieved zeb of that obligation he ordered a round of beers and took them back to the table somebody was missing but otherwise they didnt seem to have changed position at all wheres the little she zeb asked setting the beers down for all of them sally shes gone off panhandling probably halfway to amadeus park by now toying with his beer zeb said uneasily you know maybe i better be getting along too soon as i get this down the he named walter x sneered slave mentality whats it going to get you well ive got a job to do zeb said defensively job timothy told us what your job was walter x took a deep draft of the beer and went on theres not one of us in this whole place has a real job if we did we wouldnt be here stands to reason look at me i used to chop salt in the detroit mines now theyve put in automatic diggers and im redundant and milt here he was constructed for the iron mines up around lake superior dont tell me they dont mine iron zeb objected how else would they build us milt shook his head not around the lake they dont its all out in space now theyve got these von neumann automata not even real robots at all they just go out to the asteroid belt and ship off ore and refine it and build duplicates of themselves and then they come back to the works in lowearth orbit and hop right into the smelter hows a robot going to compete with that see zeb timothy put in its a tough world for a robot and thats the truth zeb took a reflective pull at his beer yes he said but see i dont know how it could be any better for us you know i mean they built us after all we have do what they want us to do oh sure cried the she named sue we do that all right we do all the work for them and half the play too were the ones that fill the concert hall when one of them wants to sing some kind of dumb latvian art songs or something god ive done that so many times i just never want to hear about another birch tree again we work in the factories and farms and mines used to zeb said wistfully used to right and now that they dont need us for that they make us fill up their damn cities so the humans left on earth wont feel so lonesome were a hobby zeb thats all we are yeah but oh hell sneered walter x you know what you are youre part of the problem you dont care about robot rights robot rights zeb repeated he understood the meaning of the words perfectly of course but it had never occurred to him to put them together in that context it tasted strange on his lips exactly our right not to be mistreated and abused you think we want to be here in a place like this with all this noise no its just so people like her can get their jollies he said angrily jerking his head at the nodding fat woman by the door the she named alexandra drained the last of her beer and ventured well really walter i kind of like it here im not in the same class as you heavy thinkers i know im not really political its just that sometimes honestly i could just scream so its either a place like this or i go up to amadeus park with sally and the other alcoholics and drifters and bums speaking of which she added leaning toward timothy if youre not going to drink your beer id just as soon the little robot passed it over silently and zeb observed for the first time that it was untouched whats the matter timothy he asked why does something have to be the matter i just dont want any beer but last week you saidoh my god zeb cried as revelation burst inside his mind youve lost your drink circuits havent you suppose i have timothy demanded fiercely and then he softened oh its not your fault he said moodily just more of the same thing i had an accident what kind of accident zeb asked repelled and fascinated timothy traced designs in the damp rings that his untouched beer glass had left on the table three nights ago he said i had a good night i scored four people at once coming out of a hotel on east erie a really big haulthey mustve been programmed to be rich alcoholics because they were loaded all ways loaded then when i was getting away i crossed michigan against the light andjesus he shuddered without looking up this bigwheeled car came out of nowhere came screeching around the corner never even slowed down and there i was in the street you got run over you mean that messed up your drinking subsystems oh hell no not just that it was worse it crushed my legs you see i mean just scrap metal so the ambulance came and they raced me of to the hospital but of course after i was there since i was a robot they didnt do any thing for me just shot me out the back door into a van and they took me to rehab for new legs only that blonde bitch he sobbed that threer she with the dimestore earrings if zebs eyes had been capable of tears they would have been brimming come on timothy he urged spit it out she had a better idea too many muggers anyway she said not enough cripples so she got me a little wheeled cart and a tin cup and all the special stuff i had the drinking and eating and all the rest i wouldnt need them anymore she said and besides she wanted the space for other facilities zeb i play the violin now and i dont mean i play it well i play it so bad i cant even stand to listen to myself and she wants me on michigan avenue every day in front of the stores playing my fiddle and begging zeb stared in horror at his friend then suddenly he pushed back his chair and peered under he table it was true timothys legs ended in black leather caps halfway down the thighs and a thing like a paddedwheeled pallet was propped against the table leg beside him alexandra patted his hand as he came back up its really bad when you first get the picture she said i know what you need is another beer zeb and thank god youve got the circuits to use it since zeb was not programmed for full alcoholismnot yet anyway he told himself with a sobhe was not really drunk but he was fuzzy in mind and in action as he finally left the community center he was appalled to see that the sky right above the lake was already beginning to lighten the night was almost over and he had not scored a single victim he would have to take the first robot that came along the first halfdozen in fact if he were to meet his quota and there simply was not time to get to his proper station at the robert taylor houses he would have to make do with whoever appeared he stared around getting his bearings and observed that around the corner from the community center there was a lighted swinging sign that said robots rest mission that was the outfit that kept the community center open he knew and there was a tall prosperous looking he coming out of the door zeb didnt hesitate he stepped up pulled out his knife and pressed it to the victims belly hard enough to be felt without penetrating your money or your life he growled reaching for the wristwatch then the victim turned his head and caught the light on his features it was a face zeb knew reverend harmswallow he gasped oh my god the minister fixed him with a baleful look i cant claim that much he said but maybe im close enough for the purpose my boy youre damned for good now zeb didnt make a conscious decision he simply turned and ran if he hadnt had the alcohol content fuzzing his systems he might not have bothered because he knew without having to think about it that it was no use there werent many places to run he couldnt run back to the robert taylor houses his assigned workplace they would look for him there first not back to the community center not with harmswallow just around the corner not to the rehab station because that was just the same as walking right into jail not anywhere in fact where there were likely to be police or human beings of any kind and that meant not anywhere in the world because wherever he problems but now looking down at the wistful littlegirl face he was touched around the table in the community center she had just been one more stranger now she reminded him of glenda the little she from the cabin next to his back on the farm but in spite of her age design sally was obviously quite an old robot from the faint smoky odor that came to him through the drizzly air he realized she was fuelcellpowered half a century old at least he emptied his pockets get yourself some new parts kid he said hoarsely gee thanks zeb she sobbed then added watch it she drew him into the shelter of a dripping shrub a park police hovercar whooshed slowly by all lights off windshield wipers slapping back and forth across the glass sides glistening in the wet zeb retreated into the shadows but the police were just keeping an eye on the parks drifters losers and vagrants as the hovercar disappeared around a curve in the path the drifters losers and vagrants began to emerge from the underbrush zeb looked around warily he hadnt realized until then how many of them there were what are you doing here zeb she asked i had a little trouble he said then shrugged hopelessly what was the point of trying to keep it a secret i went out to mug somebody and i got a human being by mistake oh wow can he identify you unfortunately i used to know him so yesno you keep it he added quickly as she made as if to return the money he had given her money wont help me now she nodded soberly i wouldnt do it but oh zeb im trying to save for a whole new chassis see i cant tell you how much i want to grow up but every time i ask for a new body they say the central nervous array isnt really worth salvaging all i wants a mature form you know like hips and boobs but they wont let me have a mature form say theres more openings for juveniles anyway but what i want to know is if there are all those openings why dont they find me one when was the last time you worked regular zeb asked oh my godyears ago i had a nice spot for a long time pupil in a preprimary school that some human person wanted to teach in that was all right she didnt really like me though because i didnt have all the fixtures you know when she was teaching things like toilettraining and covering coughs and sneezes shed always give me this dirty look but i could handle the cookies and milk all right she went on dreamily and i really liked the games so what went wrong ohthe usual thing she got tired of teaching run robot see the robot run so she went for a progressive school all about radical movements and peace marches i was doing real good at it too then one day we came in and she told us we were too juvenile for the kind of classes she wanted to teach and there we were eighteen of us out on the streets since then its been nothing but rotten she glanced up wiping the rain out of her eyesor the tearsas the purse vendor approached we dont want to buy anything hymie nobody does he said bitterly but there was sympathy in his eyes as he studied zeb you got real trouble dont you i can always tell zeb shrugged hopelessly and told him about the reverend harmswallow the vendors eyes widened oh god he said he beckoned to one of the dope pushers hear that this guy just mugged a human beingsecond offense too man thats a real heavy one you know he turned and called to his partner down the walk we got a twotime person mugger here marcus and in a minute there were a dozen robots standing around glancing apprehensively at zeb and whispering among themselves zeb didnt have to hear what they were saying he could figure it out keep away from me he offered youll just get mixed up in my trouble sally piped suddenly if its your trouble its everybodys trouble we have to stick together in union there is strength what zeb demanded its something i remember from you know just before i got kicked out of the progressive school in union there is strength its what they used to say union snarled the pitchman gesturing with his tray of allleather purses dont tell me about unions that was what i was supposed to be union organizer united openpit mine workers local threethreeeight and then they closed down the mines so what was i supposed to do they made me a sidewalk pitchman he stared at his tray of merchandise then violently flung it into the shrubbery havent sold one in two months whats the use of kidding myself if you dont get along with the rehab robots you might as well be stockpiled its all politics sally looked thoughtful for a moment then pulled something out of her data stores listen to this one she called the strikess your weapon boys the hell with politics zeb repeated the strikes your weapon boys the hell with politics hey that doesnt sound bad thats not all she said her stiff poorly automated lips were working as she rehearsed material from her data storage here we all ought to stick together because in union there is strength and lets see solidarity is forever no thats not right wait a minute hymie cried i know that one its a song solidarity forever solidarity forever solidarity forever for the union makes us strong that was in my basic data store gosh he said his eyes dreamy i hadnt though of that one in years zeb looked around nervously there were nearly thirty robots in the group now and while it was rather pleasant to be part of this fraternity of the discarded it might also be dangerous people in cars were slowing down to peer at them as they went past on the drive were attracting attention he offered maybe we ought to move but wherever they moved more and more people stopped to watch them and more and more robots appeared to join their procession it wasnt just the derelicts from amadeus park now shes shopping along the lakefront stores darted across the street convention delegates in the doorways of the big hotels stood watching and sometimes broke ranks to join them they were blocking traffic and blaring horns added to the noise of the robots singing and shouting i got another one sally called to him across the front of the group the workers justice is the strike zeb thought for a moment itd be better if it was the robots justice is the strike what the robots justice is the strike he yelled and he could hear robots in the rear ranks repeating it when they said it all together it sounded even better and others caught the idea hymie screamed lets try this one jobs not stockpiling dont throw us on the scrap heap all together now and zeb was inspired to make up a new one give the humans rehab schools we want jobs and they all agreed that was the best of the lot with a hundred fifty robots shouting it at once the last three words drummed out like cannon fire it raised echoes from the building fronts and heads popped out of windows they were not all robots there were dozens of humans in the windows and on the streets some laughing some scowling some looking almost frightenedas if human beings ever had anything to be frightened of and one of them stared incredulously right at zeb zeb stumbled and missed a step on one side hymie grabbed his arm on the other he reached out and caught the hand of a robot whose name he didnt even know he turned his head to see over this shoulder the solid ranks of robots behind him now two hundred at least and turned back to the human being nice to see you again reverend harmswallow he called and marched on arm in arm the front rank steady as it wentright up to the corner of state street where the massed ranks of police cars hissed as they waited for them zeb lay on the floor of the bullpen he was not alone half the hes from the impromptu parade were crowded into the big cell with him along with the days usual catch of felons and misdemeanants the singing and the shouting were over even the regular criminals were quieter than usual the mood in the pen was despairing though from time to time one of his comrades would lean down to say it was great while it lasted zeb or were all with you you know but with him in what recycling more rehab training maybe a long stretch in the big house downstate where the human guards were said to get their jollies out of making prisoners fight each other for power cells a toe caught him on the hip on your feet mac it was a guard big burly black with a nightstick swinging at his hip the very model of a brutal jail guardmodel twentysix fortyseven zeb thought at least somewhere in the twentysix hundred series he reached down with a hand like a cabbage and pulled zeb to his feet the rest of you can go home he roared opening the pen door you mac you come with me he led zeb through the police station to a waiting hovertruck with the words rehab division painted on its side thrust zeb inside and startlingly just as he closed the doors gave zeb a wink queerly that lifted zebs spirits even the pigs were moved but the tiny elation did not last zeb clung to the side of the van peering out at the grimy warehouses and the factories and expressway exit ramps that once had seemed so glamorous but now were merely drab depression flowed back into him he would probably never see these places again next step was the stockpileif they didnt melt him down and start over again the best he could hope for was reassignment to one of the bottom level jobs for robots nothing as good as mugging or panhandling something in the sticks no doubt squatting in blankets to entertain tourist in arizona maybe or sitting on a bridge with a fishing pole in florida but he strode to the rehab building with his head erect and his courage lasted right up to the moment when he entered the blonde threers office and saw that she was not alone reverend harmswallow was seated at her desk and the blonde herself was standing next to him give me your ear she ordered hardly looking up from the crt on the desk that both she and harmswallow were studying and when she had input his data she nodded her crystal earrings swinging wildly he wont need much reverend she said fawning on the human minister a little more gain in the speaking systems allweather protection for the exterior surfaces maybe armor plate for the skull and facial structures harmswallow to zebs surprise and concern was beaming he looked up from the crt and inspected zeb carefully and some restructuring of the facialexpression modes i should think he ought to look fiercer wouldnt you say absolutely reverend you have a marvelous eye for this kind of thing yes i do harmswallow admitted well ill leave the rest to you i want to see about the design changes for the young female i feel so fulfilled you know i think this is the sort of career ive been looking for all my life really chaplain to a dedicated striking force leader in the battle for right and justice he gazed raptly into space then collecting himself nodded to the rehab officer and departed although the room was carefully airconditioned zebs josephson junctions were working hard enough to pull moisture out of the air he could feel the beads of condensation forming on his forehead and temples i know what youre doing he sneered war games youre going to make me a soldier and hope that i get so smashed up ill be redlined the blonde stared at him war games what an imagination you have zeb furiously he dashed the beads of moisture off his face it wont work he cried robots have rights i may fall but a million others will stand firm behind me she shook her head admiringly zeb youre a great satisfaction to me youre practically perfect just as you are for your new job cant you figure out what it is he shrugged angrily i suppose youre going to tell me take it or leave it thats the way its going to be right but you will like it zeb after all its a brandnew mechanical occupational specialty and i didnt invent it you invented it for yourself youre going to be a protest organizer zeb organizing demonstrations leading marches sitins boycotts confrontationsthe whole spectrum of mass action zeb he stared at her mass action absolutely why the humans are going to love you zeb you saw reverend harmswallow itll be just like old times with a few of you rabble rousers livening up the scene rabble rouser it felt as if his circuits were stuck rabble rouser demonstration organizer crusader for robot rights and justice he sat quiet and compliant while she expertly unhooked his chest panel and replaced a few chips unprotesting as he was buttoned up again and his new systems were run against the test board unresisting while makeup and cosmetic repair restructured his facial appearance but his mind was racing rabble rouser while he waited for transportation back to the city to take up his new mos his expression was calm but inside he was exulting he would do the job well indeed no rabble needed rousing more than his and he was just the robot for the job
