the author of beltraffio chapter i much as i wished to see him i had kept my letter of introduction three weeks in my pocketbook i was nervous and timid about meeting him conscious of youth and ignorance convinced that he was tormented by strangers and especially by my countrypeople and not exempt from the suspicion that he had the irritability as well as the dignity of genius moreover the pleasure if it should occur for i could scarcely believe it was near at hand would be so great that i wished to think of it in advance to feel it there against my breast not to mix it with satisfactions more superficial and usual in the little game of new sensations that i was playing with my ingenuous mind i wished to keep my visit to the author of beltraffio as a trumpcard it was three years after the publication of that fascinating work which i had read over five times and which now with my riper judgement i admire on the whole as much as ever this will give you about the date of my first visit of any duration to england for you will not have forgotten the commotion i may even say the scandal produced by mark ambients masterpiece it was the most complete presentation that had yet been made of the gospel of art it was a kind of aesthetic warcry people had endeavoured to sail nearer to truth in the cut of their sleeves and the shape of their sideboards but there had not as yet been among english novels such an example of beauty of execution and intimate importance of theme nothing had been done in that line from the point of view of art for art that served me as a fond formula i may mention when i was twentyfive how much it still serves i wont take upon myself to say especially as the discerning reader will be able to judge for himself i had been in england briefly a twelvemonth before the time to which i began by alluding and had then learned that mr ambient was in distant landswas making a considerable tour in the east so that there was nothing to do but to keep my letter till i should be in london again it was of little use to me to hear that his wife had not left england and was with her little boy their only child spending the period of her husbands absence a good many months at a small place they had down in surrey they had a house in london but actually in the occupation of other persons all this i had picked up and also that mrs ambient was charming my friend the american poet from whom i had my introduction had never seen her his relations with the great man confined to the exchange of letters but she wasnt after all though she had lived so near the rose the author of beltraffio and i didnt go down into surrey to call on her i went to the continent spent the following winter in italy and returned to london in may my visit to italy had opened my eyes to a good many things but to nothing more than the beauty of certain pages in the works of mark ambient i carried his productions about in my trunk they are not as you know very numerous but he had preluded to beltraffio by some exquisite things and i used to read them over in the evening at the inn i used profoundly to reason that the man who drew those characters and wrote that style understood what he saw and knew what he was doing this is my sole ground for mentioning my winter in italy he had been there much in former years he was saturated with what painters call the feeling of that classic land he expressed the charm of the old hillcities of tuscany the look of certain lonely grassgrown places which in the past had echoed with life he understood the great artists he understood the spirit of the renaissance he understood everything the scene of one of his earlier novels was laid in rome the scene of another in florence and i had moved through these cities in company with the figures he set so firmly on their feet this is why i was now so much happier even than before in the prospect of making his acquaintance at last when i had dallied with my privilege long enough i despatched to him the missive of the american poet he had already gone out of town he shrank from the rigour of the london season and it was his habit to migrate on the first of june moreover i had heard he was this year hard at work on a new book into which some of his impressions of the east were to be wrought so that he desired nothing so much as quiet days that knowledge however didnt prevent me cet age est sans pitie from sending with my friends letter a note of my own in which i asked his leave to come down and see him for an hour or two on some day to be named by himself my proposal was accompanied with a very frank expression of my sentiments and the effect of the entire appeal was to elicit from the great man the kindest possible invitation he would be delighted to see me especially if i should turn up on the following saturday and would remain till the monday morning we would take a walk over the surrey commons and i could tell him all about the other great man the one in america he indicated to me the best train and it may be imagined whether on the saturday afternoon i was punctual at waterloo he carried his benevolence to the point of coming to meet me at the little station at which i was to alight and my heart beat very fast as i saw his handsome face surmounted with a soft wideawake and which i knew by a photograph long since enshrined on my mantelshelf scanning the carriagewindows as the train rolled up he recognised me as infallibly as i had recognised himself he appeared to know by instinct how a young american of critical pretensions rash youth would look when much divided between eagerness and modesty he took me by the hand and smiled at me and said you must be a you i think and asked if i should mind going on foot to his house which would take but a few minutes i remember feeling it a piece of extraordinary affability that he should give directions about the conveyance of my bag i remember feeling altogether very happy and rosy in fact quite transported when he laid his hand on my shoulder as we came out of the station i surveyed him askance as we walked together i had already i had indeed instantly seen him as all delightful his face is so well known that i neednt describe it he looked to me at once an english gentleman and a man of genius and i thought that a happy combination there was a brush of the bohemian in his fineness you would easily have guessed his belonging to the artist guild he was addicted to velvet jackets to cigarettes to loose shirtcollars to looking a little dishevelled his features which were firm but not perfectly regular are fairly enough represented in his portraits but no portrait i have seen gives any idea of his expression there were innumerable things in it and they chased each other in and out of his face i have seen people who were grave and gay in quick alternation but mark ambient was grave and gay at one and the same moment there were other strange oppositions and contradictions in his slightly faded and fatigued countenance he affected me somehow as at once fresh and stale at once anxious and indifferent he had evidently had an active past which inspired one with curiosity yet what was that compared to his obvious future he was just enough above middle height to be spoken of as tall and rather lean and long in the flank he had the friendliest frankest manner possible and yet i could see it cost him something it cost him small spasms of the selfconsciousness that is an englishmans last and dearest treasure the thing he pays his way through life by sacrificing small pieces of even as the gallant but moneyless adventurer in quentin durward broke off links of his brave gold chain he had been thirtyeight years old at the time beltraffio was published he asked me about his friend in america about the length of my stay in england about the last news in london and the people i had seen there and i remember looking for the signs of genius in the very form of his questions and thinking i found it i liked his voice as if i were somehow myself having the use of it there was genius in his house too i thought when we got there there was imagination in the carpets and curtains in the pictures and books in the garden behind it where certain old brown walls were muffled in creepers that appeared to me to have been copied from a masterpiece of one of the preraphaelites that was the way many things struck me at that time in england as reproductions of something that existed primarily in art or literature it was not the picture the poem the fictive page that seemed to me a copy these things were the originals and the life of happy and distinguished people was fashioned in their image mark ambient called his house a cottage and i saw afterwards he was right for if it hadnt been a cottage it must have been a villa and a villa in england at least was not a place in which one could fancy him at home but it was to my vision a cottage glorified and translated it was a palace of art on a slightly reduced scale and might besides have been the dearest haunt of the old english genius loci it nestled under a cluster of magnificent beeches it had little creaking lattices that opened out of or into pendent mats of ivy and gables and old red tiles as well as a general aspect of being painted in watercolours and inhabited by people whose lives would go on in chapters and volumes the lawn seemed to me of extraordinary extent the gardenwalls of incalculable height the whole air of the place delightfully still private proper to itself my wife must be somewhere about mark ambient said as we went in we shall find her perhaps weve about an hour before dinner she may be in the garden ill show you my little place we passed through the house and into the grounds as i should have called them which extended into the rear they covered scarce three or four acres but like the house were very old and crooked and full of traces of long habitation with inequalities of level and little flights of steps mossy and cracked were these which connected the different parts with each other the limits of the place cleverly dissimulated were muffled in the great verdurous screens they formed as i remember a thick loose curtain at the further end in one of the folds of which as it were we presently made out from afar a little group ah there she is said mark ambient and she has got the boy he noted that last fact in a slightly different tone from any in which he yet had spoken i wasnt fully aware of this at the time but it lingered in my ear and i afterwards understood it is it your son i inquired feeling the question not to be brilliant yes my only child hes always in his mothers pocket she coddles him too much it came back to me afterwards too the sound of these critical words they werent petulant they expressed rather a sudden coldness a mechanical submission we went a few steps further and then he stopped short and called the boy beckoning to him repeatedly dolcino come and see your daddy there was something in the way he stood still and waited that made me think he did it for a purpose mrs ambient had her arm round the childs waist and he was leaning against her knee but though he moved at his fathers call she gave no sign of releasing him a lady apparently a neighbour was seated near her and before them was a gardentable on which a teaservice had been placed mark ambient called again and dolcino struggled in the maternal embrace but too tightly held he after two or three fruitless efforts jerked about and buried his head deep in his mothers lap there was a certain awkwardness in the scene i thought it odd mrs ambient should pay so little attention to her husband but i wouldnt for the world have betrayed my thought and to conceal it i began loudly to rejoice in the prospect of our having tea in the garden ah she wont let him come said my host with a sigh and we went our way till we reached the two ladies he mentioned my name to his wife and i noticed that he addressed her as my dear very genially without a trace of resentment at her detention of the child the quickness of the transition made me vaguely ask myself if he were perchance henpecked a shocking surmise which i instantly dismissed mrs ambient was quite such a wife as i should have expected him to have slim and fair with a long neck and pretty eyes and an air of good breeding she shone with a certain coldness and practised in intercourse a certain bland detachment but she was clothed in gentleness as in one of those vaporous redundant scarves that muffle the heroines of gainsborough and romney she had also a vague air of race justified by my afterwards learning that she was connected with the aristocracy i have seen poets married to women of whom it was difficult to conceive that they should gratify the poetic fancy women with dull faces and glutinous minds who were none the less however excellent wives but there was no obvious disparity in mark ambients union my hostess so far as she could be called so delicate and quiet in a white dress with her beautiful child at her side was worthy of the author of a work so distinguished as beltraffio round her neck she wore a black velvet ribbon of which the long ends tied behind hung down her back and to which in front was attached a miniature portrait of her little boy her smooth shining hair was confined in a net she gave me an adequate greeting and dolcino i thought this small name of endearment delightful took advantage of her getting up to slip away from her and go to his father who seized him in silence and held him high for a long moment kissing him several times i had lost no time in observing that the child not more than seven years old was extraordinarily beautiful he had the face of an angel the eyes the hair the smile of innocence the more than mortal bloom there was something that deeply touched that almost alarmed in his beauty composed one would have said of elements too fine and pure for the breath of this world when i spoke to him and he came and held out his hand and smiled at me i felt a sudden strange pity for him quite as if he had been an orphan or a changeling or stamped with some social stigma it was impossible to be in fact more exempt from these misfortunes and yet as one kissed him it was hard to keep from murmuring all tenderly poor little devil though why one should have applied this epithet to a living cherub is more than i can say afterwards indeed i knew a trifle better i grasped the truth of his being too fair to live wondering at the same time that his parents shouldnt have guessed it and have been in proportionate grief and despair for myself i had no doubt of his evanescence having already more than once caught in the fact the particular infant charm thats as good as a deathwarrant the lady who had been sitting with mrs ambient was a jolly ruddy personage in velveteen and limp feathers whom i guessed to be the vicars wife our hostess didnt introduce me and who immediately began to talk to ambient about chrysanthemums this was a safe subject and yet there was a certain surprise for me in seeing the author of beltraffio even in such superficial communion with the church of england his writings implied so much detachment from that institution expressed a view of life so profane as it were so independent and so little likely in general to be thought edifying that i should have expected to find him an object of horror to vicars and their ladies of horror repaid on his own part by any amount of effortless derision this proved how little i knew as yet of the english people and their extraordinary talent for keeping up their forms as well as of some of the mysteries of mark ambients hearth and home i found afterwards that he had in his study between nervous laughs and free cigarpuffs some wonderful comparisons for his clerical neighbours but meanwhile the chrysanthemums were a source of harmony he and the vicaress were equally attached to them and i was surprised at the knowledge they exhibited of this interesting plant the ladys visit however had presumably been long and she presently rose for departure and kissed mrs ambient mark started to walk with her to the gate of the grounds holding dolcino by the hand stay with me darling mrs ambient said to the boy who had surrendered himself to his father mark paid no attention to the summons but dolcino turned and looked at her in shy appeal cant i go with papa not when i ask you to stay with me but please dont ask me mamma said the child in his small clear new voice i must ask you when i want you come to me dearest and mrs ambient who had seated herself again held out her long slender slightly too osseous hands her husband stopped his back turned to her but without releasing the child he was still talking to the vicaress but this good lady i think had lost the thread of her attention she looked at mrs ambient and at dolcino and then looked at me smiling in a highly amused cheerful manner and almost to a grimace papa said the child mamma wants me not to go with you hes very tired he has run about all day he ought to be quiet till he goes to bed otherwise he wont sleep these declarations fell successively and very distinctly from mrs ambients lips her husband still without turning round bent over the boy and looked at him in silence the vicaress gave a genial irrelevant laugh and observed that he was a precious little pet let him choose said mark ambient my dear little boy will you go with me or will you stay with your mother oh its a shame cried the vicars lady with increased hilarity papa i dont think i can choose the child answered making his voice very low and confidential but ive been a great deal with mamma today he then added and very little with papa my dear fellow i think you have chosen on which mark ambient walked off with his son accompanied by reechoing but inarticulate comments from my fellowvisitor his wife had seated herself again and her fixed eyes bent on the ground expressed for a few moments so much mute agitation that anything i could think of to say would be but a false note yet she none the less quickly recovered herself to express the sufficiently civil hope that i didnt mind having had to walk from the station i reassured her on this point and she went on weve got a thing that might have gone for you but my husband wouldnt order it after which and another longish pause broken only by my plea that the pleasure of a walk with our friend would have been quite what i would have chosen she found for reply i believe the americans walk very little yes we always run i laughingly allowed she looked at me seriously yet with an absence in her pretty eyes i suppose your distances are so great yes but we break our marches i cant tell you the pleasure to me of finding myself here i added ive the greatest admiration for mr ambient hell like that he likes being admired he must have a very happy life then he has many worshippers oh yes ive seen some of them she dropped looking away very far from me rather as if such a vision were before her at the moment it seemed to indicate her tone that the sight was scarcely edifying and i guessed her quickly enough to be in no great intellectual sympathy with the author of beltraffio i thought the fact strange but somehow in the glow of my own enthusiasm didnt think it important it only made me wish rather to emphasise that homage for me you know i returned doubtless with a due suffisance hes quite the greatest of living writers of course i cant judge of course hes very clever she said with a patient cheer hes nothing less than supreme mrs ambient there are pages in each of his books of a perfection classing them with the greatest things accordingly for me to see him in this familiar way in his habit as he lives and apparently to find the man as delightful as the artist well i cant tell you how much too good to be true it seems and how great a privilege i think it i knew i was gushing but i couldnt help it and what i said was a good deal less than what i felt i was by no means sure i should dare to say even so much as this to the master himself and there was a kind of rapture in speaking it out to his wife which was not affected by the fact that as a wife she appeared peculiar she listened to me with her face grave again and her lips a little compressed listened as if in no doubt of course that her husband was remarkable but as if at the same time she had heard it frequently enough and couldnt treat it as stirring news there was even in her manner a suggestion that i was so young as to expose myself to being called forward an imputation and a word i had always loathed as well as a hinted reminder that people usually got over their early extravagance i assure you that for me this is a redletter day i added she didnt take this up but after a pause looking round her said abruptly and a trifle dryly were very much afraid about the fruit this year my eyes wandered to the mossy mottled gardenwalls where plumtrees and pears flattened and fastened upon the rusty bricks looked like crucified figures with many arms doesnt it promise well no the trees look very dull we had such late frosts then there was another pause she addressed her attention to the opposite end of the grounds kept it for her husbands return with the child is mr ambient fond of gardening it occurred to me to ask irresistibly impelled as i felt myself moreover to bring the conversation constantly back to him hes very fond of plums said his wife ah well then i hope your crop will be better than you fear its a lovely old place i continued the whole impressions that of certain places he has described your house is like one of his pictures she seemed a bit frigidly amused at my glow its a pleasant little place there are hundreds like it oh it has his tone i laughed but sounding my epithet and insisting on my point the more sharply that my companion appeared to see in my appreciation of her simple establishment a mark of mean experience it was clear i insisted too much his tone she repeated with a harder look at me and a slightly heightened colour surely he has a tone mrs ambient oh yes he has indeed but i dont in the least consider that im living in one of his books at all i shouldnt care for that in the least she went on with a smile that had in some degree the effect of converting her really sharp protest into an insincere joke im afraid im not very literary and im not artistic she stated im very sure youre not ignorant not stupid i ventured to reply with the accompaniment of feeling immediately afterwards that i had been both familiar and patronising my only consolation was in the sense that she had begun it had fairly dragged me into it she had thrust forward her limitations well whatever i am im very different from my husband if you like him you wont like me you neednt say anything your liking me isnt in the least necessary dont defy me i could but honourably make answer she looked as if she hadnt heard me which was the best thing she could do and we sat some time without further speech mrs ambient had evidently the enviable english quality of being able to be mute without unrest but at last she spoke she asked me if there seemed many people in town i gave her what satisfaction i could on this point and we talked a little of london and of some of its characteristics at that time of the year at the end of this i came back irrepressibly to mark doesnt he like to be there now i suppose he doesnt find the proper quiet for his work i should think his things had been written for the most part in a very still place they suggest a great stillness following on a kind of tumult dont you think so i laboured on i suppose londons a tremendous place to collect impressions but a refuge like this in the country must be better for working them up does he get many of his impressions in london should you say i proceeded from point to point in this malign inquiry simply because my hostess who probably thought me an odious chattering person gave me time for when i paused ive not represented my pauses she simply continued to let her eyes wander while her long fair fingers played with the medallion on her neck when i stopped altogether however she was obliged to say something and what she said was that she hadnt the least idea where her husband got his impressions this made me think her for a moment positively disagreeable delicate and proper and rather aristocratically fine as she sat there but i must either have lost that view a moment later or been goaded by it to further aggression for i remember asking her if our great man were in a good vein of work and when we might look for the appearance of the book on which he was engaged ive every reason now to know that she found me insufferable she gave a strange small laugh as she said im afraid you think i know much more about my husbands work than i do i havent the least idea what hes doing she then added in a slightly different that is a more explanatory tone and as if from a glimpse of the enormity of her confession i dont read what he writes she didnt succeed and wouldnt even had she tried much harder in making this seem to me anything less than monstrous i stared at her and i think i blushed dont you admire his genius dont you admire beltraffio she waited and i wondered what she could possibly say she didnt speak i could see the first words that rose to her lips she repeated what she had said a few minutes before oh of course hes very clever and with this she got up our two absentees had reappeared chapter ii mrs ambient left me and went to meet them she stopped and had a few words with her husband that i didnt hear and that ended in her taking the child by the hand and returning with him to the house her husband joined me in a moment looking i thought the least bit conscious and constrained and said that if i would come in with him he would show me my room in looking back upon these first moments of my visit i find it important to avoid the error of appearing to have at all fully measured his situation from the first or made out the signs of things mastered only afterwards this later knowledge throws a backward light and makes me forget that at least on the occasion of my present reference i mean that first afternoon mark ambient struck me as only enviable allowing for this he must yet have failed of much expression as we walked back to the house though i remember well the answer he made to a remark of mine on his small son thats an extraordinary little boy of yours ive never seen such a child why he asked while we went do you call him extraordinary hes so beautiful so fascinating hes like some perfect little work of art he turned quickly in the passage grasping my arm oh dont call him that or youll youll but in his hesitation he broke off suddenly laughing at my surprise immediately afterwards however he added youll make his little future very difficult i declared that i wouldnt for the world take any liberties with his little future it seemed to me to hang by threads of such delicacy i should only be highly interested in watching it you americans are very keen he commented on this you notice more things than we do ah if you want visitors who arent struck with you i cried you shouldnt have asked me down here he showed me my room a little bower of chintz with open windows where the light was green and before he left me said irrelevantly as for my small son you know we shall probably kill him between us before weve done with him and he made this assertion as if he really believed it without any appearance of jest his fine nearsighted expressive eyes looking straight into mine do you mean by spoiling him no by fighting for him you had better give him to me to keep for you i said let me remove the apple of discord it was my extravagance of course but he had the air of being perfectly serious it would be quite the best thing we could do i should be all ready to do it im greatly obliged to you for your confidence but he lingered with his hands in his pockets i felt as if within a few moments i had morally speaking taken several steps nearer to him he looked weary just as he faced me then looked preoccupied and as if there were something one might do for him i was terribly conscious of the limits of my young ability but i wondered what such a service might be feeling at bottom nevertheless that the only thing i could do for him was to like him i suppose he guessed this and was grateful for what was in my mind since he went on presently i havent the advantage of being an american but i also notice a little and ive an idea that here he smiled and laid his hand on my shoulder even counting out your nationality youre not destitute of intelligence ive only known you half an hour but for which again he pulled up youre very young after all but you may treat me as if i could understand you i said and before he left me to dress for dinner he had virtually given me a promise that he would when i went down into the drawingroom i was very punctual i found that neither my hostess nor my host had appeared a lady rose from a sofa however and inclined her head as i rather surprisedly gazed at her i daresay you dont know me she said with the modern laugh im mark ambients sister whereupon i shook hands with her saluting her very low her laugh was modern by which i mean that it consisted of the vocal agitation serving between people who meet in drawingrooms as the solvent of social disparities the medium of transitions but her appearance was what shall i call it medieval she was pale and angular her long thin face was inhabited by sad dark eyes and her black hair intertwined with golden fillets and curious clasps she wore a faded velvet robe which clung to her when she moved and was cut as to the neck and sleeves like the garments of old italians she suggested a symbolic picture something akin even to durers melancholia and was so perfect an image of a type which i in my ignorance supposed to be extinct that while she rose before me i was almost as much startled as if i had seen a ghost i afterwards concluded that miss ambient wasnt incapable of deriving pleasure from this weird effect and i now believe that reflexion concerned in her having sunk again to her seat with her long lean but not ungraceful arms locked together in an archaic manner on her knees and her mournful eyes addressing me a message of intentness which foreshadowed what i was subsequently to suffer she was a singular fatuous artificial creature and i was never more than half to penetrate her motives and mysteries of one thing im sure at least that they were considerably less insuperable than her appearance announced miss ambient was a restless romantic disappointed spinster consumed with the love of michaelangelesque attitudes and mystical robes but im now convinced she hadnt in her nature those depths of unutterable thought which when you first knew her seemed to look out from her eyes and to prompt her complicated gestures those features in especial had a misleading eloquence they lingered on you with a faroff dimness an air of obstructed sympathy which was certainly not always a key to the spirit of their owner so that of a truth a young lady could scarce have been so dejected and disillusioned without having committed a crime for which she was consumed with remorse or having parted with a hope that she couldnt sanely have entertained she had i believe the usual allowance of rather vain motives she wished to be looked at she wished to be married she wished to be thought original it costs me a pang to speak in this irreverent manner of one of ambients name but i shall have still less gracious things to say before ive finished my anecdote and moreover i confess it i owe the young lady a bit of a grudge putting aside the curious cast of her face she had no natural aptitude for an artistic development had little real intelligence but her affectations rubbed off on her brothers renown and as there were plenty of people who darkly disapproved of him they could easily point to his sister as a person formed by his influence it was quite possible to regard her as a warning and she had almost compromised him with the world at large he was the original and she the inevitable imitation i suppose him scarce aware of the impression she mainly produced beyond having a general idea that she made up very well as a rossetti he was used to her and was sorry for her wishing she would marry and observing how she didnt doubtless i take her too seriously for she did me no harm though im bound to allow that i can only halfaccount for her she wasnt so mystical as she looked but was a strange indirect uncomfortable embarrassing woman my story gives the reader at best so very small a knot to untie that i neednt hope to excite his curiosity by delaying to remark that mrs ambient hated her sisterinlaw this i learned but later on when other matters came to my knowledge i mention it however at once for i shall perhaps not seem to count too much on having beguiled him if i say he must promptly have guessed it mrs ambient a person of conscience put the best face on her kinswoman who spent a month with her twice a year but it took no great insight to recognise the very different personal paste of the two ladies and that the usual feminine hypocrisies would cost them on either side much more than the usual effort mrs ambient smoothhaired thinlipped perpetually fresh must have regarded her crumpled and dishevelled visitor as an equivocal joke she herself so the opposite of a rossetti she herself a reynolds or a lawrence with no more farfetched note in her composition than a cold ladylike candour and a wellstarched muslin dress it was in a garment and with an expression of this kind that she made her entrance after i had exchanged a few words with miss ambient her husband presently followed her and there being no other company we went to dinner the impressions i received at that repast are present to me still the elements of oddity in the air hovered as it were without descending to any immediate check of my delight this came mainly of course from ambients talk the easiest and richest i had ever heard i maynt say today whether he laid himself out to dazzle a rather juvenile pilgrim from over the sea but that matters little it seemed so natural to him to shine his spoken wit or wisdom or whatever had thus a charm almost beyond his written that is if the high finish of his printed prose be really as some people have maintained a fault there was such a kindness in him however that ive no doubt it gave him ideas for me or about me to see me sit as openmouthed as i now figure myself not so the two ladies who not only were very nearly dumb from beginning to end of the meal but who hadnt even the air of being struck with such an exhibition of fancy and taste mrs ambient detached and inscrutable met neither my eye nor her husbands she attended to her dinner watched her servants arranged the puckers in her dress exchanged at wide intervals a remark with her sisterinlaw and while she slowly rubbed her lean white hands between the courses looked out of the window at the first signs of evening the long june day allowing us to dine without candles miss ambient appeared to give little direct heed to anything said by her brother but on the other hand she was much engaged in watching its effect upon me her dieaway pupils continued to attach themselves to my countenance and it was only her air of belonging to another century that kept them from being importunate she seemed to look at me across the ages and the interval of time diminished for me the inconvenience it was as if she knew in a general way that he must be talking very well but she herself was so at home among such allusions that she had no need to pick them up and was at liberty to see what would become of the exposure of a candid young american to a high aesthetic temperature the temperature was aesthetic certainly but it was less so than i could have desired for i failed of any great success in making our friend abound about himself i tried to put him on the ground of his own genius but he slipped through my fingers every time and shifted the saddle to one or other of his contemporaries he talked about balzac and browning about what was being done in foreign countries about his recent tour in the east and the extraordinary forms of life to be observed in that part of the world i felt he had reasons for holding off from a direct profession of literary faith a full consistency or sincerity and therefore dealt instead with certain social topics treating them with extraordinary humour and with a due play of that power of ironic evocation in which his books abound he had a deal to say about london as london appears to the observer who has the courage of some of his conclusions during the highpressure time from april to july of its gregarious life he flashed his faculty of playing with the caught image and liberating the wistful idea over the whole scheme of manners or conception of intercourse of his compatriots among whom there were evidently not a few types for which he had little love london in short was grotesque to him and he made capital sport of it his only allusion that i can remember to his own work was his saying that he meant some day to do an immense and general a kind of epic social satire miss ambients perpetual gaze seemed to put to me do you perceive how artistic how very strange and interesting we are frankly now is it possible to be more artistic more strange and interesting than this you surely wont deny that were remarkable i was irritated by her use of the plural pronoun for she had no right to pair herself with her brother and moreover of course i couldnt see my way to at all genially include mrs ambient yet there was no doubt they were taken together unprecedented enough and with all allowances i had never been left or condemned to draw so many rich inferences after the ladies had retired my host took me into his study to smoke where i appealingly brought him round or so tried to some disclosure of fond ideals i was bent on proving i was worthy to listen to him on repaying him for what he had said to me before dinner by showing him how perfectly i understood he liked to talk he liked to defend his convictions and his honour not that i attacked them he liked a little perhaps it was a pardonable weakness to bewilder the youthful mind even while wishing to win it over my ingenuous sympathy received at any rate a shock from three or four of his professions he made me occasionally gasp and stare he couldnt help forgetting or rather couldnt know how little in another and drier clime i had ever sat in the school in which he was master and he promoted me as at a jump to a sense of its penetralia my trepidations however were delightful they were just what i had hoped for and their only fault was that they passed away too quickly since i found that for the main points i was essentially i was quite constitutionally on mark ambients side this was the taken stand of the artist to whom every manifestation of human energy was a thrilling spectacle and who felt for ever the desire to resolve his experience of life into a literary form on that high head of the passion for form the attempt at perfection the quest for which was to his mind the real search for the holy grail he said the most interesting the most inspiring things he mixed with them a thousand illustrations from his own life from other lives he had known from history and fiction and above all from the annals of the time that was dear to him beyond all periods the italian cinquecento it came to me thus that in his books he had uttered but half his thought and that what he had kept back from motives i deplored when i made them out later was the finer and braver part it was his fate to make a great many still more prepared people than me not inconsiderably wince but there was no grain of bravado in his ripest things ive always maintained it though often contradicted and at bottom the poor fellow disinterested to his fingertips and regarding imperfection not only as an aesthetic but quite also as a social crime had an extreme dread of scandal there are critics who regret that having gone so far he didnt go further but i regret nothing putting aside two or three of the motives i just mentioned since he arrived at a noble rarity and i dont see how you can go beyond that the hours i spent in his study this first one and the few that followed it they were not after all so numerous seem to glow as i look back on them with a tone that is partly that of the brown old room rich under the shaded candlelight where we sat and smoked with the dusky delicate bindings of valuable books partly that of his voice of which i still catch the echo charged with the fancies and figures that came at his command when we went back to the drawingroom we found miss ambient alone in possession and prompt to mention that her sisterinlaw had a quarter of an hour before been called by the nurse to see the child who appeared rather unwell a little feverish feverish how in the world comes he to be feverish ambient asked he was perfectly right this afternoon beatrice says you walked him about too much you almost killed him beatrice must be very happy she has an opportunity to triumph said my friend with a bright bitterness which was all i could have wished it surely not if the childs ill i ventured to remark by way of pleading for mrs ambient my dear fellow you arent married you dont know the nature of wives my host returned with spirit i tried to match it possibly not but i know the nature of mothers beatrice is perfect as a mother sighed miss ambient quite tremendously and with her fingers interlaced on her embroidered knees i shall go up and see my boy her brother went on do you suppose hes asleep beatrice wont let you see him dear as to which our young lady looked at me though addressing our companion do you call that being perfect as a mother ambient asked yes from her point of view damn her point of view cried the author of beltraffio and he left the room after which we heard him ascend the stairs i sat there for some ten minutes with miss ambient and we naturally had some exchange of remarks which began i think by my asking her what the point of view of her sisterinlaw could be oh its so very odd but were so very odd altogether dont you find us awfully unlike others of our class which indeed mostly in england is awful weve lived so much abroad i adore abroad have you people like us in america youre not all alike you interesting three or counting dolcino four surely surely so that i dont think i understand your question weve no one like your brother i may go so far as that youve probably more persons like his wife miss ambient desolately smiled i can tell you that better when youve told me about her point of view oh yes oh yes well said my entertainer she doesnt like his ideas she doesnt like them for the child she thinks them undesirable being quite fresh from the contemplation of some of mark ambients arcana i was particularly in a position to appreciate this announcement but the effect of it was to make me after staring a moment burst into laughter which i instantly checked when i remembered the indisposed child above and the possibility of parents nervously or fussily anxious what has that infant to do with ideas i asked surely he cant tell one from another has he read his fathers novels hes very precocious and very sensitive and his mother thinks she cant begin to guard him too early miss ambients head drooped a little to one side and her eyes fixed themselves on futurity then of a sudden came a strange alteration her face lighted to an effect more joyless than any gloom to that indeed of a conscious insincere grimace and she added when one has children what one writes becomes a great responsibility children are terrible critics i prosaically answered im really glad i havent any do you also write then and in the same style as my brother and do you like that style and do people appreciate it in america i dont write but i think i feel to these and various other inquiries and observations my young lady treated me till we heard her brothers step in the hall again and mark ambient reappeared he was so flushed and grave that i supposed he had seen something symptomatic in the condition of his child his sister apparently had another idea she gazed at him from afar as if he had been a burning ship on the horizon and simply murmured poor old mark i hope youre not anxious i as promptly pronounced no but im disappointed she wont let me in she has locked the door and im afraid to make a noise i daresay there might have been a touch of the ridiculous in such a confession but i liked my new friend so much that it took nothing for me from his dignity she tells me from behind the door that shell let me know if hes worse its very good of her said miss ambient with a hollow sound i had exchanged a glance with mark in which its possible he read that my pity for him was untinged with contempt though i scarce know why he should have cared and as his sister soon afterward got up and took her bedroom candlestick he proposed we should go back to his study we sat there till after midnight he put himself into his slippers and an old velvet jacket he lighted an ancient pipe but he talked considerably less than before there were longish pauses in our communion but they only made me feel we had advanced in intimacy they helped me further to understand my friends personal situation and to imagine it by no means the happiest possible when his face was quiet it was vaguely troubled showing to my increase of interest if that was all that was wanted that for him too life was the same struggle it had been for so many another man of genius at last i prepared to leave him and then to my ineffable joy he gave me some of the sheets of his forthcoming book which though unfinished he had indulged in the luxury so dear to writers of deliberation of having set up from chapter to chapter as he advanced these early pages the premices in the language of letters of that new fruit of his imagination i should take to my room and look over at my leisure i was in the act of leaving him when the door of the study noiselessly opened and mrs ambient stood before us she observed us a moment her candle in her hand and then said to her husband that as she supposed he hadnt gone to bed she had come down to let him know dolcino was more quiet and would probably be better in the morning mark ambient made no reply he simply slipped past her in the doorway as if for fear she might seize him in his passage and bounded upstairs to judge for himself of his childs condition she looked so frankly discomfited that i for a moment believed her about to give him chase but she resigned herself with a sigh and her eyes turned ruefully and without a ray to the lamplit room where various books at which i had been looking were pulled out of their places on the shelves and the fumes of tobacco hung in midair i bade her goodnight and then without intention by a kind of fatality a perversity that had already made me address her overmuch on that question of her husbands powers i alluded to the precious proofsheets with which ambient had entrusted me and which i nursed there under my arm theyre the opening chapters of his new book i said fancy my satisfaction at being allowed to carry them to my room she turned away leaving me to take my candlestick from the table in the hall but before we separated thinking it apparently a good occasion to let me know once for all since i was beginning it would seem to be quite thick with my host that there was no fitness in my appealing to her for sympathy in such a case before we separated i say she remarked to me with her quick fine wellbred inveterate curtness i daresay you attribute to me ideas i havent got i dont take that sort of interest in my husbands proofsheets i consider his writings most objectionable chapter iii i had an odd colloquy the next morning with miss ambient whom i found strolling in the garden before breakfast the whole place looked as fresh and trim amid the twitter of the birds as if an hour before the housemaids had been turned into it with their dustpans and featherbrushes i almost hesitated to light a cigarette and was doubly startled when in the act of doing so i suddenly saw the sister of my host who had at the best something of the weirdness of an apparition stand before me she might have been posing for her photograph her sadcoloured robe arranged itself in serpentine folds at her feet her hands locked themselves listlessly together in front her chin rested on a cinquecento ruff the first thing i did after bidding her goodmorning was to ask her for news of her little nephew to express the hope she had heard he was better she was able to gratify this trust she spoke as if we might expect to see him during the day we walked through the shrubberies together and she gave me further light on her brothers household which offered me an opportunity to repeat to her what his wife had so startled and distressed me with the night before was it the sorry truth that she thought his productions objectionable she doesnt usually come out with that so soon miss ambient returned in answer to my breathlessness poor lady i pleaded she saw im a fanatic yes she wont like you for that but you mustnt mind if the rest of us like you beatrice thinks a work of art ought to have a purpose but shes a charming woman dont you think her charming i find in her quite the grand air shes very beautiful i produced with an effort while i reflected that though it was apparently true that mark ambient was mismated it was also perceptible that his sister was perfidious she assured me her brother and his wife had no other difference but this one that she thought his writings immoral and his influence pernicious it was a fixed idea she was afraid of these things for the child i answered that it was in all conscience enough the trifle of a womans regarding her husbands mind as a well of corruption and she seemed much struck with the novelty of my remark but there hasnt been any of the sort of trouble that there so often is among married people she said i suppose you can judge for yourself that beatrice isnt at all well whatever they call it when a woman kicks over and poor mark doesnt make love to other people either you might think he would but i assure you he doesnt all the same of course from her point of view you know she has a dread of my brothers influence on the child on the formation of his character his ideals poor little brat his principles its as if it were a subtle poison or a contagion something that would rub off on his tender sensibility when his father kisses him or holds him on his knee if she could shed prevent mark from even so much as touching him every one knows it visitors see it for themselves so theres no harm in my telling you isnt it excessively odd it comes from beatrices being so religious and so tremendously moral so a cheval on fifty thousand riguardi and then of course we mustnt forget my companion added a little unexpectedly to this polyglot proposition that some of marks ideas are well really rather impossible dont you know i reflected as we went into the house where we found ambient unfolding the observer at the breakfasttable that none of them were probably quite so impossible dont you know as his sister mrs ambient a little the worse as was mentioned for her ministrations during the night to dolcino didnt appear at breakfast her husband described her however as hoping to go to church i afterwards learnt that she did go but nothing naturally was less on the cards than that we should accompany her it was while the churchbell droned near at hand that the author of beltraffio led me forth for the ramble he had spoken of in his note i shall attempt here no record of where we went or of what we saw we kept to the fields and copses and commons and breathed the same sweet air as the nibbling donkeys and the browsing sheep whose woolliness seemed to me in those early days of acquaintance with english objects but part of the general texture of the small dense landscape which looked as if the harvest were gathered by the shears and with all nature bleating and braying for the violence everything was full of expression for mark ambients visitor from the big bandylegged geese whose whiteness was a note amid all the tones of green as they wandered beside a neat little oval pool the foreground of a thatched and whitewashed inn with a grassy approach and a pictorial sign from these humble wayside animals to the crests of high woods which let a gable or a pinnacle peep here and there and looked even at a distance like trees of good company conscious of an individual profile i admired the hedgerows i plucked the fainthued heather and i was for ever stopping to say how charming i thought the threadlike footpaths across the fields which wandered in a diagonal of finer grain from one smooth stile to another mark ambient was abundantly goodnatured and was as much struck dear man with some of my observations as i was with the literary allusions of the landscape we sat and smoked on stiles broaching paradoxes in the decent english air we took short cuts across a park or two where the bracken was deep and my companion nodded to the old woman at the gate we skirted rank coverts which rustled here and there as we passed and we stretched ourselves at last on a heathery hillside where if the sun wasnt too hot neither was the earth too cold and where the country lay beneath us in a rich blue mist of course i had already told him what i thought of his new novel having the previous night read every word of the opening chapters before i went to bed im not without hope of being able to make it decent enough he said as i went back to the subject while we turned up our heels to the sky at least the people who dislike my stuff and there are plenty of them i believe will dislike this thing if it does turn out well most this was the first time i had heard him allude to the people who couldnt read him a class so generally conceived to sit heavy on the consciousness of the man of letters a being organised for literature as mark ambient was must certainly have had the normal proportion of sensitiveness of irritability the artistic ego capable in some cases of such monstrous development must have been in his composition sufficiently erect and active i wont therefore go so far as to say that he never thought of his detractors or that he had any illusions with regard to the number of his admirers he could never so far have deceived himself as to believe he was popular but i at least then judged and had occasion to be sure later on that stupidity ruffled him visibly but little that he had an air of thinking it quite natural he should leave many simple folk tasting of him as simple as ever he found them and that he very seldom talked about the newspapers which by the way were always even abnormally vulgar about him of course he may have thought them over the newspapers night and day the only point i make is that he didnt show it while at the same time he didnt strike one as a man actively on his guard i may add that touching his hope of making the work on which he was then engaged the best of his books it was only partly carried out that place belongs incontestably to beltraffio in spite of the beauty of certain parts of its successor i quite believe however that he had at the moment of which i speak no sense of having declined he was in love with his idea which was indeed magnificent and though for him as i suppose for every sane artist the act of execution had in it as much torment as joy he saw his result grow like the crescent of the young moon and promise to fill the disk i want to be truer than ive ever been he said settling himself on his back with his hands clasped behind his head i want to give the impression of life itself no you may say what you will ive always arranged things too much always smoothed them down and rounded them off and tucked them in done everything to them that life doesnt do ive been a slave to the old superstitions you a slave my dear mark ambient youve the freest imagination of our day all the more shame to me to have done some of the things i have the reconciliation of the two women in natalina for instance which could never really have taken place that sort of things ignoble i blush when i think of it this new affair must be a golden vessel filled with the purest distillation of the actual and oh how it worries me the shaping of the vase the hammering of the metal i have to hammer it so fine so smooth i dont do more than an inch or two a day and all the while i have to be so careful not to let a drop of the liquor escape when i see the kind of things life herself the brazen hussy does i despair of ever catching her peculiar trick she has an impudence life if one risked a fiftieth part of the effects she risks it takes ever so long to believe it you dont know yet my dear youth it isnt till one has been watching her some forty years that one finds out half of what shes up to therefore ones earlier things must inevitably contain a mass of rot and with what one sees on one side with its tongue in its cheek defying one to be real enough and on the other the bonnes gens rolling up their eyes at ones cynicism the situation has elements of the ludicrous which the poor reproducer himself is doubtless in a position to appreciate better than any one else of course one mustnt worry about the bonnes gens mark ambient went on while my thoughts reverted to his ladylike wife as interpreted by his remarkable sister to sink your shaft deep and polish the plate through which people look into it thats what your work consists of i remember ingeniously observing ah polishing ones plate thats the torment of execution he exclaimed jerking himself up and sitting forward the effort to arrive at a surface if you think anything of that decent sort necessary some people dont happily for them my dear fellow if you could see the surface i dream of as compared with the one with which ive to content myself lifes really too short for art one hasnt time to make ones shell ideally hard firm and bright firm and bright is very well to say the devilish thing has a way sometimes of being bright and even of being hard as mere tough frozen pudding is hard without being firm when i rap it with my knuckles it doesnt give the right sound there are horrible sandy stretches where ive taken the wrong turn because i couldnt for the life of me find the right if you knew what a dunce i am sometimes such things figure to me now base pimples and ulcers on the brow of beauty theyre very bad very bad i said as gravely as i could very bad theyre the highest social offence i know it ought it absolutely ought im quite serious to be capital if i knew i should be publicly thrashed else id manage to find the true word the people who cant some of them dont so much as know it when they see it would shut their inkstands and we shouldnt be deluged by this flood of rubbish i shall not attempt to repeat everything that passed between us nor to explain just how it was that every moment i spent in his company mark ambient revealed to me more and more the consistency of his creative spirit the spirit in him that felt all life as plastic material i could but envy him the force of that passion and it was at any rate through the receipt of this impression that by the time we returned i had gained the sense of intimacy with him that i have noted before we got up for the homeward stretch he alluded to his wifes having once or perhaps more than once asked him whether he should like dolcino to read beltraffio he must have been unaware at the moment of all that this conveyed to me as well doubtless of my extreme curiosity to hear what he had replied he had said how much he hoped dolcino would read all his works when he was twenty he should like him to know what his father had done before twenty it would be useless he wouldnt understand them and meanwhile do you propose to hide them to lock them up in a drawer mrs ambient had proceeded oh no we must simply tell him theyre not intended for small boys if you bring him up properly after that he wont touch them to this mrs ambient had made answer that it might be very awkward when he was about fifteen say and i asked her husband if it were his opinion in general then that young people shouldnt read novels good ones certainly not said my companion i suppose i had had other views for i remember saying that for myself i wasnt sure it was bad for them if the novels were good to the right intensity of goodness bad for them i dont say so much my companion returned but very bad im afraid for the poor dear old novel itself that oblique accidental allusion to his wifes attitude was followed by a greater breadth of reference as we walked home the difference between us is simply the opposition between two distinct ways of looking at the world which have never succeeded in getting on together or in making any kind of common household since the beginning of time theyve borne all sorts of names and my wife would tell you its the difference between christian and pagan i may be a pagan but i dont like the name it sounds sectarian she thinks me at any rate no better than an ancient greek its the difference between making the most of life and making the least so that youll get another better one in some other time and place will it be a sin to make the most of that one too i wonder and shall we have to be bribed off in the future state as well as in the present perhaps i care too much for beauty i dont know i doubt if a poor devil can i delight in it i adore it i think of it continually i try to produce it to reproduce it my wife holds that we shouldnt cultivate or enjoy it without extraordinary precautions and reserves shes always afraid of it always on her guard i dont know what it can ever have done to her what grudge it owes her or what resentment rides and shes so pretty too herself dont you think shes lovely she was at any rate when we married at that time i wasnt aware of that difference i speak of i thought it all came to the same thing in the end as they say well perhaps it will in the end i dont know what the end will be moreover i care for seeing things as they are thats the way i try to show them in any professed picture but you mustnt talk to mrs ambient about things as they are she has a mortal dread of things as they are shes afraid of them for dolcino i said surprised a moment afterwards at being in a position thanks to miss ambient to be so explanatory and surprised even now that mark shouldnt have shown visibly that he wondered what the deuce i knew about it but he didnt he simply declared with a tenderness that touched me ah nothing shall ever hurt him he told me more about his wife before we arrived at the gate of home and if he be judged to have aired overmuch his grievance im afraid i must admit that he had some of the foibles as well as the gifts of the artistic temperament adding however instantly that hitherto to the best of my belief he had rarely let this particular cat out of the bag she thinks me immoral thats the long and short of it he said as we paused outside a moment and his hand rested on one of the bars of his gate while his conscious expressive perceptive eyes the eyes of a foreigner i had begun to account them much more than of the usual englishman viewing me now evidently as quite a familiar friend took part in the declaration its very strange when one thinks it all over and theres a grand comicality in it that i should like to bring out shes a very nice woman extraordinarily wellbehaved upright and clever and with a tremendous lot of good sense about a good many matters yet her conception of a novel she has explained it to me once or twice and she doesnt do it badly as exposition is a thing so false that it makes me blush its a thing so hollow so dishonest so lying in which life is so blinked and blinded so dodged and disfigured that it makes my ears burn its two different ways of looking at the whole affair he repeated pushing open the gate and theyre irreconcilable he added with a sigh we went forward to the house but on the walk halfway to the door he stopped and said to me if youre going into this kind of thing theres a fact you should know beforehand it may save you some disappointment theres a hatred of art theres a hatred of literature i mean of the genuine kinds oh the shams those theyll swallow by the bucket i looked up at the charming house with its genial colour and crookedness and i answered with a smile that those evil passions might exist but that i should never have expected to find them there ah it doesnt matter after all he a bit nervously laughed which i was glad to hear for i was reproaching myself with having worked him up if i had it soon passed off for at luncheon he was delightful strangely delightful considering that the difference between himself and his wife was as he had said irreconcilable he had the art by his manner by his smile by his natural amenity of reducing the importance of it in the common concerns of life and mrs ambient i must add lent herself to this transaction with a very good grace i watched her at table for further illustrations of that fixed idea of which miss ambient had spoken to me for in the light of the united revelations of her sisterinlaw and her husband she had come to seem to me almost a sinister personage yet the signs of a sombre fanaticism were not more immediately striking in her than before it was only after a while that her air of incorruptible conformity her tapering monosyllabic correctness began to affect me as in themselves a cold thin flame certainly at first she resembled a woman with as few passions as possible but if she had a passion at all it would indeed be that of philistinism she might have been for there are guardianspirits i suppose of all great principles the very angel of the pink of propriety putting the pink for a principle though id rather put some dismal cold blue mark ambient apparently ten years before had simply and quite inevitably taken her for an angel without asking himself of what he had been right in calling my attention to her beauty in looking for some explanation of his original surrender to her i saw more than before that she was physically speaking a wonderfully cultivated human plant that he might well have owed her a brief poetic inspiration it was impossible to be more propped and pencilled more delicately tinted and petalled if i had had it in my heart to think my host a little of a hypocrite for appearing to forget at table everything he had said to me in our walk i should instantly have cancelled such a judgement on reflecting that the good news his wife was able to give him about their little boy was ground enough for any optimistic reaction it may have come partly too from a certain compunction at having breathed to me at all harshly on the cool fair lady who sat there a desire to prove himself not after all so mismated dolcino continued to be much better and it had been promised him he should come downstairs after his dinner as soon as we had risen from our own meal mark slipped away evidently for the purpose of going to his child and no sooner had i observed this than i became aware his wife had simultaneously vanished it happened that miss ambient and i both at the same moment saw the tail of her dress whisk out of a doorway an incident that led the young lady to smile at me as if i now knew all the secrets of the ambients i passed with her into the garden and we sat down on a dear old bench that rested against the west wall of the house it was a perfect spot for the middle period of a sunday in june and its felicity seemed to come partly from an antique sundial which rising in front of us and forming the centre of a small intricate parterre measured the moments ever so slowly and made them safe for leisure and talk the garden bloomed in the suffused afternoon the tall beeches stood still for an example and behind and above us a rose tree of many seasons clinging to the faded grain of the brick expressed the whole character of the scene in a familiar exquisite smell it struck me as a place to offer genius every favour and sanction not to bristle with challenges and checks miss ambient asked me if i had enjoyed my walk with her brother and whether we had talked of many things well of most things i freely allowed though i remembered we hadnt talked of miss ambient and dont you think some of his theories are very peculiar oh i guess i agree with them all i was very particular for miss ambients entertainment to guess do you think arts everything she put to me in a moment in art of course i do and do you think beautys everything everythings a big word which i think we should use as little as possible but how can we not want beauty ah there you are she sighed though i didnt quite know what she meant by it of course its difficult for a woman to judge how far to go she went on i adore everything that gives a charm to life im intensely sensitive to form but sometimes i draw back dont you see what i mean i dont quite see where i shall be landed i only want to be quiet after all miss ambient continued as if she had long been baffled of this modest desire and one must be good at any rate must not one she pursued with a dubious quaver an intimation apparently that what i might say one way or the other would settle it for her it was difficult for me to be very original in reply and im afraid i repaid her confidence with an unblushing platitude i remember moreover attaching to it an inquiry equally destitute of freshness and still more wanting perhaps in tact as to whether she didnt mean to go to church since that was an obvious way of being good she made answer that she had performed this duty in the morning and that for her of sunday afternoons supreme virtue consisted in answering the weeks letters then suddenly and without transition she brought out its quite a mistake about dolcinos being better ive seen him and hes not at all right i wondered and somehow i think i scarcely believed surely his mother would know wouldnt she she appeared for a moment to be counting the leaves on one of the great beeches as regards most matters one can easily say what in a given situation my sisterinlaw will or would do but in the present case there are strange elements at work strange elements do you mean in the constitution of the child no i mean in my sisterinlaws feelings elements of affection of course elements of anxiety i concurred but why do you call them strange she repeated my words elements of affection elements of anxiety shes very anxious miss ambient put me indescribably ill at ease she almost scared me and i wished she would go and write her letters his father will have seen him now i said and if hes not satisfied he will send for the doctor the doctor ought to have been here this morning she promptly returned he lives only two miles away i reflected that all this was very possibly but a part of the general tragedy of miss ambients view of things yet i asked her why she hadnt urged that view on her sisterinlaw she answered me with a smile of extraordinary significance and observed that i must have very little idea of her peculiar relations with beatrice but i must do her the justice that she reenforced this a little by the plea that any distinguishable alarm of marks was ground enough for a difference of his wifes he was always nervous about the child and as they were predestined by nature to take opposite views the only thing for the mother was to cultivate a false optimism in marks absence and that of his betrayed fear she would have been less easy i remembered what he had said to me about their dealings with their son that between them theyd probably put an end to him but i didnt repeat this to miss ambient the less so that just then her brother emerged from the house carrying the boy in his arms close behind him moved his wife grave and pale the little sick face was turned over ambients shoulder and toward the mother we rose to receive the group and as they came near us dolcino twisted himself about his enchanting eyes showed me a smile of recognition in which for the moment i should have taken a due degree of comfort miss ambient however received another impression and i make haste to say that her quick sensibility which visibly went out to the child argues that in spite of her affectations she might have been of some human use it wont do at all it wont do at all she said to me under her breath i shall speak to mark about the doctor her small nephew was rather white but the main difference i saw in him was that he was even more beautiful than the day before he had been dressed in his festal garments a velvet suit and a crimson sash and he looked like a little invalid prince too young to know condescension and smiling familiarly on his subjects put him down mark hes not a bit at his ease mrs ambient said should you like to stand on your feet my boy his father asked he made a motion that quickly responded oh yes im remarkably well mark placed him on the ground he had shining pointed shoes with enormous bows are you happy now mr ambient oh yes im particularly happy dolcino replied but the words were scarce out of his mouth when his mother caught him up and in a moment holding him on her knees took her place on the bench where miss ambient and i had been sitting this young lady said something to her brother in consequence of which the two wandered away into the garden together chapter iv i remained with mrs ambient but as a servant had brought out a couple of chairs i wasnt obliged to seat myself beside her our conversation failed of ease and i for my part felt there would be a shade of hypocrisy in my now trying to make myself agreeable to the partner of my friends existence i didnt dislike her i rather admired her but i was aware that i differed from her inexpressibly then i suspected what i afterwards definitely knew and have already intimated that the poor lady felt small taste for her husbands so undisguised disciple and this of course was not encouraging she thought me an obtrusive and designing even perhaps a depraved young man whom a perverse providence had dropped upon their quiet lawn to flatter his worst tendencies she did me the honour to say to miss ambient who repeated the speech that she didnt know when she had seen their companion take such a fancy to a visitor and she measured apparently my evil influence by marks appreciation of my society i had a consciousness not oppressive but quite sufficient of all this though i must say that if it chilled my flow of smalltalk it yet didnt prevent my thinking the beautiful mother and beautiful child interlaced there against their background of roses a picture such as i doubtless shouldnt soon see again i was free i supposed to go into the house and write letters to sit in the drawingroom to repair to my own apartment and take a nap but the only use i made of my freedom was to linger still in my chair and say to myself that the light hand of sir joshua might have painted mark ambients wife and son i found myself looking perpetually at the latter small mortal who looked constantly back at me and that was enough to detain me with these vaguelyamused eyes he smiled and i felt it an absolute impossibility to abandon a child with such an expression his attention never strayed it attached itself to my face as if among all the small incipient things of his nature throbbed a desire to say something to me if i could have taken him on my own knee he perhaps would have managed to say it but it would have been a critical matter to ask his mother to give him up and it has remained a constant regret for me that on that strange sunday afternoon i didnt even for a moment hold dolcino in my arms he had said he felt remarkably well and was especially happy but though peace may have been with him as he pillowed his charming head on his mothers breast dropping his little crimson silk legs from her lap i somehow didnt think security was he made no attempt to walk about he was content to swing his legs softly and strike one as languid and angelic mark returned to us with his sister and miss ambient repeating her mention of the claims of her correspondence passed into the house mark came and stood in front of his wife looking down at the child who immediately took hold of his hand and kept it while he stayed i think mackintosh ought to see him he said i think ill walk over and fetch him thats gwendolens idea i suppose mrs ambient replied very sweetly its not such an outoftheway idea when ones childs ill he returned im not ill papa im much better now sounded in the boys silver pipe is that the truth or are you only saying it to be agreeable youve a great idea of being agreeable you know the child seemed to meditate on this distinction this imputation for a moment then his exaggerated eyes which had wandered caught my own as i watched him do you think me agreeable he inquired with the candour of his age and with a look that made his father turn round to me laughing and ask without saying it isnt he adorable then why dont you hop about if you feel so lusty ambient went on while his son swung his hand because mammas holding me close oh yes i know how mamma holds you when i come near cried mark with a grimace at his wife she turned her charming eyes up to him without deprecation or concession you can go for mackintosh if you like i think myself it would be better you ought to drive she says that to get me away he put to me with a gaiety that i thought a little false after which he started for the doctors i remained there with mrs ambient though even our exchange of twaddle had run very thin the boys little fixed white face seemed as before to plead with me to stay and after a while it produced still another effect a very curious one which i shall find it difficult to express of course i expose myself to the charge of an attempt to justify by a strained logic after the fact a step which may have been on my part but the fruit of a native want of discretion and indeed the traceable consequences of that perversity were too lamentable to leave me any desire to trifle with the question all i can say is that i acted in perfect good faith and that dolcinos friendly little gaze gradually kindled the spark of my inspiration what helped it to glow were the other influences the silent suggestive gardennook the perfect opportunity if it was not an opportunity for that it was an opportunity for nothing and the plea i speak of which issued from the childs eyes and seemed to make him say the mother who bore me and who presses me here to her bosom sympathetic little organism that i am has really the kind of sensibility she has been represented to you as lacking if you only look for it patiently and respectfully how is it conceivable she shouldnt have it how is it possible that i should have so much of it for im quite full of it dear strange gentleman if it werent also in some degree in her im my great fathers child but im also my beautiful mothers and im sorry for the difference between them so it shaped itself before me the vision of reconciling mrs ambient with her husband of putting an end to their ugly difference the project was absurd of course for had i not had his word for it spoken with all the bitterness of experience that the gulf dividing them was wellnigh bottomless nevertheless a quarter of an hour after mark had left us i observed to my hostess that i couldnt get over what she had told me the night before about her thinking her husbands compositions objectionable i had been so very sorry to hear it had thought of it constantly and wondered whether it mightnt be possible to make her change her mind she gave me a great cold stare meant apparently as an admonition to me to mind my business i wish i had taken this mute counsel but i didnt take it i went on to remark that it seemed an immense pity so much that was interesting should be lost on her nothings lost upon me she said in a tone that didnt make the contradiction less i know theyre very interesting dont you like papas books dolcino asked addressing his mother but still looking at me then he added to me wont you read them to me american gentleman id rather tell you some stories of my own i said i know some that are awfully good when will you tell them tomorrow tomorrow with pleasure if that suits you his mother took this in silence her husband during our walk had asked me to remain another day my promise to her son was an implication that i had consented and it wasnt possible the news could please her this ought doubtless to have made me more careful as to what i said next but all i can plead is that it didnt i soon mentioned that just after leaving her the evening before and after hearing her apply to her husbands writings the epithet already quoted i had on going up to my room sat down to the perusal of those sheets of his new book that he had been so good as to lend me i had sat entranced till nearly three in the morning i had read them twice over you say you havent looked at them i think its such a pity you shouldnt do let me beg you to take them up theyre so very remarkable im sure theyll convert you they place him in really such a dazzling light all thats best in him is there ive no doubt its a great liberty my saying all this but pardon me and do read them do read them mamma the boy again sweetly shrilled do read them she bent her head and closed his lips with a kiss of course i know he has worked immensely over them she said after which she made no remark but attached her eyes thoughtfully to the ground the tone of these last words was such as to leave me no spirit for further pressure and after hinting at a fear that her husband mightnt have caught the doctor i got up and took a turn about the grounds when i came back ten minutes later she was still in her place watching her boy who had fallen asleep in her lap as i drew near she put her finger to her lips and a short time afterwards rose holding him it being now best she said that she should take him upstairs i offered to carry him and opened my arms for the purpose but she thanked me and turned away with the child still in her embrace his head on her shoulder im very strong was her last word as she passed into the house her slim flexible figure bent backward with the filial weight so i never laid a longing hand on dolcino i betook myself to ambients study delighted to have a quiet hour to look over his books by myself the windows were open to the garden the sunny stillness the mild light of the english summer filled the room without quite chasing away the rich dusky tone that was a part of its charm and that abode in the serried shelves where old morocco exhaled the fragrance of curious learning as well as in the brighter intervals where prints and medals and miniatures were suspended on a surface of faded stuff the place had both colour and quiet i thought it a perfect room for work and went so far as to say to myself that if it were mine to sit and scribble in there was no knowing but i might learn to write as well as the author of beltraffio this distinguished man still didnt reappear and i rummaged freely among his treasures at last i took down a book that detained me a while and seated myself in a fine old leather chair by the window to turn it over i had been occupied in this way for half an hour a good part of the afternoon had waned when i became conscious of another presence in the room and looking up from my quarto saw that mrs ambient having pushed open the door quite again in the same noiseless way marking or disguising her entrance the night before had advanced across the threshold on seeing me she stopped she had not i think expected to find me but her hesitation was only of a moment she came straight to her husbands writingtable as if she were looking for something i got up and asked her if i could help her she glanced about an instant and then put her hand upon a roll of papers which i recognised as i had placed it on that spot at the early hour of my descent from my room is this the new book she asked holding it up the very sheets i smiled with precious annotations i mean to take your advice and she tucked the little bundle under her arm i congratulated her cordially and ventured to make of my triumph as i presumed to call it a subject of pleasantry but she was perfectly grave and turned away from me as she had presented herself without relaxing her rigour after which i settled down to my quarto again with the reflexion that mrs ambient was truly an eccentric my triumph too suddenly seemed to me rather vain a woman who couldnt unbend at a moment exquisitely indicated would never understand mark ambient he came back to us at last in person having brought the doctor with him he was away from home mark said and i went after him to where he was supposed to be he had left the place and i followed him to two or three others which accounts for my delay he was now with mrs ambient looking at the child and was to see mark again before leaving the house my host noticed at the end of two minutes that the proofsheets of his new book had been removed from the table and when i told him in reply to his question as to what i knew about them that mrs ambient had carried them off to read he turned almost pale with surprise what has suddenly made her so curious he cried and i was obliged to tell him that i was at the bottom of the mystery i had had it on my conscience to assure her that she really ought to know of what her husband was capable of what im capable elle ne sen doute que trop said ambient with a laugh but he took my meddling very goodnaturedly and contented himself with adding that he was really much afraid she would burn up the sheets his emendations and all of which latter he had no duplicate the doctor paid a long visit in the nursery and before he came down i retired to my own quarters where i remained till dinnertime on entering the drawingroom at this hour i found miss ambient in possession as she had been the evening before i was right about dolcino she said as soon as she saw me with an air of triumph that struck me as the climax of perversity hes really very ill very ill why when i last saw him at four oclock he was in fairly good form there has been a change for the worse very sudden and rapid and when the doctor got here he found diphtheritic symptoms he ought to have been called as i knew in the morning and the child oughtnt to have been brought into the garden my dear lady he was very happy there i protested with horror he would be very happy anywhere ive no doubt hes very happy now with his poor little temperature she dropped her voice as her brother came in and mark let us know that as a matter of course mrs ambient wouldnt appear it was true the boy had developed diphtheritic symptoms but he was quiet for the present and his mother earnestly watching him she was a perfect nurse mark said and mackintosh would come back at ten our dinner wasnt very gay with my host worried and absent and his sister annoyed me by her constant tacit assumption conveyed in the very way she nibbled her bread and sipped her wine of having told me so i had had no disposition to deny anything she might have told me and i couldnt see that her satisfaction in being justified by the event relieved her little nephews condition the truth is that as the sequel was to prove miss ambient had some of the qualities of the sibyl and had therefore perhaps a right to the sibylline contortions her brother was so preoccupied that i felt my presence an indiscretion and was sorry i had promised to remain over the morrow i put it to mark that clearly i had best leave them in the morning to which he replied that on the contrary if he was to pass the next days in the fidgets my company would distract his attention the fidgets had already begun for him poor fellow and as we sat in his study with our cigars after dinner he wandered to the door whenever he heard the sound of the doctors wheels miss ambient who shared this apartment with us gave me at such moments significant glances she had before rejoining us gone upstairs to ask about the child his mother and his nurse gave a fair report but miss ambient found his fever high and his symptoms very grave the doctor came at ten oclock and i went to bed after hearing from mark that he saw no present cause for alarm he had made every provision for the night and was to return early in the morning i quitted my room as eight struck the next day and when i came downstairs saw through the open door of the house mrs ambient standing at the front gate of the grounds in colloquy with mackintosh she wore a white dressinggown but her shining hair was carefully tucked away in its net and in the morning freshness after a night of watching she looked as much the type of the lady as her sisterinlaw had described her her appearance i suppose ought to have reassured me but i was still nervous and uneasy so that i shrank from meeting her with the necessary challenge none the less however was i impatient to learn how the new day found him and as mrs ambient hadnt seen me i passed into the grounds by a roundabout way and stopping at a further gate hailed the doctor just as he was driving off mrs ambient had returned to the house before he got into his cart pardon me but as a friend of the family i should like very much to hear about the little boy the stout sharp circumspect man looked at me from head to foot and then said im sorry to say i havent seen him havent seen him mrs ambient came down to meet me as i alighted and told me he was sleeping so soundly after a restless night that she didnt wish him disturbed i assured her i wouldnt disturb him but she said he was quite safe now and she could look after him herself thank you very much are you coming back no sir ill be hanged if i come back cried the honest practitioner in high resentment and the horse started as he settled beside his man i wandered back into the garden and five minutes later miss ambient came forth from the house to greet me she explained that breakfast wouldnt be served for some time and that she desired a moment herself with the doctor i let her know that the good vexed man had come and departed and i repeated to her what he had told me about his dismissal this made miss ambient very serious very serious indeed and she sank into a bench with dilated eyes hugging her elbows with crossed arms she indulged in many strange signs she confessed herself immensely distressed and she finally told me what her own last news of her nephew had been she had sat up very late after me after mark and before going to bed had knocked at the door of the childs room opened to her by the nurse this good woman had admitted her and she had found him quiet but flushed and unnatural with his mother sitting by his bed she held his hand in one of hers said miss ambient and in the other what do you think the proofsheets of marks new book she was reading them there intently did you ever hear of anything so extraordinary such a very odd time to be reading an author whom she never could abide in her agitation miss ambient was guilty of this vulgarism of speech and i was so impressed by her narrative that only in recalling her words later did i notice the lapse mrs ambient had looked up from her reading with her finger on her lips i recognised the gesture she had addressed me in the afternoon and though the nurse was about to go to rest had not encouraged her sisterinlaw to relieve her of any part of her vigil but certainly at that time the boys state was far from reassuring his poor little breathing so painful and what change could have taken place in him in those few hours that would justify beatrice in denying mackintosh access this was the moral of miss ambients anecdote the moral for herself at least the moral for me rather was that it was a very singular time for mrs ambient to be going into a novelist she had never appreciated and who had simply happened to be recommended to her by a young american she disliked i thought of her sitting there in the sickchamber in the still hours of the night and after the nurse had left her turning and turning those pages of genius and wrestling with their magical influence i must be sparing of the minor facts and the later emotions of this sojourn it lasted but a few hours longer and devote but three words to my subsequent relations with ambient they lasted five years till his death and were full of interest of satisfaction and i may add of sadness the main thing to be said of these years is that i had a secret from him which i guarded to the end i believe he never suspected it though of this im not absolutely sure if he had so much as an inkling the line he had taken the line of absolute negation of the matter to himself shows an immense effort of the will i may at last lay bare my secret giving it for what it is worth now that the main sufferer has gone that he has begun to be alluded to as one of the famous early dead and that his wife has ceased to survive him now too that miss ambient whom i also saw at intervals during the time that followed has with her embroideries and her attitudes her necromantic glances and strange intuitions retired to a sisterhood where as i am told she is deeply immured and quite lost to the world mark came in to breakfast after this lady and i had for some time been seated there he shook hands with me in silence kissed my companion opened his letters and newspapers and pretended to drink his coffee but i took these movements for mechanical and was little surprised when he suddenly pushed away everything that was before him and with his head in his hands and his elbows on the table sat staring strangely at the cloth whats the matter caro fratello mio miss ambient quavered peeping from behind the urn he answered nothing but got up with a certain violence and strode to the window we rose to our feet his relative and i by a common impulse exchanging a glance of some alarm and he continued to stare into the garden in heavens name what has got possession of beatrice he cried at last turning round on us a ravaged face he looked from one of us to the other the appeal was addressed to us alike miss ambient gave a shrug my poor mark beatrice is always beatrice she has locked herself up with the boy bolted and barred the door she refuses to let me come near him he went on she refused to let mackintosh see him an hour ago miss ambient promptly returned refused to let mackintosh see him by heaven ill smash in the door and mark brought his fist down upon the sideboard which he had now approached so that all the breakfastservice rang i begged miss ambient to go up and try to have speech of her sisterinlaw and i drew mark out into the garden youre exceedingly nervous and mrs ambients probably right i there undertook to plead women know women should be supreme in such a situation trust a mother a devoted mother my dear friend with such words as these i tried to soothe and comfort him and marvellous to relate i succeeded with the help of many cigarettes in making him walk about the garden and talk or suffer me at least to do so for near an hour when about that time had elapsed his sister reappeared reaching us rapidly and with a convulsed face while she held her hand to her heart go for the doctor mark go for the doctor this moment is he dying has she killed him my poor friend cried flinging away his cigarette i dont know what she has done but shes frightened and now she wants the doctor he told me hed be hanged if he came back i felt myself obliged to mention precisely therefore mark himself must go for him and not a messenger you must see him and tell him its to save your child the trap has been ordered its ready to save him ill save him please god ambient cried bounding with his great strides across the lawn as soon as he had gone i felt i ought to have volunteered in his place and i said as much to miss ambient but she checked me by grasping my arm while we heard the wheels of the dogcart rattle away from the gate hes off hes off and now i can think to get him away while i think while i think while you think of what miss ambient of the unspeakable thing that has happened under this roof her manner was habitually that of such a prophetess of ill that i at first allowed for some great extravagance but i looked at her hard and the next thing felt myself turn white dolcino is dying then hes dead its too late to save him his mother has let him die i tell you that because youre sympathetic because youve imagination miss ambient was good enough to add interrupting my expression of horror thats why you had the idea of making her read marks new book what has that to do with it i dont understand you your accusations monstrous i see it all im not stupid she went on heedless of my emphasis it was the book that finished her it was that decided her decided her do you mean she has murdered her child i demanded trembling at my own words she sacrificed him she determined to do nothing to make him live why else did she lock herself in why else did she turn away the doctor the book gave her a horror she determined to rescue him to prevent him from ever being touched he had a crisis at two oclock in the morning i know that from the nurse who had left her then but whom for a short time she called back the darling got munch worse but she insisted on the nurses going back to bed and after that she was alone with him for hours i listened with a dread that stayed my credence while she stood there with her tearless glare do you pretend then she has no pity that shes cruel and insane she held him in her arms she pressed him to her breast not to see him but she gave him no remedies she did nothing the doctor ordered everythings there untouched she has had the honesty not even to throw the drugs away i dropped upon the nearest bench overcome with my dismay quite as much at miss ambients horrible insistence and distinctness as at the monstrous meaning of her words yet they came amazingly straight and if they did have a sense i saw myself too woefully figure in it had i been then a proximate cause youre a very strange woman and you say incredible things i could only reply she had one of her tragic headshakes you think it necessary to protest but youre really quite ready to believe me youve received an impression of my sisterinlaw youve guessed of what shes capable i dont feel bound to say what concession on this score i made to miss ambient who went on to relate to me that within the last halfhour beatrice had had a revulsion that she was tremendously frightened at what she had done that her fright itself betrayed her and that she would now give heaven and earth to save the child let us hope she will i said looking at my watch and trying to time poor ambient whereupon my companion repeated all portentously let us hope so when i asked her if she herself could do nothing and whether she oughtnt to be with her sisterinlaw she replied you had better go and judge shes like a wounded tigress i never saw mrs ambient till six months after this and therefore cant pretend to have verified the comparison at the latter period she was again the type of the perfect lady shell treat him better after this i remember her sisterinlaws saying in response to some quick outburst on my part of compassion for her brother though i had been in the house but thirtysix hours this young lady had treated me with extraordinary confidence and there was therefore a certain demand i might as such an intimate make of her i extracted from her a pledge that shed never say to her brother what she had just said to me that shed let him form his own theory of his wifes conduct she agreed with me that there was misery enough in the house without her contributing a new anguish and that mrs ambients proceedings might be explained to her husbands mind by the extravagance of a jealous devotion poor mark came back with the doctor much sooner than we could have hoped but we knew five minutes afterwards that it was all too late his sole his adored little son was more exquisitely beautiful in death than he had been in life mrs ambients grief was frantic she lost her head and said strange things as for marks but i wont speak of that basta basta as he used to say miss ambient kept her secret ive already had occasion to say that she had her good points but it rankled in her conscience like a guilty participation and i imagine had something to do with her ultimately retiring from the world and apropos of consciences the reader is now in a position to judge of my compunction for my effort to convert my cold hostess i ought to mention that the death of her child in some degree converted her when the new book came out it was long delayed she read it over as a whole and her husband told me that during the few supreme weeks before her death she failed rapidly after losing her son sank into a consumption and faded away at mentone she even dipped into the black beltraffio
