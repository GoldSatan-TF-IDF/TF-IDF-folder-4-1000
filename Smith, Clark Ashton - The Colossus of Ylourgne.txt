the colossus of ylourgne clark ashton smith i the flight of the necromancer the thriceinfamous nathaire alchemist astrologer and necromancer with his ten devilgiven pupils had departed very suddeniy and under circumstances of strict secrecy from the town of vyones it was widely thought among the people of that vicinage that his departure had been prompted by a salutary fear of ecclesiastical thumbscrews and faggots other wizards less notorious than he had already gone to the stake during a year of unusual inquisitory zeal and it was wellknown that nathaire had incurred the reprobation of the church few therefore considered the reason of his going a mystery but the means of transit which he had employed as well as the destination of the sorcerer and his pupils were regarded as more than problematic a thousand dark and superstitious rumours were abroad and passers made the sign of the cross when they neared the tall gloomy house which nathaire had built in blasphemous proximity to the great cathedral and had filled with a furniture of satanic luxury and strangeness two daring thieves who had entered the mansion when the fact of its desertion became well established reported that much of this furniture as well as the books and other paraphernalia of nathaire had seemingly departed with its owner doubtless to the same fiery bourn this served to augment the unholy mystery for it was patently impossible that nathaire and his ten apprentices with several cartloads of household belongings could have passed the everguarded city gates in any legitimate manner without the knowledge of the custodians it was said by the more devout and religious moiety that the archfiend with a legion of batwinged assistants had borne them away bodily at moonless midnight there were clerics and also reputable burghers who professed to have seen the flight of manlike shapes upon the blotted stars together with others that were not men and to have heard the wailing cries of the hellbound crew as they passed in an evil cloud over the roofs and city walls others believed that the sorcerers had transported themselves from vyones through their own diabolic arts and had withdrawn to some unfrequented fastness where nathaire who had long been in feeble health could hope to die in such peace and serenity as might be enjoyed by one who stood between the flames of the autodaf–π and those of abaddon it was thought that he had lately cast his own horoscope for the first time in his fiftyodd years and had read therein an impending conjunction of disastrous planets signifying early death others still among whom were certain rival astrologers and enchanters said that nathaire had retired from the public view merely that he might commune without interruption with various coadjutive demons and thus might weave unmolested the black spells of a supreme and lycanthropic malice these spells they hinted would in due time be visited upon vyones and perhaps upon the entire region of averoigne and would no doubt take the form of a fearsome pestilence or a wholesale invultuation or a realmwide incursion of succubi and incubi amid the seething of strange rumours many halfforgotten tales were recalled and new legends were created overnight much was made of the obscure nativity of nathaire and his dubitable wanderings before he had settled six years previous in vyones people said that he was fiendbegotten like the fabled merlin his father being no less a personage than alastor demon of revenge and his mother a deformed and dwarfish sorceress from the former he had taken his spitefulness and malignity from the latter his squat puny physique he had travelled in orient lands and had learned from egyptian or saracenic masters the unhallowed art of necromancy in whose practice he was unrivalled there were black whispers anent the use he had made of longdead bodies of fleshless bones and the service he had wrung from buried men that the angel of doom alonelawfully raise up he had never been popular though many had sought his advice and assistance in the furthering of their own more or less dubious affairs once in the third year after his coming to vyones he had been stoned in public because of his bruited necromancies and had been permanently lamed by a welldirected cobble this injury it was thought he had never forgiven and he was said to return the antagonism of the clergy with the hellish hatred of an antichrist apart from the sorcerous evils and abuses of which he was commonly suspected he had long been looked upon as a corrupter of youth despite his minikin stature his deformity and ugliness he possessed a remarkable power a mesmeric persuasion and his pupils whom he was said to have plunged into bottomless and ghoulish iniquities were young men of the most brilliant promise on the whole his vanishment was regarded as a quite providential riddance among the people of the city there was one man who took no part in the sombre gossip and lurid speculation this man was gaspard du nord himself a student of the proscribed sciences who had been numbered for a year among the pupils of nathaire but had chosen to withdraw quietly from the masters household after learning the enormities that would attend his further initiation he had however taken with him much rare and peculiar knowledge together with a certain insight into the baleful powers and nightdark motives of the necromancer because of this knowledge and insight gaspard preferred to remain silent when he heard of nathaires departure also he did not think it well to revive the memory of his own past pupilage alone with his books in a sparsely furnished attic he frowned above a small oblong mirror framed with an arabesque of golden vipers that had once been the property of nathaire it was not the reflection of his own comely and youthful though subtly lined face that caused him to frown indeed the mirror was of another kind than that which reflects the features of the gazer in its depths for a few instants he had beheld a strange and ominouslooking scene whose participants were known to him but whose location he could not recognize or orientate before he could study it closely the mirror had clouded as if with the rising of alchemic fumes and he had seen no more this clouding he reflected could mean only one thing nathaire had known himself watched and had put forth a counterspell that rendered the clairvoyant mirror useless it was the realization of this fact together with the brief sinister glimpse of nathaires present activities that troubled gaspard and caused a chill horror to mount slowly in his mind a horror that had not yet found a palpable form or a name the gathering of the dead the departure of nathaire and his pupils occurred in the late spring of during the interlunar dark afterwards a new moon waxed above the flowery fields and brightleafed woods and waned in ghostly silver with its waning people began to talk of other magicians and fresher mysteries then in the moondeserted nights of early summer there came a series of disappearances far more unnatural and inexplicable than that of the dwarfish malignant sorcerer it was found one day by gravediggers who had gone early to their toil in a cemetery outside the walls of vyones that no less than six newly occupied graves had been opened and the bodies which were those of reputable citizens removed on closer examination it became all too evident that this removal had not been effected by robbers the coffins which lay aslant or stood protruding upright from the mould offered all the appearance of having been shattered from within as if by the use of extrahuman strength and the fresh earth itself was upheaved as if the dead men in some awful untimely resurrection had actually dug their way to the surface the corpses had vanished utterly as if hell had swallowed them and as far as could be learned there were no eyewitnesses of their fate in those devilridden times only one explanation of the happening seemed credible demons had entered the graves and had taken bodily possession of the dead compelling them to arise and go forth to the dismay and horror of all averoigne the strange vanishment was foilowed with appalling promptness by many others of a like sort it seemed as if an occult resistless summons had been laid upon the dead nightly for a period of two weeks the cemeteries of vyones and also those of other towns of villages and hamlets gave up a ghastly quota of their tenants from brazen bolted tombs from common charnels from shallow unconsecrated trenches from the marble lidded vaults of churches and cathedrals the weird exodus went on without cessation worse than this if possible there were newly ceremented corpses that leapt from their biers or catafalques and disregarding the horrified watchers ran with great bounds of automatic frenzy into the night never to be seen again by those who lamented them in every case the missing bodies were those of young stalwart men who had died but recently and had met their death through violence or accident rather than wasting illness some were criminals who had paid the penalty of their misdeeds others were menatarms or constables slain in the execution of their duty knights who had died in tourney or personal combat were numbered among them and many were the victims of the robber bands who infested averoigne at that time there were monks merchants nobles yeomen pages priests but none in any case who had passed the prime of life the old and infirm it seemed were safe from the animating demons the situation was looked upon by the more superstitious as a veritable omening of the worlds end satan was making war with his cohorts and was carrying the bodies of the holy dead into hellish captivity the consternation increased a hundredfold when it became plain that even the most liberal sprinkling of holy water the performance of the most awful and cogent exorcisms failed utterly to give protection against this diabolic ravishment the church owned itself powerless to cope with the strange evil and the forces of secular law could do nothing to arraign or punish the intangible agency because of the universal fear that prevailed no effort was made to follow the missing cadavers ghastly tales however were told by late wayfarers who had met certain of these liches striding alone or in companies along the roads of averoigne they gave the appearance of being deaf dumb totally insensate and of hurrying with horrible speed and sureness towards a remote predestined goal the general direction of their flight it seemed was eastward but only with the cessation of the exodus which had numbered several hundred people did any one begin to suspect the actual destination of the dead this destination it somehow became rumoured was the ruinous castle of ylourgne beyond the werewolfhaunted forest in the outlying semimountainous hills of averoigne ylourgne a great craggy pile that had been built by a line of evil and marauding barons now extinct was a place that even the goatherds preferred to shun the wrathful spectres of its bloody lords were said to move turbulently in its crumbling halls and its chatelaines were the undead no one cared to dwell in the shadow of its clifffounded walls and the nearest abode of living men was a small cistercian monastery more than a mile away on the opposite slope of the valley the monks of this austere brotherhood held little commerce with the world beyond the hills and few were the visitors who sought admission at their highperched portals but during that dreadful summer following the disappearances of the dead a weird and disquieting tale went forth from the monastery throughout averoigne beginning with late spring the cistercian monks were compelled to take cognizance of sundry odd phenomena in the old longdeserted ruins of ylourgne which were visible from their windows they had beheld flaring lights where lights should not have been flames of uncanny blue and crimson that shuddered behind the broken weedgrown embrasures or rose starwards above the jagged crenelations hideous noises had issued from the ruin by night together with the flames and the monks had heard a clangour as of hellish anvils and hammers a ringing of gigantic armour and maces and had deemed that ylourgne was become a musteringground of devils mephitic odours as of brimstone and burning flesh had floated across the valley and even by day when the noises were silent and the lights no longer flared a thin haze of hellblue vapour hung upon the battlements it was plain the monks thought that the place had been occupied from beneath by subterrestrial beings for no one was seen to approach it by way of the bare open slopes and crags observing these signs of the archfoes activity in their neighbourhood they crossed themselves with new fervour and frequency and said their paters and aves more interminably than before their toil and austerities also they redoubled otherwise since the old castle was a place abandoned by men they took no heed of the supposed occupation deeming it well to mind their own affairs unless in case of overt satanic hostility they kept a careful watch but for several weeks they saw no one who actually entered ylourgne or emerged therefrom except for the nocturnal lights and noises and the hovering vapour by day there was no proof of tenantry either human or diabolic then one morning in the valley below the terraced gardens of the monastery two brothers hoeing weeds in a carrotpatch beheld the passing of a singular train of people who came from the direction of the great forest of averoigne and went upwards climbing the steep chasmy slope towards ylourgne these people the monks averred were striding along in great haste with stiff but flying steps and all were strangely pale of feature and were habited in the garments of the grave the shrouds of some were torn and ragged and all were dusty with travel or grimed with the mould of interment the people numbered a dozen or more and after them at intervals there came several stragglers attired like the rest with marvellous agility and speed they mounted the hill and disappeared at length amid the lowering walls of ylourgne at this time no rumour of the ravished graves and biers had reached the cistercians the tale was brought to them later after they had beheld on many successive mornings the passing of small or great companies of the dead towards the deviltaken castle hundreds of these liches they swore had filed by beneath the monastery and doubtless many others had gone past unnoted in the dark none however were seen to come forth from ylourgne which had swallowed them up like the undisgorging pit though direly frightened and sorely scandalized the brothers still thought it well to refrain from action some the hardiest irked by all these flagrant signs of evil had desired to visit the ruins with holy water and lifted crucifixes but their abbot in his wisdom enjoined them to wait in the meanwhile the nocturnal flames grew brighter the noises louder also in the course of this waiting while incessant prayers went up from the little monastery a frightful thing occurred one of the brothers a stout fellow named theophile in violation of the rigorous discipline had made overfrequent visits to the winecasks no doubt he had tried to drown his pious horror at these untoward happenings at any rate after his potations he had the illluck to wander out among the precipices and break his neck sorrowing for his death and dereliction the brothers laid theophile in the chapel and chanted their masses for his soul these masses in the dark hours before morning were interrupted by the untimely resurrection of the dead monk who with his head lolling horribly on his broken neck rushed as if fiendridden from the chapel and ran down the hill towards the demon flames and clamours of ylourgne the testimony of the monks following the aboverelated occurrence two of the brothers who had previously desired to visit the haunted castle again applied to the abbot for this permission saying that god would surely aid them in avenging the abduction of theophiles body as well as the taking of many others from consecrated ground marvelling at the hardihood of these lusty monks who preposed to beard the archenemy in his lair the abbot permitted them to go forth furnished with aspergilluses and flasks of holy water and bearing great crosses of hornbeam such as would have served for maces with which to brain an armoured knight the monks whose names were bernard and stephane went boldly up at middle forenoon to assail the evil stronghold it was an arduous climb among overhanging boulders and along slippery scarps but both were stout and agile and moreover well accustomed to such climbing since the day was sultry and airless their white robes were soon stained with sweat but pausing only for brief prayer they pressed on and in good season they neared the castle upon whose grey timeeroded ramparts they could still descry no evidence of occupation or activity the deep moat that had once surrounded the place was now dry and had been partly filled by crumbling earth and detritus from the walls the drawbridge had rotted away but the blocks of the barbican collapsing into the moat had made a sort of rough causey on which it was possible to cross not without trepidation and lifting their crucifixes as warriors lift their weapons in the escalade of an armed fortress the brothers climbed over the ruin of the barbican into the courtyard this too like the battlements was seemingly deserted overgrown nettles rank grasses and sapling trees were rooted between its pavingstones the high massive donjon the chapel and that portion of the castellated structure containing the great hall had preserved their main outlines after centuries of dilapidation to the left of the broad bailey a doorway yawned like the mouth of a dark cavern in the cliffy mass of the hallbuilding and from this doorway there issued a thin bluish vapour writhing in phantom coils towards the unclouded heavens approaching the doorway the brothers beheld a gleaming of red fires within like the eyes of dragons blinking through infernal murk they felt sure that the place was an outpost of erebus an antechamber of the pit but nevertheless they entered bravely chanting loud exorcisms and brandishing their mighty crosses of hornbeam passing through the cavernous doorway they could see but indistinctly in the gloom being somewhat blinded by the summer sunlight they had left then with the gradual clearing of their vision a monstrous scene was limned before them with evergrowing details of crowding horror and grotesquery some of the details were obscure and mysteriously terrifying others all too plain were branded as if with sudden ineffaceable hellfire on the minds of the monks they stood on the threshold of a colossal chamber which seemed to have been made by the tearing down of upper floors and inner partitions adjacent to the castle hall itself a room of huge extent the chamber seemed to recede through interminable shadow shafted with sunlight falling through the rents of ruin sunlight that was powerless to dissipate the infernal gloom and mystery the monks averred later that they saw many people moving about the place together with sundry demons some of whom were shadowy and gigantic and others barely to be distinguished from the men these people as well as their familiars were occupied with the tending of reverberatory furnaces and immense pearshaped and gourdshaped vessels such as were used in alchemy some also were stooping above great fuming cauldrons like sorcerers busy with the brewing of terrible drugs against the opposite wall there were two enormous vats built of stone and mortar whose circular sides rose higher than a mans head so that bernard and stephane were unable to determine their contents one of the vats gave forth a whitish glimmering the other a ruddy luminosity near the vats and somewhat between them there stood a sort of low couch or litter made of luxurious weirdly figured fabrics such as the saracens weave on this the monks discerned a dwarfish being pale and wizened with eyes of chill flame that shone like evil beryls through the dusk the dwarf who had all the air of a feeble moribund was supervising the toils of the men and their familiars the dazed eyes of the brothers began to comprehend other details they saw that several corpses among which they recognized that of theophile were lying on the middle floor together with a heap of human bones that had been wrenched asunder at the joints and great lumps of flesh piled like the carvings of butchers one of the men was lifting the bones and dropping them into a cauldron beneath which there glowed a rubycoloured fire and another was flinging the lumps of flesh into a tub filled with some hueless liquid that gave forth an evil hissing as of a thousand serpents others had stripped the graveclothes from one of the cadavers and were starting to assail it with long knives others still were mounting rude flights of stone stairs along the walls of the immense vats carrying vessels filled with semiliquescent matters which they emptied over the high rims appalled at this vision of human and satanic turpitude and feeling a more than righteous indignation the monks resumed their chanting of sonorous exorcisms and rushed forward their entrance it appeared was not perceived by the heinously occupied crew of sorcerers and devils bernard and stephane filled with an ardour of godly wrath were about to fling themselves upon the butchers who had started to assail the dead body this corpse they recognized as being that of a notorious outlaw named jacques le loupgarou who had been slain a few days previous in combat with the officers of the state le loupgarou noted for his brawn his cunning and his ferocity had long terrorized the woods and highways of averoigne his great body had been half eviscerated by the swords of the constabulary and his beard was stiff and purple with the dried blood of a ghastly wound that had cloven his face from temple to mouth he had died unshriven but nevertheless the monks were unwilling to see his helpless cadaver put to some unhallowed use beyond the surmise of christians the pale malignantlooking dwarf had now perceived the brothers they heard him cry out in a shrill imperatory tone that rose above the ominous hiss of the cauldrons and the hoarse mutter of men and demons they knew not his words which were those of some outlandish tongue and sounded like an incantation instantly as if in response to an order two of the men turned from their unholy chemistry and lifting copper basins filled with an unknown fetid liquor hurled the contents of these vessels in the faces of bernard and stephane the brothers were blinded by the stinging fluid which bit their flesh as with many serpents teeth and they were overcome by the noxious fumes so that their great crosses dropped from their hands and they both fell unconscious on the castle floor recovering anon their sight and their other senses they found that their hands had been tied with heavy thongs of gut so that they were now helpless and could no longer wield their crucifixes or the sprinklers of holy water which they carried in this ignominious condition they heard the voice of the evil dwarf commanding them to arise they obeyed though clumsily and with difficulty being denied the assistance of their hands bernard who was still sick with the poisonous vapour he had inhaled fell twice before he succeeded in standing erect and his discomfiture was greeted with a cachinnation of foul obscene laughter from the assembled sorcerers now standing the monks were taunted by the dwarf who mocked and reviled them with appalling blasphemies such as could be uttered only by a bondservant of satan at last according to their sworn testimony he said to them return to your kennel ye whelps of ialdabaoth and take with you this message they that came here as many shall go forth as one then in obedience to a dreadful formula spoken by the dwarf two of the familiars who had the shape of enormous and shadowy beasts approached the body of le loupgarou and that of brother theophile one of the foul demons like a vapour that sinks into a marsh entered the bloody nostrils of le loupgarou disappearing inch by inch till its horned and bestial head was withdrawn from sight the other in like manner went in through the nostrils of brother theophile whose head lay weird athwart his shoulder on the broken neck then when the demons had completed their possession the bodies in a fashion horrible to behold were raised up from the castle floor the one with ravelled entrails hanging from its wide wounds the other with a head that dropped forward loosely on its bosom then animated by their devils the cadavers took up the crosses of hornbeam that had been dropped by stephane and bernard and using the crosses for bludgeons they drove the monks in ignominious flight from the castle amid a loud tempestuous howling of infernal laughter from the dwarf and his necromantic crew and the nude corpse of le loupgarou and the robed cadaver of theophile followed them far on the chasmriven slopes below ylourgne striking great blows with the crosses so that the backs of the two cistercians were become a mass of bloody bruises after a defeat so signal and crushing no more of the monks were emboldened to go up against ylourgne the whole monastery thereafter devoted itself to triple austerities to quadrupled prayers and awaiting the unknown will of god and the equally obscure machinations of the devil maintained a pious faith that was somewhat tempered with trepidation in time through goatherds who visited the monks the tale of stephane and bernard went forth throughout averoigne adding to the grievous alarm that had been caused by the wholesale disappearance of the dead no one knew what was really going on in the haunted castle or what disposition had been made of the hundreds of migratory corpses for the light thrown on their fate by the monks story though lurid and frightful was all too inconclusive and the message sent by the dwarf was somewhat cabalistic everyone felt however that some gigantic menace some black infernal enchantment was being brewed within the ruinous walls the malign moribund dwarf was all too readily identified with the missing sorcerer nathaire and his underlings it was plain were nathaires pupils the goingforth of gaspard du nord alone in his attic chamber gaspard du nord student of alchemy and sorcery and quondam pupil of nathaire sought repeatedly but always in vain to consult the vipercircled mirror the glass remained obscure and cloudy as with the risen fumes of satanical alembics or baleful necromantic braziers haggard and weary with long nights of watching gaspard knew that nathaire was even more vigilant than he reading with anxious care the general configuration of the stars he found the foretokening of a great evil that was to come upon averoigne but the nature of the evil was not clearly shown in the meanwhile the hideous resurrection and migration of the dead was taking place all averoigne shuddered at the manifold enormity like the timeless night of a memphian plague terror settled everywhere and people spoke of each new atrocity in bated whispers without daring to voice the execrable tale aloud to gaspard as to everyone the whispers came and likewise after the horror had apparently ceased in early midsummer there came the appalling story of the cistercian monks now at last the longbaffled watcher found an inkling of that which he sought the hidingplace of the fugitive necromancer and his apprentices at least had been uncovered and the disappearing dead were clearly traced to their bourn but still even for the percipient gaspard there remained an undeclared enigma the exact nature of the abominable brew the helldark sorcery that nathaire was concocting in his remote den gaspard felt sure of one thing only the dying splenetic dwarf knowing that his allotted time was short and hating the people of averoigne with a bottomless rancour would prepare an enormous and maleficent magic without parallel even with his knowledge of nathaires proclivities and his awareness of the wellnigh inexhaustible arcanic science the reserves of pitdeep wizardry possessed by the dwarf he could form only vague terrifical conjectures anent the incubated evil but as time went on he felt an everdeepening oppression the adumbration of a monstrous menace crawling from the dark rim of the world he could not shake off his disquietude and finally he resolved despite the obvious perils of such an excursion to pay a secret visit to the neightborhood of ylourgne gaspard though he came of a welltodo family was at that time in straitened circumstances for his devotion to a somewhat doubtful science had been disapproved by his father his sole income was a small pittance purveyed secretly to the youth by his mother and sister this sufficed for his meagre food the rent of his room and a few books and instruments and chemicals but it would not permit the purchase of a horse or even a humble mule for the proposed journey of more than forty miles undaunted he set forth on foot carrying only a dagger and a wallet of food he timed his wanderings so that he would reach ylourgne at nightfall in the rising of a full moon much of his journey lay through the great lowering forest which approached the very walls of vyones on the eastern side and ran in a sombre arc through averoigne to the mouth of the rocky valley below ylourgne after a few miles he emerged from the mighty wood of pines and oaks and larches and thenceforward for the first day followed the river isoile thiough an open wellpeopled plain he spent the warm summer night beneath a beechtree in the vicinity of a small village not caring to sleep in the lonely woods where robbers and wolves and creatures of a more baleful repute were commonly supposed to dwell at evening of the second day after passing through the wildest and oldest portion of the immemorial wood he came to the steep stony valley that led to his destination this valley was the fountainhead of the isoile which had dwindled to a mere rivulet in the brown twilight between sunset and moonrise he saw the lights of the cistercian monastery and opposite on the piled forbidding scarps the grim and rugged mass of the ruinous stronghold of ylourgne with wan and wizard fires flickering behind its high embrasures apart from these fires there was no sign of occupation and he did not hear at any time the dismal noises reported by the monks gaspard waited till the round moon yellow as the eye of some immense nocturnal bird had begun to peer above the darkling valley then very cautiously since the neighbourhood was strange to him he started to make his way towards the sombre brooding castle even for one wellused to such climbing the escalade would have offered enough difficulty and danger by moonlight several times finding himself at the bottom of a sheer cliff he was compelled to retrace his hardwon progress and often he was saved from falling only by stunted shrubs and briars that had taken root in the niggard soil breathless with torn raiment and scored and bleeding hands he gained at length the shoulder of the craggy height below the walls here he paused to recover breath and recuperate his flagging strength he could see from his vantage the pale reflection as of hidden flames that beat upwards on the inner walls of the highbuilt donjon he heard a low hum of confused noises whose distance and direction were alike baffling sometimes they seemed to float downwards from the black battlements sometimes to issue from subterranean depths far in the hill apart from this remote ambiguous hum the night was locked in a mortal stillness the very winds appeared to shun the vicinity of the dread castle an unseen clammy cloud of paralyzing evil hung removeless upon all things and the pale swollen moon the patroness of witches and sorcerers distilled her green poison above the crumbling towers in a silence older than time gaspard felt the obscenely clinging weight of a more burdenous thing than his own fatigue when he resumed his progress towards the barbican invisible webs of the waiting evergathering evil seemed to impede him the slow noisome flapping of intangible wings was heavy in his face he seemed to breathe a surging wind from unfathomable vaults and caverns of corruption inaudible howlings derisive or minatory thronged in his ears and foul hands appeared to thrust him back but bowing his head as if against a blowing gale he went on and climbed the mounded ruin of the barbican into the weedy courtyard the place was deserted to all seeming and much of it was still deep in the shadows of the walls and turrets near by in the black silvercrenellated pile gaspard saw the open cavernous doorway described by the monks it was lit from within by a lurid glare wannish and eerie as marshfires the humming noise now audible as a muttering of voices issued from the doorway and gaspard thought that he could see dark sooty figures moving rapidly in the lit interior keeping in the farther shadows he stole along the courtyard making a sort of circuit amid the ruins he did not dare to approach the open entrance for fear of being seen though as far as he could tell the place was unguarded he came to the donjon on whose upper wall the wan light flickered obliquely through a sort of rift in the long building adjacent this opening was at some distance from the ground and gaspard saw that it had been formerly the door to a stony balcony a flight of broken steps led upwards along the wall to the halfcrumbled remnant of this balcony and it occurred to the youth that he might climb the steps and peer unobserved into the interior of ylourgne some of the stairs were missing and all were in heavy shadow gaspard found his way precariously to the balcony pausing once in considerable alarm when a fragment of the worn stone loosened by his footfall dropped with a loud clattering on the courtyard flags below apparently it was unheard by the occupants of the castle and after a little he resumed his climbing cautiously he neared the large ragged opening through which the light poured upwards crouching on a narrow ledge which was all that remained of the balcony he peered in on a most astounding and terrific spectacle whose details were so bewildering that he could barely comprehend their import till after many minutes it was plain that the story told by the monks allowing for their religious bias had been far from extravagant almost the whole interior of the halfruined pile had been torn down and dismantled to afford room for the activities of nathaire this demolition in itself was a superhuman task for whose execution the sorcerer must have employed a legion of familiars as well as his ten pupils the vast chamber was fitfully illumed by the glare of athanors and braziers and above all by the weird glimmering from the huge stone vats even from his high vantage the watcher could not see the contents of these vats but a white luminosity poured upwards from the rim of one of them and a fleshtinted phosphorescence from the other gaspard had seen certain of the experiments and evocations of nathaire and was all too familiar with the appurtenances of the dark arts within certain limits he was not squeamish nor was it likely that he would have been terrified overmuch by the shadowy uncouth shapes of demons who toiled in the pit below him side by side with the blackclad pupils of the sorcerer but a cold horror clutched his heart when he saw the incredible enormous thing that occupied the central floor the colossal human skeleton a hundred feet in length stretching for more than the extent of the old castle hall the skeleton whose bony right foot the group of men and devils to all appearance were busily clothing with human flesh the prodigious and macabre framework complete in every part with ribs like arches of some satanic nave shone as if it were still heated by the fires of an infernal welding it seemed to shimmer and burn with unnatural life to quiver with malign disquietude in the flickering glare and gloom the great fingerbones curving clawlike on the floor appeared as if they were about to close upon some helpless prey the tremendous teeth were set in an everlasting grin of sardonic cruelty and malice the hollow eyesockets deep as tartarean wells appeared to seethe with myriad mocking lights like the eyes of elementals swimming upwards in obscene shadow gaspard was stunned by the shocking and stupendous fantasmagoria that yawned before him like a peopled hell afterwards he was never wholly sure of certain things and could remember very little of the actual manner in which the work of the men and their assistants was being carried on dim dubious batlike creatures seemed to be flitting to and fro between one of the stone vats and the group that toiled like sculptors clothing the bony foot with a reddish plasm which they applied and moulded like so much clay gaspard thought but was not certain later that this plasm which gleamed as if with mingled blood and fire was being brought from the rosylitten vat in vessels borne by the claws of the shadowy flying creatures none of them however approached the other vat whose wannish light was momently enfeebled as if it were dying down he looked for the minikin figure of nathaire whom he could not distinguish in the crowded scene the sick necromancer if he had not already succumbed to the littleknown disease that had long wasted him like an inward flame was no doubt hidden from view by the colossal skeleton and was perhaps directing the labours of the men and demons from his couch spellbound on that precarious ledge the watcher failed to hear the furtive catlike feet that were climbing behind him on the ruinous stairs too late he heard the clink of a loose fragment close upon his heels and turning in startlement he toppled into sheer oblivion beneath the impact of a cudgellike blow and did not even know that the beginning fall of his body towards the courtyard had been arrested by his assailants arms the horror of ylourgne gaspard returning from his dark plunge into lethean emptiness found himself gazing into the eyes of nathaire those eyes of liquid night and ebony in which swam the chill malignant fires of stars that had gone down to irremeable perdition for some time in the confusion of his senses he could see nothing but the eyes which seemed to have drawn him forth like baleful magnets from his swoon apparently disembodied or set in a face too vast for human cognizance they burned before him in chaotic murk then by degrees he saw the other features of the sorcerer and the details of a lurid scene and became aware of his own situation trying to lift his hands to his aching head he found that they were bound tightly together at the wrists he was half lying half leaning against an object with hard planes and edges that irked his back this object he discovered to be a sort of alchemic furnace or athanor part of a litter of disused apparatus that stood or lay on the castle floor cupels aludels cucurbits like enormous gourds and globes were mingled in strange confusion with the piled ironclasped books and the sooty cauldrons and braziers of a darker science nathaire propped among saracenic cushions with arabesques of sullen gold and fulgurant scarlet was peering upon him from a kind of improvisedcouch made with bales of orient rugs and arrases to whose luxury the rude walls of the castle stained with mould and mottled with dead fungi offered a grotesque foil dim lights and evilly swooping shadows flickered across the scene and gaspard could hear a guttural hum of voices behind him twisting his head a little he saw one of the stone vats whose rosy luminosity was blurred and blotted by vampire wings that went to and fro welcome said nathaire after an interval in which the student began to perceive the fatal progress of illness in the painpinched features before him so gaspard du nord has come to see his former master the harsh imperatory voice with demoniac volume issued appallingly from the wizened frame i have come said gaspard in laconic echo tell me what devils work is this in which i find you engaged and what have you done with the dead bodies that were stolen by your accursed familiars the frail dying body of nathaire as if possessed by some sardonic fiend rocked to and fro on the luxurious couch in a long violent gust of laughter without other reply if your looks bear creditable witness said gaspard when the baleful laughter had ceased you are mortally ill and the time is short in which you can hope to atone for your deeds of malice and make your peace with god if indeed it still be possible for you to make peace what foul and monstrous brew are you preparing to ensure the ultimate perdition of your soul the dwarf was again seized by a spasm of diabolic mirth nay nay my good gaspard he said finally i have made another bond than the one with which puling cowards try to purchase the good will and forgiveness of the heavenly tyrant hell may take me in the end if it will but hell has paid and will still pay an ample and goodly price i must die soon it is true for my doom is written in the stars but in death by the grace of satan i live again and shall go forth endowed with the mighty thews of the anakim to visit vengeance on the people of averoigne who have long hated me for my necromantic wisdom and have held me in derision for my dwarf stature what madness is this whereof you dream asked the youth appalled by the more than human frenzy and malignity that seemed to dilate the shrunken frame of nathaire and stream in tartarean lustre from his eyes it is no madness but a veritable thing a miracle mayhap as life itself is a miracle from the fresh bodies of the dead which otherwise would have rotted away in charnel foulness my pupils and familiars are making for me beneath my instruction the giant form whose skeleton you have beheld my soul at the death of its present body will pass into this colossal tenement through the working of certain spells of transmigration in which my faithful assistants have also been carefully instructed if you had remained with me gaspard and had not drawn back in your petty pious squeamishness from the marvels and profundities that i should have unveiled for you it would now be your privilege to share in the creation of this prodigy and if you had come to ylourgne a little sooner in your presumptuous prying i might have made a certain use of your stout bones and muscles the same use i have made of other young men who died through accident or violence but it is too late even for this since the building of the bones has been completed and it remains only to invest them with human flesh my good gaspard there is nothing whatever to be done with you except to put you safely out of the way providentially for this purpose there is an oubliette beneath the castle a somewhat dismal lodgingplace no doubt but one that was made strong and deep by the grim lords of ylourgne gaspard was unable to frame any reply to this sinister and extraordinary speech searching his horrorfrozen brain for words he felt himself seized from behind by the hands of unseen beings who had come no doubt in answer to some gesture of nathaire a gesture which the captive had not perceived he was blindfolded with some heavy fabric mouldy and musty as a gravecloth and was led stumbling through the litter of strange apparatus and down a winding flight of ruinous narrow stairs from which the noisome breath of stagnating water mingled with the oily muskiness of serpents arose to meet him he appeared to descend for a distance that would admit of no return slowly the stench grew stronger more insupportable the stairs ended a door clanged sullenly on rusty hinges and gaspard was thrust forward on a damp uneven floor that seemed to have been worn away by myriad feet he heard the grating of a ponderous slab of stone his wrists were untied the bandage was removed from his eyes and he saw by the light of flickering torches a round hole that yawned in the oozing floor at his feet beside it was the lifted slab that had formed its lid before he could turn to see the faces of his captors to learn if they were men or devils he was seized rudely and thrust into the gaping hole he fell through erebuslike darkness for what seemed an immense distance before he struck bottom lying half stunned in a shallow fetid pool he heard the funereal thud of the heavy slab as it slid back into place far above him the vaults of ylourgne gaspard was revived after a while by the chillness of the water in which he lay his garments were half soaked and the slimy mephitic pool as he discovered by his first movement was within an inch of his mouth he could hear a steady monotonous dripping somewhere in the rayless night of his dungeon he staggered to his feet finding that his bones were still intact and began a cautious exploration foul drops fell upon his hair and lifted face as he moved his feet slipped and splashed in the rotten water there were angry vehement hissings and serpentine coils slithered coldly across his ankles he soon came to a rough wall of stone and following the wall with his fingertips he tried to determine the extent of the oubliette the place was more or less circular without corners and he failed to form any just idea of its circuit somewhere in his wanderings he found a shelving pile of rubble that rose above the water against the wall and here for the sake of comparative dryness and comfort he ensconced himself after dispossessimg a number of outraged reptiles these creatures it seemed were inoffensive and probably belonged to some species of watersnake but he shivered at the touch of their clammy scales sitting on the rubbleheap gaspard reviewed in his mind the various horrors of a situation that was infinitely dismal and desperate he had learned the incredible soulshaking secret of ylourgne the unimaginably monstrous and blasphemous project of nathaire but now immured in this noisome hole as in a subterranean tomb in depths beneath the devilhaunted pile he could not even warn the world of imminent menace the wallet of food now more than half empty with which he had started from vyones was still hanging at his back and he assured himself by investigation that his captors had not troubled to deprive him of his dagger gnawing a crust of stale bread in the darkness and caressing with his hand the hilt of the precious weapon he sought for some rift in the allenvironing despair he had no means of measuring the black hours that went over him with the slowness of a slimeclogged river crawling in blind silence to a subterrene sea the ceaseless drip of water probably from sunken hillsprings that had supplied the castle in former years alone broke the stillness but the sound became in time an equivocal monotone that suggested to his halfdelirious mind the mirthless and perpetual chuckling of unseen imps at last from sheer bodily exhaustion he fell into troubled nightmareridden chamber he could not tell if it were night or noon in the world without when he awakened for the same stagnant darkness unrelieved by ray or glimmer brimmed the oubliette shivering he became aware of a steady draught that blew upon him a dank unwholesome air like the breath of unsunned vaults that had wakened into cryptic iife and activity during his sleep he had not noticed the draught heretofore and his numb brain was startled into sudden hope by the intimation which it conveyed obviously there was some underground rift or channel through which the air entered and this rift might somehow prove to be a place of egress from the oubliette getting to his feet he groped uncertainly forward in the direction of the draught he stumbled over something that cracked and broke beneath his heels and narrowly checked himself from falling on his face in tbe slimy serpenthaunted pool before he could investigate the obstruction or resume his blind groping he heard a harsh grating noise above and a wavering shaft of yellow light came down through the oubliettes opened mouth dazzled he looked up and saw the round hole ten or twelve feet overhead through which a dark hand had reached down with a flaring torch a small basket containing a loaf of coarse bread and a bottle of wine was being lowered at the end of a cord gaspard took the bread and wine and the basket was drawn up before the withdrawal of the torch and the redepositing of the slab he contrived to make a hasty survey of his dungeon the place was roughly circular as he had surmised and was perhaps fifteen feet in diameter the thing over which he had stumbled was a human skeleton lying half on the rubbleheap half in the filthy water it was brown and rotten with age and its garments had long melted away in patches of liquid mould the walls were guttered and runnelled by centuries of ooze and their very stone it seemed was rotting slowly to decay in the opposite side at the bottom he saw the opening he had suspected a low mouth not much bigger than a foxes hole into which the sluggish water fiowed his heart sank at the sight for even if the water were deeper than it seemed the hole was far too strait for the passage of a mans body in a state of hopelessness that was like a veritable suffocation he found his way back to the rubblepile when the light had been withdrawn the loaf of bread and the bottle of wine were still in his hands mechanically with dull sodden hunger he munched and drank afterwards he felt stronger and the sour common wine served to warm him and perhaps helped to inspire him with the idea which he presently conceived finishing the bottle he found his way across the dungeon to the low burrowlike hole the entering air current had strengthened and this he took for a good omen drawing his dagger he started to pick with the point at the halfrotten decomposing wall in an effort to enlarge the opening he was forced to kneel in noisome silt and the writhing coils of watersnakes hissing frightfully crawled across his legs as he worked evidently the hole was their means of ingress and egress to and from the oubliette the stone crumbled readily beneath his dagger and gaspard forgot the horror and ghastliness of his situation in the hope of escape he had no means of knowing the thickness of the wall or the nature and extent of the subterrenes that lay beyond but he felt sure that there was some channel of connection with the outer air for hours or days it seemed he toiled with his dagger digging blindly at the soft wall and removing the d–∏bris that splashed in the water beside him after a while prone on his belly he crept into the hole he had enlarged and burrowing like some laborious mole he made his way onwards inch by inch at last to his prodigious relief the daggerpoint went through into empty space he broke away with his hands the thin shell of obstructing stone that remained then crawling on in the darkness he found that he could stand upright on a sort of shelving floor straightening his cramped limbs he moved on very cautiously he was in a narrow vault or tunnel whose sides he could touch simultaneously with his outstretched fingertips the floor was a downwards incline and the water deepened rising to his knees and then to his waist probably the place had once been used as an underground exit from the castle and the roof falling in had dammed the water more than a little dismayed gaspard began to wonder if he had exchanged the foul skeletonhaunted oubliette for something even worse the night around and before him was still untouched by any ray and the aircurrent though strong was laden with dankness and mouldiness as of interminable vaults touching the tunnelsides at intervals as he plunged hesitantly into the deepening water he found a sharp angle giving upon free space at his right the space proved to be the mouth of an intersecting passage whose flooded bottom was at least level and went no deeper into the stagnant foulness exploring it he stumbled over the beginning of a flight of upward steps mounting these through the shoaling water he soon found himself on dry stone the stairs narrow broken irregular without landings appeared to wind in some eternal spiral that was coiled lightlessly about the bowels of ylourgne they were close and stifling as a tomb and plainly they were not the source of the aircurrent which gaspard had started to follow whither they would lead he knew not nor could he tell if they were the same stairs by which he had been conducted to his dungeon but he climbed steadily pausing only at long intervals to regain his breath as best he could in the dead mephitisburdened air at length in the solid darkness far above he began to hear a mysterious muffled sound a dull but recurrent crash as of mighty blocks and masses of falling stone the sound was unspeakably ominous and dismal and it seemed to shake the unfathomable walls around gaspard and to thrill with a sinister vibration in the steps on which he trod he climbed now with redoubled caution and alertness stopping ever and anon to listen the recurrent crashing noise grew louder more ominous as if it were immediately above and the listener crouched on the dark stairs for a time that might have been many minutes without daring to go farther at last with disconcerting suddenness the sound came to an end leaving a strained and fearful stillness with many baleful conjectures not knowing what fresh enormity he should find gaspard ventured to resume his climbing again in the blank and solid stillness he was met by a sound the dim reverberant chanting of voices as in some satanic mass or liturgy with dirgelike cadences that turned to intolerably soaring paeans of evil triumph long before he could recognize the words he shivered at the strong malefic throbbing of the measured rhythm whose fall and rise appeared somehow to correspond to the heartbeats of some colossal demon the stairs turned for the hundredth time in their tortuous spiral and coming forth from that long midnight gaspard blinked in the wan glimmering that streamed towards him from above the choral voices met him in a more sonorous burst of infernal sound and he knew the words for those of a rare and potent incantation used by sorcerers for a supremely foul supremely maleficent purpose affrightedly as he climbed the last steps he knew the thing that was taking place amid the ruins of ylourgne lifting his head warily above the castle floor he saw that the stairs ended in a far corner of the vast room in which he had beheld nathaires unthinkable creation the whole extent of the internally dismantled building lay before him filled with a weird glare in which the beams of the slightly gibbous moon were mingled with the ruddy flames of dying athanors and the coiling multicoloured tongues that rose from necromantic braziers gaspard for an instant was puzzled by the flood of full moonlight amid the ruins then he saw that almost the whole inner wall of the castle giving on the courtyard had been removed it was the tearingdown of the prodigious blocks no doubt through an extrahuman labour levied by sorcery that he had heard during his ascent from the subterrene vaults his blood curdled he felt an actual horripilation as he realized the purpose for which the wall had been demolished it was evident that a whole day and part of another night had gone by since his immurement for the moon rode high in the pale sapphire welkin bathed in its chilly glare the huge vats no longer emitted their eerie and electric phosphorescence the couch of saracen fabrics on which gaspard had beheld the dying dwarf was now half hidden from view by the mounting fumes of braziers and thuribles amid which the sorcerers ten pupils clad in sable and scarlet were performing their hideous and repugnant rite with its malefically measured litany fearfully as one who confronts an apparition reared up from nether hell gaspard beheld the colossus that lay inert as if in cyclopean sleep on the castle flags the thing was no longer a skeleton the limbs were rounded into bossed enormous thews like the limbs of biblical giants the flanks were like an insuperable wall the deltoids of the mighty chest were broad as platform the hands could have crushed the bodies of men like millstones but the face of the stupendous monster seen in profile athwart the pouring moon was the face of the satanic dwarf nathaire remagnified a hundred times but the same in its implacable madness and malevolence the vast bosom seemed to rise and fall and during a pause of the necromantic ritual gaspard heard the unmistakable sound of a mighty respiration the eye in the profile was closed but its lid appeared to tremble like a great curtain as if the monster were about to wake and the outflung hand with fingers pale and bluish as a row of corpses twitched unquietly on the castle flags an insupportable terror seized the watcher but even this terror could not induce him to return to the noisome vaults he had left with infinite hesitation and trepidation he stole forth from the corner keeping in a zone of ebon shadow that flanked the castle wall as he went he saw for a moment through bellying folds of vapour the couch on which the shrunken form of nathaire was lying pallid and motionless it seemed that the dwarf was dead or had fallen into a stupor preceding death then the choral voices crying their dreadful incantation rose higher in satanic triumph the vapours eddied like a hellborn cloud coiling about the sorcerers in pythonshaped volumes and hiding again the orient couch and its corpselike occupant a thraldom of measureless evil oppressed the air gaspard felt that the awful transmigration evoked and implored with everswelling liturgic blasphemies was about to take place had perhaps already occurred he thought that the breathing giant stirred like one who tosses in light slumber soon the towering massively recumbent hulk was interposed between gaspard and the chanting necromancers they had not seen him and he now dared to run swiftly and gained the courtyard unpursued and unchallenged thence without looking back he fled like a devilhunted thing upon the steep and chasmriven slopes below ylourgne the coming of the colossus after the cessation of the exodus of liches a universal terror still prevailed a wideflung shadow of apprehension infernal and funereal lay stagnantly on averoigne there were strange and disastrous portents in the aspect of the skies flamebearded meteors had been seen to fall beyond the eastern hills a comet far in the south had swept the stars with its luminous bosom for a few nights and had then faded leaving among men the prophecy of bale and pestilence to come by day the air was oppressed and sultry and the blue heavens were heated as if by whitish fires clouds of thunder darkling and withdrawn shook their fulgurant lances on the far horizons like some beleaguering titan army a murrain such as would come from the working of wizard spells was abroad among the cattle all these signs and prodigies were an added heaviness on the burdened spirits of men who went to and fro in daily fear of the hidden preparations and machinations of hell but until the actual breakingforth of the incubated menace there was no one save gaspard du nord who had knowledge of its veritable form and gaspard fleeing headlong beneath the gibbous moon towards vyones and fearing to hear the tread of a colossal pursuer at any moment had thought it more than useless to give warning in such towns and villages as lay upon his line of sight where indeed even if warned could men hope to hide themselves from the awful thing begotten by hell on the ravished charnel that would walk forth like the anakim to visit its roaring wrath on a trampled world so all that night and throughout the day that followed gaspard du nord with the dried slime of the oubliette on his briarshredded raiment plunged like a madman through the towering woods that were haunted by robbers and werewolves the westwardfalling moon flickered in his eyes betwixt the gnarled sombre boles as he ran and the dawn overtook him with the pale shafts of its searching arrows the noon poured over him its white sultriness like furnaceheated metal sublimed into light and the clotted filth that clung to his tatters was again turned into slime by his own sweat but still he pursued his nightmareharried way while a vague seemingly hopeless plan took form in his mind in the interim several monks of the cistercian brotherhood watching the grey wall of ylourgne at early dawn with their habitual vigilance were the first after gaspard to behold the monstrous horror created by the necromancers their account may have been somewhat tinged by a pious exaggeration but they swore that the giant rose abruptly standing more than waisthigh above the ruins of the barbican amid a sudden leaping of longtongued fires and a swirling of pitchy fumes erupted from malbolge the giants head was level with the high top of the donjon and his right arm outthrust lay like a bar of stormy cloud athwart the newrisen sun the monks fell grovelling to their knees thinking that the archfoe himself had come forth using ylourgne for his gateway from the pit then across the milewide valley they heard a thunderous peal of demoniac laughter and the giant climbing over the mounded barbican at a single step began to descend the scarped and craggy hill when he drew nearer bounding from slope to slope his features were manifestly those of some great devil animated with ire and malice towards the sons of adam his hair in matted locks streamed behind him like a mass of black pythons his naked skin was livid and pale and cadaverous with the skin of the dead but beneath it the stupendous thews of a titan swelled and rippled the eyes wide and glaring flamed like lidless cauldrons heated by the fires of the unplumbed pit the rumour of his coming passed like a gale of terror through the monastery many of the brothers deeming discretion the better part of religious fervour hid themselves in the stonehewn cellars and vaults others crouched in their cells mumbling and shrieking incoherent pleas to all the saints still others the most courageous repaired in a body to the chapel and knelt in solemn prayer before the wooden christ on the great crucifix bernard and stephane now somewhat recovered from their grievous beating alone dared to watch the advance of the giant their horror was inexpressibly increased when they began to recognize in the colossal features a magnified likeness to the lineaments of that evil dwarf who had presided over the dark unhallowed activities of ylourgne and the laughter of the colossus as he came down the valley was like a tempestborne echo of the damnable cachinnation that had followed their ignominious flight from the haunted stronghold to bernard and stephane however it seemed merely that the dwarf who was no doubt an actual demon had chosen to appear in his natural form pausing in the valleybottom the giant stood opposite the monastery with his flamefilled eyes on a level with the window from which bemard and stephane were peering he laughed again an awful laugh like a subterranean rurnbling and then stooping he picked up a handful of boulders as if they had been pebbles and proceeded to pelt the monastery the boulders crashed against the walls as if hurled from great catapults or mangonels of war but the stout building held though shaken grievously then with both hands the colossus tore loose an immense rock that was deeply embedded in the hillside and lifting this rock he flung it at the stubborn walls the tremendous mass broke in an entire side of the chapel and those who had gathered therein were found later crushed into bloody pulp amid the splinters of their carven christ after that as if disdaining to palter any further with a prey so insignificant the colossus turned his back on the little monastery and like some fiendborn goliath went roaring down the valley into averoigne as he departed bernard and stephane still watching from their window saw a thing they had not perceived heretofore a huge basket made of planking that hung suspended by ropes between the giants shoulders in the basket ten men the pupils and assistants of nathaire were being carried like so many dolls or puppets in a peddlers pack of the subsequent wanderings and depredations of the colossus a hundred legends were long current throughout averoigne tales of an unexampled ghastliness a wanton diabolism without parallel in all the histories of that demonpestered land the goatherds of the hills below ylourgne saw him coming and fled with their nimblefooted flocks to the highest ridges to these he paid little heed merely trampling them down like beetles when they could not escape from his path following the hillstream that was the source of the river isoile he came to the verge of the great forest and here it is related he tore up a towering ancient pine by the roots and snapping off the mighty boughs with his hands shaped it into a cudgel which he carried henceforward with this cudgel heavier than a batteringram he pounded into shapeless ruin a wayside shrine in the outer woods a hamlet fell in his way and he strode through it beating in the roofs toppling the walls and crushing the inhabitants beneath his feet to and fro in a mad frenzy of destruction like a deathdrunken cyclops he wandered all that day even the fierce beasts of the woodland ran from him in fear the wolves in midhunt abandoned their quarry and retired howling dismally with terror to their rocky dens the black savage huntingdogs of the forest barons would not face him and hid whimpering in their kennels men heard his mighty laughter his stormy bellowing they saw his approach from a distance of many leagues and fled or concealed themselves as best they could the lords of moated castles called in their menatarms drew up their drawbridges and prepared as if for the siege of an army the peasants hid themselves in caverns in cellars in old wells and even beneath haymounds hoping that he would pass them by unnoticed the churches were crammed with refugees who sought protection of the cross deeming that satan himself or one of his chief lieutenants had risen to harry and lay waste the land in a voice like summer thunder mad maledictions unthinkable obscenities and blasphemies were uttered ceaselessly by the giant as he went to and fro men heard him address the litter of blackclad figures that he carried on his back in tones of admonishment or demonstration such as a master would use to his pupils people who had known nathaire recognized the incredible likeness of the huge features the similarity of the swollen voice to his a rumour went abroad that the dwarf sorcerer through his loathly bond with the adversary had been permitted to transfer his hateful soul into this titanic form and bearing his pupils with him had returned to vent an insatiable ire a bottomless rancour on the world that had mocked him for his puny physique and reviled him for his sorcery the charnel genesis of the monstrous avatar was also rumoured and indeed it was said that the colossus had openly proclaimed his identity it would be tedious to make explicit mention of all the enormities all the atrocities that were ascribed to the marauding giant there were people mostly priests and women it is told whom he picked up as they fled and pulled limb from limb as a child might quarter an insect and there were worse things not to be named in this record many eyewitnesses told how he hunted pierre the lord of la fr–∫naie who had gone forth with his dogs and men to chase a noble stag in the nearby forest overtaking horse and rider he caught them with one hand and bearing them aloft as he strode over the treetops he hurled them later against the granite walls of the chateau of la fr–∫naie in passing then catching the red stag that pierre had hunted he flung it after them and the huge bloody blotches made by the impact of the bashed bodies remained long on the castle stone and were never wholly washed away by the autumn rains and the winter snows countless tales were told also of the deeds of obscene sacrilege and profanation committed by the colossus of the wooden virgin that he flung into the isoile above ximes lashed with human gut to the rotting mailclad body of an infamous outlaw of the wormy corpses that he dug with his hands from unconsecrated graves and hurled into the courtyard of the benedictine abbey of perigon of the church of ste zenobie which he buried with its priests and congregation beneath a mountain of ordure made by the gathering of all the dungheaps from neighbouring farms the laying of the colossus back and forth in an irregular drunken zigzag course from end to end and side to side of the harried realm the giant strode without pause like an energumen possessed by some implacable fiend of mischief and murder leaving behind him as a reaper leaves his swath an everlengthening zone of havoc of rapine and carnage and when the sun blackened by the smoke of burning villages had set luridly beyond the forest men still saw him moving in the dusk and heard still the portentous rumbling of his mad stormy cachinnation nearing the gates of vyones at sunset gaspard du nord saw behind him through gaps in the ancient wood the faroff head and shoulders of the terrible colossus who moved along the isoile stooping from sight at intervals in some horrid deed though numb with weariness and exhaustion gaspard quickened his flight he did not believe however that the monster would try to invade vyones the especial object of nathaires hatred and malice before the following day the evil soul of the sorcerous dwarf exulting in its almost infinite capacity for harm and destruction would defer the crowning act of vengeance and would continue to terrorize during the night the outlying villages and rural districts in spite of his rags and filth which rendered him practically unrecognizable and gave him a most disreputable air gaspard was admitted without question by the guards at the city gate vyones was already thronged with people who had fled to the sanctuary of its stout walls from the adjacent countryside and no one not even of the most dubious character was denied admittance the walls were lined with archers and pikebearers gathered in readiness to dispute the entrance of the giant crossbowmen were stationed above the gates and mangonels were mounted at short intervals along the entire circuit of the ramparts the city seethed and hummed like an agitated hive hysteria and pandemonium prevailed in the streets pale panicstricken faces milled everywhere in an aimless stream hurrying torches flared dolorously in the twilight that deepened as if with the shadow of impending wings arisen from erebus the gloom was clogged with intangible fear with webs of stifling oppression through all this rout of wild disorder and frenzy gaspard like a spent but indomitable swimmer breasting some tide of eternal viscid nightmare made his way slowly to his attic lodgings afterwards he could scarcely remember eating and drinking overworn beyond the limit of bodily and spiritual endurance he threw himself down on his pallet without removing his oozestiffened tatters and slept soddenly till an hour halfway between midnight and dawn he awoke with the deathpale beams of the gibbous moon shining upon him through his window and rising spent the balance of the night in making certain occult preparations which he felt offered the only possibility of coping with the fiendish monster that had been created and animated by nathaire working feverishly by the light of the westering moon and a single dim taper gaspard assembled various ingredients of familiar alchemic use which he possessed and compounded from these through a long and somewhat cabalistic process a darkgrey powder which he had seen employed by nathaire on numerous occasions he had reasoned that the colossus being formed from the bones and flesh of dead men unlawfully raised up and energized only by the soul of a dead sorcerer would be subject to the influence of this powder which nathaire had used for the laying of resurrected liches the powder if cast in the nostrils of such cadavers would cause them to return peacefully to their tombs and lie down in a renewed slumber of death gaspard made a considerable quantity of the mixture arguing that no mere fingerpinch would suffice for the lulling of the gigantic charnel monstrosity his guttering yellow candle was dimmed by the white dawn as he ended the latin formula of fearsome verbal invocation from which the compound would derive much of its efficacy the formula which called for the cooperation of alastor and other evil spirits he used with unwillingness but he knew that there was no alternative sorcery could be fought only with sorcery morning came with new terrors to vyones gaspard had felt through a sort of intuition that the vengeful colossus who was said to have wandered with unhuman tirelessness and diabolic energy all night through averoigne would approach the hated city early in the day his intuition was confirmed for scarcely had he finished his occult labours when he heard a mounting hubbub in the streets and above the shrill dismal clamour of frightened voices the faroff roaring of the giant gaspard knew that he must lose no time if he were to post himself in a place of vantage from which he could throw his powder into the nostrils of the hundredfoot colossus the city walls and even most of the church spires were not lofty enough for this purpose and a brief reflection told him that the great cathedral standing at the core of vyones was the one place from whose roof he could front the invader with success he felt sure that the menatarms on the walls could do little to prevent the monster from entering and wreaking his malevolent will no earthly weapon could injure a being of such bulk and nature for even a cadaver of normal size reared up in this fashion could be shot full of arrows or transfixed by a dozen pikes without retarding its progress hastily he filled a huge leathern pouch with the powder and carrying the pouch at his belt he joined the agitated press of pople in the street many were fleeing towards the cathedral to seek the shelter of its august sanctity and he had only to let himself be borne along by the frenzydriven stream the cathedral nave was packed with worshippers and solemn masses were being said by priests whose voices faltered at times with inward panic unheeded by the wan despairing throng gaspard found a flight of coiling stairs that led tortuously to the gargoylewarded roof of the high tower here he posted himself crouching behind the stone figure of a catheaded griffin from his vantage he could see beyond the crowded spires and gables the approaching giant whose head and torso loomed above the city walls a cloud of arrows visible even at that distance rose to meet the monster who apparently did not even pause to pluck them from his hide great boulders hurled from mangonels were no more to him than a pelting of gravel the heavy bolts of arbalests embedded in his flesh were mere slivers nothing could stay his advance the tiny figures of a company of pikemen who opposed him with outthrust weapons swept from the wall above the eastern gate by a single sidelong blow of the seventyfoot pine that he bore for a cudgel then having cleared the wall the colossus climbed over it into vyones roaring chuckling laughing like a maniacal cyclops he strode along the narrow streets between houses that rose only to his waist trampling without mercy everyone who could not escape in time and smashing in the roofs with stupendous blows of his bludgeon with a push of his left hand he broke off the protruding gables and overturned the church steeples with their bells clanging in dolorous alarm as they went down a woeful shrieking and wailing of hysterialaden voices accompanied his passing straight towards the cathedral he came as gaspard had calculated feeling that the high edifice would be made the special butt of his malevolence the streets were now emptied of people but as if to hunt them out and crush them in their hidingplaces the giant thrust his cudgel like a batteringram through walls and windows and roofs as he went by the ruin and havoc that he left was indescribable soon he loomed opposite the cathedral tower on which gaspard waited behind the gargoyle his head was level with the tower and his eyes flamed like wells of burning brimstone as he drew near his lips were parted over stalactitic fangs in a hateful snarl and he cried out in a voice like the rumbling of articulate thunder ho ye puling priests and devotees of a powerless god come forth and bow to nathaire the master before he sweeps you into limbo it was then that gaspard with a hardihood beyond comparison rose from his hidingplace and stood in full view of the raging colossus draw nearer nathaire if indeed it be you foul robber of tombs and charnels he taunted come close for i would hold speech with you a monstrous look of astonishment dimmed the diabolic rage on the colossal features peering at gaspard as if in doubt or incredulity the giant lowered his lifted cudgel and stepped close to the tower till his face was only a few feet from the intrepid student then when he had apparently convinced himself of gaspards identity the look of maniacal wrath returned flooding his eyes with tartarean fire and twisting his lineaments into a mask of apollyonlike malignity his left arm came up in a prodigious arc with twitching fingers that poised horribly above the head of the youth casting upon him a vultureblack shadow in the fullrisen sun gaspard saw the white startled faces of the necromancers pupils peering over his shoulder from their plankbuilt basket is it you gaspard my recreant pupil the colossus roared stormily i thought you were rotting in the oubliette beneath ylourgne and now i find you perched atop of this accursed cathedral which i am about to demolish you had been far wiser to remain where i left you my good gaspard his breath as he spoke blew like a charnelpolluted gale on the student his vast fingers with blackened nails like shovelblades hovered in ogreish menace gaspard had furtively loosened his leathern pouch that hung at his belt and had untied its mouth now as the twitching fingers descended towards him he emptied the contents of the pouch in the giants face and the fine powder mounting in a darkgrey cloud obscured the snarling lips and palpitating nostrils from his view anxiously he watched the effect fearing that the powder might be useless after all against the superior arts and satanical resources of nathaire but miraculously as it seemed the evil lambence died in the pitdeep eyes as the monster inhaled the flying cloud his lifted hand narrowly missing the crouching youth in its sweep fell lifelessly at his side the anger was erased from the mighty contorted mask as if from the face of a dead man the great cudgel fell with a crash to the empty street and with drowsy lurching steps and listless hanging arms the giant turned his back to the cathedral and retraced his way through the devastated city he muttered dreamily to himself as he went and people who heard him swore that the voice was no longer the awful thunderswollen voice of nathaire but the tones and accents of a multitude of men amid which the voices of certain of the ravished dead were recognizable and the voice of nathaire himself no louder now than in life was heard at intervals through the manifold mutterings as if protesting angrily climbing the eastern wall as it had come the colossus went to and fro for many hours no longer wreaking a hellish wrath and rancour but searching as people thought for the various tombs and graves from which the hundreds of bodies that composed it had been so foully reft from charnel to charnel from cemetery to cemetery it went through all the land but there was no grave anywhere in which the dead colossus could lie down then towards evening men saw it from afar on the red rim of the sky digging with its hands in the soft loamy plain beside the river isoile there in a monstrous and selfmade grave the colossus laid itself down and did not rise again the ten pupils of nathaire it was believed unable to descend from their basket were crushed beneath the mighty body for none of them was ever seen thereafter for many days no one dared to approach the place where the corpse lay uncovered in its selfdug grave and so the thing rotted prodigiously beneath the summer sun breeding a mighty stench that wrought pestilence in that portion of averoigne and they who ventured to go near in the following autumn when the stench had lessened greatly swore that the voice of nathaire still protesting angrily was heard by them to issue from the enormous rookhaunted bulk of gaspard du nord who had been the saviour of the province it was related that he lived in much honour to a ripe age being the one sorcerer of that region who at no time incurred the disapprobation of the church
