a gesture and a quest telemachus had wandered so far in search of his father he had quite forgotten what he was looking for he sat on a yellow plush bench in the cafй el oro del rhin plaza santa ana madrid swabbing up with a bit of bread the last smudges of brown sauce off a plate of which the edges were piled with the dismembered skeleton of a pigeon opposite his plate was a similar plate his companion had already polished telemachus put the last piece of bread into his mouth drank down a glass of beer at one spasmodic gulp sighed leaned across the table and said i wonder why im here why anywhere else than here said lyaeus a young man with hollow cheeks and slowmoving hands about whose mouth a faint pained smile was continually hovering and he too drank down his beer at the end of a perspective of white marble tables faces thrust forward over yellow plush cushions under twining veils of tobacco smoke four german women on a little dais were playing tannhauser smells of beer sawdust shrimps roast pigeon do you know jorge manrique thats one reason tel the other man continued slowly with one hand he gestured to the waiter for more beer the other he waved across his face as if to brush away the music then he recited pronouncing the words haltingly recuerde el alma dormida avive el seso y despierte contemplando cуmo se pasa la vida cуmo se viene la muerte tan callando cuбn presto se va el placer cуmo despuйs de acordado da dolor cуmo a nuestro parecer cualquier tiempo pasado fuй mejor its always death said telemachus but we must go on it had been raining lights rippled red and orange and yellow and green on the clean pavingstones a cold wind off the sierra shrilled through clattering streets as they walked the other man was telling how this castilian nobleman courtier manatarms had shut himself up when his father the master of santiago died and had written this poem created this tremendous rhythm of death sweeping like a wind over the world he had never written anything else they thought of him in the court of his great dustcolored mansion at ocaсa where the broad eaves were full of a cooing of pigeons and the wide halls had dark rafters painted with arabesques in vermilion in a suit of black velvet writing at a table under a lemon tree down the sunscarred street in the cathedral that was building in those days full of a smell of scaffolding and stone dust there must have stood a tremendous catafalque where lay with his arms around him the master of santiago in the carved seats of the choirs the stout canons intoned an endless growling litany at the sacristy door the flare of the candles flashing occasionally on the jewels of his mitre the bishop fingered his crosier restlessly asking his favorite choirboy from time to time why don jorge had not arrived and messengers must have come running to don jorge telling him the service was on the point of beginning and he must have waved them away with a grave gesture of a long white hand while in his mind the distant sound of chanting the jingle of the silver bit of his roan horse stamping nervously where he was tied to a twined moorish column memories of cavalcades filing with braying of trumpets and flutter of crimson damask into conquered towns of court ladies dancing and the noise of pigeons in the eaves drew together like strings plucked in succession on a guitar into a great wave of rhythm in which his life was sucked away into this one poem in praise of death nuestras vidas son los rнos que van a dar en la mar que es el morir telemachus was saying the words over softly to himself as they went into the theatre the orchestra was playing a sevillana as they found their seats they caught glimpses beyond peoples heads and shoulders of a huge woman with a comb that pushed the tip of her mantilla a foot and a half above her head dancing with ponderous dignity her dress was pink flounced with lace under it the bulge of breasts and belly and three chins quaked with every thump of her tiny heels on the stage as they sat down she retreated bowing like a fullrigged ship in a squall the curtain fell the theatre became very still next was pastora strumming of a guitar whirring fast dry like locusts in a hedge on a summer day pauses that catch your blood and freeze it suddenly still like the rustling of a branch in silent woods at night a gipsy in a red sash is playing slouched into a cheap cane chair behind him a faded crimson curtain off stage heels beaten on the floor catch up the rhythm with tentative interest drowsily then suddenly added sharp click of fingers snapped in time the rhythm slows hovers like a bee over a clover flower a little taut sound of air sucked in suddenly goes down the rows of seats with faintest tapping of heels faintest snapping of the fingers of a brown hand held over her head erect wrapped tight in yellow shawl where the embroidered flowers make a splotch of maroon over one breast a flecking of green and purple over shoulders and thighs pastora imperio comes across the stage quietly unhurriedly in the mind of telemachus the words return cуmo se viene la muerte tan callando her face is brown with a pointed chin her eyebrows that nearly meet over her nose rise in a flattened a towards the fervid black gleam of her hair her lips are pursed in a halfsmile as if she were stifling a secret she walks round the stage slowly one hand at her waist the shawl tight over her elbow her thighs lithe and restless a panther in a cage at the back of the stage she turns suddenly advances the snapping of her fingers gets loud insistent a thrill whirrs through the guitar like a covey of partridges scared in a field red heels tap threateningly decidme la hermosura la gentil frescura y tez de la cara el color y la blancura cuando viene la viejez cuбl se para she is right at the footlights her face brows drawn together into a frown has gone into shadow the shawl flames the maroon flower over her breast glows like a coal the guitar is silent her fingers go on snapping at intervals with dreadful foreboding then she draws herself up with a deep breath the muscles of her belly go taut under the tight silk wrinkles of the shawl and she is off again light joyful turning indulgent glances towards the audience as a nurse might look in the eyes of a child she has unintentionally frightened with a too dreadful fairy story the rhythm of the guitar has changed again her shawl is loose about her the long fringe flutters she walks with slow steps in pomp a ship decked out for a festival a queen in plumes and brocade їquй se hicieron las damas sus tocados sus vestidos sus olores їquй se hicieron las llamas de los fuegos encendidos de amadores and she has gone and the gipsy guitarplayer is scratching his neck with a hand the color of tobacco while the guitar rests against his legs he shows all his teeth in a worldengulfing yawn when they came out of the theatre the streets were dry and the stars blinked in the cold wind above the houses at the curb old women sold chestnuts and little ragged boys shouted the newspapers and now do you wonder tel why you are here they went into a cafй and mechanically ordered beer the seats were red plush this time and much worn all about them groups of whiskered men leaning over tables astride chairs talking its the gesture thats so overpowering dont you feel it in your arms something sudden and tremendously muscular when belmonte turned his back suddenly on the bull and walked away dragging the red cloak on the ground behind him i felt it said lyaeus that gesture a yellow flame against maroon and purple cadences an instant swagger of defiance in the midst of a litany to death the allpowerful that is spain castile at any rate is swagger the right word find a better for the gesture a medieval knight made when he threw his mailed glove at his enemys feet or a rose in his ladys window that a muledriver makes when he tosses off a glass of aguardiente that pastora imperio makes dancing word rubbish and lyaeus burst out laughing he laughed deep in his throat with his head thrown back telemachus was inclined to be offended did you notice how extraordinarily near she kept to the rhythm of jorge manrique he asked coldly of course of course shouted lyaeus still laughing the waiter came with two mugs of beer take it away shouted lyaeus who ordered beer bring something strong champagne drink the beer yourself the waiter was scrawny and yellow with bilious eyes but he could not resist the laughter of lyaeus he made a pretense of drinking the beer telemachus was now very angry though he had forgotten his quest and the maxims of penelope there hovered in his mind a disquieting thought of an eventual accounting for his actions before a dimly imagined group of women with inquisitive eyes this lyaeus he thought to himself was too free and easy then there came suddenly to his mind the dancer standing tense as a caryatid before the footlights her face in shadow her shawl flaming yellow the strong modulations of her torso seemed burned in his flesh he drew a deep breath his body tightened like a catapult oh to recapture that gesture he muttered the vague inquisitorial womanfigures had sunk fathoms deep in his mind lyaeus handed him a shallow tinkling glass there are all gestures he said outside the plateglass window a countryman passed singing his voice dwelt on a deep trembling note rose high faltered skidded down the scale then rose suddenly frighteningly like a skyrocket into a new burst of singing there it is again telemachus cried he jumped up and ran out on the street the broad pavement was empty a bitter wind shrilled among arclights white like dead eyes idiot lyaeus said between gusts of laughter when telemachus sat down again idiot tel here youll find it and despite telemachuss protestations he filled up the glasses a great change had come over lyaeus his face looked fuller and flushed his lips were moist and very red there was an occasional crisp curl in the black hair about his temples and so they sat drinking a long while at last telemachus got unsteadily to his feet i cant help it i must catch that gesture formulate it do it it is tremendously inconceivably unendingly important to me now you know why youre here said lyaeus quietly why are you here to drink said lyaeus lets go why to catch that gesture lyaeus said telemachus in an oversolemn voice like a comedy professor with a butterflynet roared lyaeus his laughter so filled the cafй that people at faraway tables smiled without knowing it its burned into my blood it must be formulated made permanent killed said lyaeus with sudden seriousness better drink it with your wine silent they strode down an arcaded street cupolas voluted baroque faзades a square tower the bulge of a market building tile roofs chimneypots ate into the stardusted sky to the right and left of them until in a great gust of wind they came out on an empty square where were few gaslamps in front of them was a heavy arch full of stars and orion sprawling above it under the arch a pile of rags asked for alms whiningly the jingle of money was crisp in the cold air where does this road go toledo said the beggar and got to his feet he was an old man bearded evilsmelling thank you we have just seen pastora said lyaeus jauntily ah pastora the last of the great dancers said the beggar and for some reason he crossed himself the road was frosty and crunched silkily underfoot lyaeus walked along shouting lines from the poem of jorge manrique cуmo se pasa la vida cуmo se viene la muerte tan callando cuбn presto se va el placer cуmo despuйs de acordado da dolor cуmo a nuestro parecer cualquier tiempo pasado fuй mejor i bet you tel they have good wine in toledo the road hunched over a hill they turned and saw madrid cut out of darkness against the starlight before them sown plains gulches full of mist and the tremulous lights on many carts that jogged along each behind three jingling slow mules a cock crowed all at once a voice burst suddenly in swaggering tremolo out of the darkness of the road beneath them rising rising then fading off then flaring up hotly like a red scarf waved on a windy day like the swoop of a hawk like a rocket intruding among the stars butterfly net you old fool lyaeuss laughter volleyed across the frozen fields telemachus answered in a low voice lets walk faster he walked with his eyes on the road he could see in the darkness pastora wrapped in the yellow shawl with the splotch of marooncolored embroidery moulding one breast stand tremulous with foreboding before the footlights suddenly draw in her breath and turn with a great exultant gesture back into the rhythm of her dance only the victorious culminating instant of the gesture was blurred to him he walked with long strides along the crackling road his muscles aching for memory of it ii the donkey boy where the husbandmans toil and strife little varies to strife and toil but the milky kernel of life with her numbered corn wine fruit oil the path zigzagged down through the olive trees between thin chortling glitter of irrigation ditches that occasionally widened into green pools reedfringed froggy about which bristled scrub oleanders through the shimmer of olive leaves all about i could see the great ruddy heave of the mountains streaked with the emerald of milletfields and above snowy shoulders against a vault of indigo patches of wood cut out hard as metal in the streaming noon light tinkle of a donkeybell below me then at the turn of a path the donkeys hindquarters mauvegrey neatly clipped in a pattern of diamonds and lozenges and a tail meditatively swishing as he picked his way among the stones the head as yet hidden by the osier baskets of the pack at the next turn i skipped ahead of the donkey and walked with the arriero a dark boy in tight blue pants and short grey tunic cut to the waist who had the strong cheekbones hawk nose and slender hips of an arab who spoke an aspirated andalusian that sounded like arabic we greeted each other cordially as travellers do in mountainous places where the paths are narrow we talked about the weather and the wind and the sugar mills at motril and women and travel and the vintage struggling all the while like drowning men to understand each others lingo when it came out that i was an american and had been in the war he became suddenly interested of course i was a deserter he said clever to get away thered been two deserters in his town a year ago alemanes perhaps friends of mine it was pointed out that i and the alemanes had been at different ends of the gunbarrel he laughed what did that matter then he said several times quй burro la guerra quй burro la guerra i remonstrated pointing to the donkey that was following us with dainty steps looking at us with a quizzical air from under his long eyelashes could anything be wiser than a burro he laughed again twitching back his full lips to show the brilliance of tightly serried teeth stopped in his tracks and turned to look at the mountains he swept a long brown hand across them look he said up there is the alpujarras the last refuge of the kings of the moors there are bandits up there sometimes you have come to the right place here we are free men the donkey scuttled past us with a derisive glance out of the corner of an eye and started skipping from side to side of the path cropping here and there a bit of dry grass we followed the arriero telling how his brother would have been conscripted if the family had not got together a thousand pesetas to buy him out that was no life for a man he spat on a red stone theyd never catch him he was sure of that the army was no life for a man in the bottom of the valley was a wide stream which we forded after some dispute as to who should ride the donkey the donkey all the while wrinkling his nose with disgust at the coldness of the speeding water and the sliminess of the stones when we came out on the broad moraine of pebbles the other side of the stream we met a lean blackish man with yellow horseteeth who was much excited when he heard i was an american america is the world of the future he cried and gave me such a slap on the back i nearly tumbled off the donkey on whose rump i was at that moment astride en amйrica no se divierte muttered the arriero kicking his feet that were cold from the ford into the burning saffron dust of the road the donkey ran ahead kicking at pebbles bucking trying to shake off the big pearshaped baskets of osier he had either side of his pack saddle delighted with smooth dryness after so much water and such tenuous stony roads the three of us followed arguing the sunlight beating wings of white flame about us in america there is freedom said the blackish man there are no rural guards roadmenders work eight hours and wear silk shirts and earn un dineral the blackish man stopped quite out of breath from his grappling with infinity then he went on your children are educated free no priests and at forty every manjack owns an automobile ca said the arriero sн hombre said the blackish man for a long while the arriero walked along in silence watching his toes bury themselves in dust at each step then he burst out spacing his words with conviction ca en amйrica no se hase na a que trabahar y decansar not on your life in america they dont do anything except work and rest sos to get ready to work again thats no life for a man people dont enjoy themselves there an old sailor from malaga who used to fish for sponges told me and he knew its not gold people need but bread and wine and life they dont do anything there except work and rest so theyll be ready to work again two thoughts jostled in my mind as he spoke i seemed to see redfaced gentlemen in knee breeches dogsear wigs askew over broad foreheads reading out loud with unction the phrases inalienable rights pursuit of happiness and to hear the cadence out of merediths the day of the daughter of hades where the husbandmans toil and strife little varies to strife and toil but the milky kernel of life with her numbered corn wine fruit oil the donkey stopped in front of a little wineshop under a trellis where dusty gourdleaves shut out the blue and gold dazzle of sun and sky he wants to say have a little drink gentlemen said the blackish man in the greenish shadow of the wineshop a smell of anise and a sound of water dripping when he had smacked his lips over a small cup of thick yellow wine he pointed at the arriero he says people dont enjoy life in america but in america people are very rich shouted the barkeeper a beetfaced man whose huge girth was bound in a red cotton sash and he made a gesture suggestive of coins rubbing thumb and forefinger together everybody roared derision at the arriero but he persisted and went out shaking his head and muttering thats no life for a man as we left the wineshop where the blackish man was painting with broad strokes the legend of the west the arriero explained to me almost tearfully that he had not meant to speak ill of my country but to explain why he did not want to emigrate while he was speaking we passed a cartload of yellow grapes that drenched us in jingle of mulebells and in dizzying sweetness of bubbling ferment a sombre man with beetling brows strode at the mules head in the cart brown feet firmly planted in the steaming slush of grapes flushed face tilted towards the ferocious white sun a small child with a black curly pate rode in triumph shouting teeth flashing as if to bite into the sun what you mean is said i to the arriero that this is the life for a man he tossed his head back in a laugh of approval something thats neither work nor getting ready to work thats it he answered and cried arrh he to the donkey we hastened our steps my sweaty shirt bellied suddenly in the back as a cool wind frisked about us at the corner of the road ah it smells of the sea said the arriero well see the sea from the next hill that night as i stumbled out of the inn door in motril overfull of food and drink the full moon bulged through the arches of the cupola of the pink and saffron church everywhere steelgreen shadows striped with tangible moonlight as i sat beside my knapsack in the plaza groping for a thought in the bewildering dazzle of the night three disconnected mules egged on by a hoarse shouting jingled out of the shadow when they stopped with a jerk in the full moonglare beside the fountain it became evident that they were attached to a coach a spidery coach tilted forward as if it were perpetually going down hill from inside smothered voices like the strangled clucking of fowls being shipped to market in a coop on the drivers seat ones feet were on the shafts and one had a view of every rag and shoelace the harness was patched with creaking groaning with wabbling of wheels grumble of inside passengers cracking of whip and long strings of oaths from the driver the coach lurched out of town and across a fat plain full of gurgle of irrigation ditches shrilling of toads falsetto rustle of broad leaves of the sugar cane occasionally the gleam of the soaring moon on banana leaves and a broad silver path on the sea landwards the hills like piles of ash in the moonlight and far away a cloudy inkling of mountains beside me mouth open shouting rich pedigrees at the leading mule cordovan hat on the back of his head from under which sprouted a lock of black hair that hung between his eyes over his nose and made him look like a goblin the driver bounced and squirmed and kicked at the flanks of the mules that roamed drunkenly from side to side of the uneven road down into a gulch across a shingle up over a plank bridge then down again into the bed of the river i had forded that morning with my friend the arriero along a beach with fishing boats and little huts where the fishermen slept then barking of dogs another bridge and we roared and crackled up a steep village street to come to a stop suddenly catastrophically in front of a tavern in the main square we are late said the goblin driver turning to me suddenly i have not slept for four nights dancing every night dancing he sucked the air in through his teeth and stretched out his arms and legs in the moonlight ah women women he added philosophically have you a cigarette ah la juventud said the old man who had brought the mailbag he looked up at us scratching his head its to enjoy a moment a momentito and its gone old men work in the day time but young men work at night ay de mн and he burst into a peal of laughter and as if some one were whispering them the words of jorge manrique sifted out of the night їquй se hizo el rey don juan los infantes de aragуn їquй se hicieron quй fuй de tanto galбn quй fuй de tanta invenciуn cуmo truxeron everybody went into the tavern from which came a sound of singing and of clapping in time and as hearty a tinkle of glasses and banging on tables as might have come out of the mermaid in the days of the virgin queen outside the moon soared soared brilliant a greenish blotch on it like the timestain on a chased silver bowl on an altar the broken lions head of the fountain dribbled one tinkling stream of quicksilver on the seawind came smells of rotting garbage and thyme burning in hearths and jessamine flowers down the street geraniums in a window smouldered in the moonlight in the dark above them the merest contour of a face once the gleam of two eyes opposite against the white wall standing very quiet a man looking up with dilated nostrils el amor as the coach jangled its lumbering unsteady way out of town our ears still throbbed with the rhythm of the tavern of hard brown hands clapped in time of heels thumping on oak floors from the last house of the village a man hallooed with its noise of cupboards of china overturned the coach crashed to stillness a wiry whitefaced man with a little waxed moustache like the springs of a mousetrap climbed on the front seat while burly people heaved quantities of corded trunks on behind how late two hours late the man spluttered jerking his checked cap from side to side since this morning nothing to eat but two boiled eggs think of that ўquй incultura ўquй pueblo indecente all day only two boiled eggs i had business in motril don antonio said the goblin driver grinning business cried don antonio laughing squeakily and after all what a night something impelled me to tell don antonio the story of king mycerinus of egypt that herodotus tells how hearing from an oracle he would only live ten years the king called for torches and would not sleep so crammed twenty years living into ten the goblin driver listened in intervals between his hoarse investigations of the private life of the grandmother of the leading mule don antonio slapped his thigh and lit a cigarette and cried in andalusia we all do that dont we paco yes sir said the goblin driver nodding his head vigorously that is lo flamenco cried don antonio the life of andalusia is lo flamenco the moon has begun to lose foothold in the black slippery zenith we are hurtling along a road at the top of a cliff below the sea full of unexpected glitters laceedged swishing like the silk dress of a dancer the goblin driver rolls from side to side asleep the check cap is down over the little mans face so that not even his moustaches are to be seen all at once the leading mule taken with suicidal mania makes a sidewise leap for the cliffedge crumbling of gravel snap of traces shouts uproar inside some one has managed to yank the mule back on her hind quarters in the sea below the shadow of a coach totters at the edge of the cliffs shadow hija de puta cries the goblin driver jumping to the ground don antonio awakes with a grunt and begins to explain querulously that he has had nothing to eat all day but two boiled eggs the teeth of the goblin driver flash white flame as he hangs wreath upon wreath of profanity about the trembling tugging mules with a terrific rattling jerk the coach sways to the safe side of the road from inside angry heads are poked out like the heads of hens out of an overturned coop don antonio turns to me and shouts in tones of triumph їquй flamenco eh when we got to almuсecar don antonio the goblin driver and i sat at a little table outside the empty casino a waiter appeared from somewhere with wine and coffee and tough purple ham and stale bread and cigarettes over our heads dusty palmfronds trembled in occasional faint gusts off the sea the rings on don antonios thin fingers glistened in the light of the one tired electric light bulb that shone among palpitating mottoes above us as he explained to me the significance of lo flamenco the tough swaggering gesture the quavering song well sung the couplet neatly capped the back turned to the charging bull the mantilla draped with exquisite provocativeness all that was lo flamenco on this coast seсor inglйs we dont work much we are dirty and uninstructed but by god we live why the poor people of the towns dyou know what they do in summer they hire a figtree and go and live under it with their dogs and their cats and their babies and they eat the figs as they ripen and drink the cold water from the mountains and manalive they are happy they fear no one and they are dependent on no one when they are young they make love and sing to the guitar and when they are old they tell stories and bring up their children you have travelled much i have travelled little madrid never further but i swear to you that nowhere in the world are the women lovelier or is the land richer or the cookery more perfect than in this vega of almuсecar if only the wine werent quite so heavy then you dont want to go to america ўhombre por dios sing us a song paco hes a galician you see the goblin driver grinned and threw back his head go to the end of the world youll find a gallego he said then he drank down his wine rubbed his mouth on the back of his hand and started droningly si quieres quel carro cante mуjale y dejelen rнo que despuйs de buen mojao canta comun silbio if you want a cart to sing wet it and soak it in the river for when its well soaked itll sing like a locust hola cried don antonio go on a mн me gusta el blanco ўviva lo blanco ўmuera lo negro porque el negro es muy triste yo soy alegre yo no lo quiero i like white hooray for white death to black because black is very sad and i am happy i dont like it thats it cried don antonio excitedly you people from the north english americans germans whatnot you like black you like to be sad i dont yo soy alegre yo no lo quiero the moon had sunk into the west flushed and swollen the east was beginning to bleach before the oncoming sun birds started chirping above our heads i left them but as i lay in bed i could hear the hoarse voice of the goblin driver roaring out a mн me gusta el blanco ўviva lo blanco ўmuera lo negro at nerja in an arbor of purple ipomoeas on a red jutting cliff over the beach where brown children were bathing there was talk again of lo flamenco in spain my friend don diego was saying we live from the belly and loins or else from the head and heart between don quixote the mystic and sancho panza the sensualist there is no middle ground the lowest panza is lo flamenco but you do live in dirt disease lack of education bestiality half of us are always dying of excess of food or the lack of it what do you want education organization energy the modern world i told him what the donkeyboy had said of america on the road down from the alpujarras that in america they did nothing but work and rest so as to be able to work again and america was the modern world and lo flamenco is neither work nor getting ready to work that evening san miguel went out to fetch the virgin of sorrows from a roadside oratory and brought her back into town in procession with candles and skyrockets and much chanting and as the swaying coneshaped figure carried on the shoulders of six sweating men stood poised at the entrance to the plaza where all the girls wore jessamine flowers in the blackness of their hair all waved their hats and cried ўviva la vнrgen de las angustias and the virgin and san miguel both had to bow their heads to get in the church door and the people followed them into the church crying ўviva so that the old vaults shivered in the tremulous candlelight and the shouting some people cried for water as rain was about due and everything was very dry and when they came out of the church they saw a thin cloud like a mantilla of white lace over the moon so they went home happy wherever they went through the narrow wellswept streets lit by an occasional path of orange light from a window the women left behind them long trails of fragrance from the jessamine flowers in their hair don diego and i walked a long while on the seashore talking of america and the virgin and a certain soup called ajo blanco and don quixote and lo flamenco we were trying to decide what was the peculiar quality of the life of the people in that rich plain vega they call it between the mountains of the sea walking about the country elevated on the small grassgrown levees of irrigation ditches the owners of the fields we crossed used simply because we were strangers to offer us a glass of wine or a slice of watermelon i had explained to my friend that in his modern world of america these same people would come out after us with shotguns loaded with rock salt he answered that even so the old order was changing and that as there was nothing else but to follow the procession of industrialism it behooved spaniards to see that their country forged ahead instead of being as heretofore dragged at the tail of the parade and do you think its leading anywhere this endless complicating of life of course he answered where where does anything lead at least it leads further than lo flamenco but couldnt the point be to make the way significant he shrugged his shoulders work he said we had come to a little nook in the cliffs where fishing boats were drawn up with folded wings like ducks asleep we climbed a winding path up the cliff pebbles scuttled underfoot our hands were torn by thorny aromatic shrubs then we came out in a glen that cut far into the mountains full of the laughter of falling water and the rustle of sappy foliage seven stilted arches of an aqueduct showed white through the canebrakes inland fragrances thronged about us the smell of dry thymegrown uplands of rich wet fields of goats and jessamine and heliotrope and of water cold from the snowfields running fast in ditches somewhere far off a donkey was braying then as the last groan of the donkey faded a mans voice rose suddenly out of the dark fields soaring yearning on taut throatcords then slipped down through notes like a small boat sliding sideways down a wave then unrolled a great slow scroll of rhythm on the night and ceased suddenly in an upward cadence as a guttering candle flares to extinction something thats neither work nor getting ready to work and i thought of the arriero on whose donkey i had forded the stream on the way down from the alpujarras and his saying ca en amйrica no se hose naa que trabahar y dйcansar i had left him at his home village a little cluster of red and yellow roofs about a fat tower the moors had built and a gaunt church that hunched by itself in a square of trampled dust we had rested awhile before going into town under a fig tree while he had put white canvas shoes on his lean brown feet the broad leaves had rustled in the wind and the smell of the fruit that hung purple bursting to crimson against the intense sky had been like warm stroking velvet all about us and the arriero had discoursed on the merits of his donkey and the joys of going from town to town with merchandise up into the mountains for chestnuts and firewood down to the sea for fish to malaga for tinware to motril for sugar from the refineries nights of dancing and guitarplaying at vintagetime fiestas of the virgin where older realer gods were worshipped than jehovah and the dolorous mother of the pale christ the toros blood and embroidered silks aflame in the sunlight words whispered through barred windows at night long days of travel on stony roads in the mountains and i had lain back with my eyes closed and the hum of little figbees in my ears and wished that my life were his life after a while we had jumped to our feet and i had shouldered my knapsack with its books and pencils and silly pads of paper and trudged off up an unshaded road and had thought with a sort of bitter merriment of that prig christian and his damned burden something that is neither work nor getting ready to work to make the road so significant that one needs no destination that is lo flamenco said i to don diego as we stood in the glen looking at the seven white arches of the aqueduct he nodded unconvinced iii the baker of almorox i the seсores were from madrid indeed the mans voice was full of an awe of great distances he was the village baker of almorox where we had gone on a sunday excursion from madrid and we were standing on the scrubbed tile floor of his house ceremoniously receiving wine and figs from his wife the father of the friend who accompanied me had once lived in the same village as the bakers father and bought bread of him hence the entertainment this baker of almorox was a tall man with a soft moustache very black against his ashpale face who stood with his large head thrust far forward he was smiling with pleasure at the presence of strangers in his house while in a tone of shy deprecating courtesy he asked after my friends family don fernando and doсa ana and the seсorita were well and little carlos carlos was no longer little answered my friend and doсa ana was dead the bakers wife had stood in the shadow looking from one face to another with a sort of wondering pleasure as we talked but at this she came forward suddenly into the pale greenishgold light that streamed through the door holding a dark winebottle before her there were tears in her eyes no she had never known any of them she explained hastily she had never been away from almorox but she had heard so much of their kindness and was sorry it was terrible to lose a father or a mother the tall baker shifted his feet uneasily embarrassed by the sadness that seemed slipping over his guests and suggested that we walk up the hill to the hermitage he would show the way but your work we asked ah it did not matter strangers did not come every day to almorox he strode out of the door wrapping a woolen muffler about his bare strongly moulded throat and we followed him up the devious street of whitewashed houses that gave us glimpses through wide doors of dark tiled rooms with great black rafters overhead and courtyards where chickens pecked at the manure lodged between smooth worn flagstones still between whitewashed walls we struck out of the village into the deep black mud of the high road and at last burst suddenly into the open country where patches of sprouting grass shone vivid green against the gray and russet of broad rolling lands at the top of the first hill stood the hermitage a small whitewashed chapel with a square threestoried tower over the door was a relief of the virgin crowned in worn lichened stone the interior was very plain with a single heavily gilt altar over which was a painted statue stiff but full of a certain erect disdainful grace again of the virgin the figure was dressed in a long lace gown full of frills and ruffles grey with dust and age la vнrgen de la cima said the baker pointing reverently with his thumb after he had bent his knee before the altar and as i glanced at the image a sudden resemblance struck me the gown gave the virgin a curiously conical look that somehow made me think of that conical black stone the bona dea that the romans brought from asia minor here again was a good goddess a bountiful one more mother than virgin despite her prudish frills but the man was ushering us out and there is no finer view than this in all spain with a broad sweep of his arm he took in the village below with its waves of roofs that merged from green to maroon and deep crimson broken suddenly by the open square in front of the church and the gray towering church scowling with strong lights and shadows on buttresses and pointed windows and the brown fields faintly sheened with green which gave place to the deep maroon of the turned earth of vineyards and the shining silver where the wind ruffled the oliveorchards and beyond the rolling hills that grew gradually flatter until they sank into the yellowish plain of castile as he made the gesture his fingers were stretched wide as if to grasp all this land he was showing his flaccid cheeks were flushed as he turned to us but we should see it in may he was saying in may when the wheat was thick in the fields and there were flowers on the hills then the lands were beautiful and rich in may and he went on to tell us of the local feast and the great processions of the virgin this year there were to be four days of the toros so many bullfights were unusual in such a small village he assured us but they were rich in almorox the wine was the best in castile four days of toros he said again and all the people of the country around would come to the fiestas and there would be a great pilgrimage to this hermitage of the virgin as he talked in his slow deferential way a little conscious of his volubility before strangers there began to grow in my mind a picture of his view of the world first came his family the wife whose body lay beside his at night who bore him children the old withered parents who sat in the sun at his door his memories of them when they had had strong rounded limbs like his and of their parents sitting old and withered in the sun then his work the heat of his ovens the smell of bread cooking the faces of neighbors who came to buy and outside in the dim penumbra of things half real of travellers tales lay madrid where the king lived and where politicians wrote in the newspapers and francia and all that was not almorox in him i seemed to see the generations wax and wane like the years strung on the thread of labor of unending sweat and strain of muscles against the earth it was all so mellow so strangely aloof from the modern world of feverish change this life of the peasants of almorox everywhere roots striking into the infinite past for before the revolution before the moors before the romans before the dark furtive traders the phoenicians they were much the same these iberian village communities far away things changed cities were founded hard roads built armies marched and fought and passed away but in almorox the foundations of life remained unchanged up to the present new names and new languages had come the virgin had taken over the festivals and rituals of the old earth goddesses and the deep mystical fervor of devotion but always remained the love for the place the strong anarchistic reliance on the individual man the walking consciously or not of the way beaten by generations of men who had tilled and loved and lain in the cherishing sun with no feeling of a reality outside of themselves outside of the bare encompassing hills of their commune except the god which was the synthesis of their souls and of their lives here lies the strength and the weakness of spain this intense individualism born of a history whose fundamentals lie in isolated village communities pueblos as the spaniards call them over the changeless face of which like grass over a field events spring and mature and die is the basic fact of spanish life no revolution has been strong enough to shake it invasion after invasion of goths of moors of christian ideas of the fads and convictions of the renaissance have swept over the country changing surface customs and modes of thought and speech only to be metamorphosed into keeping with the changeless iberian mind and predominant in the iberian mind is the thought la vida es sueсo life is a dream only the individual or that part of life which is in the firm grasp of the individual is real the supreme expression of this lies in the two great figures that typify spain for all time don quixote and sancho panza don quixote the individualist who believed in the power of mans soul over all things whose desire included the whole world in himself sancho the individualist to whom all the world was food for his belly on the one hand we have the ecstatic figures for whom the power of the individual soul has no limits in whose minds the universe is but one man standing before his reflection god these are the loyolas the philip seconds the fervid ascetics like juan de la cruz the originals of the glowing tortured faces in the portraits of el greco on the other hand are the jovial materialists like the archpriest of hita culminating in the frantic mystical sensuality of such an epic figure as don juan tenorio through all spanish history and art the threads of these two complementary characters can be traced changing combining branching out but ever in substance the same of this warp and woof have all the strange patterns of spanish life been woven ii in trying to hammer some sort of unified impression out of the scattered pictures of spain in my mind one of the first things i realize is that there are many spains indeed every village hidden in the folds of the great barren hills or shadowed by its massive church in the middle of one of the upland plains every fertile huerta of the seacoast is a spain iberia exists and the strong iberian characteristics but spain as a modern centralized nation is an illusion a very unfortunate one for the present atrophy the desolating resultlessness of a century of revolution may very well be due in large measure to the artificial imposition of centralized government on a land essentially centrifugal in the first place there is the matter of language roughly four distinct languages are at present spoken in spain castilian the language of madrid and the central uplands the official language spoken in the south in its andalusian form gallegoportuguese spoken on the west coast basque which does not even share the latin descent of the others and catalan a form of provenзal which with its dialect valencian is spoken on the upper mediterranean coast and in the balearic isles of course under the influence of rail communication and a conscious effort to spread castilian the other languages with the exception of portuguese and catalan have lost vitality and died out in the larger towns but the problem remains far different from that of the italian dialects since the spanish languages have all except basque a strong literary tradition added to the variety of language there is an immense variety of topography in the different parts of spain the central plateaux dominant in modern history history being taken to mean the births and breedings of kings and queens and the doings of generals in armor probably approximate the warmer russian steppes in climate and vegetation the west coast is in most respects a warmer and more fertile wales the southern huertas arable river valleys have rather the aspect of egypt the east coast from valencia up is a continuation of the mediterranean coast of france it follows that in this country where an hours train ride will take you from siberian snow into african desert unity of population is hardly to be expected here is probably the root of the tendency in spanish art and thought to emphasize the differences between things in painting where the mind of a people is often more tangibly represented than anywhere else we find one supreme example el greco almost the caricature in his art of the don quixote type of mind who though a greek by birth and a venetian by training became more spanish than the spaniards during his long life at toledo strove constantly to express the difference between the world of flesh and the world of spirit between the body and the soul of man more recently the extreme characterization of goyas sketches and portraits the intensifying of national types found in zuloaga and the other painters who have been exploiting with such success the peculiarities the picturesqueness of spanish faces and landscapes seem to spring from this powerful sense of the separateness of things in another way you can express this constant attempt to differentiate one individual from another as caricature spanish art is constantly on the edge of caricature given the ebullient fertility of the spanish mind and its intense individualism a constant slipping over into the grotesque is inevitable and so it comes to be that the conscious or unconscious aim of their art is rather selfexpression than beauty their image of reality is sharp and clear but distorted burlesque and satire are never far away in their most serious moments not even the calmest and best ordered of spanish minds can resist a tendency to excess of all sorts to overelaboration to grotesquerie to deadening mannerism all that is greatest in their art indeed lies on the borderland of the extravagant where sublime things skim the thin ice of absurdity the great epic don quixote such plays as calderons la vida es sueсo such paintings as el grecos resurrecciуn and velasquezs dwarfs such buildings as the escorial and the alhambra all among the universal masterpieces are far indeed from the middle term of reasonable beauty hence their supreme strength and for our generation to which excess is a synonym for beauty is added argumentative significance to the long tradition of spanish art another characteristic springing from the same fervid abundance that links the spanish tradition to ours of the present day is the strangely impromptu character of much spanish art production the slightly ridiculous proverb that genius consists of an infinite capacity for taking pains is well controverted the creative flow of spanish artists has always been so strong so full of vitality that there has been no time for taking pains lope de vega with his two thousandodd plays or was it twelve thousand is by no means an isolated instance perhaps the strong sense of individual validity which makes spain the most democratic country in europe sanctions the constant improvisation and accounts for the confident planlessness as common in spanish architecture as in spanish political thought here we meet the old stock characteristic spanish pride this is a very real thing and is merely the external shell of the fundamental trust in the individual and in nothing outside of him again el greco is an example as his painting progressed grew more and more personal he drew away from tangible reality and with all the dogmatic conviction of one whose faith in his own reality can sweep away the mountains of the visible world expressed his own restless almost sensual spirituality in forms that flickered like white flames toward god for the spaniard moreover god is always in essence the proudest sublimation of mans soul the same spirit runs through the preachers of the early church and the works of santa teresa a disguise of the frantic desire to express the self the self changeless and eternal at all costs from this comes the hard cruelty that flares forth luridly at times a recent book by miguel de unamuno del sentimiento trбgico de la vida expresses this fierce clinging to separateness from the universe by the phrase el hambre de inmortalidad the hunger of immortality this is the core of the individualism that lurks in all spanish ideas the conviction that only the individual soul is real iii in the spain of today these things are seen as through a glass darkly since the famous and much gloatedover entrance of ferdinand and isabella into granada the history of spain has been that of an attempt to fit a square peg in a round hole in the great flare of the golden age the age of ingots of peru and of men of even greater worth the disease worked beneath the surface since then the conflict has corroded into futility all the buoyant energies of the country i mean the persistent attempt to centralize in thought in art in government in religion a nation whose every energy lies in the other direction the result has been a deadlock and the ensuing rust and numbing of all life and thought so that a century of revolution seems to have brought spain no nearer a solution of its problems at the present day when all is ripe for a new attempt to throw off the atrophy a sort of despairing inaction causes the spaniards to remain under a government of unbelievably corrupt and inefficient politicians there seems no solution to the problem of a nation in which the centralized power and the separate communities work only to nullify each other spaniards in face of their traditions are rather in the position of the archжologists before the problem of iberian sculpture for near the cerro de los santos bare hill where from the ruins of a sanctuary has been dug an endless series of native sculptures of men and women goddesses and gods there lived a little watchmaker the first statues to be dug up were thought by the pious country people to be saints and saints they were according to an earlier dispensation than that of rome with the result that much kudos accompanied the discovery of those draped women with high headdresses and fixed solemn eyes and those fragmentary bullnecked men hewn roughly out of grey stone they were freed from the caked clay of two thousand years and reverently set up in the churches so probably the motives that started the watchmaker on his career of sculpturing and falsifying were pious and reverential however it began when it was discovered that the saints were mere horrid heathen hegods and shegods and that the foreign gentlemen with spectacles who appeared from all the ends of europe to investigate would pay money for them the watchmaker began to thrive as a mighty man in his village and generation he began to study archaeology and the style of his cumbersome forged divinities improved for a number of years the statues from the cerro de los santos were swallowed whole by all learned europe but the watchmakers imagination began to get the better of him forms became more and more fantastic egyptian assyrian artnouveau influences began to be noted by the discerning until at last someone whispered forgery and all the scientists scuttled to cover shouting that there had never been any native iberian sculpture after all the little watchmaker succumbed before his imagining of heathen gods and died in a madhouse to this day when you stand in the middle of the room devoted to the cerro de los santos in the madrid and see the statues of iberian goddesses clustered about you in their high headdresses like those of dancers you cannot tell which were made by the watchmaker in and which by the imagemaker of the hillsanctuary at a time when the first redeyed ships of the phoenician traders were founding trading posts among the barbarians of the coast of valencia and there they stand on their shelves the real and the false inextricably muddled and stare at the enigma with stone eyes so with the traditions the tradition of catholic spain the tradition of military grandeur the tradition of fighting the moors of suspecting the foreigner of hospitality of truculence of sobriety of chivalry of don quixote and tenorio the spanishamerican war to the united states merely an opportunity for a patrioticcapitalist demonstration of sanitary engineering heroism and cannedmeat scandals was to spain the first whispered word that many among the traditions were false the young men of that time called themselves the generation of ninetyeight according to temperament they rejected all or part of the museum of traditions they had been taught to believe was the real spain each took up a separate road in search of a spain which should suit his yearnings for beauty gentleness humaneness or else vigor force modernity the problem of our day is whether spaniards evolving locally anarchically without centralization in anything but repression will work out new ways of life for themselves or whether they will be drawn into the festering tumult of a europe where the system that is dying is only strong enough to kill in its deaththroes all new growth in which there was hope for the future the pyrenees are high iv it was after a lecture at an exhibition of basque painters in madrid where we had heard vallemelan with eyes that burned out from under shaggy grizzled eyebrows denounce in bitter stinging irony what he called the europeanization of spain what they called progress he had said was merely an aping of the stupid commercialism of modern europe better no education for the masses than education that would turn healthy peasants into crafty puttyskinned merchants better a spain swooning in her ageold apathy than a spain awakened to the brutal soulless tradewar of modern life i was walking with a young student of philosophy i had met by chance across the noisy board of a spanish pensiуn discussing the exhibition we had just seen as a strangely meek setting for the fiery reactionary speech i had remarked on the very primitive look much of the work of these young basque painters had shown by some in the almost affectionate technique in the dainty caressing brushwork in others by that inadequacy of the means at the painters disposal to express his idea which made of so many of the pictures rather gloriously impressive failures my friend was insisting however that the primitiveness rather than the birthpangs of a new view of the world was nothing but the last affectation of an overcivilized tradition spain he said is the most civilized country in europe the growth of our civilization has never been interrupted by outside influence the phoenicians the romans spains influence on rome was i imagine fully as great as romes on spain think of the five spanish emperors the goths the moors all incidents absorbed by the changeless iberian spirit even spanish christianity he continued smiling is far more spanish than it is christian our life is one vast ritual our religion is part of it that is all and so are the bullfights that so shock the english and americans are they any more brutal though than foxhunting and prizefights and how full of tradition are they our fiestas de toros their ceremony reaches back to the hecatombs of the homeric heroes to the bullworship of the cretans and of so many of the mediterranean cults to the roman games can civilization go farther than to ritualize death as we have done but our culture is too perfect too stable life is choked by it we stood still a moment in the shade of a yellowed lime tree my friend had stopped talking and was looking with his usual bitter smile at a group of little boys with brown bare dusty legs who were intently playing bullfight with sticks for swords and a piece of newspaper for the toreadors scarlet cape it is you in america he went on suddenly to whom the future belongs you are so vigorous and vulgar and uncultured life has become once more the primal fight for bread of course the dollar is a complicated form of the food the cave man killed for and slunk after and the means of combat are different but it is as brutal from that crude animal brutality comes all the vigor of life we have none of it we are too tired to have any thoughts we have lived so much so long ago that now we are content with the very simple things the warmth of the sun and the colors of the hills and the flavor of bread and wine all the rest is automatic ritual but what about the strike i asked referring to the onedays general strike that had just been carried out with fair success throughout spain as a protest against the governments apathy regarding the dangerous rise in the prices of food and fuel he shrugged his shoulders that and more he said is new spain a prophecy rather than a fact old spain is still allpowerful later in the day i was walking through the main street of one of the clustered adobe villages that lie in the folds of the castilian plain not far from madrid the lamps were just being lit in the little shops where the people lived and worked and sold their goods and women with beautifully shaped pottery jars on their heads were coming home with water from the well suddenly i came out on an open plaza with trees from which the last leaves were falling through the greenish sunset light the place was filled with the lilting music of a grindorgan and with a crunch of steps on the gravel as people danced there were soldiers and servantgirls and redcheeked apprenticeboys with their sweethearts and respectable shopkeepers and their wives with mantillas over their gleaming black hair all were dancing in and out among the slim treetrunks and the air was noisy with laughter and little cries of childlike unfeigned enjoyment here was the gospel of sancho panza i thought the easy acceptance of life the unashamed joy in food and color and the softness of womens hair but as i walked out of the village across the harsh plain of castile greygreen and violet under the deepening night the memory came to me of the knight of the sorrowful countenance don quixote blunderingly trying to remould the world pitifully sure of the power of his own ideal and in these two spain seemed to be manifest far indeed were they from the restless industrial world of joyless enforced labor and incessant goading war and i wondered to what purpose it would be should don quixote again saddle rosinante and what the good baker of almorox would say to his wife when he looked up from his kneading trough holding out hands white with dough to see the knight errant ride by on his lean steed upon a new quest iv talk by the road telemachus and lyaeus had walked all night the sky to the east of them was rosy when they came out of a village at the crest of a hill cocks crowed behind stucco walls the road dropped from their feet through an avenue of pollarded poplars ghostly with frost far away into the brown west stretched reach upon reach of lakelike glimmer here and there a few trees pushed jagged arms out of drowned lands they stood still breathing hard its the tagus overflowed its banks said telemachus lyaeus shook his head its mist they stood with thumping hearts on the hilltop looking over inexplicable shimmering plains of mist hemmed by mountains jagged like coals that as they looked began to smoulder with dawn the light all about was lemon yellow the walls of the village behind them were fervid primrose color splotched with shadows of sheer cobalt above the houses uncurled green spirals of woodsmoke lyaeus raised his hands above his head and shouted and ran like mad down the hill a little voice was whispering in telemachuss ear that he must save his strength so he followed sedately when he caught up to lyaeus they were walking among twining wraiths of mist roseshot from a rim of the sun that poked up behind hills of bright madder purple a sudden cold windgust whined across the plain making the mist writhe in a delirium of crumbling shapes ahead of them casting gigantic blue shadows over the furrowed fields rode a man on a donkey and a man on a horse it was a grey swaybacked horse that joggled in a little trot with much switching of a ragged tail its rider wore a curious peaked cap and sat straight and lean in the saddle over one shoulder rested a long bamboo pole that in the exaggerating sunlight cast a shadow like the shadow of a lance the man on the donkey was shaped like a dumpling and rode with his toes turned out telemachus and lyaeus walked behind them a long while without catching up staring curiously after these two silent riders eventually getting as far as the tails of the horse and the donkey they called out buenos dнas there turned to greet them a red round face full of little lines like an overripe tomato and a long bloodless face drawn into a point at the chin by a grizzled beard how early you are gentlemen said the tall man on the grey horse his voice was deep and sepulchral with an occasional flutter of tenderness like a glint of light in a black river late said lyaeus we come from madrid on foot the dumpling man crossed himself they are mad he said to his companion that said the man on the grey horse is always the answer of ignorance when confronted with the unusual these gentlemen undoubtedly have very good reason for doing as they do and besides the night is the time for long strides and deep thoughts is it not gentlemen the habit of vigil is one we sorely need in this distracted modern world if more men walked and thought the night through there would be less miseries under the sun but such a cold night exclaimed the dumpling man on colder nights than this i have seen children asleep in doorways in the streets of madrid is there much poverty in these parts asked telemachus stiffly wanting to show that he too had the social consciousness there are people thousands who from the day they are born till the day they die never have enough to eat they have wine said lyaeus one little cup on sundays and they are so starved that it makes them as drunk as if it were a hogshead i have heard said lyaeus that the sensations of starving are very interesting people have visions more vivid than life one needs very few sensations to lead life humbly and beautifully said the man on the grey horse in a gentle tone of reproof lyaeus frowned perhaps said the man on the grey horse turning towards telemachus his lean face where under scraggly eyebrows glowered eyes of soft dark green it is that i have brooded too much on the injustice done in the world all society one great wrong many years ago i should have set out to right wrong for no one but a man an individual alone can right a wrong organization merely substitutes one wrong for another but now i am too old you see i go fishing instead why its a fishing pole cried lyaeus when i first saw it i thought it was a lance and he let out his roaring laugh and such trout cried the dumpling man the trout there are in that little stream above illescas thats why we got up so early to fish for trout i like to see the dawn said the man on the grey horse is that illescas asked telemachus and pointed to a dun brown tower topped by a cap of blue slate that stood guard over a cluster of roofs ahead of them telemachus had a map torn from baedecker in his pocket that he had been peeping at secretly that gentlemen is illescas said the man on the grey horse and if you will allow me to offer you a cup of coffee i shall be most pleased you must excuse me for i never take anything before midday i am a recluse have been for many years and rarely stir abroad i do not intend to return to the world unless i can bring something with me worth having a wistful smile twisted a little the corners of his mouth i could guzzle a hogshead of coffee accompanied by vast processions of toasted rolls in columns of four shouted lyaeus we are on our way to toledo telemachus broke in not wanting to give the impression that food was their only thought you will see the paintings of dominico theotocopoulos the only one who ever depicted the soul of castile this man said lyaeus with a slap at telemachuss shoulder is looking for a gesture the gesture of castile the man on the grey horse rode along silently for some time the sun had already burnt up the hoarfrost along the sides of the road only an occasional streak remained glistening in the shadow of a ditch a few larks sang in the sky two men in brown corduroy with hoes on their shoulders passed on their way to the fields who shall say what is the gesture of castile i am from la mancha myself the man on the grey horse started speaking gravely while with a bony hand very white he stroked his beard something cold and haughty and aloof men concentrated converging breathlessly on the single flame of their spirit torquemada loyola jorge manrique cortйs santa teresa rapacity cruelty straightforwardness every mans life a lonely ruthless quest lyaeus broke in remember the infinite gentleness of the saints lowering the conde de orgaz into the grave in the picture in san tomбs ah that is what i was trying to think of these generations my generation my sons generation are working to bury with infinite tenderness the gorgeously dressed corpse of the old spain gentlemen it is a little ridiculous to say so but we have set out once more with lance and helmet of knighterrantry to free the enslaved to right the wrongs of the oppressed they had come into town in the high square tower churchbells were ringing for morning mass down the broad main street scampered a flock of goats herded by a lean man with fangs like a dog who strode along in a snuffcolored cloak with a broad black felt hat on his head how do you do don alonso he cried good luck to you gentlemen and he swept the hat off his head in a wide curving gesture as might a courtier of the rey don juan the hot smell of the goats was all about them as they sat before the cafй in the sun under a bare acacia tree looking at the tightly proportioned brick arcades of the mudйjar apse of the church opposite don alonso was in the cafй ordering the dumplingman had disappeared telemachus got up on his numbed feet and stretched his legs ouf he said im tired then he walked over to the grey horse that stood with hanging head and drooping knees hitched to one of the acacias i wonder what his name is he stroked the horses scrawny face is it rosinante the horse twitched his ears straightened his back and legs and pulled back black lips to show yellow teeth of course its rosinante the horses sides heaved he threw back his head and whinnied shrilly exultantly v a novelist of revolution i much as g b s refuses to be called an englishman pнo baroja refuses to be called a spaniard he is a basque reluctantly he admits having been born in san sebastiбn outpost of cosmopolis on the mountainous coast of guipuzcoa where a sternfeatured race of mountaineers and fishermen whose prominent noses high ruddy cheekbones and square jowls are gradually becoming known to the world through the paintings of the zubiaurre clings to its ancient unaryan language and its ancient song and customs with the hardheadedness of hill people the world over from the first spanish discoveries in america till the time of our own new england clipper ships the basque coast was the backbone of spanish trade the three provinces were the only ones which kept their privileges and their municipal liberties all through the process of the centralizing of the spanish monarchy with cross and faggot which historians call the great period of spain the rocky inlets in the mountains were full of shipyards that turned out privateers and merchantmen manned by lanky broadshouldered men with hard redbeaked faces and huge hands coarsened by generations of straining on heavy oars and halyards men who feared only god and the seaspirits of their strange mythology and were a law unto themselves adventurers and bigots it was not till the nineteenth century that the carlist wars and the passing of sailing ships broke the prosperous independence of the basque provinces and threw them once for all into the main current of spanish life now papermills take the place of shipyards and instead of the great fleet that went off every year to fish the newfoundland and iceland banks a few steam trawlers harry the sardines in the bay of biscay the world war too did much to make bilboa one of the industrial centers of spain even restoring in some measure the ancient prosperity of its shipping pнo baroja spent his childhood on this rainy coast between green mountains and green sea there were old aunts who filled his ears up with legends of former mercantile glory with talk of sea captains and slavers and shipwrecks born in the late seventies baroja left the mistfilled inlets of guipuzcoa to study medicine in madrid febrile capital full of the artificial scurry of government on the dry upland plateau of new castile he even practiced reluctantly enough in a town near valencia where he must have acquired his distaste for the mediterranean and the latin genius and later in his own province at cestons where he boarded with the woman who baked the sacramental wafers for the parish church and so he claims felt the spirit of racial solidarity glow within him for the first time but he was too timid in the face of pain and too sceptical of science as of everything else to acquire the cocksure brutality of a country doctor he gave up medicine and returned to madrid where he became a baker in juventudegolatria youthselfworship a book of delightfully shameless selfrevelations he says that he ran a bakery for six years before starting to write and he still runs a bakery you can see it any day walking towards the royal theatre from the great focus of madrid life the puerta del sol it has a most enticing window on one side are hams and red sausages and purple sausages and white sausages some plump to the bursting like rubenss graces others as weazened and smoked as saints by ribera in the middle are oblong plates with patйs and sliced bologna and things in jelly then come ranks of cakes creamcakes and fruitcakes everything from obscene jamrolls to celestial cornucopias of white cream through the door you see a counter with round loaves of bread on it and a basketful of brown rolls if someone comes out a dense sweet smell of fresh bread and pastry swirls about the sidewalk so by meeting commerce squarely in its own field he has freed himself from any compromise with mammon while his bread remains sweet his novels may be as bitter as he likes ii the moon shines coldly out of an intense blue sky where a few stars glisten faint as mica shadow fills half the street etching a silhouette of roofs and chimneypots and cornices on the cobblestones leaving the rest very white with moonlight the faзades of the houses with their blank windows might be carved out of ice in the dark of a doorway a woman sits hunched under a brown shawl her head nods but still she jerks a tune that sways and dances through the silent street out of the accordion on her lap a little saucer for pennies is on the step beside her in the next doorway two guttersnipes are huddled together asleep the moonlight points out with mocking interest their skinny dirtcrusted feet and legs stretched out over the icy pavement and the filthy rags that barely cover their bodies two men stumble out of a wineshop arm in arm poor men in corduroy who walk along unsteadily in their worn canvas shoes making grandiloquent gestures of pity tearing down the cold hard faзades with drunken generous phrases buoyed up by the warmth of the wine in their veins that is barojas world dismal ironic the streets of towns where industrial life sits heavy on the neck of a race as little adapted to it as any in europe no one has ever described better the shaggy badlands and cabbagepatches round the edges of a city where the debris of civilization piles up ramshackle suburbs in which starve and scheme all manner of human detritus back lots where men and women live fantastically in shelters patched out of rotten boards of old tin cans and bits of chairs and tables that have stood for years in bright pleasant rooms grassy patches behind crumbling walls where on sunny days starving children spread their fleshless limbs and run about in the sun miserable wineshops where the wind whines through broken panes to chill men with everempty stomachs who sit about gambling and finding furious drunkenness in a sip of aguardiente courtyards of barracks where painters who have not a cent in the world mix with beggars and guttersnipes to cajole a little hot food out of softhearted soldiers at messtime convent doors where ragged lines shiver for hours in the shrill wind that blows across the bare castilian plain waiting for the nuns to throw out bread for them to fight over like dogs and through it all moves the great crowd of the outcast sneakthieves burglars beggars of every description rich beggars and poor devils who have given up the struggle to exist homeless children prostitutes people who live a halfhonest existence selling knicknacks penniless students inventors who while away the time they are dying of starvation telling all they meet of the riches they might have had all who have failed on the daily treadmill of breadmaking or who have never had a chance even to enjoy the privilege of industrial slavery outside of russia there has never been a novelist so taken up with all that society and respectability reject not that the interest in outcasts is anything new in spanish literature spain is the home of that type of novel which the pigeonholemakers have named picaresque these loafers and wanderers of barojas like his artists and grotesque dreamers and fanatics all are the descendants of the people in the quijote and the novelas ejemplares of the rogues and bandits of the lazarillo de tormes who through gil blas invaded france and england where they rollicked through the novel until mrs grundy and george eliot packed them off to the reform school but the rogues of the seventeenth century were jolly rogues they always had their tongues in their cheeks and success rewarded their ingenious audacities the moulds of society had not hardened as they have now there was less pressure of hungry generations or more probably pity had not come in to undermine the foundations the corrosive of pity which had attacked the steel girders of our civilization even before the work of building was completed has brought about what gilbert murray in speaking of greek thought calls the failure of nerve in the seventeenth century men still had the courage of their egoism the world was a bad job to be made the best of all hope lay in driving a good bargain with the conductors of life everlasting by the end of the nineteenth century the life everlasting had grown cobwebby the french revolution had filled men up with extravagant hopes of the perfectibility of this world humanitarianism had instilled an abnormal sensitiveness to pain to ones own pain and to the pain of ones neighbors barojas outcasts are no longer jolly knaves who will murder a man for a nickel and go on their road singing over the hills and far away they are men who have not had the willpower to continue in the fight for bread they are men whose nerve has failed who live furtively on the outskirts snatching a little joy here and there drugging their hunger with gorgeous mirages one often thinks of gorki in reading baroja mainly because of the contrast instead of the tumultuous spring freshet of a new race that drones behind every page of the russian there is the cold despair of an old race of a race that lived long under a formula of life to which it has sacrificed much only to discover in the end that the formula does not hold these are the last paragraphs of mala hierba wild grass the middle volume of barojas trilogy on the life of the very poor in madrid they talked manuel felt irritation against the whole world hatred up to that moment pent up within him against society against man honestly he ended by saying i wish it would rain dynamite for a week and that the eternal father would come tumbling down in cinders he invoked crazily all the destructive powers to reduce to ashes this miserable society jesъs listened with attention you are an anarchist he told him i yes so am i since when since i have seen the infamies committed in the world since i have seen how coldly they give to death a bit of human flesh since i have seen how men die abandoned in the streets and hospitals answered jesъs with a certain solemnity manuel was silent the friends walked without speaking round the ronda de segovia and sat down on a bench in the little gardens of the vнrgen del puerto the sky was superb crowded with stars the milky way crossed its immense blue concavity the geometric figure of the great bear glittered very high arcturus and vega shone softly in that ocean of stars in the distance the dark fields scratched with lines of lights seemed the sea in a harbor and the strings of lights the illumination of a wharf the damp warm air came laden with odors of woodland plants wilted by the heat how many stars said manuel what can they be they are worlds endless worlds i dont know why it doesnt make me feel better to see this sky so beautiful jesъs do you think there are men in those worlds asked manuel perhaps why not and are there prisons too and judges and gambling dens and police do you think so jesъs did not answer after a while he began talking with a calm voice of his dream of an idyllic humanity a sweet pitiful dream noble and childish in his dream man led by a new idea reached a higher state no more hatreds no more rancours neither judges nor police nor soldiers nor authority in the wide fields of the earth free men worked in the sunlight the law of love had taken the place of the law of duty and the horizons of humanity grew every moment wider wider and more azure and jesъs continued talking of a vague ideal of love and justice of energy and pity and those words of his chaotic incoherent fell like balm on manuels ulcerated spirit then they were both silent lost in their thoughts looking at the night an august joy shone in the sky and the vague sensation of space of the infinity of those imponderable worlds filled their spirits with a delicious calm iii spain is the classic home of the anarchist a bleak upland country mostly with a climate giving all varieties of temperature from moist african heat to dry siberian cold where people have lived until very recently and do still in villages hidden away among the bare ribs of the mountains or in the indented coast plains where every region is cut off from every other by high passes and defiles of the mountains flaming hot in summer and freezing cold in winter where the iberian race has grown up centerless the pueblo the village community is the only form of social cohesion that really has roots in the past on these free towns empires have time and again been imposed by force in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the catholic monarchy wielded the sword of the faith to such good effect that communal feeling was killed and the spanish genius forced to ingrow into the mystical realm where every ego expanded itself into the solitude of god the eighteenth century reduced god to an abstraction and the nineteenth brought pity and the mad hope of righting the wrongs of society the spaniard like his own don quixote mounted the warhorse of his idealism and set out to free the oppressed alone as a logical conclusion we have the anarchist who threw a bomb into the lyceum theatre in barcelona during a performance wanting to make the ultimate heroic gesture and only succeeding in a senseless mangling of human lives but that was the reduction to an absurdity of an immensely valuable mental position the anarchism of pнo baroja is of another sort he says in one of his books that the only part a man of the middle classes can play in the reorganization of society is destructive he has not undergone the discipline which can only come from common slavery in the industrial machine necessary for a builder his slavery has been an isolated slavery which has unfitted him forever from becoming truly part of a community he can use the vast power of knowledge which training has given him only in one way his great mission is to put the acid test to existing institutions and to strip the veils off them i dont want to imply that baroja writes with his social conscience he is too much of a novelist for that too deeply interested in people as such but it is certain that a profound sense of the evil of existing institutions lies behind every page he has written and that occasionally only occasionally he allows himself to hope that something better may come out of the turmoil of our age of transition only a man who had felt all this very deeply could be so sensitive to the new spirit if the word were not threadbare one would call it religious which is shaking the foundations of the worlds social pyramid perhaps only another example of the failure of nerve perhaps the triumphant expression of a new will among mankind in aurora roja red dawn the last of the madrid trilogy about the same manuel who is the central figure of mala hierba he writes at first it bored him but later little by little he felt himself carried away by what he was reading first he was enthusiastic about mirabeau then about the girondins vergniau petion condorcet then about danton then he began to think that robespierre was the true revolutionary afterwards saint just but in the end it was the gigantic figure of danton that thrilled him most manuel felt great satisfaction at having read that history often he said to himself what does it matter now if i am a loafer and goodfornothing ive read the history of the french revolution i believe i shall know how to be worthy after michelet he read a book about then another on the commune by louise michel and all this produced in him a great admiration for french revolutionists what men after the colossal figures of the convention babeuf proudhon blanqui bandin deleschize rochefort fйlix pyat vallu what people what does it matter now if i am a loafer i believe i shall know how to be worthy in those two phrases lies all the power of revolutionary faith and how like phrases out of the gospels those older expressions of the hope and misery of another society in decay that is the spirit that for good or evil is stirring throughout europe today among the poor and the hungry and the oppressed and the outcast a new affirmation of the rights and duties of men baroja has felt this profoundly and has presented it but without abandoning the function of the novelist which is to tell stories about people he is never a propagandist iv i have never hidden my admirations in literature they have been and are dickens balzac poe dostoievski and now stendhal writes baroja in the preface to the nelson edition of la dama errante the wandering lady he follows particularly in the footprints of balzac in that he is primarily a historian of morals who has made a fairly consistent attempt to cover the world he lived in with dostoievski there is a kinship in the passionate hatred of cruelty and stupidity that crops out everywhere in his work i have never found any trace of influence of the other three to be sure there are a few early sketches in the manner of poe but in respect to form he is much more in the purely chaotic tradition of the picaresque novel he despises than in that of the american theorist barojas most important work lies in the four series of novels of the spanish life he lived in madrid in the provincial towns where he practiced medicine and in the basque country where he had been brought up the foundation of these was laid by el arbol de la ciencia the tree of knowledge a novel half autobiographical describing the life and death of a doctor giving a picture of existence in madrid and then in two spanish provincial towns its tremendously vivid painting of inertia and the deadening under its weight of intellectual effort made a very profound impression in spain two novels about the anarchist movement followed it la dama errante which describes the state of mind of forwardlooking spaniards at the time of the famous anarchist attempt on the lives of the king and queen the day of their marriage and la ciudad de la niebla about the spanish colony in london then came the series called la busca the search which to me is barojas best work and one of the most interesting things published in europe in the last decade it deals with the lowest and most miserable life in madrid and is written with a cold acidity which maupassant would have envied and is permeated by a human vividness that i do not think maupassant could have achieved all three novels la busca mala hierba and aurora roja deal with the drifting of a typical uneducated spanish boy son of a maid of all work in a boarding house through different strata of madrid life they give a sense of unadorned reality very rare in any literature and besides their power as novels are immensely interesting as sheer natural history the type of the golfo is a literary discovery comparable with that of sancho panza by cervбntes nothing that baroja has written since is quite on the same level the series el pasado the past gives interesting pictures of provincial life las inquietudes de shanti andia the anxieties of shanti andia a story of basque seamen which contains a charming picture of a childhood in a seaside village in guipuzcoa delightful as it is to read is too muddled in romantic claptrap to add much to his fame el mundo es asн the world is like that expresses rather lamely it seems to me the meditations of a disenchanted revolutionist the latest series memorias de un hombre de acciуn a series of yarns about the revolutionary period in spain at the beginning of the nineteenth century though entertaining is more an attempt to escape in a jolly romantic past the realities of the morose present than anything else cйsar o nada translated into english under the title of aut cжsar aut nullus is also less acid and less effective than his earlier novels that is probably why it was chosen for translation into english we know how anxious our publishers are to furnish food easily digestible by weak american stomachs it is silly to judge any spanish novelist from the point of view of form improvisation is the very soul of spanish writing in thinking back over books of barojas one has read one remembers more descriptions of places and people than anything else in the end it is rather natural history than dramatic creation but a natural history that gives you the pictures etched with vitriol of spanish life in the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century which you get in these novels of barojas is very near the highest sort of creation if we could inject some of the virus of his intense sense of reality into american writers it would be worth giving up all these stale conquests of form we inherited from poe and o henry the following again from the preface of la dama errante is barojas own statement of his aims and certainly he has realized them probably a book like la dama errante is not of the sort that lives very long it is not a painting with aspirations towards the museum but an impressionist canvas perhaps as a work it has too much asperity is too hard not serene enough this ephemeral character of my work does not displease me we are men of the day people in love with the passing moment with all that is fugitive and transitory and the lasting quality of our work preoccupies us little so little that it can hardly be said to preoccupy us at all vi talk by the road spain said don alonso as he and telemachus walked out of illescas followed at a little distance by lyaeus and the dumplingman has never been swept clean there have been the romans and the visigoths and the moors and the french armed men jingling over mountain roads conquest has warped and sterilised our iberian mind without changing an atom of it an example we missed the revolution and suffered from napoleon we virtually had no reformation yet the inquisition was stronger with us than anywhere do you think it will have to be swept clean asked telemachus he does don alonso pointed with a sweep of an arm towards a man working in the field beside the road it was a short man in a blouse he broke the clods the plow had left with a heavy triangular hoe sometimes he raised it only a foot above the ground to poise for a blow sometimes he swung it from over his shoulder face clothes hands hoe were brown against the brown hillside where a purple shadow mocked each heavy gesture with lank gesticulations in the morning silence the blows of the hoe beat upon the air with muffled insistence and he is the man who will do the building went on don alonso it is only fair that we should clear the road but you are the thinkers said telemachus his mother penelopes maxims on the subject of constructive criticism popped up suddenly in his mind like tickets from a cash register thought is the acid that destroys answered don alonso telemachus turned to look once more at the man working in the field the hoe rose and fell rose and fell at a moment on each stroke a flash of sunlight came from it telemachus saw all at once the whole earth plowed fields full of earthcolored men shoulders thrown back bent forward muscles of arms swelling and slackening hoes flashing at the same moment against the sky at the same moment buried with a thud in clods and he felt reassured as a traveller feels hearing the continuous hiss and squudge of well oiled engines out at sea vii cordova no longer of the caliphs when we stepped out of the bookshop the narrow street steamed with the dust of many carriages above the swiftly whirling wheels gaudily dressed men and women sat motionless in attitudes over the backs of the carriages brilliant shawls trailed triangles of red and purple and yellow bread and circuses muttered the man who was with me but not enough bread it was fairtime in cordova the carriages were coming back from the toros we turned into a narrow lane where the dust was yellow between high green and lavenderwashed walls from the street we had left came a sound of cheers and handclapping my friend stopped still and put his hand on my arm there goes belmonte he said half the men who are cheering him have never had enough to eat in their lives the old romans knew better to keep people quiet they filled their bellies those fools he jerked his head backwards with disgust i thought of the shawls and the high combs and the hair gleaming black under lace and the waspwaists of the young men and the insolence of black eyes above the flashing wheels of the carriages those fools give only circuses do you people in the outside world realize that we in andalusia starve that we have starved for generations that those black bulls for the circuses may graze over good wheatland to make spain picturesque the only time we see meat is in the bullring those people who argue all the time as to why spains backward and write books about it i could tell them in one word malnutrition he laughed despairingly and started walking fast again we have solved the problem of the cost of living we live on air and dust and bad smells i had gone into his bookshop a few minutes before to ask an address and had been taken into the back room with the wonderful enthusiastic courtesy one finds so often in spain there the bookseller a carpenter and the booksellers errandboy had all talked at once explaining the last strike of farmlaborers when the region had been for months under martial law and they and every one else of socialist or republican sympathies had been packed for weeks into overcrowded prisons they all regretted they could not take me to the casa del pueblo but they explained laughing the civil guard was occupying it at that moment it ended by the booksellers coming out with me to show me the way to azorнns azorнn was an architect who had supported the strikers he had just come back to cordova from the obscure village where he had been imprisoned through the care of the military governor who had paid him the compliment of thinking that even in prison he would be dangerous in cordova he had recently been elected municipal councillor and when we reached his office was busy designing a schoolhouse on the stairs the bookseller had whispered to me that every workman in cordova would die for azorнn he was a sallow little man with a vaguely sarcastic voice and an amused air as if he would burst out laughing at any moment he put aside his plans and we all went on to see the editor of andalusia a regionalist prolabor weekly in that dark little office over three cups of coffee that appeared miraculously from somewhere with the pungent smell of ink and fresh paper in our nostrils we talked about the past and future of cordova and of all the wide region of northern andalusia fertile irrigated plains dry oliveland stretching up to the rocky waterless mountains where the mines are in azorнns crisp phrases and in the long ornate periods of the editor the serfdom and the squalor and the heroic hope of these peasants and miners and artisans became vivid to me for the first time occasionally the compositor a boy of about fifteen with a brown inksmudged face would poke his head in the door and shout its true what they say but they dont say enough they dont say enough the problem in the south of spain is almost wholly agrarian from the tagus to the mediterranean stretches a mountainous region of low rainfall intersected by several series of broad rivervalleys which under irrigation are enormously productive of rice oranges and in the higher altitudes of wheat in the dry hills grow grapes olives and almonds a country on the whole much like southern california under the moors this region was the richest and most civilised in europe when the christian nobles from the north reconquered it the ecclesiastics laid hold of the towns and extinguished industry through the inquisition while the land was distributed in huge estates to the magnates of the court of the catholic kings the agricultural workers became virtually serfs and the communal village system of working the land gradually gave way now the province of jaen certainly as large as the state of rhode island is virtually owned by six families this process was helped by the fact that all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the liveliest people in all spain swarmed overseas to explore and plunder america or went into the church so that the tilling of the land was left to the humblest and least vigorous and immigration to america has continued the safety valve of the social order it is only comparatively recently that the consciousness has begun to form among the workers of the soil that it is possible for them to change their lot as everywhere else russia has been the beaconflare since an extraordinary tenseness has come over the lives of the frugal sinewy peasants who through centuries of oppression and starvation have kept in spite of almost complete illiteracy a curiously vivid sense of personal independence in the backs of taverns revolutionary tracts are spelled out by some boy who has had a couple of years of school to a crowd of men who listen or repeat the words after him with the fervor of people going through a religious mystery unspeakable faith possesses them in what they call la nueva ley the new law by which the good things a man wrings by his sweat from the earth shall be his and not the property of a distant seсor in madrid it is this hopefulness that marks the difference between the present agrarian agitation and the violent and desperate peasant risings of the past as early as october a congress of agricultural workers was held to decide on strike methods and more important to formulate a demand for the expropriation of the land in two months the unions sociedades de resistencia had been welded at least in the province of cordova into a unified system with more or less central leadership the strike which followed was so complete that in many cases even domestic servants went out after savage repression and the military occupation of the whole province the strike petered out into compromises which resulted in considerable betterment of working conditions but left the important issues untouched the rise in the cost of living and the growing unrest brought matters to a head again in the summer of the military was used with even more brutality than the previous year attempts at compromise at parcelling out uncultivated land have proved as unavailing as the mausers of the civil guard to quell the tumult the peasants have kept their organizations and their demands intact they are even willing to wait but they are determined that the land upon which they have worn out generations and generations shall be theirs without question all this time the landlords brandish a redoubtable weapon starvation already thousands of acres that might be richly fertile lie idle or are pasture for herds of wild bulls for the arena the great landowning families hold estates all over spain if in a given region the workers become too exigent they decide to leave the land in fallow for a year or two in the villages it becomes a question of starve or emigrate to emigrate many certificates are needed many officials have to be placated for all that money is needed men taking to the roads in search of work are persecuted as vagrants by the civil guards arson becomes the last retort of despair at night the standing grain burns mysteriously or the country house of an absent landlord and from the parched hills where gnarled almondtrees grow groups of half starved men watch the flames with grim exultation meanwhile the press in madrid laments the incultura of the andalusian peasants the problem of civilization after all is often one of food calories fernando de los rнos socialist deputy for granada recently published the result of an investigation of the food of the agricultural populations of spain in which he showed that only in the balkans out of all europe was the working man so undernourished the calories which the diet of the average cordova workman represented was something like a fourth of those of the british workmans diet even so the foremen of the big estates complain that as a result of all this social agitation their workmen have taken to eating more than they did in the good old times how long it will be before the final explosion comes no one can conjecture the spring of when great things were expected was completely calm on the other hand in the last municipal elections when six hundred socialist councillors were elected in all spain in contrast to sixtytwo in the vote polled in andalusia was unprecedented up to this election many of the peasants had never dared vote and those that had had been completely under the thumb of the caciques the bosses that control spanish local politics however in spite of socialist and syndicalist propaganda the agrarian problem will always remain separate from anything else in the minds of the peasants this does not mean that they are opposed to communism or cling as violently as most of the european peasantry to the habit of private property all over spain one comes upon traces of the old communist village institutions by which flocks and mills and bakeries and often land were held in common as in all arid countries where everything depends upon irrigation ditches are everywhere built and repaired in common and the idea of private property is of necessity feeble where there is no rain for what good is land to a man without water still until there grows up a much stronger community of interest than now exists between the peasants and the industrial workers the struggle for the land and the struggle for the control of industry will be in spain as i think everywhere parallel rather than unified one thing is certain however long the fire smoulders before it flares high to make a clean sweep of spanish capitalism and spanish feudalism together cordova hoary city of the caliphs where ghosts of old grandeurs flit about the zigzag ochrecolored lanes will when the moment comes be the center of organization of the agrarian revolution when i was leaving spain i rode with some young men who were emigrating to america to make their fortunes they said when i told them i had been to cordova their faces became suddenly bright with admiration ah cordova one of them cried theyve got the guts in cordova viii talk by the road at the first crossroads beyond illescas the dumplingman and don alonso turned off in quest of the trout stream don alonso waved solemnly to lyaeus and telemachus perhaps we shall meet in toledo he said catch a lot of fish shouted lyaeus and perhaps a thought was the last word they heard from don alonso the sun already high in the sky poured tingling heat on their heads and shoulders there was sand in their shoes an occasional sharp pain in their shins in their bellies bitter emptiness at the next village tel im going to bed you can do what you like said lyaeus in a tearful voice ill like that all right buenos dнas seсores viajeros came a cheerful voice they found they were walking in the company of a man who wore a tightwaisted overcoat of a light blue color a creamcolored felt hat from under which protruded long black moustaches with gimlet points and shoes with lemonyellow uppers they passed the time of day with what cheerfulness they could muster ah toledo said the man you are going to toledo my birthplace there i was born in the shadow of the cathedral there i shall die i am a traveller of commerce he produced two cards as large as postcards on which was written antonio silva y yepes universal agent import export national products at your service gentlemen he said and handed each of them a card i deal in tinware ironware pottery lead pipes enameled ware kitchen utensils american toilet articles french perfumery cutlery linen sewing machines saddles bridles seeds fancy poultry fighting bantams and objects de vertu you are foreigners are you not how barbarous spain what people what dirt what lack of culture what impoliteness what lack of energy the universal agent choked coughed spat produced a handkerchief of crimson silk with which he wiped his eyes and mouth twirled his moustaches and plunged again into a torrent of words turning on telemachus from time to time little redrimmed eyes full of moist pathos like a dogs oh there are times gentlemen when it is too much to bear when i rejoice to think that its all up with my lungs and that i shant live long anyway in america i should have been a rockefeller a carnegie a morgan i know it for i am a man of genius it is true i am a man of genius and look at me here walking from one of these cursed tumbledown villages to another because i have not money enough to hire a cab and ill too dying of consumption o spain spain how do you crush your great men what you must think of us you who come from civilized countries where life is organized where commerce is a gentlemanly even a noble occupation but you savor life more ca ca interrupted the universal agent with a downward gesture of the hand to think that they call by the same name living here in a pen like a pig and living in paris london new york biarritz trouville luxurious beds coiffures toilettes theatrical functions sumptuous automobiles elegant ladies glittering with diamonds the world of light and enchantment oh to think of it and spain could be the richest country in europe if we had energy organization culture think of the exports iron coal copper silver oranges hides mules olives food products woolens cotton cloth sugarcane raw cotton couplets dancers gipsy girls the universal agent had quite lost his breath he coughed for a long time into his crimson handkerchief then looked about him over the rolling dun slopes to which the young grain sprouting gave a sheen of vivid green like the patina on a pompeian bronze vase and shrugged his shoulders ўquй vida what a life for some time a spire had been poking up into the sky at the roads end now yellowtiled roofs were just visible humped out of the wheatland with the church standing guard over them its buttresses as bowed as the legs of a bulldog at the sight of the village a certain spring came back to telemachuss fatiguesodden legs he noticed with envy that lyaeus took little skips as he walked if we properly exploited our exports we should be the richest people in europe the universal agent kept shouting with farflung gestures of despair and the last they heard from him as they left him to turn into the manurelittered chickennoisy courtyard of the posada de la luna was ўquй pueblo indecente what a beastly town yet if they exploited with energy with modern energy their exports ix an inverted midas every age must have had choice spirits whose golden fingers turned everything they touched to commonplace since we know our own literature best it seems unreasonably well equipped with these inverted midases though the fact that all angloamerican writing during the last century has been so exclusively of the middle classes by the middle classes and for the middle classes must count for something still rome had her marcus aurelius and we may be sure that platitudes would have obscured the slanting sides of the pyramids had stonecutting in the reign of cheops been as disastrously easy as is printing today the addition of the typewriter to the printingpress has given a new and horrible impetus to the spread of halfbaked thought the labor of graving on stone or of baking tablets of brick or even of scrawling letters on paper with a pen is no longer a curb on the dangerous fluency of the inverted midas he now lolls in a morris chair sipping iced tea dictating to four blonde and two darkhaired stenographers three novels a couple of books of travel and a short story written at once are nothing to a really enterprising universal genius poor julius caesar with his letters we complain that we have no supermen nowadays that we cant live as much or as widely or as fervently or get through so much work as could pico della mirandola or erasmus or politian that the race drifts towards mental and physical anжmia i deny it with the typewriter all these things shall be added unto us this age too has its great universal geniuses they overrun the seven continents and their respective seas accompanied by mжnadic bands of stenographers and a music of typewriters deliriously clicking they go about the world catching all the butterflies rubbing the bloom off all the plums tunneling mountains bridging seas smoothing the facets off ideas so that they may be swallowed harmlessly like pills with true anglosaxon conceit we had thought that our own mr wells was the most universal of these universal geniuses he has so diligently brought science ethics sex marriage sociology god and everything else properly deodorized of course to the desk of the ordinary man that he may lean back in his swivelchair and receive faint susuration from the sense of progress and the complexity of life without even having to go to the window to look at the sparrows sitting in rows on the telephonewires so that really it seemed inconceivable that anyone should be more universal it was rumored that there lay the ultimate proof of anglosaxon ascendancy what other race had produced a great universal genius but all that was before the discovery of blasco ibбсez on the backs of certain of blasco ibбсezs novels published by the casa prometeo in valencia is this significant advertisement obras de vulgarizaciуn popular works of popular vulgarization under it is an astounding list of volumes all either translated or edited or arranged if not written from cover to cover by one tireless pen i mean typewriter ten volumes of universal history three volumes of the french revolution translated from michelet a universal geography a social history works on science cookery and housecleaning nine volumes of blasco ibбсezs own history of the european war and a translation of the arabian nights a thousand and one of them without an hour missing works of popular vulgarization i admit that in spanish the word vulgarizaciуn has not yet sunk to its inevitable meaning but can it long stand such a strain add to that list a round two dozen novels and some books of travel and who can deny that blasco ibбсez is a great universal genius read his novels and you will find that he has looked at the stars and knows lord kelvins theory of vortices and the nebular hypothesis and the direction of ocean currents and the qualities of kelp and the direction the codfish go in iceland waters when the northeast wind blows that he knows about gothic architecture and byzantine painting the social movement in jerez and the exports of patagonia the wallpaper of paris apartment houses and the red paste with which countesses polish their fingernails in monte carlo the very pattern of a modern majorgeneral and like the great universal geniuses of the renaissance he has lived as well as thought and written he is said to have been thirty times in prison six times deputy he has been a cowboy in the pampas of argentina he has founded a city in patagonia with a bullring and a bust of cervantes in the middle of it he has rounded the horn on a sailingship in a hurricane and it is whispered that like victor hugo he eats lobsters with the shells on he hobnobs with the universe one must admit too that blasco ibбсezs universe is a bulkier burlier universe than mr wellss one is strangely certain that the axle of mr wellss universe is fixed in some suburb of london say putney where each house has a bit of garden where waddles an asthmatic pet dog where people drink tea weak with milk in it before a gaslog where every bookcase makes a futile effort to impinge on infinity through the encyclopedia where life is a monotonous going and coming swathed in clothes that must above all be respectable to business and from business but who can say where blasco ibбсezs universe centers it is in constant progression starting as walt whitman from fishshaped paumonauk from the fierce green fertility of valencia city of another great spanish conqueror the cid he had marched on the world in battle array the whole history comes out in the series of novels at this moment being translated in such feverish haste for the edification of the american public the beginnings are stories of the peasants of the fertile plain round about valencia of the fishermen and sailors of el grao the port a sturdy violent people living amid a snappy fury of vegetation unexampled in europe his method is inspired to a certain extent by zola taking from him a little of the newspaperhorror mode of realism with inevitable murder and sudden death in the last chapters yet he expresses that life vividly although even then more given to grand vague ideas than to a careful scrutiny of men and things he is at home in the strong communal feeling in the individual anarchism in the passionate worship of the water that runs through the fields to give life and of the blades of wheat that give bread and of the wine that gives joy which is the moral makeup of the valencian peasant he is sincerely indignant about the agrarian system about social inequality and is full of the revolutionary bravado of his race a typical novel of this period is la barraca a story of a peasant family that takes up land which has lain vacant for years under the curse of the community since the eviction of the tenants who had held it for generations by a landlord who was murdered as a result on a lonely road by the father of the family he had turned out the struggle of these peasants against their neighbours is told with a good deal of feeling and the culmination in a rifle fight in an irrigation ditch is a splendid bit of blood and thunder there are many descriptions of local customs such as the tribunal of water that sits once a week under one of the portals of valencia cathedral to settle conflicts of irrigation rights a little dragged in by the heels to be sure but still worth reading yet even in these early novels one feels over and over again the force of that phrase popular vulgarization valencia is being vulgarized for the benefit of the universe the proletariat is being vulgarized for the benefit of the people who buy novels from valencia raids seem to have been made on other parts of spain sonnica la cortesana gives you antique saguntum and the usual aves wreaths fluteplayers and other claptrap of costume novels in la catedral you have toledo the church socialism and the modern world in the shadow of gothic spires la bodega takes you into the genial air of the wine vaults of jerezdelafrontera with smugglers processions blessing the vineyards and agrarian revolt in the background up to now they have been spanish novels written for spaniards it is only with sangre y arena that the virus of a european reputation shows results in sangre y arena to be sure you learn that toreros use scent have a home life and are seduced by passionate baudelairian ladies of the smart set who plant white teeth in their brown sinewy arms and teach them to smoke opium cigarettes you see toreros taking the sacraments before going into the ring and you see them tossed by the bull while the crowd which a moment before had been crying hola as if it didnt know that something was going wrong gets very pale and chilly and begins to think what dreadful things corridas are anyway until the arrival of the next bull makes them forget it all of which is good fun when not obscured by grand vague ideas and incidentally sells like hot cakes thenceforward the casa prometeo becomes an exporting house dealing in the good spanish products of violence and sunshine blood voluptuousness and death as another vulgarizer put it next comes the expedition to south america and the argonauts appears the atlantic is bridged there open up rich veins of picturesqueness and new grand vague ideas all in full swing when the war breaks out blasco ibбсez meets the challenge nobly and very soon with the four horsemen of the apocalypse which captures the allied world and proves again the mot about prophets so without honor in its own country is the four horsemen that the english translation rights are sold for a paltry three thousand pesetas but the great success in england and america soon shows that we can appreciate the acumen of a neutral who came in and rooted for our side so early in the race too while the

circe and a vamping theda bara who was really a german spy in one grand chant of praise before the mumbojumbo of nationalism los enemigos de la mujer the latest production abandons spain entirely and plants itself in the midst of princes and countesses all elaborately proally at monte carlo forgotten the proletarian tastes of his youth the local color he loved to lay on so thickly the habaсera atmosphere only the grand vague ideas subsist in the cosmopolite and the fluency that fatal latin fluency and now the united states the home of the blonde stenographer and the typewriter and the press agent what are we to expect from the combination of blasco ibбсez and broadway at any rate the movies will profit yet one cant help wishing that blasco ibбсez had not learnt the typewriter trick so early print so easily spins a web of the commonplace over the fine outlines of life and blasco ibбсez need not have been an inverted midas his is a superbly mediterranean type with something of arretino something of garibaldi something of tartarin of tarascon blustering sensual enthusiastic living at bottom in a real world which can hardly be said of anglosaxon vulgarizers even if it is a real world obscured by grand vague ideas blasco ibбсezs mere energy would have produced interesting things if it had not found such easy and immediate vent in the typewriter bottle up a man like that for a lifetime without means of expression and hell produce memoirs equal to marco polo and casanova but let his energies flow out evenly without resistance through a corps of clicking typewriters and all you have is one more popular novelist it is unfortunate too that blasco ibбсez and the united states should have discovered each other at this moment they will do each other no good we have an abundance both of vague grand ideas and of popular novelists and we are the favorite breeding place of the inverted midas we need writing that shall be acid with sharp edges on it yeasty to leaven the lump of glucose that the combination of the ideals of the man in the swivelchair with decayed puritanism has made of our national consciousness of course blasco ibбсez in america will only be a seven days marvel nothing is ever more than that but why need we pretend each time that our seven days marvels are the great eternal things then too if the american public is bound to take up spain it might as well take up the worthwhile things instead of the works of popular vulgarization they have enough of those in their bookcases as it is and in spain there is a novelist like baroja essayists like unamuno and azorнn poets like valle inclбn and antonio machado but i suppose they will shine with the reflected glory of the author of the four horsemen of the apocalypse x talk by the road when they woke up it was dark they were cold their legs were stiff they lay each along one edge of a tremendously wide bed between them a tangle of narrow sheets and blankets telemachus raised himself to a sitting position and put his feet that were still swollen gingerly to the floor he drew them up again with a jerk and sat with his teeth chattering hunched on the edge of the bed lyaeus burrowed into the blankets and went back to sleep for a long while telemachus could not thaw his frozen wits enough to discover what noise had waked him up then it came upon him suddenly that huge rhythms were pounding about him sounds of shaken tambourines and castanettes and beaten dishpans and roaring voices someone was singing in shrill tremolo above the din a song of which each verse seemed to end with the phrase y maсana carnaval tomorrows carnival wake up he cried out to lyaeus and pulled on his trousers lyaeus sat up and rubbed his eyes i smell wine he said telemachus through hunger and stiffness and aching feet and the thought of what his mother penelope would say about these goings on if they ever came to her ears felt a tremendous elation flare through him come on theyre dancing he cried dragging lyaeus out on the gallery that overhung the end of the court dont forget the butterfly net tel what for to catch your gesture what do you think telemachus caught lyaeus by the shoulders and shook him as they wrestled they caught glimpses of the courtyard full of couples bobbing up and down in a jota in the doorway stood two guitar players and beside them a table with pitchers and glasses and a glint of spilt wine feeble light came from an occasional little constellation of oliveoil lamps when the two of them pitched down stairs together and shot out reeling among the dancers everybody cried out hola and shouted that the foreigners must sing a song after dinner cried lyaeus as he straightened his necktie we havent eaten for a year and a half the padrуn a red thicknecked individual with a weeks white bristle on his face came up to them holding out hands as big as hams you are going to toledo for carnival o how lucky the young are travelling all over the world he turned to the company with a gesture i was like that when i was young they followed him into the kitchen where they ensconced themselves on either side of a cave of a fireplace in which burned a fire all too small the hunchbacked woman with a face like tanned leather who was tending the numerous steaming pots that stood about the hearth noticing that they were shivering heaped dry twigs on it that crackled and burst into flame and gave out a warm spicy tang tomorrows carnival she said we mustnt stint ourselves then she handed them each a plate of soup full of bread in which poached eggs floated and the padrуn drew the table near the fire and sat down opposite them peering with interest into their faces while they ate after a while he began talking from outside the handclapping and the sound of castanettes continued interrupted by intervals of shouting and laughter and an occasional snatch from the song that ended every verse with y maсana carnaval i travelled when i was your age he said i have been to america nueva york montreal buenos aires chicago san francisco selling those little nuts yes peanuts what a country how many laws there are there how many policemen when i was young i did not like it but now that i am old and own an inn and daughters and all that vamos i understand you see in spain we all do just as we like then if we are the sort that goes to church we repent afterwards and fix it up with god in european civilized modern countries everybody learns what hes got to do and what he must not do thats why they have so many laws here the police are just to help the government plunder and steal all it wants but thats not so in america the difference is broke in telemachus as butler put it between living under the law and living under grace i should rather live under gra but he thought of the maxims of penelope and was silent but after all we know how to sing said the padrуn will you have coffee with cognac and poets man alive what poets the padrуn stuck out his chest put one hand in the black sash that held up his trousers and recited emphasizing the rhythm with the cognac bottle aquн estб don juan tenorio no hay hombre para йl bъsquenle los reсidores cйrquenle los jugadores quien se prйcie que le ataje a ver si hay quien le aventaje en juego en lid o en amores he finished with a flourish and poured more cognac into the coffee cups ўque bonito how pretty cried the old hunchbacked woman who sat on her heels in the fireplace thats what we do said the padrуn we brawl and gamble and seduce women and we sing and we dance and then we repent and the priest fixes it up with god in america they live according to law feeling welltoasted by the fire and wellwarmed with food and drink lyaeus and telemachus went to the inn door and looked out on the broad main street of the village where everything was snowy white under the cold stare of the moon the dancing had stopped in the courtyard a group of men and boys was moving slowly up the street each one with a musical instrument there were the two guitars frying pans castanettes cymbals and a goatskin bottle of wine that kept being passed from hand to hand each time the bottle made a round a new song started and so they moved slowly up the street in the moonlight lets join them said lyaeus no i want to get up early so as to see the gesture by daylight cried lyaeus jeeringly then he went on tel you live under the law under the law there can be no gestures only machine movements then he ran off and joined the group of men and boys who were singing and drinking telemachus went back to bed on his way upstairs he cursed the maxims of his mother penelope but at any rate tomorrow in carnivaltime he would feel the gesture xi antonio machado poet of castile i spent fifty thousand pesetas in a year at the military school jaime le chic said the young artillery officer of whom i had asked the way he was leading me up the steep cobbled hill that led to the irregular main street of segovia a moment before we had passed under the aqueduct that had soared above us arch upon arch into the crimson sky he had snapped tightly gloved fingers and said and whats that good for id like to know id give it all for a puff of gasoline from a hispanosuizo dyou know the hispanosuizo and look at this rotten town theres not a street in it i can speed on in a motorcycle without running down some fool old woman or a squalling brat or other whos this gentleman you are going to see hes a poet i said i like poetry too i write it light elegant about light elegant women he laughed and twirled the tiny waxed spike that stuck out from each side of his moustache he left me at the end of the street i was looking for and after an elaborate salute walked off saying to think that you should come here from new york to look for an address in such a shabby street and i so want to go to new york if i was a poet i wouldnt live here the name on the street corner was calle de los desemparados street of abandoned children we sat a long while in the casino twiddling spoons in coffeeglasses while a waxpink fat man played billiards in front of us being ponderously beaten by a lean brownish swallowtail with yellow face and walrus whiskers that emitted a rasping bueno after every play there was talk of paris and possible new volumes of verse homage to walt whitman maragall questioning about emily dickinson about us was a smell of old horsehair sofas a buzz of the poignant musty ennui of old towns left centuries ago high and dry on the beach of history the group grew talk of painting zuloaga had not come yet the zubiaurre brothers had abandoned their basque coast towns seduced by the bronzecolored people and the saffron hills of the province of segovia sorolla was dying another had gone mad at last someone said its stifling here lets walk there is full moon tonight there was no sound in the streets but the irregular clatter of our footsteps the slanting moonlight cut the street into two triangular sections one enormously black the other bright engraved like a silver plate with the lines of doors roofs windows ornaments overhead the sky was white and blue like buttermilk blackness cut across our path then there was dazzling light through an arch beyond outside the gate we sat in a ring on square freshcut stones in which you could still feel a trace of the warmth of the sun to one side was the limewashed wall of a house white fire cut by a wide oaken door where the moon gave a restless glitter to the spiked nails and the knocker and above the door red geraniums hanging out of a pot their color insanely bright in the silverwhite glare the other side a deep glen the shimmering tops of poplar trees and the sound of a stream in the dark above the arch of the gate a trembling oil flame showed up the green feet of a painted virgin everybody was talking about el buscуn a story of quevedos that takes place mostly in segovia a wandering story of thieves and escapes by night through the back doors of brothels of rope ladders dangling from the windows of great ladies of secrets overheard in confessionals and trysts under bridges and fingers touching significantly in the holywater fonts of tall cathedrals a ghostlike wraith of dust blew through the gate the man next me shivered the dead are stronger than the living he said how little we have and they in the quaver of his voice was a remembering of long muletrains jingling through the gate queens in litters hung with patchwork curtains from samarcand gold brocades splashed with the clay of deep roads stained with the blood of ambuscades bales of silks from valencia travelling gangs of moorish artisans heavy armed templars on their way to the sepulchre wandering minstrels sneakthieves bawds rowdy strings of knights and footsoldiers setting out with wineskins at their saddlebows to cross the passes towards the debatable lands of extremadura where there were infidels to kill and cattle to drive off and village girls to rape all when the gate was as new and crisply cut out of clean stone as the blocks we were sitting on down in the valley a donkey brayed long and dismally they too have their nostalgias said someone sentimentally what they of the old time did not have came a deep voice from under a bowler hat was the leisure to be sad the sweetness of putrefaction the long remembering of palely colored moods they had the sun we have the colors of its setting who shall say which is worth more the man next to me had got to his feet a night like this with a moon like this he said we should go to the ancient quarter of the witches gravel crunched under our feet down the road that led out of moonlight into the darkness of the glen to san millбn de las brujas you cannot read any spanish poet of today without thinking now and then of rubйn darнo that prodigious nicaraguan who collected into his verse all the tendencies of poetry in france and america and the orient and poured them in a turgid cataract full of mud and golddust into the thought of the new generation in spain overflowing with beauty and banality patched out with images and ornaments from greece and egypt and france and japan and his own central america symbolist and romantic and parnassian all at once rubйn darнos verse is like those doorways of the spanish renaissance where french and moorish and italian motives jostle in headlong arabesques where the vulgarest routine stonechipping is interlocked with designs and forms of rare beauty and significance here and there among the turgid muddle out of the impact of unassimilated things comes a spark of real poetry and that spark can be said as truly as anything of the sort can be said to be the motive force of the whole movement of renovation in spanish poetry of course the poets have not been content to be influenced by the outside world only through darнo baudelaire and verlaine had a very large direct influence once the way was opened and their influence succeeded in curbing the lush impromptu manner of romantic spanish verse in antonio machados work and he is beginning to be generally considered the central figure there is a restraint and terseness of phrase rare in any poetry i do not mean to imply that machado can be called in any real sense a pupil of either darнo or verlaine rather one would say that in a generation occupied largely in more or less unsuccessful imitation of these poets machados poetry stands out as particularly original and personal in fact except for the verse of juan ramуn jimйnez it would be in america and england rather than in spain in aldington and amy lowell that one would find analogous aims and methods the influence of the symbolists and the turbulent experimenting of the nicaraguan broke down the bombastic romantic style current in spain as it was broken down everywhere else in the middle nineteenth century in machados work a new method is being built up that harks back more to early ballads and the verse of the first moments of the renaissance than to anything foreign but which shows the same enthusiasm for the rhythms of ordinary speech and for the simple pictorial expression of undoctored emotion that we find in the renovators of poetry the world over campos de castilla his first volume to be widely read marks an epoch in spanish poetry antonio machados verse is taken up with places it is obsessed with the old spanish towns where he has lived with the mellow sadness of tortuous streets and of old houses that have soaked up the lives of generations upon generations of men crumbling in the flaming silence of summer noons or in the icy blast off the mountains in winter though born in andalusia the bitter strength of the castilian plain where halfdeserted cities stand aloof from the world shrunken into their walls still dreaming of the ages of faith and conquest has subjected his imagination and the purity of castilian speech has dominated his writing until his poems seem as castilian as don quixote my childhood memories of a courtyard in seville and of a bright garden where lemons hung ripening my youth twenty years in the land of castile my history a few events i do not care to remember so machado writes of himself he was born in the eighties has been a teacher of french in government schools in soria and baeza and at present in segovia all old spanish cities very mellow and very stately and has made the migration to paris customary with spanish writers and artists he says in the poema de un dнa here i am already a teacher of modern languages who yesterday was a master of the gai scavoir and the nightingales apprentice he has published three volumes of verse soledades solitudes campos de castilla fields of castile and soledades y galerнas solitudes and galleries and recently a government institution the residencia de estudiantes has published his complete works up to date the following translations are necessarily inadequate as the poems depend very much on modulations of rhythm and on the expressive fitting together of words impossible to render in a foreign language he uses rhyme comparatively little often substituting assonance in accordance with the peculiar traditions of spanish prosody i have made no attempt to imitate his form exactly i yes come away with me fields of soria quiet evenings violet mountains aspens of the river green dreams of the grey earth bitter melancholy of the crumbling city perhaps it is that you have become the background of my life men of the high numantine plain who keep god like old christians may the sun of spain fill you with joy and light and abundance ii a frail sound of a tunic trailing across the infertile earth and the sonorous weeping of the old bells the dying embers of the horizon smoke white ancestral ghosts go lighting the stars open the balconywindow the hour of illusion draws near the afternoon has gone to sleep and the bells dream iii figures in the fields against the sky two slow oxen plough on a hillside early in autumn and between the black heads bent down under the weight of the yoke hangs and sways a basket of reeds a childs cradle and behind the yoke stride a man who leans towards the earth and a woman who into the open furrows throws the seed under a cloud of carmine and flame in the liquid green gold of the setting their shadows grow monstrous iv naked is the earth and the soul howls to the wan horizon like a hungry shewolf what do you seek poet in the sunset bitter going for the path weighs one down the frozen wind and the coming night and the bitterness of distance on the white path the trunks of frustrate trees show black on the distant mountains there is gold and blood the sun dies what do you seek poet in the sunset v silver hills and grey ploughed lands violet outcroppings of rock through which the duero traces its curve like a crossbow about soria dark oakwood wild cliffs bald peaks and the white roads and the aspens of the river afternoons of soria mystic and warlike today i am very sad for you sadness of love fields of soria where it seems that the rocks dream come with me violet rocky outcroppings silver hills and grey ploughed lands vi we think to create festivals of love out of our love to burn new incense on untrodden mountains and to keep the secret of our pale faces and why in the bacchanals of life we carry empty glasses while with tinkling echoes and laughing foams the gold must of the grape a hidden bird among the branches of the solitary park whistles mockery we feel the shadow of a dream in our wineglass and something that is earth in our flesh feels the dampness of the garden like a caress vii i have been back to see the golden aspens aspens of the road along the duero between san polo and san saturio beyond the old stiff walls of soria barbican towards aragon of the castilian lands these poplars of the river that chime when the wind blows their dry leaves to the sound of the water have in their bark the names of lovers initials and dates aspens of love where yesterday the branches were full of nightingales aspens that tomorrow will sing under the scented wind of the springtime aspens of love by the water that speeds and goes by dreaming aspens of the bank of the duero come away with me viii cold soria clear soria key of the outlands with the warrior castle in ruins beside the duero and the stiff old walls and the blackened houses dead city of barons and soldiers and huntsmen whose portals bear the shields of a hundred hidalgos city of hungry greyhounds of lean greyhounds that swarm among the dirty lanes and howl at midnight when the crows caw cold soria the clock of the lawcourts has struck one soria city of castile so beautiful under the moon ix at a friends burial they put him away in the earth a horrible july afternoon under a sun of fire a step from the open grave grew roses with rotting petals among geraniums of bitter fragrance redflowered the sky a pale blue a wind hard and dry hanging on the thick ropes the two gravediggers let the coffin heavily down into the grave it struck the bottom with a sharp sound solemnly in the silence the sound of a coffin striking the earth is something unutterably solemn the heavy clods broke into dust over the black coffin a white mist of dust rose in the air out of the deep grave and you without a shadow now sleep long peace to your bones for all time you sleep a tranquil and a real sleep x the iberian god like the crossbowman the gambler in the song the iberian had an arrow for his god when he shattered the grain with hail and ruined the fruits of autumn and a gloria when he fattened the barley and the oats that were to make bread tomorrow god of ruin i worship because i wait and because i fear i bend in prayer to the earth a blasphemous heart lord through whom i snatch my bread with pain i know your strength i know my slavery lord of the clouds in the east that trample the countryside of dry autumns and late frosts and of the blasts of heat that scorch the harvests lord of the iris in the green meadows where the sheep graze lord of the fruit the worms gnaw and of the hut the whirlwind shatters your breath gives life to the fire in the hearth your warmth ripens the tawny grain and your holy hand st johns eve hardens the stone of the green olive lord of riches and poverty of fortune and mishap who gives to the rich luck and idleness and pain and hope to the poor lord lord in the inconstant wheel of the year i have sown my sowing that has an equal chance with the coins of a gambler sown on the gamblingtable lord a father today though stained with yesterdays blood twofaced of love and vengeance to you dice cast into the wind goes my prayer blasphemy and praise this man who insults god in his altars without more care of the frown of fate also dreamed of paths across the seas and said it is god who walks upon the waters is it not he who put god above war beyond fate beyond the earth beyond the sea and death did he not give the greenest bough of the darkgreen iberian oak for gods holy bonfire and for love flame one with god but today what does a day matter for the new household gods there are plains in forest shade and green boughs in the old oakwoods though long the land waits for the curved plough to open the first furrow there is sowing for gods grain under thistles and burdocks and nettles what does a day matter yesterday waits for tomorrow tomorrow for infinity men of spain neither is the past dead nor is tomorrow nor yesterday written who has seen the face of the iberian god i wait for the iberian man who with strong hands will carve out of castilian oak the parched god of the grey land xii a catalan poet it is time for sailing the swallow has come chattering and the mellow west wind the meadows are already in bloom the sea is silent and the waves the rough winds pummeled up anchors and loose the hawsers sailor set every stitch of canvas this i priapos the harbor god command you man that you may sail for all manner of ladings leonidas in the greek anthology catalonia like greece is a country of mountains and harbors where the farmers and herdsmen of the hills can hear in the morning the creak of oars and the crackling of cordage as the great booms of the wingshaped sails are hoisted to the tops of the stumpy masts of the fishermens boats barcelona with its fine harbor nestling under the towering slopes of montjuic has been a trading city since most ancient times in the middle ages the fleets of its stocky merchants were the economic scaffolding which underlay the pomp and heraldry of the great sea kingdom of the aragonese to this day you can find on old buildings the arms of the kings of aragon and the counts of barcelona in mallorca and manorca and ibiza and sardinia and sicily and naples it follows that when catalonia begins to reлmerge as a nucleus of national consciousness after nearly four centuries of subjection to castile poets speaking catalan writing catalan shall be poets of the mountains and of the sea yet this time the motor force is not the sailing of white argosies towards the east it is textile mills stable motionless drawing about them muddled populations raw towns fattening to new arrogance the descendants of those stubborn burghers who gave the kings of aragon and of castile such vexing moments theres a story of one king who was so chagrined by the tightpursed contrariness of the cortes of barcelona that he died of a broken heart in full parliament assembled this growth of industry during the last century coupled with the reawakening of the whole mediterranean took form politically in the catalan movement for secession from spain and in literature in the resurrection of catalan thought and catalan language naturally the first generation was not interested in the manufactures that were the dynamo that generated the ferment of their lives they had first to state the emotions of the mountains and the sea and of ancient heroic stories that had been bottled up in their race during centuries of inexpressiveness for another generation perhaps the symbols will be the cluck of oiled cogs the whirring of looms the dragon forms of smoke spewed out of tall chimneys and the substance will be the painful struggle for freedom for sunnier richer life of the huddled mobs of the slaves of the machines for the first men conscious of their status as catalans the striving was to make permanent their individual lives in terms of political liberty of the mistcapped mountains and the changing sea of this first generation was juan maragall who died in five years after the shooting of ferrer after a life spent almost entirely in barcelona writing for newspapers as far as one can gather a completely peaceful wellmarried existence punctuated by a certain amount of political agitation in the cause of the independence of catalonia the life of a placid and recognized literary figure un maоtre the french would have called him perhaps six centuries before in palma de mallorca a young nobleman a poet a skilled player on the lute had stood tiptoe for attainment before the highborn and very stately lady he had courted through many moonlight nights when her eye had chilled his quivering love suddenly and she had pulled open her bodice with both hands and shown him her breasts one white and firm and the other swollen black and purple with cancer the horror of the sight of such beauty rotting away before his eyes had turned all his passion inward and would have made him a saint had his ideas been more orthodox as it was the blessed ramуn lull lived to write many mystical works in catalan and latin in which he sought the love of god in the love of earth after the manner of the sufi of persia eventually he attained bloody martyrdom arguing with the sages in some north african town somehow the spirit of the tortured thirteenthcentury mystic was born again in the calm barcelona journalist whose life was untroubled by the impact of events as could only be a life comprising the last half of the nineteenth century in maragalls writings modulated in the lovely homely language of the peasants and fishermen of catalonia there flames again the passionate metaphor of lull here is a rough translation of one of his best known poems at sunset time drinking at the springs edge i drank down the secrets of mysterious earth deep in the runnel i saw the stainless water born out of darkness for the delight of my mouth and it poured into my throat and with its clear spurting there filled me entirely mellowness of wisdom when i stood straight and looked mountains and woods and meadows seemed to me otherwise everything altered above the great sunset there already shone through the glowing carmine contours of the clouds the white sliver of the new moon it was a world in flower and the soul of it was i i the fragrant soul of the meadows that expands at flowertime and reapingtime i the peaceful soul of the herds that tinkle halfhidden by the tall grass i the soul of the forest that sways in waves like the sea and has as far horizons and also i was the soul of the willow tree that gives every spring its shade i the sheer soul of the cliffs where the mist creeps up and scatters and the unquiet soul of the stream that shrieks in shining waterfalls i was the blue soul of the pond that looks with strange eyes on the wanderer i the soul of the allmoving wind and the humble soul of opening flowers i was the height of the high peaks the clouds caressed me with great gestures and the wide love of misty spaces clove to me placid i felt the delightfulness of springs born in my flanks gifts of the glaciers and in the ample quietude of horizons i felt the reposeful sleep of storms and when the sky opened about me and the sun laughed on my green planes people far off stood still all day staring at my sovereign beauty but i full of the lust that makes furious the sea and mountains lifted myself up strongly through the sky lifted the diversity of my flanks and entrails at sunset time drinking at the springs edge i drank down the secrets of mysterious earth the sea and mountains mist and cattle and yellow broomflowers and fishing boats with lateen sails like dark wings against the sunrise towards mallorca delight of the nose and the eyes and the ears in all living perceptions until the poison of otherworldliness wells up suddenly in him and he is a christian and a mystic full of echoes of old soultorturing in maragalls most expressive work a sequence of poems called el comte arnau all this is synthesized these are from the climax all the voices of the earth acclaim count arnold because from the dark trial he has come back triumphant son of the earth son of the earth count arnold now ask now ask what cannot you do live live live forever i would never die to be like a wheel revolving to live with wine and a sword wheels roll roll but they count the years then i would be a rock immobile to suns or storms rock lives without life forever impenetrable then the evermoving sea that opens a path for all things the sea is alone alone you go accompanied then be the air when it flames in the light of the deathless sun but air and sun are loveless ignorant of eternity then to be man more than man to be earth palpitant you shall be wheel and rock you shall be the mistveiled sea you shall be the air in flame you shall be the whirling stars you shall be man more than man for you have the will for it you shall run the plains and hills all the earth that is so wide mounted on a horse of flame you shall be tireless terrible as the tramp of the storms all the voices of earth will cry out whirling about you they will call you spirit in torment call you forever damned night all the beauty of adalaisa asleep at the feet of naked christ arnold goes pacing a dark path there is silence among the mountains in front of him the rustling lisp of a river a pool then it is lost and soundless arnold stands under the sheer portal he goes searching the cells for adalaisa and sees her sleeping beautiful prone at the feet of the naked christ without veil without kerchief without cloak gestureless without any defense there sleeping she had a great head of turbulent hair how like fine silk your hair adalaisa thinks arnold but he looks at her silently she sleeps she sleeps and little by little a flush spreads over all her face as if a dream had crept through her gently until she laughs aloud very softly with a tremulous flutter of the lips what amorous lips adalaisa thinks arnold but he looks at her silently a great sigh swells through her sleeping like a seawave and fades to stillness what sighs swell in your breast adalaisa thinks arnold but he stares at her silently but when she opens her eyes he awake tingling carries her off in his arms when they burst out into the open fields it is day but the fear of life gushes suddenly to muddy the dear wellspring of sensation and the poet beaten to his knees writes and when the terrorhaunted moment comes to close these earthly eyes of mine open for me lord other greater eyes to look upon the immensity of your face but before that moment comes through the medium of an extraordinarily terse and unspoiled language a language that has not lost its earthy freshness by mauling and softening at the hands of literary generations what a lilting crystalbright vision of things it is as if the air of the mediterranean itself thin brilliant had been hammered into cadences the verse is leaping and free full of echoes and refrains the images are sudden and unlabored like the images in the greek anthology a hermit released from nebuchadnezzars spell gets to his feet like a bear standing upright fishing boats being shoved off the beach slide into the sea one by one like village girls joining a dance on a rough day the smacks with reefed sails skip like goats at the harbor entrance there are phrases like the great asleepness of the mountains a long sigh like a seawave through her sleep my speech of her is like a flight of birds that lead your glance into intense blue sky the disquieting unquiet sea perhaps it is that the eyes are sharpened by the yearning to stare through the brilliant changing forms of things into some intenser beyond perhaps it takes a hot intoxicating draught of divinity to melt into such white fire the various colors of the senses perhaps earthly joy is intenser for the beckoning flames of hell the daily life too to which maragall aspires seems strangely out of another age that came home to me most strongly once talking to a catalan after a mountain scramble in the eastern end of mallorca we sat looking at the sea that was violet with sunset where the sails of the homecoming fishing boats were the wan yellow of primroses behind us the hills were sharp pyrites blue from a window in the adobe hut at one side of us came a smell of sizzling olive oil and tomatoes and peppers and the muffled sound of eggs being beaten we were footsore hungry and we talked about women and love and after all it was marriage that counted he told me at last womens bodies and souls and the love of them were all very well but it was the ordered life of a family children that counted the family was the immortal chain on which lives were strung and he recited this quatrain saying in that proud awefilled tone with which latins speak of creative achievement by our greatest poet juan maragall canta esposa fila i canta que el patн em faras suau quan lesposa canta i fila el casal sadorm en pau it was hard explaining how all our desires lay towards the completer and completer affirming of the individual that we in anglosaxon countries felt that the family was dead as a social unit that new cohesions were in the making i want my liberty he broke in as much as as byron did liberty of thought and action he was silent a moment then he said simply but i want a wife and children and a family mine mine then the girl who was cooking leaned out of the window to tell us in soft mallorquin that supper was ready she had a full brown face flushed on the cheekbones and given triangular shape like an el greco madonnas face by the bright blue handkerchief knotted under the chin her breasts hung out from her body solid like a victorys under the sleek grey shawl as she leaned from the window in her eyes that were seagrey there was an unimaginable calm i thought of penelope sitting beside her loom in a smokyraftered hall grey eyes looking out on a sailless sea and for a moment i understood the catalans phrase the family was the chain on which lives were strung and all of maragalls lyricizing of wifehood when the wife sits singing as she spins all the house can sleep in peace from the fishermens huts down the beach came an intense blue smoke of fires above the soft rustle of the swell among the boats came the chatter of many sleepy voices like the sound of sparrows in a city park at dusk the day dissolved slowly in utter timelessness and when the last fishing boat came out of the dark sea the tall slanting sail folding suddenly as the wings of a seagull alighting the redbrown face of the man in the bow was the face of returning odysseus it was not the continuity of mens lives i felt but their oneness on that beach beside that sea there was no time when we were eating in the whitewashed room by the light of three brass olive oil lamps i found that my argument had suddenly crumbled what could i who had come out of ragged and barbarous outlands tell of the art of living to a man who had taught me both system and revolt so am i to whom the connubial lyrics of patmore and ella wheeler wilcox have always seemed inexpressible soiling of possible loveliness forced to bow before the rich cadences with which juan maragall catalan poet of the mediterranean celebrates the familia and in maragalls work it is always the mediterranean that one feels the mediterranean and the men who sailed on it in black ships with bright pointed sails just as in homer and euripides and pindar and theocritus and in that tantalizing kaleidoscope the anthology beyond the grammar and the footnotes and the desolation of german texts there is always the rhythm of sea waves and the smell of wellcaulked ships drawn up on dazzling beaches so in maragall beyond the graceful wellkept literary existence beyond wife and children and pompous demonstrations in the cause of abstract freedom there is the sea lashing the rocky shins of the pyrenees actual dangerous wet in this day when we americans are plundering the earth far and near for flowers and seeds and ferments of literature in the hope perhaps vain of fallowing our thin soil with manure rich and diverse and promiscuous so that the somewhat sickly plants of our own culture may burst sappy and green through the steel and cement and inhibitions of our lives we should not forget that northwest corner of the mediterranean where the langue doc is as terse and salty as it was in the days of pierre vidal whose rhythms of life intrinsically mediterranean are finding new permanence poetry richly ordered and lucid to the catalans of the last fifty years has fallen the heritage of the oar which the cunning sailor odysseus dedicated to the sea the earthshaker on his last voyage and the first of them is maragall xiii talk by the road on the top step telemachus found a man sitting with his head in his hands moaning ўay de mн over and over again i beg pardon he said stiffly trying to slip by did you see the function this evening sir asked the man looking up at telemachus with tears streaming from his eyes he had a yellow face with lean blue chin and jowls shaven close and a little waxed moustache that had lost all its swagger for the moment as he had the ends of it in his mouth what function in the theatre i am an artist an actor he got to his feet and tried to twirl his ragged moustaches back into shape then he stuck out his chest straightened his waistcoat so that the large watchchain clinked and invited telemachus to have a cup of coffee with him they sat at the black oak table in front of the fire the actor told how there had been only twelve people at his show how was he to be expected to make his living if only twelve people came to see him and the night before carnival too when they usually got such a crowd hed learned a new song especially for the occasion too good too artistic for these pigs of provincials here in spain the stage is ruined ruined he cried out finally how ruined asked telemachus the zarzuela is dead the days of the great writers of zarzuela have gone never to return o the music the lightness the jollity of the zarzuelas of my fathers time my father was a great singer a tenor whose voice was an enchantment i know the princely life of a great singer of zarzuela when a small boy i lived it and now look at me telemachus thought how strangely out of place was the actors anжmic wasplike figure in this huge kitchen where everything was dark strongsmelling massive black beams with here and there a trace of red daub on them held up the ceiling and bristled with square iron spikes from which hung hams and sausages and white strands of garlic the table at which they sat was an oak slab black from smoke and generations of spillings firmly straddled on thick trestles over the fire hung a copper pot sooty with a glitter of grease on it where the soup had boiled over when one leaned to put a bundle of sticks on the fire one could see up the chimney an oblong patch of blackness spangled with stars on the edge of the hearth was the great hunched figure of the padrуn half asleep a silk handkerchief round his head watching the coffeepot it was an elegant life full of voyages went on the actor south america naples sicily and all over spain there were formal dinners receptions ceremonial dress ladies of high society came to congratulate us i played all the child rфles when i was fourteen a duchess fell in love with me and now look at me ragged dying of hunger not even able to fill a theatre in this hog of a village in spain they have lost all love of the art all they want is foreign importations viennese musical comedies smutty farces from paris with cognac or rum the padrуn roared out suddenly in his deep voice swinging the coffee pot up out of the fire cognac said the actor what rotten coffee he gave little petulant sniffs as he poured sugar into his glass the wail of a baby rose up suddenly out of the dark end of the kitchen the actor took two handfuls of his hair and yanked at them ay my nerves he shrieked the baby wailed louder in spasm after spasm of yelling the actor jumped to his feet ўdolуres dolуres ven acб after he had called several times a girl came into the room padding softly on bare feet and stood before him tottering sleepily in the firelight her heavy lids hung over her eyes a strand of black hair curled round her full throat and spread raggedly over her breasts she had pulled a blanket over her shoulders but through a rent in her coarse nightgown the fire threw a patch of red glow curved like a rose petal about one brown thigh ўquй desvergonzaa how shameless muttered the padrуn the actor was scolding her in a shrill endless whine the girl stood still without answering her teeth clenched to keep them from chattering then she turned without a word and brought the baby from the packing box in which he lay at the end of the room and drawing the blanket about both her and the child crouched on her heels very close to the flame with her bare feet in the ashes when the crying had ceased she turned to the actor with a fulllipped smile and said theres nothing the matter with him paco hes not even hungry you woke him up the poor little angel talking so loud she got to her feet again and with slow unspeakable dignity walked back and forth across the end of the room with the child at her breast each time she turned she swung the trailing blanket round with a sudden twist of her body from the hips telemachus watched her furtively sniffing the hot aroma of coffee and cognac from his glass and whenever she turned the muscles of his body drew into tight knots from joy es buena chica shes a nice kid from malaga i picked her up there a little stupid but these days the actor was saying with much shrugging of the shoulders she dances well but the public doesnt like her no tiene cara de parisiana she hasnt the parisian air but these days vamos one cant be too fastidious this taste for french plays french women french cuisine its ruined the spanish theatre the fire flared crackling telemachus sat sipping his coffee waiting for the unbearable delight of the swing of the girls body as she turned to pace back towards him across the room xiv benaventes madrid all the gravel paths of the plaza santa ana were encumbered with wicker chairs at one corner seven blind musicians all in a row with violins a cello guitars and a mournful cornet toodled and wheezed and twiddled through the blue danube at another a crumpled old man with a monkey dressed in red silk drawers on his shoulder ground out la paloma from a hurdygurdy in the middle of the green plot a fountain sparkled in the yellow light that streamed horizontally from the cafйs fuming with tobacco smoke on two sides of the square and ragged guttersnipes dipped their legs in the slimy basin round about it splashing one another rolling like little colts in the grass from the cafйs and the wicker chairs and tables clink of glasses and dominoes patter of voices scuttle of waiters with laden trays shouts of men selling shrimps prawns fried potatoes watermelon nuts in little cornucopias of red green or yellow paper light gleamed on the buffcolored disk of a table in front of me on the rims of two beermugs in the eyes of a bearded man with an aquiline nose very slender at the bridge who leaned towards me talking in a deep even voice telling me in swift lisping castilian stories of madrid first of the madrid of felipe cuarto corridas in the plaza mayor auto da fй pictures by velasquez on view under the arcade where now there is a doughnut and coffee shop pompous coaches painted vermilion cobalt gilded stuffed with ladies in vast bulge of damask and brocade plumed cavaliers pert ogling pages lurching and swaying through the footdeep stinking mud of the streets plays of calderon and lope presented in gardens tinkling with jewels and swordchains where ladies of the court flirted behind ostrich fans with stiff leanfaced lovers then goyas madrid riots in the puerta del sol majas leaning from balconies the fair of san isidro by the river scuttling of ragged guerrilla bands brigands and patriots tramp of the stiffnecked grenadiers of napoleon pompous little men in shorttailed wigs dying the dos de mayo with phrases from mirabeau on their lips under the brick arch of the arsenal frantic carnivals of the burial of the sardine naked backs of flagellants dripping blood lovers hiding under the hoop skirts of the queen then the romantic madrid of the thirties larra becquer espronceda byronic gestures vigils in graveyards duels struttings among the boxalleys of the retiro pale young men in white stocks shooting themselves in attics along the calle mayor and now the voice became suddenly gruff with anger look at madrid they closed the cafй suizo they are building a subway the castellana looks more like the champs elysйes every day its only on the stage that you get any remnant of the real madrid benavente is the last madrileсo tiene el sentido de lo castizo he has the sense of the all the end of the evening went to the discussion of the meaning of the famous word castizo the very existence of such a word in a language argues an acute sense of style of the manner of doing things like all words of real import its meaning is a gamut a section of a spectrum rather than something fixed and irrevocable the first implication seems to be according to hoyle following tradition a neatly turned phrase an essentially castilian cadence is castizo a piece of pastry or a poem in the old tradition are castizo or a compliment daintily turned or a cloak of the proper fullness with the proper red velvetbordered lining gracefully flung about the ears outside of a cafй lo castizo is the essence of the local of the regional the last stronghold of castilian arrogance refers not to the empty shell of traditional observances but to the very core and gesture of them ultimately lo castizo means all that is salty savourous of the red and yellow hills and the bare plains and the deep arroyos and the dustcolored towns full of palaces and belfries and the beggars in snuffcolored cloaks and the muledrivers with blankets over their shoulders and the discursive leanfaced gentlemen grouped about tables at cafйs and casinos and the stout dowagers with mantillas over their gleaming black hair walking to church in the morning with missals clasped in fat hands all that is acutely indigenous iberian in the life of castile in the flood of industrialism that for the last twenty years has swelled to obliterate landmarks to bring all the world to the same level of nickelplated dullness the theatre in madrid has been the refuge of lo castizo it has been a theatre of manners and local types and customs of observation and natural history where a rather specialized welltrained audience accustomed to satire as the tone of daily conversation was tickled by any portrayal of its quips and cranks a tradition of characteracting grew up nearer that of the yiddish theatre than of any other stage we know in america benavente and the brothers quintero have been the playwrights who most typified the school that has been in vogue since the going out of the drame passionel style of echegaray at present benavente as director of the teatro nacional is unquestionably the leading figure therefore it is very fitting that benavente should be in life and works of all madrileсos the most castizo later as we sat drinking milk in la granja after a couple of hours of a shabby thirdgeneration viennese musical show at the apollo my friend discoursed to me of the manner of life of the madrileсo in general and of don jacinto benavente in particular round eleven or twelve one got up took a cup of thick chocolate strolled on the castellana under the chestnut trees or looked in at ones office in the theatre at two one lunched at three or so one sat a while drinking coffee or anis in the gato negro where the waiters have the air of cabinet ministers and listen to every word of the rather languid discussions on art and letters that while away the afternoon hours then as it got towards five one drifted to a matinee if there chanced to be a new play opening or to tea somewhere out in the new frenchified barrio de salamanca dinner came along round nine from there one went straight to the theatre to see that all went well with the evening performance at one the day culminated in a famous tertulia at the cafй de lisboa where all the world met and argued and quarreled and listened to disquisitions and epigrams at tables stacked with coffee glasses amid spiral reek of cigarette smoke but when were the plays written i asked my friend laughed oh between semicolons he said and en route and in bed and while being shaved here in madrid you write a comedy between biscuits at breakfast and now that the metros open its a great help i know a young poet who tossed off a fiveact tragedy sexpsychology and all between the puerta del sol and cuatro caminos but madrids being spoiled he went on sadly at least from the point of view of lo castizo in the last generation all one saw of daylight were sunset and dawn people used to go out to fight duels where the residencia de estudiantes is now and they had real tertulias tertulias where conversation swaggered and parried and lunged sparing nothing laughing at everything for all the world like our unique spanish hero don juan tenorio yo a las cabaсas baje yo a los palacios subн y los claustros escalй y en todas partes dejй memorias amargas de mн talk ranged from peasant huts to the palaces of carlist duchesses and god knows the crows and the cloisters werent let off scot free and like good old absurd tenorio they didnt care if laughter did leave bitter memories and were willing to wait till their deathbeds to reconcile themselves with heaven and solemnity but our generation they all went solemn in their cradles except for the theatre people always except for the theatre people we of the theatres will be castizo to the death as we left the cafй i to go home to bed my friend to go on to another tertulia he stood for a moment looking back among the tables and glasses what the agora was to the athenians he said and finished the sentence with an expressive wave of the hand its hard for anglosaxons antesocial as suspicious of neighbors as if they still lived in the boggy forests of finland citydwellers for a paltry thirty generations to understand the publicity the communal quality of life in the region of the mediterranean the first thought when one gets up is to go out of doors to see what people are talking of the last thing before going to bed is to chat with the neighbors about the events of the day the home cloistered off exclusive can hardly be said to exist instead of the nordic hearth there is the courtyard about which the women sit while the men are away at the marketplace in spain this social life centers in the cafй and the casino the modern theatre is as directly the offshoot of the cafй as the old theatre was of the marketplace where people gathered in front of the church porch to see an interlude or mystery acted by travelling players in a wagon the people who write the plays the people who act them and the people who see them spend their spare time smoking about marbletop tables drinking coffee discussing those too poor to buy a drink stand outside in groups the sunny side of squares constant talk about everything that may happen or had happened or will happen manages to butter the bread of life pretty evenly with passion and thought and significance but one loses the chunks of intensity there is little chance for the burst dams that suddenly flood the dry watercourse of emotion among more inhibited less civilized people generations upon generations of townsmen have made of life a welldredged canal easyflowing somewhat shallow it follows that the theatre under such conditions shall be talkative witty full of neat swift caricaturing improvised unselfconscious at its worst glib boisterous action often passionate strain almost never in echegaray there are hecatombs half the characters habitually go insane in the last act tremendous barking but no bite of real intensity benavente has recaptured some of lope de vegas marvellous quality of adventurous progression the quinteros write domestic comedies full of whim and sparkle and tenderness but expression always seems too easy there is never the unbearable tension the utter selfforgetfulness of the greatest drama the spanish theatre plays on the nerves and intellect rather than on the great harpstrings of emotion in which all of life is drawn taut at present in madrid even cafй life is receding before the exigencies of business and the hardly excusable mania for imitating english and american manners spain is undergoing great changes in its relation to the rest of europe to latin america in its own internal structure notwithstanding madrids wartime growth and prosperity the city is fast losing ground as the nucleus of the life and thought of spanishspeaking people the madrileсo lean cynical unscrupulous nocturnal explosive with a curious sort of febrile wit is becoming extinct his theatre is beginning to pander to foreign tastes to be ashamed of itself to take on respectability and stodginess prices of seats up to very low rise continually the artisans apprentice boys loafers clerks porters who formed the backbone of the audiences can no longer afford the theatre and have taken to the movies instead managers spend money on scenery and costumes as a way of attracting fashionables it has become quite proper for women to go to the theatre benaventes plays thus acquire double significance as the summing up and the chief expression of a movement that has reached its heyday from which the sap has already been cut off it is indeed the thing to disparage them for their very finest quality the vividness with which they express the texture of madrid the animated humorous mordant conversation about cafй tables lo castizo the first play of his i ever saw gente conocida impressed me i remember at a time when i understood about one word in ten and had to content myself with following the general modulation of things as carrying on to the stage the moment the curtain rose the very people intonations phrases that were stirring in the seats about me after the first act a broadbosomed lady in black silk leaned back in the seat beside me sighing comfortably quй castizo es este benavente and then went into a volley of approving chirpings the full import of her enthusiasm did not come to me until much later when i read the play in the comparative light of a surer knowledge of castilian and found that it was a most vitriolic dissecting of the manner of life of that very dowagers own circle a showing up of the predatory spite of people of consequence here was this society woman who in any other country would have been indignant enjoying the annihilation of her kind on such willingness to play the game of wit even of abuse without too much rancor which is the unction to ease of social intercourse is founded all the popularity of benaventes writing somewhere in hugos spanish grammar god save the mark is a proverb to the effect that the wind of madrid is so subtle that it will kill a man without putting out a candle the same at their best can be said of benaventes satiric comedies el viento de madrid es tan sutil que mata a un hombre y no apaga un candil from the opposite bank of the manzanares a slimy shrunken stream usually that flows almost hidden under clothes lines where billow the undergarments of all madrid in certain lights you can recapture almost entire the silhouette of the city as goya has drawn it again and again clots of peeling stucco houses huddling up a flattened hill towards the dome of san francisco el grande then an undulating skyline with cupolas and baroque belfries jutting among the sudden lights and darks of the clouds then perhaps the sun will light up with a spreading shaft of light the electriclight factory the sign on a biscuit manufacturers warehouse a row of white blocks of apartments along the edge of town to the north and instead of odd grimy aboriginal madrid it will be a type city in europe in the industrial era that shines in the sun beyond the blue shadows and creamy flashes of the clothes on the lines so will it be in a few years with modernized madrid with the life of cafйs and paseos and theatres there will be moments when in american automats elegant smokeless tearooms shiny restaurants built in copy of those of buenos aires someone who has read his benavente will be able to catch momentary glimpses of old intonations of witty parries of noisy bombastic harangues and feel for one pentecostal moment the full and by that time forgotten import of lo castizo xv talk by the road the sun next morning was tingling warm telemachus strode along with a taste of a milky bowl of coffee and crisp churros in his mouth and a fresh wind in his hair his feet rasped pleasantly on the gravel of the road behind him the town sank into the dun emeraldstriped plain roofs clustering huddling more and more under the shadow of the beetling church and the tower becoming leaner and darker against the steamy clouds that oozed in billowing tiers over the mountains to the north crows flapped about the fields where here and there the dark figures of a man and a pair of mules moved up a long slope on the telegraph wires at a bend in the road two magpies sat the sunlight glinting when they stirred on the white patches on their wings telemachus felt wellrested and content with himself after all mother knows best he was thinking that foolish lyaeus will come dragging himself into toledo a week from now before noon he came on the same don alonso he had seen the day before in illescas don alonso was stretched out under an olive tree a long red sausage in his hand a loaf of bread and a small leather bottle of wine on the sward in front of him hitched to the tree at the bark of which he nibbled with long teeth was the grey horse hola my friend cried don alonso still bent on toledo how soon can i get there soon enough to see the castle of san servando against the sunset we will go together you travel as fast as my old nag but do me the honor of eating something you must be hungry thereupon don alonso handed telemachus the sausage and a knife to peel and slice it with how early you must have started they sat together munching bread and sausage to which the sweet pepper mashed into it gave a bright red color and occasionally head thrown back let a little wine squirt into their mouths from the bottle don alonso waved discursively a bit of sausage held between bread by tips of long grey fingers you are now my friend in the heart of castile look nothing but liveoaks along the gulches and wheatlands rolling up under a tremendous sky have you ever seen more sky in madrid there is not so much sky is there in your country there is not so much sky look at the huge volutes of those clouds this is a setting for thoughts as mighty in contour as the white cumulus over the sierra such as come into the minds of men lean windtanned longstriding don alonso put a finger to his high yellow forehead there is in castile a potential beauty my friend something humane tolerant vivid robust i dont say it is in me my only merit lies in recognizing it formulating it for i am no more than a thinker but the day will come when in this gruff land we shall have flower and fruit don alonso was smiling with thin lips head thrown back against the twisted trunk of the olive tree then all at once he got to his feet and after rummaging a moment in the little knapsack that hung over his shoulder produced absentmindedly a handful of small white candies the shape of millstones which he stared at in a puzzled way for some seconds after all he went on they make famous sweets in these old castilian towns these are melindres have one when people dyou know are kind to children there are things to be expected certainly children are indulgently treated in spain said telemachus his mouth full of almond paste they actually seem to like children a cart drawn by four mules tandem led by a very minute donkey with three strings of blue beads round his neck was jingling past along the road as the canvas curtains of the cover were closed the only evidence of the driver was a sleepy song in monotone that trailed with the dust cloud after the cart while they stood by the roadside watching the joggle of it away from them down the road a flushed face was poked out from between the curtains and a voice cried hello tel its lyaeus cried telemachus and ran after the cart bubbling with curiosity to hear his companions adventures with a angle of mulebells and a hoarse shout from the driver the cart stopped and lyaeus tumbled out his hair was mussed and there were wisps of hay on his clothes he immediately stuck his head back in through the curtains by the time telemachus reached him the cart was tinkling its way down the road again and lyaeus stood grinning blinking sleepy eyes in the middle of the road in one hand a skin of wine in the other a canvas bag what ho cried telemachus figs and wine said lyaeus then as don alonso came up leading his grey horse he added in an explanatory tone i was asleep in the cart well said telemachus o its such a long story said lyaeus walking beside them don alonso was reciting into his horses ear sigue la vana sombra el bien fingido el hombre estб entregado al sueсo de su suerte no cuidando y con paso callado el cielo vueltas dando las horas del vivir le va hurtando whose is that said lyaeus the revolving sky goes stealing his hours of life but i dont know said don alonso perhaps like you this spain of ours makes ground sleeping as well as awake what does a day matter the driver snores but the good mules jog on down the appointed road then without another word he jumped on his horse and with a smile and a wave of the hand trotted off ahead of them xvi a funeral in madrid doce dнas son pasados despuйs que el cid acabбra aderйzanse las gentes para salir a batalla con bъcar ese rey moro y contra la su canalla cuando fuera media noche el cuerpo asн coma estaba le ponen sobre babieca y al caballo lo ataban i and when the army sailed out of valencia the moors of king bucar fled before the dead body of the cid and ten thousand of them were drowned trying to scramble into their ships among them twenty kings and the christians got so much booty of gold and silver among the tents that the poorest of them became a rich man then the army continued the dead cid riding each days journey on his horse across the dry mountains to sant pedro de cardeсa in castile where the king don alfonso had come from toledo and he seeing the cids face still so beautiful and his beard so long and his eyes so flaming ordered that instead of closing the body in a coffin with gold nails they should set it upright in a chair beside the altar with the sword tizona in its hand and there the cid stayed more than ten years mandу que no se enterrase sino que el cuerpo arreado se ponga junto al altar y a tizona en la su mano asн estuvo mucho tiempo que fueron mбs de diez aсos in the pass above people were skiing on the hard snow of the road there were orangeskins a victoria had just driven by in which sat a bored inflated couple much swathed in furs where on earth are they going to the puerta de navecerrada my friend answered but they look as if theyd be happier having tea at molineros than paddling about up there in the snow they would be but its the style winter sports and all because a lithe little brown man who died two years ago liked the mountains before him no madrileсo ever knew the sierra existed who was that don francisco giner that afternoon when it was already getting dark we were scrambling wet chilled our faces lashed by the snow down through drifts from a shoulder of siete picos with the mist all about us and nothing but the track of a flock of sheep for a guide the light from a hut pushed a long gleaming orange finger up the mountainside once inside we pulled off our shoes and stockings and toasted our feet at a great fireplace round which were flushed faces glint of teeth in laughter schoolboys and people from the university shouting and declaiming a smell of tea and wet woolens everybody was noisy with the rather hysterical excitement that warmth brings after exertion in cold mountain air cheeks were purple and tingling a young man with fuzzy yellow hair told me a story in french about the emperor of morocco and produced a tin of potted blackbirds which it came out were from the said personages private stores unending fountains of tea seethed in two smokeblackened pots on the hearth in the back of the hut among leaping shadows were piles of skis and the door which occasionally opened to let in a new wet snowy figure and shut again on skimming snowgusts everyone was rocked with enormous jollity train time came suddenly and we ran and stumbled and slid the miles to the station through the dark down the rocky path in the thirdclass carriage people sang songs as the train jounced its way towards the plain and madrid the man who sat next to me asked me if i knew it was don francisco who had had that hut built for the children of the instituciуn libre de inseсanza little by little he told me the history of the krausistas and francisco giner de los rнos and the revolution of a story like enough to many others in the annals of the nineteenth century movement for education but in its overtones so intimately spanish and individual that it came as the explanation of many things i had been wondering about and gave me an inkling of some of the origins of a rather special mentality i had noticed in people i knew about madrid somewhere in the forties a professor of the universidad central sanz del rнo was sent to germany to study philosophy on a government scholarship spain was still in the intellectual coma that had followed the failure of the cortes of cadiz and the restoration of fernando septimo a decade or more before larra the last flame of romantic revolt had shot himself for love in madrid in germany at heidelberg sanz del rнo found dying krause the first archpriest who stood interpreting between kant and the world when he returned to spain he refused to take up his chair at the university saying he must have time to think out his problems and retired to a tiny room a room so dark that they say that to read he had to sit on a stepladder under the window in the town of illescas where was another student grecos san ildefonso there he lived several years in seclusion when he did return to the university it was to refuse to make the profession of political and religious faith required by a certain prime minister named orovio he was dismissed and several of his disciples at the same time francisco giner de los rнos then a young man who had just gained an appointment with great difficulty because of his liberal ideas resigned out of solidarity with the rest in came the liberal revolution which was the political expression of this whole movement and all these professors were reinstated until the restoration of the bourbons in spain was a hive of modernization europeanization returned to power orovio lost no time in republishing his decrees of a profession of faith giner ascбrate salmerуn and several others were arrested and exiled to distant fortresses when they protested their friends declared themselves in sympathy and lost their jobs and many other professors resigned so that the university was at one blow denuded of its best men from this came the idea of founding a free university which should be supported entirely by private subscription from that moment the life of giner de los rнos was completely entwined with the growth of the instituciуn libre de inseсanza which developed in the course of a few years into a coeducational primary school and directly or indirectly there is not a single outstanding figure in spanish life today whose development was not largely influenced by this dark slender baldheaded old man with a white beard whose picture one finds on peoples writing desks oh sн llevad amigos su cuerpo a la montaсa a los azules montes del ancho guadarrama wrote his pupil antonio machado and i rather think machado is the pupil whose name will live the longest after don franciscos death in yes carry friends his body to the hills to the blue peaks of the wide guadarrama there are deep gulches of green pines where the wind sings there is rest for his spirit under a cold live oak in loam full of thyme where play golden butterflies there the master one day dreamed new flowerings for spain these are fragments from an elegy by juan ramon jimйnez another poetpupil of don francisco don francisco it seemed that he summed up all that is tender and keen in life flowers flames birds peaks children now stretched on his bed like a frozen river that perhaps still flows under the ice he is the clear path for endless recurrence he was like a living statue of himself a statue of earth of wind of water of fire he had so freed himself from the husk of every day that talking to him we might have thought we were talking to his image yes one would have said he wasnt going to die that he had already passed without anybodys knowing it beyond death that he was with us forever like a spirit in the little door of the bedroom one already feels wellbeing a trail of the smell of thyme and violets that comes and goes with the breeze from the open window leads like a delicate hand towards where he lies peace all death has done has been to infuse the color of his skin with a deep violet veiling of ashes what a suave smell and how excellent death is here no rasping essences none of the exterior of blackness and crкpe all this is white and uncluttered like a hut in the fields in andalusia like the whitewashed portal of some garden in the south all just as it was only he who was there has gone the day is fading with a little wind that has a premonition of spring in the window panes is a confused mirroring of rosy clouds the blackbird the blackbird that he must have heard for thirty years that hed have liked to have gone on hearing dead has come to see if hes listening peace the bedroom and the garden strive quietly light against light the brightness of the bedroom is stronger and glows out into the afternoon a sparrow flutters up into the sudden stain with which the sun splashes the top of a tree and sits there twittering in the shadow below the blackbird whistles once more now and then one seems to hear the voice that is silenced forever how pleasant to be here its like sitting beside a spring reading under a tree like letting the stream of a lyric river carry one away and one feels like never moving like plucking to infinity as one might tear roses to pieces these white full hours like clinging forever to this clear teacher in the eternal twilight of this last lesson of austerity and beauty municipal cemetery it says on the gate so that one may know opposite that other sign catholic cemetery so that one may also know he didnt want to be buried in that cemetery so opposed to the smiling savourous poetry of his spirit but it had to be hell still hear the blackbirds of the familiar garden after all says cossio i dont think hell be sorry to spend a little while with don juliбn careful hands have taken the dampness out of the earth with thyme on the coffin they have thrown roses narcissus violets there comes lost an aroma of last evening a bit of the bedroom from which they took so much away silence faint sunlight great piles of cloud full of wind drag frozen shadows across us and through them flying low black grackles in the distance guadarrama chaste beyond belief lifts crystals of cubed white light some tiny bird trills for a second in the sown fields nearby that are already vaguely greenish then lights on the creamy top of a tomb then flies away neither impatience nor cares slowness and forgetfulness silence in the silence the voice of a child walking through the fields the sound of a sob hidden among the tombstones the wind the broad wind of these days ive seen occasionally a fire put out with earth innumerable little tongues spurted from every side a pupil of his who was a mason made for this extinguished fire its palace of mud on a piece of earth two friends kept free he has at the head a euonymus young and strong and at the foot already full of sprouts with coming spring an acacia round el pardo the evergreen oaks encinas are scattered sparsely tight round heads of blue green over hills that in summer are yellow like the haunches of lions from madrid to el pardo was one of don franciscos favorite walks out past the jail where over the gate is written an echo of his teaching abhor the crime but pity the criminal past the palace of moncloa with its stately abandoned gardens and out along the manzanares by a road through the royal domain where are gamekeepers with shotguns and signs of beware the mantraps then up a low hill from which one sees the sierra guadarrama piled up against the sky to the north greenish snowpeaks above long blue foothills and all the foreground rolling land full of clumps of encinas and at last into the little village with its barracks and its dilapidated convent and its planetrees in front of the mansion charles v built it was under an encina that i sat all one long morning reading up in reviews and textbooks on the theory of law the life and opinions of don francisco in the moments when the sun shone the heat made the sticky cistus bushes with the glistening white flowers all about me reek with pungence then a cool whisp of wind would bring a chill of snowslopes from the mountains and a passionless indefinite fragrance of distances at intervals a church bell would toll in a peevish importunate manner from the boxlike convent on the hill opposite i was reading an account of the philosophical concept of monism cudgelling my brain with phrases and his fervent love of nature made the master evoke occasionally in class this beautiful image of the great poet and philosopher schelling man is the eye with which the spirit of nature contemplates itself and then having qualified with a phrase schellings expression he would turn on those who see in nature manifestation of the rough the gross the instinctive and offer for meditation this saying of michelet cloth woven by a weaver is just as natural as that a spider weaves all is in one being all is in the idea and for the idea the latter being understood in the way platonic substantialism has been interpreted in the grass under my book were bright fronds of moss among which very small red ants performed prodigies of mountaineering while along tramped tunnels long black ants scuttled darkly glinting when the light struck them the smell of cistus was intense hot full of spices as the narrow streets of an oriental town at night in the distance the mountains piled up in zones olive green prussian blue ultramarine white a cold windgust turned the pages of the book thought and passion reflection and instinct affections emotions impulses collaborate in the rule of custom which is revealed not in words declared and promulgated in view of future conduct but in the act itself tacit taken for granted or according to the energetic expression of the digest rebus et factis over factis sat a little green and purple fly with the body curved under at the table i wondered vaguely if it was a mayfly and then all of a sudden it was clear to me that these books these dusty philosophical phrases these mortuary articles by official personages were dimming the legend in my mind taking the brilliance out of the indirect but extraordinarily personal impact of the man himself they embalmed the cid and set him up in the church with his sword in his hand for all men to see what sort of legend would a technical disquisition by the archbishop on his theory of the angle of machicolations have generated in mens minds and what can a saint or a soldier or a founder of institutions leave behind him but a legend certainly it is not for the franciscans that one remembers francis of assisi and the curious thing about the legend of a personality is that it may reach the highest fervor without being formulated it is something by itself that stands behind anecdotes deathnotices elegies in madrid at the funeral of another of the great figures of nineteenth century spain pйrez galdуs i stood on the curb beside a largemouthed youth with a flattened toadlike face who was balancing a great whitemetal jar of milk on his shoulder the plumed hearse and the carriages full of flowers had just passed the street in front of us was a slow stream of people very silent their feet shuffling shuffling feet in patentleather shoes and spats feet in squaretoed shoes pointedtoed shoes alpargatas canvas sandals people along the sides seemed unable to resist the suction of it joined in unostentatiously to follow if only a few moments the procession of the legend of don benito the boy with the milk turned to me and said how lucky it was they were burying galdуs hed have an excuse for being late for the milk then suddenly he pulled his cap off and became enormously excited and began offering cigarettes to everyone round about he scratched his head and said in the voice of a saul stricken on the road to damascus how many books he must have written that gentleman ўcбspita it makes a fellow sorry when a gentleman like that dies and shouldering his pail his blue tunic fluttering in the wind he joined the procession like the milk boy i found myself joining the procession of the legend of giner de los rнos that morning under the encina i closed up the volumes on the theory of law and the bulletins with their deathnotices and got to my feet and looked over the tawny hills of el bardo and thought of the little lithe baldheaded man with a white beard like the beard in el grecos portrait of covarrubias who had taught a generation to love the tremendous contours of their country to climb mountains and bathe in cold torrents who was the first it almost seems to feel the tragic beauty of toledo who in a lifetime of courageous unobtrusive work managed to stamp all the men and women whose lives remotely touched his with the seal of his personality born in ronda in the wildest part of andalusia of a family that came from vйlezmбlaga a white town near the sea in the rich fringes of the sierra nevada he had the mental agility and the sceptical tolerance and the uproarious good nature of the people of that region the sobriety and sinewiness of a mountaineer his puritanism became a definite part of the creed of the hopeful discontented generations that are gradually for better or for worse remoulding spain his nostalgia of the north of fjords where fir trees hang over black tidal waters of blonde people cheerfully orderly in rectangular bluetiled towns became the gospel of europeanization of wholesale destruction of all that was individual savage african in the spanish tradition rebus et factis and yet none of the things and acts do much to explain the peculiar radiance of his memory the jovial tenderness with which people tell one about him the immanence of the man is such that even an outsider one who like the milk boy at the funeral of galdуs meets the procession accidentally with another errand in his head is drawn in almost without knowing it its impossible to think of him buried in a box in unconsecrated ground in the cementerio civil in madrid in the little garden of the instituciуn where he used to teach the children in front of a certain open fire in a certain house at el pardo where they say he loved to sit and talk i used to half expect to meet him that some friend would take me to see him as they took people to see cid in san pedro de cardeсa cara tiene de hermosura muy hermosa y colorada los ojos igual abiertos muy apuesta la su barba non parece que estб muerto antes vivo semejaba ii although miguel de unamuno was recently condemned to fifteen years imprisonment for lиse majestй for some remark made in an article published in a valencia paper no attempt has been made either to make him serve the term or to remove him from the chair of greek at the university of salamanca which proves something about the efficiency of the stand giner de los rнos and his friends made fifty years before furthermore at the time of the revolutionary attempt of august the removal of bestiero from his chair caused so many of the faculty to resign and such universal protest that he was reinstated although an actual member of the revolutionary committee and at that time under sentence for life in after the fall of the republic it had been in the face of universal popular reaction that the krausistas founded their free university the lump is leavened but unamuno a basque from the country of loyola living in salamanca in the highest coldest part of the plateau of old castile in many senses the opposite of giner de los rнos who was austere as a man on a long pleasant walk doesnt overeat or overdrink so that the walk may be longer and pleasanter while unamuno is austere religiously mystically giner de los rнos was the champion of life unamuno is the champion of death here is his creed one of his creeds from the preface of the vida de don quijote y sancho there is no future there is never a future this thing they call the future is one of the greatest lies today is the real future what will we be tomorrow there is no tomorrow what about us today now that is the only question and as for today all these nincompoops are thoroughly satisfied because they exist today mere existence is enough for them existence ordinary naked existence fills their whole soul they feel nothing beyond existence but do they exist really exist i think not because if they did exist if they really existed existence would be suffering for them and they wouldnt content themselves with it if they really and truly existed in time and space they would suffer not being of eternity and infinity and this suffering this passion what is it but the passion of god in us god who suffers in us from our temporariness and finitude that divine suffering will burst all the puny bonds of logic with which they try to tie down their puny memories and their puny hopes the illusion of their past and the illusion of their future your quixotic madness has made you more than once speak to me of quixotism as the new religion and i tell you that this new religion you propose to me if it hatched would have two singular merits one that its founder its prophet don quixote not cervantes probably wasnt a real man of flesh and blood at all indeed we suspect that he was pure fiction and the other merit would be that this prophet was a ridiculous prophet peoples butt and laughing stock what we need most is the valor to face ridicule ridicule is the arm of all the miserable barbers bachelors parish priests canons and dukes who keep hidden the sepulchre of the knight of madness knight who made all the world laugh but never cracked a joke he had too great a soul to bring forth jokes they laughed at his seriousness begin then friend to do the peter the hermit and call people to join you to join us and let us all go win back the sepulchre even if we dont know where it is the crusade itself will reveal to us the sacred place start marching where are you going the star will tell you to the sepulchre what shall we do on the road while we march what fight fight and how how if you find a man lying shout in his face lie and forward if you find a man stealing shout thief and forward if you find a man babbling asininities to whom the crowd listens openmouthed shout at them all idiots and forward always forward to the march then and throw out of the sacred squadron all those who begin to study the step and its length and its rhythm above everything throw out all those who fuss about this business of rhythm theyll turn the squadron into a quadrille and the march into a dance away with them let them go off somewhere else to sing the flesh those who try to turn the squadron on the march into a dancing quadrille call themselves and each other poets but theyre not theyre something else they only go to the sepulchre out of curiosity to see what its like looking for a new sensation and to amuse themselves along the road away with them its these that with their indulgence of bohemians contribute to maintain cowardice and lies and all the weaknesses that flood us when they preach liberty they only think of one that of disposing of their neighbors wife all is sensuality with them they even fall in love sensually with ideas with great ideas they are incapable of marrying a great and pure idea and breeding a family with it they only flirt with ideas they want them as mistresses sometimes just for the night away with them if a man wants to pluck some flower or other along the path that smiles from the fringe of grass let him pluck it but without breaking ranks without dropping out of the squadron of which the leader must always keep his eyes on the flaming sonorous star but if he put the little flower in the strap above his cuirass not to look at it himself but for others to look at away with him let him go with his flower in his buttonhole and dance somewhere else look friend if you want to accomplish your mission and serve your country you must make yourself unpleasant to the sensitive boys who only see the world through the eyes of their sweethearts or through something worse let your words be strident and rasping in their ears the squadron must only stop at night near a wood or under the lee of a mountain there they will pitch their tents and the crusaders will wash their feet and sup off what their women have prepared then they will beget a son on them and kiss them and go to sleep to begin the march again the following day and when someone dies they will leave him on the edge of the road with his armor on him at the mercy of the crows let the dead take the trouble to bury the dead instead of the rationalists and humanists of the north unamunos idols are the mystics and saints and sensualists of castile hard stalwart men who walked with god loyola torquemada pizarro narvбez who governed with whips and thumbscrews and drank death down greedily like heady wine he is excited by the amorous madness of the mysticism of santa teresa and san juan de la cruz his religion is paradoxical unreasonable of faith alone full of furious yearning otherworldliness his style it follows perforce is headlong gruff redundant full of tremendous pounding phrases there is a vigorous angry insistence about his dogmas that makes his essays unforgettable even if one objects as violently as i do to his asceticism and deathworship there is an anarchic fury about his crying in the wilderness that will win many a man from the fleshpots and chain gangs in the apse of the old cathedral of salamanca is a fresco of the last judgment perhaps by the castilian painter gallegos over the retablo on a black ground a tremendous figure of the avenging angel brandishes a sword while behind him unrolls the scroll of the dies irae and huddled clusters of plump little naked people fall away into space from under his feet there are moments in del sentimiento trбgico de la vida and in the vida de don quijote y sancho when in the rolling earthy castilian phrases one can feel the brandishing of the sword of that very angel not for nothing does unamuno live in the rust and saffroncolored town of salamanca in the midst of bare red hills that bulge against an enormous flat sky in which the clouds look like piles of granite like floating cathedrals they are so solid heavy ominous a country where barrenness and the sweep of cold wind and the lash of strong wine have made peoples minds ingrow into the hereafter where the clouds have been tramped by the angry feet of the destroying angel a patmos for a new apocalypse unamuno is constantly attacking sturdily those who clamor for the modernization europeanization of spanish life and spanish thought he is the counterpoise to the northwardyearning apostles of giner de los rнos in an essay in one of the volumes published by the residencia de estudiantes he wrote as can be seen i proceed by what they call arbitrary affirmations without documentation without proof outside of a modern european logic disdainful of its methods perhaps i want no other method than that of passion and when my breast swells with disgust repugnance sympathy or disdain i let the mouth speak the bitterness of the heart and let the words come as they come we spaniards are they say arbitrary charlatans who fill up with rhetoric the gaps in logic who subtilize with more or less ingenuity but uselessly who lack the sense of coherence with scholastic souls casuists and all that ive heard similar things said of augustine the great african soul of fire that spilt itself in leaping waves of rhetoric twistings of the phrase antithesis paradoxes and ingenuities saint augustine was a gongorine and a conceptualist at the same time which makes me think that gongorism and conceptualism are the most natural forms of passion and vehemence the great african the great ancient african here is an expression ancient african that one can oppose to modern european and thats worth as much at least african and ancient were saint augustine and tertullian and why shouldnt we say we must make ourselves ancient africanstyle or else we must make ourselves african ancientstyle the typical tree of castile is the encina a kind of liveoak that grows low with dense bluish foliage and a ribbed knotted and contorted trunk it always grows singly and on dry hills on the roads one meets lean men with knotted hands and brown sunwizened faces that seem brothers to the encinas of their country the thought of unamuno emphatic lonely contorted hammered into homely violent phrases oaktough oaktwisted is brother to the men on the roads and to the encinas on the hills of castile this from the end of del sentimiento trбgico de la vida and in this critical century don quixote has also contaminated himself with criticism and he must charge against himself victim of intellectualism and sentimentalism who when he is most sincere appears most affected the poor man wants to rationalize the irrational and irrationalize the rational and he falls victim of the inevitable despair of a rationalism century of which the greatest victims were tolstoy and nietzsche out of despair he enters into the heroic fury of that quixote of thought who broke out of the cloister giordano bruno and makes himself awakener of sleeping souls dormitantium animorum excubitor as the exdominican says of himself he who wrote heroic love is proper to superior natures called insane insane not because they do not know non sanno but because they know too much soprasanno but bruno believed in the triumph of his doctrines or at least at the foot of his statue on the campo dei fiori opposite the vatican they have put that it is offered by the century he had divined il secolo da lui divinato but our don quixote the resurrected internal don quixote does not believe that his doctrines will triumph in the world because they are not his and it is better that they should not triumph if they wanted to make don quixote king he would retire alone to the hilltop fleeing the crowds of kingmakers and kingkillers as did christ when after the miracle of the loaves and fishes they wanted to proclaim him king he left the title of king to be put above the cross what is then the new mission of don quixote in this world to cry to cry in the wilderness for the wilderness hears although men do not hear and one day will turn into a sonorous wood and that solitary voice that spreads in the desert like seed will sprout into a gigantic cedar that will sing with a hundred thousand tongues an eternal hosanna to the lord of life and death xvii toledo lyaeus youve found it her you mean no the essence the gesture i carry no butterfly net the sun blazed in a halo of heat about their heads both sides of the straight road olive trees contorted gouty trunks as they walked past on a bank beside a quietly grazing donkey a man was asleep wrapped in a brown blanket occasionally a little grey bird twittered encouragingly from the telegraph wires when the wind came there was a chill of winter and wisps of cloud drifted across the sun and a shiver of silver ran along the olive groves tel cried lyaeus after a pause maybe i have found it maybe you are right you should have been with me last night what happened last night as a wave of bitter envy swept over him telemachus saw for a moment the face of his mother penelope brows contracted with warning white hand raised in admonition for a fleeting second the memory of his quest brushed through the back of his mind but lyaeus was talking nothing much happened there were a few things o this is wonderful he waved a clenched fist about his head the finest people tel you never saw such people tel they gave me a tambourine here it is wait a minute he placed the bag he carried on his shoulder on top of a milestone and untied its mouth when he pulled the tambourine out it was full of figs look pocket these i taught her to write her name on the back see pilar she didnt know how to write telemachus involuntarily cleared his throat it was the finest dive part house part cave we all roared in and there was the funniest little girl lot of other people fat women but my eyes were in a highly selective state she was very skinny with enormous black eyes does eyes timid as a dogs she had a fat pink puppy in her lap but i meant something in line movement eternal not that there are very few gestures said lyaeus they walked along in silence i am tired said lyaeus at least lets stop in here i see a bush over the door why stop we are nearly there why go on we want to get to toledo dont we why because we started for there no reason at all said lyaeus with a laugh as he went in the door of the wineshop when they came out they found don alonso waiting for them holding his horse by the bridle the spartans he said with a smile never drank wine on the march how far are we from toledo asked telemachus it was nice of you to wait for us about a league five kilometers nothing i wanted to see your faces when you first saw the town i think you will appreciate it lets walk fast said telemachus there are some things one doesnt want to wait for it will be sunset and the whole town will be on the paseo in front of the hospital of san juan bautista this is sunday of carnival people will be dressed up in masks and very noisy its a day on which they play tricks on strangers heres the trick they played me at the last town said lyaeus agitating his bag of figs lets eat some im sure the spartans ate figs on the road will rosinante i mean will your horse eat them he put his hand with some figs on it under the horses mouth the horse sniffed noisily out of black nostrils dappled with pink and then reached for the figs lyaeus wiped his hand on the seat of his pants and they proceeded toledo is symbolically the soul of spain began don alonso after a few moments of silent walking by that i mean that through the many spains you have seen and will see is everywhere an undercurrent of fantastic tragedy greco on the one hand goya on the other morбles gallegos a great flame of despair amid dust rags ulcers human life rising in a sudden pжan out of desolate abandoned duncolored spaces to me toledo expresses the supreme beauty of that tragic farce and the apex the victory the deathlessness of it is in el greco how strange it is that it should be that cypriote who lived in such venetian state in a great house near the abandoned synagogue scandalizing us austere spaniards by the sounds of revelry and unabashed music that came from it at mealtimes making pert sayings under the nose of humorless visitors like pacheco living solitary in a country where he remained to his death misunderstood and alien and where two centuries thought of him along with don quixote as a madman how strange that it should be he who should express most flamingly all that was imperturbable in toledo i have often wondered whether that fiery vitality of spirit that we feel in el greco that we felt in my generation when i was young that i see occasionally in the young men of your time has become conscious only because it is about to be smothered in the great advancing waves of european banality i was thinking the other day that perhaps states of life only became conscious once their intensity was waning but most of the intellectuals i met in madrid put in telemachus seemed enormously anxious for subways and mechanical progress seemed to think that existence could be made perfect by slotmachines they are anxious to hold stock in the subway and slotmachine enterprises that they may have more money to unspanish themselves in paris but let us not talk of that from the next turn in the road round that little hill we shall see toledo don alonso jumped on his horse and lyaeus and telemachus doubled the speed of their stride first above the bulge of reddish saffron striped with dark of a plowed field they saw a weathercock then under it the slate cap of a tower the alcбzar said don alonso the road turned away and olive trees hid the weathercock at the next bend the towers were four strongly buttressing a square building where on the western windows glinted reflections of sunset as they walked more towers dust colored and domes and the spire of a cathedral greenish spiky like the tail of a pickerel jutted to the right of the citadel the road dipped again passed some white houses where children sat in the doorways from the inner rooms came a sound of frying oil and a pungence of cistustwigs burning starting up the next rise that skirted a slope planted with almond trees they caught sight of a castle rounded towers built of rough grey stone joined by crenellated walls that appeared occasionally behind the erratic lacework of angular twigs on which here and there a cluster of pink flowers had already come into bloom at the summit was a wineshop with mules tethered against the walls and below the tagus and the great bridge and toledo against the grey and ochrestreaked theatre of the cigarrales were piled masses of buttressed wall that caught the orange sunset light on many tall plane surfaces rising into crenellations and square towers and domes and slatecapped spires above a litter of yellowish tile roofs that fell away in terraces from the highest points and sloped outside the walls towards the river and the piers from which sprang the enormous arch of the bridge the shadows were bluegreen and violet a pale cobalt haze of supperfires hung over the quarters near the river as they started down the hill towards the heavy pile of san juan bautista that stood under its broad tiled dome outside the nearest gate a great volley of bellringing swung about their ears a donkey brayed there was a sound of shouting from the town here we are gentlemen ill look for you tomorrow at the fonda shouted don alonso he took off his hat and galloped towards the gate leaving telemachus and lyaeus standing by the roadside looking out over the city beyond the zinc bar was an irregular room with nilegreen walls into which light still filtered through three little round arches high up on one side in a corner were some hogsheads of wine in another small tables with threelegged stools from outside came the distant braying of a brass band and racket of a street full of people laughter and the occasional shivering jangle of a tambourine lyaeus had dropped onto a stool and spread his feet out before him on the tiled floor never walked so far in my life he said my toes are pulverized pulverized he leaned over and pulled off his shoes there were holes in his socks he pulled them off in turn and started wiggling his toes meditatively his ankles were grimed with dust well began telemachus the padrуn a lean man with moustaches and a fancy yellow vest which he wore unbuttoned over a lavender shirt brought two glasses of dense black wine you have walked a long way he asked looking with interest at lyaeus feet from madrid ўcarai not all in one day you are sailors going to rejoin your ship in sevilla the padrуn looked from one to another with a knowing expression twisting his mouth so that one of the points of his moustache slanted towards the ceiling and the other towards the floor not exactly another man drew up his chair to their table first taking off his wide cap and saying gravely con permiso de ustedes his broad slightly flabby face was very pale the eyes under his sparse blonde eyelashes were large and grey he put his two hands on their shoulders so as to draw their heads together and said in a whisper you arent deserters are you no i hoped you were i might have helped you i escaped from prison in barcelona a week ago i am a syndicalist have a drink cried lyaeus another glass and we can let you have some money if you need it too if you want to get out of the country the padrуn brought the wine and retired discreetly to a chair beside the bar from which he beamed at them with almost religious approbation you are comrades of those who break out said lyaeus flushing what about the progress of events when do you think the pot will boil over soon or never said the syndicalist that is never in our lifetime we are being buried under industrialism like the rest of europe our people our comrades even are fast getting the bourgeois mentality there is danger that we shall lose everything we have fought for you see if we could only have captured the means of production when the system was young and weak we could have developed it slowly for our benefit made the machine the slave of man every day we wait makes it more difficult it is a race as to whether this peninsula will be captured by communism or capitalism it is still neither one nor the other in its soul he thumped his clenched fist against his chest how long were you in prison only a month this time but if they catch me it will be bad they wont catch me he spoke quietly without gestures occasionally rolling an unlit cigarette between his brown fingers hadnt we better go out before it gets quite dark said telemachus when shall i see you again said lyaeus to the syndicalist oh well meet if you stay in toledo a few days lyaeus got to his feet and took the man by the arm look let me give you some money wont you be wanting to go to portugal the man flushed and shook his head if our opinions coincided i agree with all those who break out said lyaeus thats not the same my friend they shook hands and telemachus and lyaeus went out of the tavern two carriages hung with gaudily embroidered shawls full of dominos and pierrots and harlequins who threw handfuls of confetti at people along the sidewalks clattered into town through the dark arches of the gate telemachus got some confetti in his mouth a crowd of little children danced about him jeering as he stood spluttering on the curbstone lyaeus took him by the arm and drew him along the street after the carriages bent double with laughter this irritated telemachus who tore his arm away suddenly and made off with long strides up a dark street a halfwaned moon shone through the perforations in a round terracotta chimney into the streets angular greenish shadow from somewhere came the seethe of water over a dam telemachus was leaning against a damp wall tired and exultant looking vaguely at the oval of a womans face half surmised behind the bars of an upper window when he heard a clatter of unsteady feet on the cobbles and lyaeus appeared reeling a little his lips moist his eyebrows raised in an expression of drunken jollity lyaeus i am very happy cried telemachus stepping forward to meet his friend walking about here in these empty zigzag streets i have suddenly felt familiar with it all as if it were a part of me as if i had soaked up some essence out of it silly that about essences gestures tel silly awake all you need lyaeus stood on a little worn stone that kept wheels off the corner of the house where the street turned and waved his arms awake dormitant animorum excubitor thats not right latins no good means a fellow who says wake up you son of a gun oh youre drunk its much more important than that its like learning to swim for a long time you flounder about its unpleasant and gets up your nose and you choke then all at once you are swimming like a duck thats how i feel about all this the challenge was that woman in madrid dancing dancing tel there are things too good to talk about look im like st simeon stylites lyaeus lifted one leg then the other waving his arms like a tightrope walker when i left you i walked out over the other bridge the bridge of st martin and climbed shut up i think i hear a girl giggling up in the window there lyaeus stood up very straight on his column and threw a kiss up into the darkness the giggling turned to a shrill laughter a head craned out from a window opposite lyaeus beckoned with both hands never mind about them look out somebody threw something oh its an orange i want to tell you how i felt the gesture i had climbed up on one of the hills of the cigarrales and was looking at the silhouette of the town so black against the stormy marbled sky the moon hadnt risen yet lets move away from here ven flor de mi corazуn shouted lyaeus towards the upper window a flock of goats was passing on the road below and from somewhere came the tremendous lilt of heads cried lyaeus throwing himself round an angle in the wall telemachus looked up his mind full of his mother penelopes voice saying reproachfully you might have been murdered in that dark alley a girl was leaning from the window shaken with laughter taking aim with a bucket she swung with both hands stop cried telemachus its the other as he spoke a column of cold water struck his head knocked his breath out drenched him speaking of gestures whispered lyaeus breathlessly from the doorway where he was crouching and the street was filled with uncontrollable shrieking laughter
