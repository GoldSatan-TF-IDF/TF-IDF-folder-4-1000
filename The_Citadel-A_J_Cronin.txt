chapter one the new doctor late one october afternoon in the year a badly dressed young man looked eagerly out of the window of his railway carriage in the almost empty train manson had been travelling all day but the last stage of his long journey to south wales moved him to great excitement as he thought of the post his first as a doctor that he was about to take up in this wild country outside the rain beat down between the mountains on either side of the railway line the tops of the mountains were hidden by a grey sky and their sides which contained many coal mines looked black and cold night was falling and no trees no grass could be seen at a bend in the railway line a bright red light from an iron works suddenly came into view lighting up a number of men who were working with all their strength at once a sense of power filled the mountain valley manson drew a deep breath he felt an added call to effort a sudden hope and promise for the future it was dark when half an hour later his train reached drineffy he had arrived at last manson jumped from the train and hurried out of the station in the street an old man in dirty clothes looked at him carefully and asked are you dr pages new man thats right mansons my name andrew manson hm mines thomas ive got the carriage here get in manson climbed into the carriage which was badly in need of repair and they drove in silence through several streets of small dirty houses old thomas whose body gave off an unpleasant smell kept looking strangely at manson at last he said youve only just left college eh andrew smiled i thought so old thomas said scornfully the last man left ten days ago they never stay for long why andrew asked trying to hide his anxiety the works too hard for one reason and what are the other reasons youll soon find out after leaving the centre of the town they drove across some rough ground near a coal mine and then up a narrow stony road to a house close to the rows of small miners houses this is the house said thomas stopping the horse andrew got out of the carriage the next minute the front door was thrown open and he was welcomed by a tall woman of about fifty well well you must be dr manson come inside im dr pages sister miss page i am pleased to see you she said with a friendly smile our last man was of no use but im sure that i can trust you come with me and i will show you your bedroom andrews room was small and cold with very little furniture andrew looked round the unwelcoming room and remarked politely this looks very comfortable miss page she smiled yes i think that you will be comfortable now come and meet the doctor she paused and then added awkwardly i cant remember whether i told you in my letter that the doctor is not well at the moment andrew looked at her in sudden surprise oh its nothing serious she said quickly hell soon be fit again she led andrew to the end of the passage where she opened a door and called out to her brother heres dr manson edward as andrew entered the hot bedroom which smelt of sickness edward page turned slowly in his bed he was a big man of perhaps sixty with tired eyes and an expression of great suffering on his face the light of the oil lamp shining on to his bed showed that one half of his face was stiff and lifeless the left side of his body had no strength or feeling at all these signs of a long and most serious illness gave andrew a shock there was an awkward silence i hope that you wont find the work here too hard dr page remarked speaking slowly and with difficulty youre very young im twentyfour sir andrew answered but i like work he added quickly page looked at andrew and said in a tired voice i hope that youll stay goodness what a thing to say cried miss page she smiled at andrew and then led him downstairs to supper as andrew followed her he felt worried no mention of pages illness had been made when he applied for the post but the doctor was so ill that he would never be fit to work again andrew asked himself why his sister had kept this fact secret youre lucky doctor miss page remarked as they went into the dining room there will be no surgery for you tonight jenkins has attended to it jenkins he mixes the medicines hes a useful man prepared to do anything hes been acting for the doctor and attending to all the patients during these last ten days andrew again looked at her in surprise was this how country doctors ran their practices miss page rang a bell and a servant with a pale face brought in the supper looking quickly at andrew as she entered come along annie cried miss pagethis is dr manson annie did not answer she served andrew with a small piece of cold meat which he ate without tasting it during the meal miss page was silent then she sat back in her chair and described in a friendly manner the medical system at drineffy all our patients are miners she explained the mining company has three doctors on its lists each of whom employs a younger doctor to help him dr page now employs you and dr nicholls employs a shameful man called denny and then theres dr bramwell each miner chooses which of the three doctors he wishes to see in times of illness and the company pays part of his wages each week to the doctor whom he has chosen the doctor gives a fair share of this money to his helper and keeps the rest for himself she stopped and looked at andrew i think i understand the system miss page he said well she gave a short laugh all that you must remember is that you are working for dr page never forget that she looked at the clock and then quickly rose from her chair her manner suddenly changed theres a woman ill at number glydar place her husband sent for the doctor a long time ago you had better go round there immediately she ordered andrew chapter second fever andrew went out at once he was eager to begin this was his first case it was still raining as he crossed the black rough ground and made his way to the main street darkly as he walked the dirty town took shape before him shops and ugly churches large and cold filled the street the sense of being buried deep in the valley of the mountains made andrew tremble there were few people about beyond the shops and churches on both sides of the street were rows and rows of houses and at the far end of the town lighting up the watery sky were the drineffy mine workings andrew reached number glydar place he took a deep breath and then knocked at the door he was admitted at once to the kitchen where the patient lay in bed she was a young woman the wife of a miner named williams as andrew went ever to her bed he suddenly felt a great sense of responsibility he was alone he must find out what was wrong with the woman and cure her with no other doctor to advise him while the husband waited and watched in the cold dark room andrew examined the woman with great care he could see that she was ill very ill but what was the cause of her illness andrew could not discover the answer he felt very anxious his first case he must not make a mistake he examined the patient a second time but he still did not know what was wrong with her at last he turned to her husband and asked did she have a cold yes doctor three or four days ago williams answered eagerly andrew trying to appear confident said cheerfully then ill soon make her better come to the surgery in half an hour ill give you a bottle of medicine for her he quickly left the house and walked back in the rain to the surgery an old wooden building in pages garden he lit the gaslight and walked up and down the room trying to think of any illness from which the woman might be suffering he knew that it was not really her cold that had made her ill she had something far worse wrong with her feeling very annoyed with himself for his stupidity he took some bottles from a shelf and mixed a medicine he had just finished this and was putting the womans name and address on to the bottle when the surgery bell rang before andrew could answer this the door opened and a short powerful man of about thirty walked in followed by a dog the man who wore an old suit of clothes and dirty shoes looked andrew up and down at last he spoke i saw a light in your window as i was passing by so i decided to come in and welcome you im denny employed by the great dr nicholls philip denny lit his pipe threw the match on to the floor and walked forward he picked up the bottle of medicine smelt it and then put it down again excellent he said so youve begun the good work already medicine every three hours the usual nonsense when in doubt give medicine there was silence in the wooden building suddenly denny laughed why have you come here he asked by this time andrews temper was rising he answered angrily i want to turn drineffy into a famous medical centre again denny laughed clever clever my dear doctor then suddenly his manner changed listen manson he said there are one or two things about this place that you ought to know the medical system at drineffy is very bad theres no hospital nor anything else that a doctor needs the place is so unhealthy that people often die of fever usually through drinking the bad water page was a good doctor but hes a sick man and will never work again nicholls my employer thinks only about making money and bramwell the other doctor in the area knows nothing and i i drink too much i think thats all come hawkins well go he called the dog and moved heavily towards the door there he paused took another look at the bottle of medicine and then added i advise you to consider typhoid fever in glydar place the door closed noisily and denny and the dog disappeared into the wet darkness andrew slept badly that night dennys remark had raised another doubt in his mind was it typhoid as he lay in bed through the long night andrew asked himself if he knew anything at all about the profession of medicine next morning he ate his breakfast quickly and then went to the surgery jenkins was already there mixing the medicines theres no need to come here so early doctor he said i can give the men their medicines and sick notes it is not necessary for you to see them thank you but i wish to see them andrew answered coldly he paused and then asked quickly what are you putting into those bottles jenkins smiled water doctor i colour the water to make it look like medicine the patients dont know they think it makes them better after the morning surgery andrew drove with old thomas to glydar place he called at number and then visited six other houses where people were now complaining of headaches and sickness in each case andrew found definite signs of fever he realized with sudden fear that the fever was already spreading he decided that he must speak to dr page at once dr page whats the best thing to do with cases of typhoid fever he asked page replied with closed eyes fever has always been difficult to deal with i advise you to telephone griffiths the area medical officer he paused but im afraid that hes not very helpful andrew ran down to the hall and telephoned griffiths hullo hullo is that dr griffiths after a short silence a mans voice answered who wants him this is manson of drineffy i work for dr page i have several cases of typhoid fever i want dr griffiths to come here immediately im sorry but dr griffiths is out on business when will he be back shouted manson i dont know but listen but the speaker at the other end had gone manson swore loudly turning round he saw annie the servant beside him dr griffiths is never at home at this hour of the day she told him hes out enjoying himself but i think that it was dr griffiths who spoke to me annie smiled perhaps when he is at home he pretends that hes out i shouldnt waste your time on him that evening while attending to his surgery patients andrew decided to see denny it was he who suggested typhoid he reminded himself i hate him but that doesnt matter i must go to him at once denny showed no surprise when andrew visited him well have you killed anybody yet he asked in his rude manner andrew reddened you were right it is typhoid ive come to ask your advice denny gave a faint smile then youd better come in sit down have a drink no i didnt think that you would for a few moments he sat in silence pushing the dog hawkins with his foot then he pointed to the table and said look at that on the table stood a microscope andrew looked through this and saw on a glass plate the bacteria that were responsible for the fever you have typhoid cases too then andrew asked with interest four and all in the same area as yours these bacteria come from the well in glydar place andrew looked at him in surprise the sewer is the cause of the trouble denny continued there are holes in it and the dirt flows through these into the well ive reported the matter to griffiths several times but he refuses to do anything its shameful andrew almost shouted he got up and moved towards the door thank you for the information in future i shall order all my patients in glydar place to boil their water its griffiths who ought to be boiled denny laughed we shall probably have to see more of each other before this situation improves come and see me any time that you can bear it going home by glydar place where he left orders regarding the water andrew realized that he did not hate denny as much as he thought dennys behaviour seemed strange to andrew and when he arrived home he decided to look up his qualifications in one of pages old medical books he found that denny who came of a good family had been educated at an english university and had qualified with good degrees at one of the best hospitals in london denny was in fact an excellent doctor he gave his patients the best possible attention and treated them with great kindness but he refused to give medicines unless they were necessary many doctors did not trouble to find out what was really wrong with their patients but just gave them useless medicines this made denny bitterly critical of medical practice and accounted for his strange behaviour at times chapter three the sewer andrew worked hard to cure his fever cases now that his patients were drinking only boiled water they quickly began to get better i am succeeding he called out in delight then one day in november just before lunch denny telephoned him manson id like to see you can you come to my house at three oclock its important very well ill be there andrew ate his lunch in deep thought as he ate miss page looked at him suspiciously and asked who telephoned you it was denny wasnt it i told you not to see that man hes worthless andrew replied angrily youre wrong miss page i have found him extremely helpful hes a bad doctor he refuses to give medicines hes so rude too i forbid you to see him they finished their meal in silence after lunch andrew walked slowly up the street towards dennys house philip greeted him with the news young jones died this morning and i have two new typhoid cases andrew looked down at the floor in sympathy hardly knowing what to say dont look so pleased about it denny said bitterly you like to see my cases get worse while yours get better but if that sewer no no andrew interrupted im sorry honestly i am we must do something about the sewer we must write to its no use writing letters philip cried theres only one way to make them build a new sewer whats that blow up the old one andrew was not sure if denny had gone mad but youre not being serious denny looked at him with scorn you neednt help me if you dont want to oh ill help you andrew promised all that afternoon while visiting his patients manson wished he hadnt made the promise dennys plan was too risky if they were discovered they would both be dismissed from their posts andrew trembled at this thought he was angry with philip swore a number of times that he would not go but for some reason he could not break his promise at oclock that night denny and he set out with the dog hawkins it was very dark and wet and a strong wind blew the rain into their faces the two men each of whom carried explosives in his coat pockets walked quickly along the empty streets when they reached the sewer in glydar place they broke open the lid which had not been lifted for many years and then shone a light inside nice isnt it said denny see the holes in the wall look manson look for the last time no more was said they placed their explosives inside the sewer put back the lid and then ran up the street when they were only about metres away there was a loud explosion weve done it denny andrew said excitedly five more explosions followed the last so loud that it could be heard all down the valley there said denny thats the end of that particular cause of misery almost immediately doors and windows opened and people ran out of their houses in a minute the street was crowded making good use of the darkness and the noise denny and manson hurried home before eight oclock the next morning dr griffiths arrived on the scene he had been sent for by several of the most important men in the town who told their medical officer in loud voices so that everyone could hear that he had neglected his duty most shamefully when they had finished with him griffiths walked over to denny who with manson stood in the crowd listening to the angry exchanges well denny he said ill have to build that new sewer for you now dennys face showed no expression i warned you about this several months ago he said coldly dont you remember yes yes but how could i guess that the thing would blow up its a mystery to me how it happened the work of building a new sewer began on the following monday chapter four a visit to the school it was three months later and andrew was beginning to like the dirty old town and its strange but kind people feeling extremely happy he went out one afternoon to see a small boy of nine whose name was joe he was not very ill but as the family was poor his illness seemed likely to give the boys mother a lot more work at the end of his visit andrew remarked to her you must still keep his brother home from school im afraid joes mother looked at him in surprise but miss barlow said that i neednt keep him at home although he was sympathetic andrew felt annoyed oh and who is miss barlow he asked shes the schoolteacher she called to see me this morning andrew did not reply but on leaving the house he walked straight to the school to see this teacher when he entered the classroom all the children were sitting at their desks miss barlow was facing away from him and did not notice him at first then suddenly she turned round she was so different from most schoolteachers he had met that andrew paused uncertainly are you miss barlow he asked awkwardly yes she was a small attractive and welldressed young woman of about twentytwo she looked at him for a moment and then smiled you work for dr page dont you never mind about that he answered coldly i am dr manson you have a boy here whose brother has a serious disease that could spread to other children he ought to be at home she smiled again yes i know her refusal to treat his visit seriously made andrew lose his temper dont you realize that you are breaking the rules by allowing this boy to come to school his manner now made miss barlow angry but she replied quietly most of the children here have already had the same illness and the others are certain to catch it in any case and if he didnt come to school he would miss his free milk which is doing him such a lot of good he ought to be at home you must send that child home at once andrew ordered her her eyes showed her anger now i am in charge of this class you may be able to tell people in other places what to do but here i give the orders youre breaking the law he shouted i shall have to report you then report me miss barlow replied she turned to the children and said stand up children and say good morning dr manson thank you for coming the children rose and politely repeated the words she then showed him out of the door and gently closed it behind him chapter five christine manson wrote several letters but he tore them all up again he felt angry with himself because he had lost his temper he decided not to report the schoolteacher he tried to forget the matter but he could not dismiss christine barlow from his mind two weeks later when he was walking down the street mrs bramwell called out to him oh dr manson i want to see you will you come to dinner tonight ive invited three other very nice people mr and mrs watkins from the mine and the schoolteacher christine badow manson s face lit up with pleasure well of course ill come mrs bramwell thank you for asking me for the rest of the day he could think of nothing but the fact that he was going to meet christine barlow again after the evening surgery he hurried round to the bramwells house he felt very awkward he did not dare even to look at christine during dinner and he did not address a single remark to her after the meal he wanted to speak to her but he did not have the courage to do so but when the dinner party ended he spoke to her as she was leaving the house miss barlow may i take you home he asked thank you but mr and mrs watkins have already offered to take me she told him andrew felt very disappointed i want to say that im sorry he said suddenly i behaved very badly your decision about that boy was right i admire you for it good night he did not wait for her answer he turned round and walked down the road for the first time for many days he felt happy andrew had never been in love before he was afraid to fall in love afraid that it might get in the way of his work but he could not control his feelings for christine he wanted with all his heart to see her again then one day in may he received a note from her inviting him to supper on the following evening he almost ran to the house where christine lived he arrived early before the watkins who had also been invited christine gave him a warm welcome he was so pleased that he could hardly speak its been a lovely day hasnt it he said as he followed her into the living room lovely she agreed i went for such a nice walk this afternoon she sat down how nice it was to be here with her her room full of her own possessions was pleasant and comfortable he felt relaxed and began to ask her questions about herself she answered him simply her mother had died when she was fifteen and four years later her father and brother had been killed in an accident in their coal mine now she had no relatives people were kind to me she said mr and mrs watkins were especially kind i came to work at the school here she paused but im like you i still feel strange a little lonely here he looked at her its easy to feel lonely here i often wish that i had somebody to talk to she smiled what do you want to talk about he turned red oh my work i suppose i seem to have so many problems he explained do you mean that you have difficult cases no not really he paused when i came to drineffy i imagined that a doctors life would be very pleasant but now i am discovering that it is far from that the system is all wrong for example a patient comes to the surgery for a bottle of medicine and is given coloured water it isnt right doctors dont take enough trouble to find out what is wrong with a patient before treating him they are always in such a hurry christine was about to answer when the doorbell rang she rose saying i hope that you will tell me more about this another time mr watkins and his wife came in and almost at once they sat down to supper it was a good meal and nicely served after supper mr watkins told stories which made them all laugh the evening passed quickly when andrew looked at his watch he saw to his surprise that it was nearly oclock sadly he rose to leave he thanked christine who went with him to the door please can i see you again he paused will you christine will you come out with me one evening she smiled well i might he wanted to kiss her he held her hand for a moment turned and ran down the path on his way home oh she was a lovely girl and he had called her christine chapter six curing a madman andrew felt happy hopeful this feeling of excitement influenced his work he wanted to do something to make christine proud of him for the next few weeks he had only very simple cases to attend to such as cuts on the hand and colds in the head he began to ask himself if a doctor in such a lonely place would ever have an opportunity to do work of real importance but then at six oclock one morning he was woken by annie who with tears in her eyes gave him a note from dr bramwell andrew quickly opened the envelope and read come at once i want you to help me with a dangerous madman its my brother emlyn doctor said annie wiping her eyes hes been ill for three weeks during the night he suddenly became violent and attacked his wife with a knife come quickly doctor andrew dressed in three minutes and went with annie to emlyns home there he found bramwell seated at a table writing ah manson thank you for coming so quickly he said whats the matter emlyn has gone mad we shall have to send him to the mental hospital at once but of course they will not admit him unless a second doctor signs my report saying that he is mad thats why i sent for you what are your reasons for considering him mad andrew asked bramwell read out his report it certainly sounds bad andrew agreed when bramwell had finished well ill examine him emlyn was in bed and seated beside him in case he should become violent again were two of his friends from the mine at the foot of the bed stood his wife who was crying andrew had a sudden feeling of coldness almost of fear he went over to emlyn and at first the man hardly recognized him andrew spoke to him emlyn gave a reply that did not make sense then throwing up his hands he shouted and threatened andrew a silence followed emlyn showed all the signs of madness but for some reason andrew doubted whether he was really mad he kept asking himself why emlyn should behave like this there might be some other medical reason he touched the mans swollen face and noticed with surprise that his finger left no mark at once he saw the cause of the trouble he finished his examination to make certain that he was right and then went back to bramwell listen bramwell he said trying to hide his excitement i dont think that we should sign that report what but the mans mad thats not my opinion andrew answered in my opinion emlyn is only suffering from a hormone problem bramwell was too surprised to speak let us try to cure him instead of sending him to the mental hospital andrew suggested before bramwell could argue andrew went out of the room a few minutes later he returned with emlyns wife and told her with bramwell listening what they planned to do two weeks after starting andrews new treatment emlyn was well enough to leave his sickbed and in two months he was back at work one evening he and his wife went to the surgery and told andrew we owe everything to you we would like you to be our regular doctor in future bramwell knows nothing hes a silly old fool you cant change doctors andrew answered that would not be fair to bramwell but andrew felt pleased that they wished to change and as soon as they left he went round to christine to tell her of his success chapter seven freddie hamson in july an important meeting of british doctors was held in the welsh capital cardiff andrew had not intended to go to this meeting because of the cost but a few days before it began he received a letter from his friend freddie hamson urging him to attend and inviting him to have dinner with him on the saturday evening andrew showed the letter to christine with whom he was now very much in love and asked her will you come with me id like you to meet hamson id love to come she said on saturday christine and andrew took the train to cardiff andrew smiled at christine who sat on the opposite seat he wanted to kiss her to hold her in his arms rather breathlessly he said we shall have a happy time this evening freddies a nice man youll like him when they reached cardiff they went to the hotel where the meeting was being held hamson had not yet arrived so they stood together watching the doctors and their wives talking and laughing after some time freddie arrived and headed towards them hullo hullo sorry im late well well its nice to see you again andrew i see that youre still the same old manson why dont you buy yourself a new suit suddenly noticing christine he smiled and ordered andrew introduce me man wake up while the two doctors were in their meeting christine went out to look at the shops then in the early evening they met up again in the hotel over dinner freddie began to talk about the days when he and andrew had studied medicine together i never thought then he said in a rather scornful manner that you would bury yourself in the country like this do you really think that hes buried himself christine asked coldly there was a pause freddie smiled at andrew what did you think of the meeting i suppose andrew answered doubtfully that the discussions help to keep ones knowledge up to date oh i dont take any notice of the discussions heavens no ive come here to meet the doctors the important doctors who will be useful to me in my profession youd be surprised how many useful men there are here when i return to london i shall invite them to a meal then we shall do business together i dont understand freddie manson said its simple when rich people come to me i shall examine them first and then send them to a second doctor to see if he agrees with my opinion about their illness and the treatment to give in return these doctors will send me some of their patients the patients then have to pay each of us thats the way to make money freddie laughed you ought to come to london one day then you and i could do business together christine looked quickly at hamson was about to speak but then stopped herself and now tell me about yourself manson freddie continued smiling what have you been doing oh nothing much most of my patients are coal miners and their families that doesnt sound very good i enjoy my work andrew said christine interrupted and you do important work yes i had one interesting case recently andrew began to tell hamson about emlyn but hamson was not really listening at ten oclock andrew and christine left as they walked back to the railway station andrew asked did you like hamson no not much she paused hes too pleased with himself he considers himself to be so much better than you i hate that way of talking andrew seemed surprised i agree that he is rather pleased with himself but hes really a very nice man you must be blind if you cant see the kind of person he is he only thinks about himself andrew had never seen christine so angry before they entered the railway station andrew wanted a quiet talk with christine to clear up their little disagreement and to tell her of his love for her but the train was crowded and they could not be alone it was late when they reached drineffy and christine looked very tired so he took her home and said good night chapter eight baby morgan it was nearly midnight when andrew reached the pages house he found joe morgan waiting for him morgan and his wife had been married for years and now to their great joy they were expecting their first baby oh doctor i am glad to see you said joe my wife come quickly andrew ran into the house for his bag of instruments and then hurried along to morgans home ill wait outside doctor im too worried to come in morgan said when they arrived inside a narrow staircase led up to a small bedroom which though clean had very little furniture and was lit by only an oil lamp here mrs morgans mother and a fat nurse stood anxiously by the bed watching andrews expression as he moved about the room andrew smiled dont worry he comforted them he knew that this case would demand all his attention as there was nothing that he could do for the moment he sat down and waited thinking of christine at half past three he went over to the bed and saw that he could now begin his work it was a long and difficult birth then just as daylight was beginning the child was born lifeless as he looked at the babys still white body andrew turned cold quickly he gave the child to the nurse and turned his attention to mrs morgan who was also close to death working with great speed he seized a bottle and gave her a medicine to make her heart stronger he then made a feverish effort to save her by other means after a few minutes her heartbeat strengthened seeing that she was out of danger andrew turned round to the nurse and shouted wheres the child the nurse looked afraid she had put the baby under the bed at once andrew knelt down and pulled out the child still kneeling he examined the boy and decided that there was just a chance of bringing him to life he jumped to his feet and ordered the nurse get me some hot water and cold water bowls too quickly but doctor quick he shouted when the bowls arrived andrew filled one with the cold water and the other with the hot water working with great speed he then placed the baby first into one bowl and then into the other he continued this operation for minutes but the baby showed no sign of life youre wasting your time doctor said the nurse its dead but andrew took no notice he put the baby into hot and cold water for another minutes having again achieved no success he then made a last and more determined effort pressing on the babys little chest trying to get breath into its still body suddenly the baby made a movement gradually its white face and body began to turn pink after a few more minutes it started to cry good heavens the nurse cried its its come to life andrew handed her the child he felt weak almost faint his dirty instruments cloths and bowls lay in pools of water on the floor mrs morgan was asleep not knowing what had been happening her mother stood by the wall praying ill come back for my bag later nurse andrew said he went downstairs to the kitchen and put on his hat and coat outside he found joe all right joe he said your wife and son are both safe it was nearly five oclock a few miners were already in the streets as andrew walked home he thought ive done something oh god ive done something good at last andrew had a bath and went downstairs to breakfast miss page having discovered that his bed had not been slept in gave him a severe look as he sat down at the table and remarked you got home late i suppose you were out enjoying yourself all night drinking or getting into some other kind of trouble youre as bad as all the other men weve employed you cant be trusted andrew was too angry to reply after the morning surgery he went back to the morgans as he walked down their road women whom he had never met smiled at him in a most friendly manner when he reached the morgans house he received a very warm welcome he went upstairs to the bedroom the little room which had been so untidy only a few hours before had been cleaned and polished and his instruments carefully washed and put into his bag there were clean sheets on the bed the nurse rose from her seat and smiling at the mother and baby said they look very well now dont they doctor but they dont know how much trouble they gave us mrs morgan tried to express her thanks we are very grateful to you doctor has joe been to see you yet she asked no well hes coming before andrew left the house the old woman gave him a glass of wine two weeks later when andrew had paid his last visit of the day morgan who was about to go abroad with his wife and child called to see him money cant pay for all that you have done for us but my wife and i would like to give you this little present he said handing andrew a cheque for five pounds but i cant accept this joe andrew said he knew that the morgans had very little money you must accept it we want you to joe told him its a present for yourself not for dr page you understand yes i understand joe andrew said smiling he took the cheque to the pages bank and told the manager mr rees that he wished to open an account rees looked at the cheque and asked slowly do you want this account to be in your own name manson was surprised at the question yes why is the amount too small oh no doctor were very pleased to do business with you er you did say that you want the account to be in your own name yes of course all right doctor i just wanted to check good morning dr manson good morning manson left the bank asking himself what the manager meant it was some days before he was able to answer the question chapter nine joe morgans cheque christine had gone away for a holiday and andrew felt lonely without her the weather was hot and tiring and life seemed dull then one day watkins sent a message asking him to call at his office the manager of the coal mines greeted him in a friendly manner listen doctor he said emlyn and a number of the miners want me to hire you as one of the companys doctors andrew looked at him in surprise you mean i mean watkins said slowly that i would like to add your name to the list of doctors so that any man who wishes to can leave dr page and make you his regular doctor i couldnt agree to that it wouldnt be fair to dr page andrew replied it wouldnt be honest watkins was disappointed think about my suggestion doctor he urged andrew its no use i couldnt do it he said firmly though sadly wishing that he had never been offered this opportunity to improve his position andrew tried to take his mind off the matter by going to see denny but to his disappointment he found that denny had been drinking and could neither behave nor talk sensibly andrew put him to bed and left the next morning after surgery he went back to dennys house to see how he was he found him in an even worse condition swearing about denny and the summer heat andrew hurried out to visit philips patients as well as his own when he called on him in the evening denny shouted the medical profession huh its the worst system in the world its not honest give me another drink he paused manson youre a good man i love you better than a brother you and i should work together wed soon change the whole of this profession denny nearly fell over and andrew put him to bed for the second time for the rest of that week he did all dennys work then on sunday denny was quite well again i understand that youve been doing my work for me manson he said in a cold voice his manner was so cold that andrew left the house at once in anger he behaves as if he has generously allowed me to do his work andrew said to himself but his anger soon left him he was fond of philip and respected his honesty and skill as a doctor when andrew reached home miss page shouted at him is that you doctor dr manson i want you whats the matter miss page he answered with annoyance she came up to him what you may well ask kindly explain this she said holding up joe morgans cheque raising his head andrew saw rees standing behind miss page yes you have reason to be surprised miss page continued perhaps you will explain why you paid this money into your bank account instead of into dr pages andrew felt hot with anger its my money joe morgan gave it to me as a present a present its easy to say that now that hes abroad write and ask him if you doubt my word i do doubt your word you are trying to take over dr pages practice this shows the kind of man that you are you consider only your own interests andrew moved towards them his eyes on rees miss page he said unless you take those words back within two minutes i shall bring an action against you in a court of law and i shall punish your bank manager in a way that he has never been punished before i i only did my duty the bank manager said weakly im waiting miss page andrew warned her she realized that she had said too much i im sorry andrew took a quick deep breath miss page there is something that i want to tell you last week i was invited to become an official doctor to the mining company but i refused the offer because i did not consider it fair to dr page to accept now im so tired of you that i have decided to leave i give you a months notice she looked at him in surprise lies all lies she shouted you cant give me notice andrew said nothing more he went upstairs to his room and closed the door chapter ten a new post andrew began to search at once for another position but he did not receive a single answer to his letters he became very worried how was he to live then one day when walking sadly down the street he met denny knocking out the ashes from his pipe philip said im sorry that youre leaving manson he paused i heard this afternoon that the aberalaw medical society is advertising for a new man aberalaw thats kilometres down the valley why dont you try for the post andrew looked doubtful well yes he agreed slowly i could try he walked home and wrote to the society a week later andrew and seven other young doctors went to aberalaw to be examined by the societys committee it was a fine summer afternoon and andrew liked aberalaw which was larger than drineffy with good streets and shops and green fields surrounding the town but i wont get this post he told himself as he waited his turn for examination the other men were better dressed and seemed more confident than he but what would christine think of him if he failed she would return to drineffy either today or tomorrow he had not told her about the post he wanted to surprise her and to win her respect by greeting her with the good news that he had been given the post andrew the third man to be examined entered the committee room with a feeling of fear and determination about miners were in the room at a small table sat a pale man with a kind face he was owen the secretary owen in a quiet voice explained the medical system at aberalaw the miners pay part of their wages each week to the society and out of this money the society provides the medical services including a hospital the society employs a head doctor dr llewellyn four other doctors to help him and a dentist each doctor receives a payment for every patient on his list owen turned to the committee and now gentlemen do you wish to ask dr manson any questions several voices began to shout questions at andrew he answered them calmly and returned to the waiting room the next man then went in the last man came back from his examination with a smile of satisfaction on his face im the winner his expression seemed to say there was another long wait at last the door of the committee room opened and owen came out he called out will you come in for a minute dr manson the committee would like to see you again his heart beating fast andrew followed the secretary back into the committee room where he was welcomed by smiling faces owen now addressed him dr manson we will be honest with you the committee on dr llewellyns advice had intended to hire a doctor with experience in this valley but the committee now feels that you may be a better choice andrew was too excited to smile i should add dr manson owen continued that the committee has been influenced by two letters received from doctors in your own town one is from a dr denny who has a very good degree and the other enclosed with dennys is signed by dr page by whom you are employed these two doctors praise your work so highly that the committee would like to offer you the post andrew lowered his eyes his thoughts on dennys generous act there is just one difficulty dr manson owen added this post should really be given to a married man the miners like their families to be attended by married doctors also a house is provided there was a long silence they were all looking at him at last andrew said calmly that is all right gentlemen i am going to marry a girl in drineffy there were loud cheers then dr manson you are appointed said owen when can you start your duties i can start work next week andrew answered then he turned cold as he thought suppose that christine wont marry me a few minutes later andrew left and excitedly ran to the railway station to catch the next train home to drineffy when he reached drineffy he went straight to christines house to see if she had returned from her holiday finding to his joy that the light was on in her room he rushed into the house christine she looked at him in surprise andrew how nice of you to come round chris i have something to tell you a worried expression spread across her face what has happened have you had more trouble with miss page are you going away he shook his head christine ive got a new post an excellent post at aberalaw five hundred pounds a year and a house a house christine oh my dearest christine could you will you marry me she went very pale her eyes were bright she said quietly and i thought that you were going to tell me some bad news no no the best news my dear he cried oh chris i love you so much but perhaps you dont love me she went towards him and laid her head against his chest as he put his arm round her she said oh andrew dear ive loved you ever since ever since i saw you walk into my school chapter eleven the move to aberalaw a few days later they were married on the same morning they packed christines few pieces of furniture and pots and pans into john lossins old motor bus and drove slowly through the mountains to aberalaw the weather was bright and sunny they laughed and joked and lossin a man without cares kept pulling a bottle from his pocket to drink to their future happiness they had lunch at a small hotel high in the mountains then they began to drop down into the valley leading to aberalaw along a rough and narrow road with steep hills on either side at last after passing two dangerous bends they caught their first sight of aberalaw it was a moment of joy the town lay before them with its houses dotted up and down the valley its shops offices and churches were at one end of the town and at the other end its mines and smoking chimneys all lit up by the bright sun look chris look andrew whispered pressing her arm tightly its a fine place isnt it theres the square and look theres the gas works no need to use oil lamps here dear where do you think our house is they stopped a miner who directed them to vale view well said christine as they entered the large ugly house vale view that was now their home its its nice isnt it yes dear it it looks a lovely house excitedly they went into each room there were so many rooms and they were all so large that they only had enough furniture for two of them they finished their tour of the house in the kitchen where christine unpacked some eggs and cooked a meal heavens dear you are a good cook that was the best meal that ive ever eaten andrew said in delight oh i am looking forward to starting work there ought to be good opportunities here big opportunities he suddenly caught sight of a box in the corner i say chris whats that a wedding present from denny denny his expression changed philips manner had been cold when andrew thanked him for his help in getting the new post and told him of his intention to marry christine this morning he had not even said goodbye to them his unfriendly behaviour had hurt andrew andrew slowly opened the box thinking that it might be a joke then he gave a cry of delight inside was dennys microscope and a note i dont really need this good luck andrew picked up the microscope carried it into another room and gently laid it on the floor saying owing to the generosity of our good friend philip denny i shall now make this room my work room suddenly the telephone rang perhaps its a patient chris my first aberalaw case andrew cried and ran into the hall to answer the telephone it was dr llewellyn hullo manson how are you i want to welcome you and your wife to aberalaw thank you dr llewellyn thats most kind of you andrew replied nonsense nonsense come and have dinner with us tonight then you and i can have a talk we shall expect you at seven oclock goodbye andrew hurried back to christine to tell her about the invitation wasnt that nice of him chris the head doctor and he sounded so friendly mrs manson we are going to be successful he put his arm round her and began to dance dr and mrs llewellyn greeted them like old friends during dinner while mrs llewellyn was talking to christine dr llewellyn told andrew a few more details about the medical system at aberalaw there are two surgeries one at the west end of the town and the other at the east end he explained you will work at the west surgery with old dr urquhart and gadge who mixes the medicines here at the east surgery there are two other doctors dr medley and dr oxborrow theyre all nice men youll like them of course im too busy to work at the surgery myself i have so many other responsibilities im in charge of the hospital im medical officer for the town and hold several other important posts i also have a private practice you do have a lot of work manson remarked llewellyn smiled i must make money dr manson he paused i should just mention that the doctors have agreed to pay me a small part of their salaries andrew looked up in surprise thats because i see their patients for them when theyre worried llewellyn added quicklybut well discuss this matter at another time at that moment mrs llewellyn called to her husband from the other end of the table they were only married this morning mrs manson has just told me so she took christines hand my poor child you will be busy trying to make that terrible house look nice manson reddened its true he admitted he paused would it be possible do you think dr llewellyn for me to go to london for two days to buy furniture for our house certainly you can be absent from work tomorrow and the next day dr manson at ten oclock llewellyn drove andrew and christine to the hospital where he had some patients to see the hospital though small was well built and seemed to contain everything that was needed as llewellyn showed them round andrew thought this is perfect ill be able to treat my patients very effectively in here im rather proud of this place manson llewellyn remarked then suddenly his manner changed well i cant waste any more time he said quickly you can find your way home cant you good night as they walked home together andrew saidi like him i like him very much but but why should we pay him part of our salary it doesnt seem fair when they returned to their almost empty house they stood together in the dark hall then andrew put his arm round christine and whispered whats your name love christine she answered in surprise christine what christine manson her breath came quickly and was warm on his lips chapter twelve the system at aberalaw they went to london and bought some cheap furniture arranging to pay for this at the rate of a few pounds a month during the next year on thursday morning andrew began work at the west surgery his first patient was a man with a bad knee who wanted a doctors note stating that he was not fit for work andrew examined his knee and gave him his note but the next three patients also asked for doctors notes andrew got up opened the door of the waiting room and called out how many more men want sick notes stand up please forty men were waiting and they all stood up it was half past ten when andrew finished his surgery then an old man with a red face walked into his room this was dr urquhart heavens man said urquhart without a word of introduction where have you been during these last two days i had to do your work for you never mind never mind ill say no more about it come and meet gadge hes a miserable man but hes good at his work andrew followed urquhart into another room where gadge a thin man with a sad expression took hardly any notice of him well said urquhart after introducing them is there anything that you would like to know im worried about the number of sick notes that i had to sign this morning andrew told him some of the men seemed quite fit for work a doctor shouldnt give sick notes for no reason urquhart looked at him quickly take care the men will be annoyed if you refuse them their sick notes for the only time that morning gadge made a remark thats because theres nothing wrong with most of them all that day andrew worried about the sick notes he decided to give no more unless they were really necessary he went to his evening surgery with an anxious but determined expression the crowd was larger than at the morning surgery the first patient to enter was a big fat man who looked as if he had never done an honest days work in his life his name was ben chenkin sick note he said roughly what for andrew asked chenkin held out his hand skin disease look andrew could see at once that there was nothing seriously wrong with chenkin he rose from his seat take off your clothes he ordered him chenkin now asked what for im going to examine you chenkin who had never been examined by the last doctor undressed andrew carried out a long examination then he said sharply dress again chenkin he sat down and began to write out a note i thought that youd give me one chenkin said rudely he seized the note from andrews hand and rushed out of the surgery five minutes later he returned whats the meaning of this he shouted pushing the paper into andrews face it read this is to state that chenkin is suffering from the effects of drinking too much but is quite fit to work ive got skin disease shouted chenkin ive had it for years well you havent got it now andrew said a crowd had collected by the open door he could see urquhart looking anxious and gadge with a faint smile on his face are you going to give me a sick note chenkin shouted no im not andrew shouted back and get out of here before i throw you out chenkin looked as if he might kill andrew then he turned and shouting threats left the surgery as soon as he had gone gadge entered rubbing his hands with delight do you know who he is his son is an important member of the committee the chenkin event caused a lot of talk some people were pleased that chenkin had been made to work at last but most people were on his side as he went round the town calling on his patients andrew received many black looks and there was worse trouble for him the men had the right to choose their doctor each man gave his medical card to the doctor of his choice if he wished to make a change he could ask for his card back and hand it to another doctor every night that week men came to andrews surgery and demanded my card please doctor every card that he returned reduced his salary urquhart warned him take care man i understand how you feel you want to improve matters but take care think before you act andrew soon ran into more trouble he was called to the home of thomas evans a miner who had burnt his left arm when andrew arrived he found that the area nurse who had since left the house had put oil on the burn andrew examined the arm and saw that unless he changed the treatment at once the arm would become infected so with great care he cleaned and treated the burn and put on a new bandage will it be all right doctor evans asked anxiously when he had finished yes quite all right andrew smiled leave this to nurse and me before he left the house he wrote a short note to the nurse thanking her for what she had done and asking her to continue his treatment next morning when he went back to the house he found that his bandage had been removed and that the arm had again been treated with oil the nurse was waiting for him whats the explanation of this she asked angrily andrew felt annoyed but he managed to smile now nurse dont ive worked here for years and nobody has ever told me before not to use oil on a burn now listen nurse andrew tried to reason theres a danger of infection thats why i want you to try my treatment ive never heard of this treatment old dr urquhart doesnt give it i refuse to take orders from a man who has been here for only a week it was dangerous to quarrel with the nurse but andrew could not risk his patients health he said in a low voice if you wont give my treatment nurse i shall come in every morning and evening and give it myself all right do the nurse shouted and i hope that evans lives through it she then rushed out of the house in silence andrew attended to the damaged arm when he left he promised to return at nine oclock that night but that same evening mrs evans went to his surgery and in a frightened voice said im sorry to trouble you doctor but can i have my husbands card back please andrew rose without a word searched for the card and handed it to her when he returned home after surgery he was very silent after supper he sat down beside christine and leaning his head against her said sadly oh my dear ive begun so badly tears came to his eyes chapter thirteen thevaughans andrew had a very difficult time all chenkins friends and relatives were his enemies and the area nurse tried to persuade his patients to leave him he had another bitter disappointment dr llewellyn refused to let him use the hospital what do you think happened this morning chris andrew said to his wife with disgust i wanted to give a man treatment in hospital my first hospital case and so i telephoned llewellyn and asked his permission well llewellyn drove round in his expensive car to examine the man personally he was very pleasant he agreed at once to admit the patient into hospital but then before i could thank him he told me that he would take over the case he said that he attends to all the hospital patients and that oh what does it matter what he said andrew was beginning to consider himself a failure but at the end of that week he received a visitor late one evening the doorbell rang it was owen the secretary to the society andrew turned white did the committee intend to dismiss him for his failure were he and christine to be thrown out into the street then suddenly owen produced a yellow card im sorry to call so late dr manson he said but i want to give you my medical card i would like you to be my doctor andrew could hardly speak thank you mr owen ill ill be delighted to add your name to my list christine who was standing in the hall invited owen into the living room where they sat and talked dont lose heart owen comforted andrew the people here are not easy to understand but they are really very kind when they know you better they will like you and their manner towards you will change before andrew could reply owen asked have you heard about evans no that oil which you warned the nurse not to use did exactly what you were afraid would happen hes lost the use of his arm and will never be able to work again andrew expressed his sorrow he felt very sad that a wound which could have got better so easily had ruined evanss life after a short silence owen told them that he saw his purpose in life to make life happier for the miners of aberalaw he wanted to improve the medical services to build better houses and to make the mines themselves healthier and safer at this stage andrew told owen that he believed that the dust from a certain kind of coal caused lung disease these men work in the coal dust all day he said they breathe it into their lungs i may be wrong in my opinion but i dont think so what excites me is that nobody seems to have thought of this before he added eagerly owen leaned forward my goodness doctor this is really important they had a long discussion it was late when the secretary left as the front door closed behind owen andrew thought that man is my friend the news that the secretary had given his card to andrew spread quickly and helped to make the new doctor a little more popular one afternoon in december andrew was returning home he saw coming towards him a young man whom he recognized as richard vaughan a director of the aberalaw mining company he tried to avoid him but to his surprise vaughan called out in a friendly voice hullo youre the man who sent chenkin back to work arent you andrew stopped i would like to have seen old chenkins face vaughan laughed it didnt amuse me taking no notice of this remark vaughan said youre our nearest neighbours my wife will pay yours a visit now that you have settled in thanks andrew said coldly and walked away when he reached home he told christine about their meeting why was he so friendly its a mystery to me he said ive seen him pass llewellyn in the street without even looking at him perhaps he hopes to persuade me to send more men back to work at his mines oh andrew dont be so stupid said christine thats your great fault youre so suspicious of people i am suspicious of vayghan hes proud and he has too much money hes not sincere his wife wont come to see us but mrs vaughan did call on christine and christine enjoyed her visit ten days later mrs vaughan telephoned and invited them both to dinner andrew answered the telephone himself im sorry he said im afraid that we cant come i work at the surgery till nine oclock every evening but not on sunday her voice was warm and pleasant we shall expect you to dinner next sunday goodbye andrew ran back to christine these rich friends of yours have invited us to dinner we cant go now listen to me andrew manson christine said firmly you must not be so foolish were poor and everybody knows that we are but that doesnt matter the vaughans are rich but theyre kind and clever people why shouldnt we be friendly with them dont be ashamed of being poor they went to the vaughans on sunday and they received a warm welcome there were two other guests mr and mrs challis andrew who had never been in such a grand house before felt awkward at dinner a simple but good meal he sat next to mrs vaughan who tried to start a conversation by asking him how he considered that the medical services in aberalaw might be improved well i dont know he said as soup ran from his spoon on to the tablecloth i suppose he could not discuss even his favourite subject he looked down at his plate until to his relief mrs vaughan turned to talk to challis who had an important post at cardiff university christine was quite relaxed andrew saw her smiling at challis heard her take part in a most informed discussion it surprised him to hear how she argued with challis several times she tried to bring andrew into their discussion my husband is very interested in the coal miners mr challis hes doing some experiments on the breathing of coal dust oh yes said challis looking with interest towards manson isnt that so dear christine encouraged him oh i dont know andrew answered its of no importance he was angry with himself perhaps this man challis might have helped him for some strange reason he began to direct his anger towards christine as they walked home at the end of the evening he was silent christine remarked happily we did have a nice time didnt we love oh a very nice time andrew said bitterly next day his manner was the same then in the evening mrs vaughan sent christine some books and flowers and this kind act led to a quarrel look love christine cried isnt mrs vaughan kind andrew stiffened very kind books and flowers from the rich lady i suppose that you need these things to help you to live with me im too dull for you im not one of those clever people that you met last night im just a doctor andrew its true isnt it i could see by your behaviour at dinner last night youre tired of me already how can you say such a thing andrew ran from the room closing the door noisily behind him for five minutes he walked up and down the kitchen then suddenly he ran back to christine and took her into his arms chris my dear he cried im sorry forgive me im just a jealous fool i love you with all my heart they held each other tightly chapter fourteen fighting the system winter ended andrew now had the additional interest of his research into coal dust which he had begun by medically examining every miner on his list christine helped by writing notes for him her knowledge continued to surprise him as the hours of daylight grew longer christine without telling andrew began to make a garden with the help of an old miner one day when crossing the broken bridge andrew discovered them at work by the stream hey what are you doing he shouted from the bridge wait and see christine called back she made a neat little garden in a corner of the rough ground and a few weeks later she proudly led andrew by the arm and showed him her first flower on the last sunday in march without warning denny paid them a visit they were delighted to see him page is dead philip said as they sat down to lunch yes the poor man died a month ago miss page is going to marry your friend rees the bank manager there was a pause while they thought of edward page and how are you philip andrew asked at last oh i dont know i dont feel very content denny smiled drineffy seems a lonely place since you people left i think i shall go abroad for a time if i can find myself a post andrew was silent sad at the thought of this clever doctor wasting his life in this way they talked all afternoon and philip caught the last train back to drineffy when he had gone andrew realized how much he missed philips friendship they had shared the same ideas about the medical profession and had worked with the same aim but the other doctors at aberalaw seemed to have no aims at all urquhart though a kind man was old and had lost interest in his work medley had such a serious hearing problem that when his patients told him about their illnesses he never heard a word and so rather than risk giving them the wrong treatment he always gave them a bottle of some harmless medicine oxborrow was a bad doctor for whom there was no excuse he had so little confidence in himself that before treating the simplest case he would kneel by the patients bed and pray and in the end he usually made him worse and had to send for llewellyn there was no friendship between the doctors they did not like each other at all andrew wanted to improve relations to start a new system where the doctors would work together in a friendly spirit he also wanted to stop the unfair arrangement of paying part of their salaries to llewellyn he had made so many mistakes already that he did not dare to attempt this for the moment but then a week or two later he met con boland andrew had discovered a hole in his tooth and went to see the societys dentist as he walked up the path to bolands house he heard a loud hammering and saw through the open door of a wooden building a large man mending a car with a hammer at the same moment the man noticed him hullo he called out hullo andrew answered what do you want i want to make an appointment with the dentist im dr manson im the dentist boland laughed ive been doing some work on my old car he put on his coat come with me to the surgery and ill deal with your tooth at the surgery which was almost as dirty as the garage con filled the hole talking all the time he had not washed his hands he was a careless pleasant man who enjoyed life after filling the tooth he threw his instruments into a bowl of water and invited andrew to tea id like you to meet my family he said bolands wife and five children the oldest of whom was called mary were already having their tea when con and andrew entered the living room this room was also untidy the childrens toys were scattered all over the floor after they had been introduced mrs boland said i meant to call on mrs manson doctor but ive been so busy con burst into loud laughter busy she hadnt a good enough dress to wear thats what she means he turned to andrew we are poor manson we earn very little money and of course we have to give some of it to the big chief who whos the big chief andrew asked llewellyn of course he takes money from me as well as from you but why youre a dentist not a doctor oh he examines a patient for me occasionally listen boland andrew said quickly this arrangement is not fair why dont we refuse to pay eh lets get together and break off this agreement with llewellyn andrew suggested we can ask the other doctors to join in with us too con gave andrew his hand manson ill support you well work together andrew raced home to christine chris chris ive met such a nice man a dentist listen dear were going to do battle with llewellyn he laughed excitedly the following day andrew discussed his plan with owen who was sympathetic he then persuaded urquhart oxborrow and medley to come to his house that evening having made his arrangements andrew suddenly decided to warn llewellyn he spoke to llewellyn at the hospital look here dr llewellyn he said its only fair to tell you that we doctors object to paying you part of our salaries i intend to suggest that we stop these payments were going to meet at my house tonight to discuss the matter before llewellyn could reply andrew turned and left the room the meeting began at nine oclock gentlemen said andrew our system here is all wrong we are all members of the same medical society but instead of helping each other we are always quarrelling the result is that we give ourselves additional work and we are not making the most of our skills theres no organization in our profession we should change our system work out some plan that will help us all he paused to watch their faces and we should also refuse to pay money to llewellyn it isnt fair i spoke to owen about it he says that this is not a rule of the committee but a private arrangement between llewellyn and ourselves thats correct urquhart agreed the arrangement was made nine years ago two doctors at the east surgery kept asking llewellyn to examine their patients so one day he called us all together and said that he refused to see any more of our cases unless we agreed to pay him part of our salaries thats how it started but its llewellyns duty as head doctor to examine our patients when we need his advice his own salary is meant to cover work of this nature why should we pay him as well andrew asked angrily i agree i agree said con oxborrow now spoke remember this dr llewellyn is always prepared to take over our difficult cases andrew looked at him with scorn do you want him to take over your difficult cases of course said oxborrow who doesnt i dont andrew shouted i want to cure them myself i oxborrows right medley interrupted the most important thing in medical practice manson is to get rid of ones difficult cases what a suggestion andrew said angrily the discussion continued for nearly an hour andrew then repeated we must refuse to pay llewellyn knows that we intend to refuse i told him so this afternoon what shouted the three doctors you told llewellyn of course i did he must know some time if we stand firm together were certain to win you had no right to tell him urquhart shouted llewellyn has great influence we may be dismissed he got up and walked towards the door youre a nice man manson but you have no common sense good night medley and oxborrow followed him leaving con and andrew alone in the room andrew opened some bottles of drink and with this to comfort them they sat down and discussed the stupidity and weakness of the other three doctors they talked for so long that they did not hear christine come in and go to bed next morning andrew had a bad headache while walking down the street to see a patient he passed llewellyn in his car llewellyn smiled at him chapter fifteen a new qualification andrew felt very miserable on sunday morning while lying in bed he suddenly shouted at christine i dont mind about the money its the idea of making these payments that angers me why cant i forget about it why dont i like llewellyn i think you are jealous of llewellyn said christine what andrew shouted why should i be jealous of him because hes very good at his work and well because hes a better qualified doctor than you are god now i know what you really think of me he jumped out of bed and began to walk about the room what do qualifications matter well love you dont want to remain here all your life do you if you had a good degree it would help you to get a better post andrew swung round chris youre right he thought for a moment but no it isnt possible to take a degree i should have to learn some foreign languages christine ran up and kissed him you would only need a little knowledge of the languages and i could help you remember your wife was once a schoolteacher they made plans excitedly all day and that evening christine gave andrew his first lessons she helped him every evening andrew studied to such a late hour each night that when he went to bed he was often too tired to sleep he lost weight and became thinner in the face but chris was always there to comfort and encourage him by august which was a very hot month andrew was ready to do some practical work in medicine this presented another difficulty where could he get this experience it was christine who thought of challis and his important post at cardiff university when andrew wrote to him challis immediately agreed to let him work at the university you were quite right chris andrew said it is nice to have friends and i didnt want to go to the vaughans that night when we met challis andrew bought himself an old motorcycle there were three afternoon hours during which andrew was not on duty so on those days after lunch he rode kilometres to cardiff worked at the university for one hour and then rode back again the work and the long journey in the heat made him so tired that he was almost ill at last he had covered every subject in which he would be examined he went alone to london to sit for his degree now that the event was so near andrew felt that he knew nothing but when his examination began he wrote and wrote never looking at the clock on the second day he was examined by two doctors in turn on the practical work of medicine andrew found himself fearing this even more than he had feared the written papers his first examiner dr gadsby looked at him coldly and then asked him six questions five of these andrew answered correctly but the sixth he could not answer appearing to lose his patience gadsby repeated the question several times then without a word he passed him on to the second examiner sir robert abbey andrew crossed the room with a pale face he felt certain that he had failed already he raised his eyes and saw robert abbey smiling at him whats the matter asked abbey nothing sir andrew answered slowly i dont think that dr gadsby was very pleased with my answers thats all dont worry abbey comforted him though abbey was now one of the most famous doctors in europe he remembered his own early struggles and therefore felt great sympathy for andrew he began in a friendly manner to question andrew his questions at first simple gradually became more difficult but andrew encouraged by abbeys pleasant manner answered well abbey then asked him a question about a condition of the body called aneurism do you know the history of aneurism pare andrew answered is supposed to have been the first man to discover the condition abbeys face expressed surprise why do you say supposed dr manson pare did discover aneurism andrew reddened well sir the medical books say so but i dont think that theyre correct when i was studying for my degree i read a long description of aneurism in a book that was written years before pare lived abbey looked at andrew with a strange expression dr manson he said you are the first person in an examination who has ever told me something which i did not know well done andrew turned red again now just answer one more question abbey ended what do you consider the most important rule for a doctor andrew thought for a moment i suppose never to believe anything till it is proved thank you dr manson at last it was over at four oclock in the afternoon abbey came to him smiling and told him that he had passed he had done it he had got his degree he ran down to the nearest post office and sent a message with the great news to christine chapter sixteen accident at the mine when his train reached aberalaw it was nearly midnight as andrew was walking home a miner called frank davis ran up to him crying doctor youre wanted whats wrong shouted andrew theres been an accident at the mine a man is almost buried under the coal its sam bevan one of your patients come quickly doctor i shall need my bag andrew said run to my house and get it ill go straight to the mine andrew reached the mine in four minutes the manager and three men were waiting for him its a terrible accident said the manager nobody has been killed but one of the men is trapped we cant move him and theres a danger that more coal will fall at that moment davis ran up to them with his bag without delay the small party began to go slowly down into the deep and dangerous mine the passage to the mine was so narrow that andrew and the other four men had to creep forward on their hands and knees for nearly a kilometre at last they reached the scene of the accident heres the doctor get back and give him room to move the manager ordered the three men who had been trying to get bevan out they pulled themselves back and andrew crept forward bevan tried to smile at manson well im giving you a good chance to test your skill by the light of the managers lamp andrew examined the trapped man the whole of bevans body was free except for his left arm which was buried under a heavy pile of coal and badly damaged andrew saw at once that the only way to free bevan was to cut off his arm bevan read andrews decision in his face go on then doctor he said bravely cut it off i can bear it just get me out of here as quickly as you can dont worry sam andrew said im going to put you to sleep now when you wake up you will be in bed kneeling in a pool of water andrew took off his coat and placed it under bevans head then he opened his bag but he was shocked to discover that the bottle that he needed was broken he could not put bevan to sleep andrew trembled for perhaps seconds he could not decide what to do then he quickly pulled out another bottle and gave bevan something to reduce the pain shut your eyes sam he said as the knife cut into him bevan gave a loud cry of pain he cried out again then when the knife touched the bone he fainted andrew could not see what he was doing in this hole deep down beneath the ground he had never worked in such difficult conditions before he would never be able to cut through the bone at any moment the coal would crash down on them and kill them all oh god would he never finish in the end he almost cried with relief he put a bandage over the wound and lifting himself onto his knees said take him out fortyfive metres away with more room to move and four lamps round him he treated the wound more thoroughly finished wrap him up warmly andrew ordered the miners slowly gently they carried bevan out of the mine when they had struggled along for about metres they heard a long loud crash of falling coal in the darkness behind them thats it the manager said to andrew it took them nearly an hour to reach the surface there they found a crowd of women waiting anxiously suddenly andrew heard a voice desperately calling his name the next moment christine threw her arms round his neck crying loudly whats the matter andrew asked surprised holding on to him like a drowning woman she said they told us that the coal had crashed down on you that you wouldnt couldnt come out alive chapter seventeen christmas the saving of sam bevan greatly increased andrews popularity he received smiles from people who had taken no notice of him before medical cards began to come back to him owen was delighted didnt i tell you that this would happen he said andrews new degree also improved his position in the town denny now abroad did not yet know about his success but freddie hamson wrote to andrew to say how pleased he was its a pity that we never see freddie nowadays andrew remarked to christine hasnt he written a nice letter yes very nice but most of it is about himself christine replied the next few weeks passed very happily on the evening before christmas andrew returned home from the surgery with a pleasant feeling of peace and goodwill as he entered the house he saw at once that christine had the same feeling shut your eyes and come with me she said holding out her hand she led him into the kitchen where on the table lay a number of packages each with a little note andrew realized at once that these were presents from his patients look andrew christine cried a chicken and two ducks and a lovely cake and a bottle of wine isnt it kind of them isnt it nice that they want to give you these presents for a moment he could not speak this generous sign that the people of aberalaw had begun to like him touched him deeply walking up and down the kitchen he said thats how poor people should always pay their doctor chris no money no bills if a patient is poor let him give the doctor something that he can afford if every doctor stopped thinking about how much money he could make the whole system would be better yes dear next morning christmas day was fine and bright after breakfast andrew went out to see his patients dinners were cooking in all the little houses and his own was cooking at home in every street people called out happy christmas doctor their cheerful behaviour so different from that of a year ago made andrew very happy except for chenkin whom he did not want the only patient who had not come back to him was tom evans andrew suddenly decided to call on evans and wish him a happy christmas after knocking once he opened the front door and walked straight into the kitchen there he had a shock the kitchen was almost empty and evans was sitting on a broken chair in front of a miserable fire that gave no heat on his knee sat his little girl who was four years old suddenly evans turned and saw andrew an expression of shame and anger spread across his face andrew saw that evans was ashamed at being found in such a state by the doctor whose advice he had refused andrew felt sad and awkward he wanted to turn and go away but at that moment mrs evans entered the kitchen she was so surprised to see andrew that she cried out whats the matter sir he hasnt done anything wrong has he mrs evans andrew replied looking down at the floor i would like us to be friends its christmas and well i would be so pleased if the three of you would come round and help us to eat our christmas dinner but doctor she began you be quiet evans interrupted her angrily we dont want help from anybody what do you mean im inviting you as a friend said andrew eat your christmas dinner yourself evans shouted we dont want it andrew turned to mrs evans you persuade him mrs evans i shall be really sorry if you dont come well expect you at half past one before either of them could reply he left the house the evans family arrived washed and brushed and looking very uncomfortable at first it seemed as if the christmas dinner would be a failure but then by good fortune andrew accidentally upset his soup on to the table there was a silence then the little girl burst out laughing the next minute they were all laughing after the meal christine led mrs evans and the child into the living room leaving andrew alone with evans the two men sat in silence for a time then andrew said im sorry about your arm tom youre not as sorry as i am evans replied there was a pause then andrew continued will you allow me to speak to mr vaughan about you i have a little influence with him and i feel certain that i could persuade him to find you some easier work to do evans did not answer he said nothing he was in tears his whole body was shaking at half past three the evans family left and christine and andrew went into the living room you know chris andrew said that poor man lost the use of his arm because of oxborrow hes the man to blame when evans left me he went to oxborrow who gave him the wrong treatment oxborrow knows nothing nothing there ought to be a law to andrew dear christine smiled at him from her chair do stop talking about your work i want to tell you something important yes she laughed silently come over here he sat on the chair beside her well what is this great news she gave another little laugh andrew im going to have a baby a baby really you mean yes ive been trying to tell you all day chapter eighteen the rotten bridge spring came again the garden was bright with the flowers that christine had planted in the autumn now andrew would allow her to do no more work youve made the garden now sit in it he ordered her excited at the thought of becoming a father andrew suddenly decided to ask dr llewellyn to attend his wife at the birth of the baby llewellyn when andrew telephoned him seemed pleased i shall be glad to help you manson i didnt think that you liked me enough to ask me to do this i promise to do my best for now i think that it would do your wife good to have a short holiday acting on llewellyns advice christine went to stay with an aunt andrew missed her even more than he had expected to do he spent one or two evenings with the bolands and the vaughans but most evenings he continued with his research into coal dust he made a discovery which excited him greatly standing in front of the dead fire long after midnight he suddenly seized christines photograph and cried chris i believe that i am going to do something important christine returned at the end of june oh it is nice to be home again she said throwing her arms round him then as she looked into his face her expression changed andrew dear you look tired i dont believe that you have been eating properly she was worried about him andrew told her about the developments in his research how long is this going to take you she asked i dont know it may take a year or it may take five years well in that case you will have to work to a system keep regular hours and not stay up too late wearing yourself out theres nothing the matter with me but christine was firm every evening while andrew worked she sat in his work room reading then at oclock she would rise from her chair and say time for bed oh not yet you go up chris ill follow you in a minute andrew manson if you think that im going to bed alone in my state of health these last words a joke about the baby that she was expecting always ended the argument with a laugh he would stretch himself and put away his microscope towards the end of july andrew became particularly busy with his practice one afternoon as he walked up the road feeling very tired he saw dr llewellyns car outside his gate thinking that perhaps the baby had been born early he ran home burst into the house and said eagerly hullo llewellyn i i didnt expect to see you here so soon no llewellyn answered andrew smiled well llewellyn did not smile i have been trying to find you all morning he said is anything wrong llewellyn looked through the window towards the old bridge in the garden manson he said gently this morning when your wife was walking over that bridge a piece of wood broke she fell she is all right quite all right but i am afraid that the baby andrew understood even before llewellyn finished we did everything that we could llewellyn continued in a voice of deep sympathy i came at once and brought a nurse from the hospital weve been here all day there was silence andrew covered his eyes with his hands and cried to himself nobody is to blame it was an accident llewellyn tried to comfort him now go upstairs and see your wife his head lowered andrew went upstairs outside the door of the bedroom he paused breathing heavily then he went inside chapter nineteen experiments by the year opinions about dr manson were rather mixed in aberalaw his practice was not large but all his patients had the greatest confidence in him he rarely gave medicines but when he did do so he gave the newest best and often the most expensive medicines on the market by his use of modern medicines manson once prevented a serious disease from spreading through the town although the rest of the area suffered badly the committee of the medical society ought to have been grateful to manson but a few of its members led by chenkin were jealous of his success though manson had many friends he also had enemies andrew sometimes asked himself why he and christine had remained in aberalaw after the death of their child his coal dust research was the only reason for staying he could not leave the mines until he had completed that he now had a great deal of important information about the effect of coal dust on the miners lungs but in order to prove his facts he decided to do a few tests on small animals to study the action of the dust on their lungs here his real troubles began taking care to cause the animals as little pain as possible andrew did some extremely successful tests which proved all his beliefs he felt proud and excited but then a few days later he had a shock when andrew returned home from work he found christine looking worried whats the matter he asked her she looked at him unhappily i had some visitors today oh who were they five members of the committee including chenkin they had heard about your tests on the animals and wanted to see your work room i told them that you were not at home but they pushed me out of the way and rushed into your room when they saw what was in there one of the men shouted oh the poor animals i tried to tell them that they had not suffered but they refused to listen they put the animals in a bag and took them away what andrew shouted he thought for a minute and then went into the hall to use the telephone but just as he reached it the telephone bell rang hullo he said angrily then his voice changed it was owen look here owen i know i know owen interrupted this is a bad business ill come along to see you now owen came before andrew could speak he said did you get permission andrew looked at him in surprise permission for what to do tests on animals good heavens no i never thought about it im afraid that there will be trouble owen said some members of the committee feel very bitter about you but dont worry everything will be allright in the end owen went away the following evening andrew received a letter ordering him to attend an inquiry to be held by the committee a week later the news that there was to be an inquiry caused a lot of discussion in aberalaw fights broke out between andrews friends and his enemies andrew himself felt tired angry and worried on sunday afternoon he presented himself before the committee a large crowd was waiting in the street when andrew entered the offices and walked up the narrow stairs to the committee room which also was packed with people the inquiry began with an angry speech by chenkin who shouted that andrew had broken the law by doing tests on animals without permission and should be reported for this crime here owen interrupted i must warn the committee that if we report dr manson for this the whole committee may run into trouble what do you mean chenkin asked as dr manson is employed by us owen explained we are responsible in law for his actions there were cries of owens right we dont want any trouble never mind about the permission then shouted chenkin there are many other complaints against him yes yes someone at the back called out remember all those afternoons that he wasted riding about on his motorcycle he wont give medicines came another voice all these complaints chenkin shouted prove that dr manson has served us badly we demand that he gives up his job chenkin looked round at his friends and sat down to loud cheers perhaps you will now allow dr manson to speak owen said and turned to andrew there was a silence andrew sat still for a moment the situation was worse than he had expected he rose to his feet he was not a good speaker but he was angry now he began what i have been doing wasnt cruel why do you men take mice and birds down the mines to see if gas is present when these mice and birds are killed by the gas do you call that cruelty no of course you dont you realize that these tests with animals save mens lives your lives well that is what i have been trying to do for you for three years i have been doing research into the diseases that you get from the dust in the mines i have made a discovery that may improve your conditions of work a discovery that will keep you in good health better than botdes of medicine can do you dont believe me you think that i lie to you but this will show you what other people think of my experiments people who are able to judge he took a letter from his pocket and handed it to owen it was from a university in scotland offering him another medical degree in recognition of his important coal dust discoveries owen read the letter gave a sudden smile of relief and then passed it round to the members of the committee after a few more remarks he said perhaps you will leave us now doctor please when andrew returned to the committee room everyone except for chenkin seemed to be more friendly owen stood up and said im glad to tell you dr manson that the committee has decided to ask you to remain he had won but his victory gave andrew no satisfaction the committee expected him to be pleased but instead he said thank you mr owen im glad that the committee wishes me to stay but i am afraid that i cannot do so i give the committee a months notice from today he spoke without feeling and then walked out of the room there was silence then chenkin called out hell be no loss owen now lost his temper be quiet chenkin he shouted we have lost the best man weve ever had chapter twenty an offer of work andrew woke up in the middle of that night calling out am i a fool chris she comforted him in the darkness no we dont want to stay in wales for the rest of our lives dear weve been happy here but its time for us to move on but chris we cant afford to buy a practice yet we ought to save some more money before we leave here what does money matter she answered in a sleepy voice her confidence gave him courage next morning the world seemed a cheerful place he had no need to worry about the risk that he was taking he now had a degree and over three hundred pounds in the bank they would never be hungry now that he was to leave everybody wanted him to stay a week after the inquiry owen and two or three members of the committee called at his house and asked andrew to change his mind but he refused reports of his coal dust discoveries had recently been printed in a number of medical papers in england and america a few days later as a result of these reports andrew received several letters one letter was from challis who asked andrew to visit him that week andrew lost the letter and forgot to answer it another letter interested him more this pleases me chris its from an american named stillman he told her yes is he a doctor she asked no not really he runs a small hospital in america where he treats people for diseases of the lung the medical profession refuses to recognize him but stillman is a good man very clever at his work ill tell you about him some time he sat down and replied to stillman immediately as he still neglected to answer challis andrew soon received a second letter from him this stated that the coal and mines board having read about his coal dust experiments wished andrew to be their medical officer when christine read the letter she said happily didnt i tell you that something like this would happen isnt it good yes lovely andrew went straight to the post office and sent a message to challis accepting the offer chapter twenty one the coal and mines board the offices of the coal and mines board were in a large stone building in the centre of london on a bright morning in august andrew ran up the steps of this building in high spirits im the new medical officer he told the man at the door yes sir said the man mr gill is expecting you jones take our new doctor to mr gills room andrew was led into a large sunny room where mr gill a cheerful little man shook hands with him and said please sit down would you like a cup of tea while they drank their tea gill made some remarks about the weather then he led andrew to his room which was also sunny with a view of the river i i hope you will like this room gill said with a smile oh yes its a beautiful room now ill introduce you to your secretary miss mason gill took him into the next room where miss mason a friendly young woman sat at a small desk miss mason this is dr manson good morning dr manson they had a short conversation and then andrew returned to his own room where gill remarked ill send you some reports to read a pile of reports arrived andrew read these dull accounts of meetings of the board as quickly as he could and then went to gill and asked when can i start work gill was surprised at his question heavens have you read those reports already i thought that i had given you enough to keep you busy for a month he looked at his watch lets go out its time for lunch at lunch gill explained that the board would not meet again till the middle of september and that there would be no other work for andrew until after that meeting andrew went back to christine that evening with a feeling of disappointment would you believe it chris he said theyre not ready for me for a whole month i shall have nothing to do except to read reports and drink tea never mind said christine her thoughts on other things its lovely here much nicer than aberalaw i went for a walk this afternoon oh i planned such lovely things for us to do he had rarely seen her so excited my love lets go out to dinner then if youre not too tired we might go to the theatre as she led him to the door he laughed i need some entertainment after my first days hard work next morning he read every report again then he began to explore the building suddenly he found himself in a long room where a young man in a dirty white coat was sitting on a box smoking a pipe and doing nothing hullo andrew said the other answered tiredly lost your way andrew introduced himself my names manson i thought so so youve come to join the forgotten men he paused im dr hope what are you doing here heaven knows some of the time i sit here and think but most of the time i just sit occasionally when there has been an explosion they send me bits of a dead miner to examine and tell me to find out the cause of the accident they went out to lunch together hope then told andrew more about his duties and about the members of the board three of whom were challis abbey and gadsby do you know gadsby hope asked ive met the gentleman andrew told hope about his examination gadsby is a clever man but hes only interested in himself hope who had a great sense of fun laughed suddenly and then told andrew a joke that abbey had once made about gadsby he gave another loud laugh and then became serious abbey is the best man on the board the others spend so much time quarrelling that they never make any decisions andrew and hope had lunch together nearly every day although hope was always joking he was a clever young man andrew believed that one day he might do something important while andrew waited for the next meeting of the board he and christine explored london they began to feel that they belonged there chapter twenty two measuring bandages at last on the afternoon of september th the board met sitting beside gill and hope andrew watched the members enter the long room gentlemen the president addressed the meeting we are pleased to welcome our new medical officer dr manson has made some important discoveries and we must give him every opportunity to develop his research we wish him gentlemen to visit the mines and examine the miners in many parts of the country we will give him all the help that we can including the skilled services of our young friend dr hope andrew drew one quick breath this was better than he had expected but gentlemen the president continued before dr manson starts this work i think that he should attend to another and more urgent matter i think that first he should make a study of the medical materials used for accidents in mines for example there is no fixed standard for the width of bandages i feel that dr manson should inquire into this matter and make a report suggesting the best width and length of bandage for each of the most common forms of accident silence andrew looked desperately round the table surely sir this this bandage question is of little importance abbey argued dr manson it is certainly not of little importance the government has asked for this report excuse me sir andrew interrupted i i understood that i was to do medical work here for a month i have been wasting my time doing nothing now if you expect me to he stopped and looked at them it was abbey who helped him dr mansons argument is very reasonable for four years he has worked patiently at his research and now after offering him the opportunity to work on this further you want to send him out to measure bandages if dr manson has been patient for four years he can be patient for a little longer the president laughed after the meeting andrew discussed the matter with gill and hope it wont take you long only about six months gill comforted him then you can begin your work on the coal dust he wont get the chance hope laughed hell be measuring bandages for the rest of his life oh very funny andrew picked up his hat and went home to christine he bought an old car and on the following monday he and christine began their tour of the coal mines anyway at least we are together chris andrew remarked the work was very simple andrew examined the medical supplies at several hundred mines and then returned to london and wrote his report the coal and mines board sent this report to an important member of the government who at once asked andrew to call at his office your report is excellent manson he told him the government intends to introduce a new law controlling the use of medical supplies in mines and factories we shall base this law on your report but there is one suggestion that i would like you to change i think that a narrower bandage would be better than the size you suggest dont you agree andrew was angry personally i prefer the bigger bandage but i really dont think that it makes much difference what no difference no no difference at all you treat this matter very lightly dont you realize how important this is andrew lost his temper have you ever been down a mine i have ive done a bloody operation lying in a pool of water with only one small lamp and no room to move and i tell you this the size of the bandage is of no importance andrew left the building more quickly than he had entered when he returned to his office at the coal and mines board he stood for some time looking out of the window i dont belong here he thought im a doctor not a clerk towards the end of may he informed the board that he was leaving gill tried to persuade him to stay but hope said dont listen to him youre lucky i shall leave as soon as i can find another post if i dont go mad first several months later the government acting on information supplied by dr gadsby publicly declared that coal dust was the cause of a dangerous disease next day the newspapers praised gadsby for his useful work and described him as a great doctor chapter twenty three andrews first practice andrew and christine began to search for a practice they sold their car to add to their savings they now had six hundred pounds but it appeared that this was not enough money with which to buy a practice in london then when they had almost lost hope andrew heard that a doctor in the paddington area of london had died and that his practice was for sale at a price which they could just afford when they went to see the large cold house that would be their home they were disappointed its in a miserable are said andrew then suddenly becoming more cheerful he added but there are nice houses in the neighbourhood what do you think chris shall we take a chance and buy it christine was doubtful she was tired of london now she hated this cold house and the dirty streets she wanted to go back to the country but andrew seemed so anxious to buy a practice in london that she let him have his wish all right she said buy the practice if you would like to he bought the practice and in october he and christine moved into their new home weve spent everything chris you must be very careful with the money andrew warned her to his surprise she burst into tears careful arent i always careful chris whats the matter with you oh i hate this house its so dark and dirty i but chris its the practice thats important not the house he held her in his arms and tried to comfort her next morning at nine oclock he opened his surgery his heart was beating fast with excitement half past nine came he waited anxiously it was nearly oclock now and still no patient had arrived suddenly the surgery bell rang and an old woman walked in she had a bad cough andrew examined her and then gave her a bottle of medicine for which she paid him a small amount andrew felt as excited as if this was the first money that he had ever earned he ran to christine and showed her the coins first patient chris this money will buy our lunch that evening three patients came to his surgery but on the following day he received no patients and on the next day he earned less than a pound andrew began to ask himself if he had made a bad mistake in buying this practice he and christine were so poor that sometimes they did not have enough to eat they went to a cheap food shop owned by a fat little german woman who called herself mrs smith for their meals mrs smith liked them and was kind to them she became very fond of christine and one day she said to andrew you will be all right you will succeed you have a good wife dont worry i will send you patients they tried to pretend that their struggles were amusing but never had they known such hard times chapter twenty four andrew decides to succeed andrew felt a great desire for the friendship of another doctor denny was abroad having taken a post with an oil company and hope was now working in the north of england so andrew decided to telephone freddie hamson this is manson andrew manson ive bought a practice in london he told him manson in london good heavens man why didnt you telephone me before oh ive been too busy andrew smiled to himself im married now freddie so am i we must meet at once can you come to dinner on thursday good christine expressed no pleasure when andrew told her of the invitation you go alone andrew she suggested oh nonsense i know that you dont like freddie very much but therell be other people there as well probably other doctors when they arrived at hamsons grand house on thursday night freddie greeted them most warmly its lovely to see you people again how do you like my house old man didnt i tell you that i would succeed it looked a most expensive house andrew was about to express his admiration when mrs hamson entered almost at once the other guests arrived introductions followed with much talk and laughter then they went into dinner a good meal with expensive food and drink after two glasses of wine andrew felt very happy he listened with interest when ivory and deedman two wellknown and successful doctors talked loudly about their medical experiences he said to himself i must get to know these men better theyre so rich and successful i played a clever trick the other day said ivory i persuaded a patient to have a course of treatments i told him that the usual charge for this was fifty pounds but that i would be willing to reduce the price to fortyfive pounds if he paid me immediately he gave me a cheque at once thats the way to make money freddie laughed and a bottle of medicine would have done him just as much good ivory smiled yes and the price of the medicine is under a pound most people remarked deedman do not realize how little these treatments really cost the important thing is to make them think that they are expensive ivory and hamson agreed exactly the more you charge a patient the more confidence he has in you they continued to talk in this manner after dinner andrew listened smoked and drank they all drank they brought andrew into their conversation and when christine said that it was time to go home ivory remarked warmly if at any time you would like my advice about a case manson let me know i shall always be pleased to help óîu andrew thanked him and walked with an unsteady step to the door on their way home he said happily chris weve had a lovely time havent we she answered coldly weve had a terrible time i like denny and hope but not those people why what do you mean whats wrong with everything the food the furniture the way they talked money is all that they think about mistaking her remark for jealousy andrew cried out ill make money for you chris i dont want money she said but my dear he tried to put his arm round her dont i love you andrew but not when youve drunk too much andrew said no more but when he went to bed that night he promised himself i will make money im going to succeed too next morning andrew looked up the qualifications of ivory deedman and hamson in a medical book to his surprise he discovered that these rich doctors did not have the qualifications he did i can do better than they are doing he said to himself andrew made a sudden decision to find himself a parttime post at a london hospital as such appointments were not easy to find he went to see sir robert abbey i will do my best to help you abbey promised him the victoria chest hospital would be the best for you i will make some inquiries ahdrew went home feeling very pleased ive just seen abbey he told christine hes going to try to get me a post at the victoria hospital a hospital appointment would improve my position greatly the pleasure in her eyes made him feel sorry ive been very badtempered recendy chris will you forgive me he asked she ran to him saying that it had been her fault andrew now worked with increased determination feeling sure that he would soon have some good luck slowly his practice improved but he still had many disappointments some of his cases were serious needing admission to hospital at once yet andrew could rarely persuade any hospital to admit even the most dangerous case dr who they would ask when he telephoned who no no sorry we have no empty beds one day andrew went to christine complaining theyve plenty of beds for their own doctors if they dont know a doctor they refuse to admit his patients this is london this is our hospital system its terrible he was still waiting to hear from abbey about the hospital appointment he was also disappointed that he had not heard from hamson or his friends since their dinner feeling rather miserable he sat in his surgery one evening towards the end of april thinking about his future it was nearly nine oclock and he was about to lock the door for the night when a young woman entered what is your trouble he asked her she smiled and sat down mrs smith in the little food shop advised me to come to you doctor she said i work at a large dress shop my name is miss cramb i am having trouble with my hands i have been to several doctors in this area but they have not been able to cure me he looked at her hands which were very red and sore with sudden interest he examined them more closely they make it difficult for me to work she said ive tried various medicines but they have done no good no they wouldnt he said you are suffering from a rather rare skin disease medicines are useless for this disease it is caused by the food you eat well no doctor has told me that before he laughed and wrote out a list of the foods that she must avoid she took the list saying ill take your advice doctor ill try anything she paid andrew for his services and left ten days later she returned look at my hands now doctor cured i am so grateful to you thats all right andrew answered awkwardly she rose perhaps one day i shall be able to prove to you that i am grateful she said he smiled and showed her to the door chapter twenty five new patients miss crambs cure caused surprise and excitement at her dress shop she advised the other girls working there to go to andrew and they ah took her advice anxious to see what this great doctor was like at least six or seven girls who had nothing really the matter with them attended his surgery every evening their visits greatly increased andrews profits but miss cramb was only beginning to express her thanks in the first week of june andrew received a letter asking him to call at the home of a miss everett a rich woman who lived in a very expensive part of london this is my chance at last he told himself when closing his surgery early he left home to visit miss everett the servant who opened the door led him into a large beadtifully decorated room where miss everett a woman of about fifty was waiting for him she gave him one look and then came straight to the point my doctor has died its a pity because i trusted him completely miss cramb suggested you to me i looked up your qualifications youre well qualified she paused and took another look at him i think that perhaps you might be the doctor for me i always have treatment for hay fever at this time of year you understand hay fever i suppose yes he answered which treatment do you have she mentioned the name of a wellknown cure my last doctor advised it it has been very helpful andrew wanted to tell her that this treatment was useless but decided that this would be foolish he could not risk losing this chance to make money he said then i will give you the same treatment miss everett good i suggest that i pay you a pound for each visit do you agree to this arrangement a pound a visit he had never been paid so much before the idea of giving a treatment in which he did not believe no longer worried him what did it matter if it was useless he was tired of failure he wanted to succeed and he would succeed he visited miss everett again the following day at oclock he then called twice a week after each treatment they would talk together for perhaps half an hour andrew told miss everett of his desire for success and she encouraged him on his last visit she gave him a glass of wine and paid him a cheque for twelve pounds for his services she then led him to the front door and stood for a moment looking at him will you take the advice of a woman who is old enough to be your mother she said get yourself a good suit you say that you wish to succeed you will never be successful in those clothes he walked down the road feeling hurt and angry but his annoyance soon passed shes quite right he thought how can i attract highclass patients if i wear clothes like these when he reached home he excitedly showed christine his cheque look at that woman this is real money what a well qualified doctor ought to has twelve pounds just for talking nicely to miss everett and giving her the etreatment whats that she asked smiling then suddenly she was doubtful havent i heard you say that that treatment is useless his expression changed she had made the one remark that he did not wish to hear youre never satisfied he shouted and went out of the room the next day he went to a good shop and bought himself two new suits of clothes he felt a little awkward when for the first time he came down to breakfast wearing one of these suits christine was pouring out his coffee when he appeared for a moment she was too surprised to speak andrew she cried you look lovely are you going somewhere going somewhere im going to visit my patients of course well do you like it yes its its very nice but she smiled but it makes you look so strange you prefer me to dress badly do you he finished in silence and then left the room to start his work three weeks later he had reason to be glad that he had bought these suits because miss everett then sent for him to attend a relative and a friend both of whom wanted the same hay fever treatment andrew gave them the treatment without feeling at all guilty actually he felt very pleased with himself he was winning his desire for success made him forget the bitter things that he used to say about other doctors who behaved in this way he forgot too that this improvement in his affairs had been started by a fat little german woman in a cheap food shop soon another exciting opportunity was offered to him one afternoon when he was counting the money that he had earned during the last month the telephone rang oh dr manson said a voice this is mr winch the manager of the dress shop in which your patient miss cramb works a lady has been taken ill in the shop will you come at once please ill be there in four minutes andrew promised him he was met at the shop by miss cramb who explained its miss le roy i advised mr winch to send for you at that moment mr winch himself appeared oh doctor im so pleased to see you come this way doctor he led andrew into a small room where miss le roy was lying on the floor shouting and crying she was about twentyfour with blue eyes and fair hair andrew knelt down beside her on the other side of her knelt another woman oh toppy toppy the woman kept saying this is a serious case andrew said can you get me a chair please slowly and very gently andrew lifted miss le roy who was still shouting on to the chair he held her head and said a few words quietly to her then suddenly he hit her on the face immediately toppy stopped shouting andrew hit her a second time then he turned to her friend and explained sorry it was the only thing to do she might have done herself harm if she had continued like that for any longer shell be all right in a few minutes i must take her home said her friend will you come with us very well andrew agreed they took miss le roy home by car her house surprised andrew he had never entered such a grand building before toppy threw herself down on to a comfortable chair and said to her friend ring the bell dear i want a drink thank heavens father isnt at home a servant brought in somedrinks when he had gone toppys friend smiled at andrew and said im mrs lawrence i think that i had better explain what happened doctor toppy had an argument about a dress that she had ordered shes been feeling very tired of late and is rather quick to quarrel she paused we are very grateful to you doctor toppy looked at andrew i went mad doctor didnt i go on doctor say that i went mad laugh it was very funny i didnt think it funny andrew spoke quickly feeling that he too should explain himself you had a bad attack i am sorry that i had to hit you there was a pause andrew had finished his drink well he said awkwardly i must get back to my work send for your own doctor tomorrow goodbye mrs lawrence led him into the hall she was tall dark and quite young she gave him her hand and said with a smile i admired your form of treatment i can see that one day you will be a great success walking down the street andrew noticed to his surprise that it was nearly five oclock he had spent three hours in the company of these two women he would be able to charge a high price for his services a very high price chapter twenty six the nursing home on the following morning when andrew was about to visit some of his poor patients mrs lawrence telephoned and asked him in a most friendly manner to call on toppy again andrew went straight to the house here he met mr le roy who looked at him quickly and said listen doctor im in a hurry youre a clever young man well then cure my girl stop all her stupid nonsense her crying and shouting about nothing give her the best treatment i can afford it goodbye when andrew went upstairs he found mrs lawrence waiting for him outside toppys room every day frances lawrence was present at the time of his visit her quiet gentle manner attracted andrew although he did not realize it she soon began to influence some of his actions she suggested that he should buy a car for his work andrew made no mention of this to christine but he began to ask himself how any doctor could develop a highclass practice without a car a man in his position must not be seen walking down the street carrying his own bag he could not afford to buy a car in one payment but he could spread out his payments over two or three years any garage would agree to that arrangement three weeks later andrew drove home in an expensive new car he ran into the house and called out christine christine come and see something he had meant to surprise her and he succeeded andrew is this ours oh what a beauty he smiled at her step inside lady and ill take you for a drive she admired the car again and again as he drove her through the streets they went out together so rarely now that she made the most of every minute she said happily now perhaps we can drive into the country on sundays oh that would be so nice the suggestion annoyed andrew oh all right i suppose so he answered but we cant make a habit of driving into the country the car is for work not for pleasure they drove home in silence on thursday as he was leaving the le roys house andrew met freddie hamson hullo hamson he said freddie looked at him in surprise why hullo what are you doing here patient andrew answered pointing towards the house im attending le roys daughter le roy delighted at freddies surprise andrew proudly put his hand on the door of his new car and asked which way are you going can i drive you anywhere im going to ida sherringtons nursing home said freddie you can drive me there if you like as they drove to the nursing home both men were silent hamson was thinking he had given andrew a warm welcome when he came to london because he had hoped that manson might occasionally ask for his opinion about a case for which he would be able to charge the patient three pounds but now this surprising change in his old friend his new clothes the car and his mention of le roy gave hamson reason to believe that andrew might be more helpful to him than he had expected come in and meet ida he suggested when they reached the nursing home her home is one of the worst in london but she makes a lot of money shes a person worth knowing yes come in with me and see my patient old mrs raeburn ivory and i are doing a few tests on her come and examine her chest that would please her and shed pay you five pounds what you mean but whats the matter with her chest nothing freddie smiled dont look so surprised thats how we work here ivory deedman and i you really ought to join up with us the success of our system would surprise you andrew got out of the car and looked at the tall cold building he then turned his head and listened to the noise of the cars and the buses in the street he asked himself how any sick person could find peace here andrew mentioned this to hamson as they entered the building yes it is noisy freddie agreed but the area is very convenient for us thats all that matters he led andrew into a small office where a fat woman with a red face sat at a desk good morning ida freddie called out ive brought dr manson to see you ida greeted manson in a friendly manner after they had talked together for a few minutes freddie interrupted them take a good look at him he said to ida hell soon be sending you a lot of patients hamson laughed and then led andrew upstairs to see mrs raeburn she was a woman of about sixty freddie sat on her bed and talked to her he told her that mr ivory would call next day to tell her about the result of his important tests and he asked her to allow dr manson who had made a special study of lungs to examine her chest mrs raeburn was delighted at the suggestion she enjoyed the examination she was a rich woman and liked to spend her money on her health heavens freddie said as they left the room youve no idea how much money we have made from that old woman andrew did not answer this place gave him a feeling of disgust there was nothing wrong with the old lady and freddies behaviour was shameful he shook hands with hamson and drove away at the end of the month when he received a cheque for five pounds from mrs raeburn he decided that he had been foolish to feel as he did he had given her his services and had earned this payment he accepted the cheque chapter twenty seven getting rich andrews hard rimes were over so many people now came to his surgery that he could no longer take the time to give them proper attention listen chris he said one morning ive just thought of an idea to save time i want you to deal with the medicines for me i usually spend about five minutes mixing each patients medicine during those five minutes i could examine another patient she looked at him but i dont know anything about medicine he smiled that doesnt matter dear i have prepared a large quantity of two different kinds of medicine i will tell you which kind to give each patient then you will fill the botde and hand it to him christine looked worried but oh andrew do you really believe oh i know that i used to talk a lot of nonsense about medicine at aberalaw but im a practical doctor now these medicines cant do any harm christine knew that it would be a waste of breath to argue with him and so she agreed to fill the bottles at every surgery andrew would run into her room to tell her which medicine to give each patient and then run back to his surgery to attend to the next patient on one occasion christine told him that one of the medicines was finished never mind give the other andrew shouted give coloured water give anything after the evening surgery andrew would sit down and work out his accounts heavens chris we are doing well he said proudly one evening do you remember that miserable sum that i earned on our first day here well today today i made over eight pounds he locked up the money in a drawer and praised his wisdom in buying the practice yes and im attending highclass patients as well were going to be rich woman soon he was able to tell her to buy new furniture for the house go to the best shop get all the new furniture that you want get everything christine looked at him in silence he smiled thats the joy of making money one can buy everything that one wants let us enjoy our success by buying expensive furniture he did not notice the bitterness in her voice he laughed thats right dear nows the time to get rid of all those terrible old bits and pieces she burst into tears you werent ashamed of it at aberalaw oh those were happy days she turned and ran out of the room andrew was very surprised he thought angrily she doesnt care about my success she doesnt care but other people showed him respect a week after his quarrel with christine mrs lawrence telephoned and invited him to a lunch party on the following friday one or two important people who i would like you to meet will also be there she told him feeling that he would be foolish to miss any opportunity of meeting people who might help him andrew accepted the invitation but he did not want to run the risk of having another quarrel with christine and so when friday came he told her that he was going to have lunch with hamson with a feeling of relief he jumped into his car and drove to the home of mrs lawrence several wellknown people including one of londons most famous doctors were at the lunch party the meal was excellent with plenty of wine andrew drank laughed joined in the conversation and enjoyed every moment although much of the conversation was as stupid as the talk at hamsons party andrew returned home with a feeling of satisfaction but next morning he had a shock freddie telephoned him to inquire did you enjoy your lwich yesterday how did i know about it havent you seen the newspapers andrew ran to the sitting room and hurriedly turned the pages of his newspaper to his great surprise he saw a photograph of frances lawrence and a report of her party with the names of all the guests he tore out the page and threw it into the fire but christine had already read the newspaper she felt deeply hurt why had he not told her why why she felt more sorry for andrew than for herself she knew that rich people could be ill as well as poor people but she felt that andrew was giving up all his beliefs simply to make money sadly she attempted to do her housework suddenly the telephone rang as andrew had by now gone out she answered it her eyes became bright excited she kept looking out of the window eager for andrews return she forgot her sadness she had received good news when andrew returned she ran into the hall and called out to him andrew sir robert abbey has just telephoned darling you have been appointed to a post at the victoria hospital tears of excitement came to his eyes why thats good news chris isnt it isnt it she cried she put her arms round his neck and kissed him he looked down at her touched by her love how good you are chris and how bad i am he said chapter twenty eight denny returns to his great pride andrew was now a doctor in one of the oldest and most famous hospitals in london the victoria was certainly old the building was in a noisy dirty street and it rarely saw the sun even in summer the department in which andrew worked smelt of old age andrew worked at the victoria on two afternoons a week and all his patients had some form of lung disease but though he was excited about his new appointment andrew could not put his heart into his work he had lost interest in his coal dust discoveries he had more important things to think about now he decided that it was not worth his time and trouble to make a thorough medical examination of every person who came to see him instead he took a quick look at each patient and then gave him or her a bottle of medicine six weeks after he started work at the victoria andrew received a letter from denny he gave a sudden cry of pleasure hes coming home to work in england heavens it will be nice to see him again chris she was as pleased as andrew was but for a different reason she had always felt that denny and hope had been a good influence on andrew and she hoped that denny might influence his behaviour now i think that i will invite denny and hope to dinner next week she said all right he replied but they will have to come on sunday im too busy during the rest of the week on the following sunday denny arrived he looked older but seemed to be happier yet he was the same denny this is a very grand house he greeted them then turning to christine he added and who is this welldressed gentleman is he dr manson seated a moment later he refused a drink no thanks i dont drink now im going to settle down he told them that he had found himself a good post at a country hospital andrew looked at him quickly you shouldnt bury yourself in the country philip with your degree you could get a much better post in london come to london what have you been doing to him denny asked christine he doesnt sound like the man who blew up that sewer with me at drineffy at that moment hope arrived he and denny had not met before but they liked each other at once five minutes later as they sat down to dinner they began to joke about andrews success to his face of course hope philip remarked sadly i have known these people for a long time i knew the doctor before he came to london before he became so successful he was dismissed from his last post for using animals in his research hope laughed loudly and replied with another joke about andrew there was more of this sort of talk during the meal then as christine had hoped the conversation became more serious at first andrew was rather quiet although he was pleased to see philip again he did not feel that his old friend was showing enough respect for his success after all he had done very well extremely well and what had denny done several times he nearly told denny and hope to stop trying to be funny yet when they began to discuss hospitals andrew joined in the conversation with real interest theyre all out of date he cried the victoria is falling down most of the hospitals in london are falling down the buildings are old and the streets are noisy how can patients get well in such conditions the whole system is wrong well whats the answer philip asked with an annoying smile what do you suggest a new board of control with you in charge to reorganize all the hospitals dont be a fool denny andrew answered angrily the only sensible answer is to build new hospitals a few kilometres outside london in quiet areas where there is good fresh air i tell you the present system is terrible and what are we doing about it nothing if i were in charge they talked until after midnight denny complained about the lack of knowledge shown by so many doctors and hope complained about the waste of medical supplies soon after midnight hope left while andrew was out of the room saying goodbye to him denny gave christine a small present which he had brought home for her from abroad she tried to thank him but he stopped her his kind eyes avoiding hers denny said dont worry about andrew he smiled but we must try to lead him back to his old drineffy standards mustnt we chapter twenty nine money from mr ivory soon after dennys visit a mrs thornton requested andrew to call and see her daughter sybil who had hurt her foot when andrew examined her foot he decided that the only way to cure the trouble was by a simple operation i should have this done before the foot gets worse he advised mrs thornton i will take your advice doctor she said will you make the arrangements for this please who do you suggest does the operation for a moment andrew could not think of anyone then suddenly he remembered ivory mr ivory might do this for us if hes not too busy he said andrew went home and telephoned ivory whose manner was most friendly he examined the girl and agreed that an operation was necessary and two days later he did the operation in miss sherringtons nursing home andrew was present because ivory said that it was important for him to be present two weeks later when sybil thornton had left the nursing home ivory invited him to lunch during the meal he suggested to andrew leave the money arrangements for the operation to me i hear that the thorntons are very rich i can charge them more than you can he paused er there is another matter that i ought to mention sybils tonsils are in a bad state did you examine them no no i didnt oh theyre very bad i hope you dont mind but i told mrs thornton that we would take out sybils tonsils as soon as the weather is warm on his way home andrew thought what a pleasant man ivory is so nice and easy to work with about a month later while he was having tea with christine the afternoon post brought him a friendly letter from ivory enclosing a cheque for twenty pounds andrew looked at the cheque in surprise he had done nothing to help ivory at the operation with a smile he handed the letter and cheque to christine this is very generous isnt it chris she looked confused but i dont understand is this in payment of your bill to mrs thornton he laughed no no this is an additional payment for the time that i spent at the operation i earned this just for being there she put the cheque on the table it seems a lot of money for doing nothing well why not the thorntons are very rich they can easily afford it when andrew had gone christine looked at the cheque again she had not realized that he was working with ivory suddenly all her worries returned how fond of money he had become money seemed to be the only thing that mattered to him tears came to her eyes she must speak to him that evening after surgery she asked slowly andrew will you do something to please me will you drive me into the country on sunday he looked at her strangely well oh all right on sunday a fine spring day they drove to a village a few miles from london where they ate their lunch which they had brought with them by some woods as they sat in the sunshine christine took a deep breath andrew dear she said i want to speak to you money isnt the only thing in life please listen to me please you have changed so much andrew denny noticed the difference in you too youre not the andrew manson that i married oh if only you could be as you used to be what have i done wrong now andrew shouted its your whole behaviour love that cheque that ivory sent you its not right to accept it he stiffened not right why shouldnt i accept it oh cant you understand what i mean youre doing all the things that used to make you so angry with other doctors oh andrew dont lose all respect for yourself she suddenly burst into tears he looked at her in anger oh stop crying you fool try to help me instead of complaining every minute of the day you talk as if i were a criminal i only want to succeed dont mention this nonsense to me again all right she cried i wont but i warn you one day you will be sorry they hardly spoke to each other for the rest of the day towards the end of the week andrew went to tea with mrs lawrence who always seemed to approve of his actions why suggested mrs lawrence dont you rent a room in this part of london for this highclass practice that you are so anxious to develop many more people with money would come to you if you had a room in this area half an hour later as andrew drove home he thought about mrs lawrences suggestion it was a good idea without saying anything to christine he began to search for a room in the west end of london when he found one about a month later he told her at breakfast it may interest you to know that i have rented a room in welbeck street i shall use the surgery here for people who have not much money and my new room in the west end for my rich patients chapter thirty lunch with mr stillman the room in welbeck street gave andrew a new feeling of his own importance frances lawrence and freddie hamson made suggestions about decorations and furniture and hamson also found him a nurse nurse sharp a rather bitter but hardworking woman who was a friend of the nurse that freddie employed when his room was ready it looked very grand andrew decided that he could charge his patients at least three pounds a visit here for the first week or two very few people came to see him but then patients began to flood in he was a busy man driving backwards and forwards in his expensive car from his home to his welbeck street office and from there to the victoria hospital he rarely finished work until ten oclock at night in june ivory took out sybil thorntons tonsils and posted andrew a cheque in payment for attending the operation one afternoon soon after this an old woman called to see andrew about her throat her condition was quite easy to cure but andrew decided to send her to hamson for his advice about the best treatment to give freddie had been so kind of late that he wanted to give him this opportunity to earn himself an easy three pounds a week or two later hamson in return sent andrew one of his patients to examine that evening as he drove home from his west end consulting room andrew felt very pleased with himself but he found christine far from pleased mrs lawrence telephoned you again this afternoon no message she told him he turned red what do you mean again this is the fourth time that she has telephoned you this week well nothing i didnt say anything its how you look its not my fault if she telephones me he rushed out of the room at once he felt sorry relations between christine and himself were getting worse and they had once been so happy he had a sudden desire to please her the next minute he was in his car driving to see miss cramb at her shop when he returned he went into the living room and called out christine come here a moment she came at once look dear andrew said awkwardly ive bought you this i know i know that we have been quarrelling of late but this ought to show you he broke off and handed her a box as she opened it her hands trembled then she gave a little cry what a lovely lovely dress tears were running down her face she turned to him excitedly you do love me dont you dear thats all that matters to me he smiled of course i do listen chris ill take you out to dinner today he took her to a very expensive restaurant we didnt have this sort of food in drineffy he laughed as they began their meal andrew was determined to have a good time but christine could not be cheerful the room was crowded hot and noisy the noise of these rich people was hateful to her suddenly she felt sick whats the matter andrew asked arent you enjoying yourself yes of course she tried to smile you havent listened to a word that ive been saying you havent drunk any of your wine when a man takes his wife out can i have a little water she asked weakly she wanted to shout she hated the place they finished their meal in silence and drove home their relations were even worse than before christine felt terribly miserable she began to lose her selfconfidence to ask herself if she was really the right wife for andrew but andrews worries at home were pushed into the background when next day he read in a newspaper that richard stillman the man with a hospital in america who had written to praise his coal dust experiments had come to england and was staying at a hotel in london stillman had no medical qualifications after leaving school he had begun to study medicine at an american university but before he had finished his studies his father died leaving his mother very little money in order to support his mother and sister stillman left the university to earn his living in an old family business he hated this work he continued to study medicine in his free time and when he had saved enough money he returned to the medical profession but so many valuable years had been wasted that stillman did not take a degree instead he built a hospital for the treatment of people with lung diseases at first the american doctors refused to recognize him but stillman cured so many people that other doctors had failed to cure that he gradually won the respect of the american medical profession the english doctors still refused to recognize stillman but andrew felt the greatest respect for him he wrote to him at once inviting him to lunch at the expensive restaurant to which he had taken christine next morning stillman telephoned him dr manson he said i should like to meet you for lunch but not at that restaurant i hate the place come and have lunch at my hotel when they had taken their seats at a quiet table in the dining room of his hotel stillman gave andrew a friendly smile and said its very nice to be in england i like your country what is the reason for your visit andrew asked stillman smiled as a matter of fact i have come to england to start a small hospital like my hospital in america i am building it in the lovely chiltern hills to the northwest of london i expect that you know the area andrew leaned forward thats interesting i should like to see your hospital i shall be delighted to show you round as soon as the place is ready we shall treat mainly chest diseases and i have one or two new ideas that may interest you really tell me about them they spent most of the afternoon discussing stillmans new hospital andrew left stillman with a strange feeling of excitement but when he returned home he found christine reading a prayer book for some reason that he could not explain this annoyed him good heavens he shouted have you nothing better to do whats wrong i used to read my prayer book before i met you oh did you well let me tell you this youre a fool perhaps but i would prefer to be a fool and keep my selfrespect than to be successful with no selfrespect with a great effort she kept back her tears then in a quiet voice she said andrew dont you think that it would be a good idea if i went away for a short time mrs vaughan has invited me to stay with her for two or three weeks dont you think that i ought to go yes go go at once he turned and left the room chapter thirty one mary boland christines absence was at first a relief to andrew then he began to ask himself what she was doing and to look forward to her return although he told himself that he was now a free man he had the same lonely feeling that he had experienced at aberalaw when christine had gone away to stay with her aunt he met ivory freddie and deedman two or three times he also drove to the chiltern hills to see stillmans new hospital he and stillman became good friends but his friendship with stillman did not take away his loneliness in the end andrew telephoned frances lawrence and asked her would you care to drive into the country and have dinner with me tomorrow evening her voice comforted him that would be very nice the next evening they drove to a small country town where they had dinner at a hotel by the river we have known each other for quite a long time frances remarked but this is the first occasion that you have asked me to come out with you are you sorry that you came she smiled does does your husband know that we she looked up dont you understand jack and i are good friends but we she stopped suddenly lets dance she suggested they danced it gave andrew a strange feeling of pleasure to hold her in his arms when they returned to their table he asked awkwardly why have you been so kind to me his question seemed to amuse her you are very attractive and what i like most about you is that you do not realize it no do be serious she laughed its hot in here lets go outside and look at the moonlight on the river they walked down to the river and sat on a seat she looked at the moon shining on the water what a beautiful night she said he kissed her her lips were warm she smiled that was very sweet but very badly done i can do better he whispered he felt awkward ashamed he wanted to take her into his arms but then a shadowy picture of christines tired sad face looked up at him from the water it worried and annoyed him he kissed frances again you took a long time to do that she said and now doctor i think that we should go home they drove back to london in silence andrew was not happy he hated himself he tried to dismiss christine from his mind but he could not do so when they reached mrs lawrences house he got out of the car and opened the door for her without a word come in she invited him he paused its very late isnt it she went indoors without answering and he followed her three days later andrew sat in his west end office feeling tired and miserable suddenly nurse sharp entered theres a man to see you a mr boland ive told him hell have to wait boland andrew repeated tiredly as if he had never heard the name before then suddenly his face brightened con boland show him in nurse at once but a patient is waiting to see you never mind about that he shouted do what i say nurse sharp annoyed at being addressed in that manner gave andrew one look and went out of the room a minute later she showed boland in why con andrew called out jumping up from his chair hullo hullo shouted con walking quickly forward to shake hands with andrew heavens manson its nice to see you again youre looking well well well this is a highclass practice he looked at nurse sharp who was watching him with scorn this nurse of yours refused to admit me at first nurse sharp turned and walked out of the room after she had left cons manner changed listen manson he said ive come to see you about my daughter mary shes ill llewellyn has been attending her but well hes useless con suddenly became angry he says that mary has tuberculosis and cannot be cured listen manson will you do something for me i know that youre a successful doctor now but will you examine mary i have such confidence in you and so has mary andrew was worried mary poor girl ill do everything that i can for her everything he promised con at that moment nurse sharp entered five patients are waiting to see you now dr manson she informed him andrew took no notice but continued to talk to con he invited boland to stay with him for a few days and boland accepted his invitation joyfully cons cheerful spirit helped him to forget his troubles with christine when she returned on friday andrew took con with him to the railway station to meet her he was afraid to meet christine by himself after all that had happened and he hoped that cons presence might make things easier for both of them hullo chris andrew called out cheerfully as she got out of the train look whos here con hes staying with us chris did you enjoy yourself christine was surprised at her warm welcome she had feared that she might not be met at all sitting in the back seat of the car with con she talked excitedly oh i am glad to be home again she said when they reached the house she took a deep breath have you missed me andrew missed you i most certainly have after a few minutes andrew who still felt awkward said that he must visit a patient and hurriedly left the house thank heavens thats over he said to himself as he got into his car im sure that she has no suspicions about frances thats all that matters at the moment while he was out con had a long talk with christine about marys health christine felt very anxious and advised con to telephone mary telling her to come to london at once when mary arrived next day her thin face and body gave andrew a shock he ordered her to bed and examined her chest fifteen minutes later he returned to the living room looking very worried im afraid con that llewellyn was right mary has got tuberculosis he told him but dont worry the disease is in the early stage of development you mean that she can be cured yes but she must go into hospital for special treatment there is a doctor at the victoria hospital dr thoroughgood who has made a special study of this disease i will ask him to treat her and if she comesinto my hospital i can watch her progress manson youre a true friend said con on saturday afternoon mary was admitted to the victoria hospital and con returned to aberalaw how nice to be together again chris andrew said after he had left he sounded sincere but for some reason christine did not believe that he really meant what he said she went upstairs to her bedroom and cried to herself oh god when and how will this end chapter thirty two harry vidlers operation andrews dreams of success and wealth were coming true his practice was growing every week his business relations with hamson and ivory were very close and were earning him a lot of money deedman was also sending him patients and now le roy who owned a large food factory had offered him a post as medical adviser to his company andrew had a feeling of power he could do nothing wrong then quite suddenly and without warning his whole life was changed one evening in november the wife of a shoemaker came to his house her name was mrs vidler a small cheerful woman of middle age whom andrew knew well doctor she said my husband is ill he has been ill for several weeks but he refused to come to you because he didnt want to trouble you will you call and see him doctor when andrew called next morning harry vidler was in bed with a bad pain in his stomach he examined vidler and found that although not seriously ill he needed an operation to be done quickly he explained this to the vidlers who asked him to arrange for a good surgeon to do the operation in a nursing home that evening andrew telephoned ivory i would like you to do a stomach operation ivory he said the patient is a shoemaker he has very little money and so i shall be grateful if you will reduce your charges for him ivory was pleasant they discussed the case for several minutes and then andrew telephoned mrs vidler mr ivory a west end surgeon has agreed to do this operation for thirty pounds he told her his usual charge is a hundred pounds so i think this is very satisfactory yes doctor yes she sounded worried its very kind of you to arrange this for us well find the money somehow a few days later ivory did the operation in a private nursing home vidler was very cheerful before he was put to sleep he smiled at andrew and said i shall feel better after this the next moment he was asleep ivory took his surgeons knife and made a long cut in vidlers stomach at once a large flesh bag of poisonous matter sprang out of the wound like a wet ball this bag was the cause of vidlers pain ivory tried to catch hold of the ball and cut it away from the inside of the stomach he must have tried times but on each attempt the ball slipped out of his hand andrew looked at ivory in annoyance thinking what is the man doing why does he find it so difficult suddenly he realized that this was the first stomach operation that ivory had done for him he walked nearer to the table nobody else seemed to be worried ivory the doctor who had put vidler to sleep and the nurses were all quite calm but for some reason andrew had a feeling of fear in the end ivory gave up the attempt and cut a hole in the bag itself at once the bag burst and spilled the poisonous matter into the stomach wound andrew watched in disgust but still ivory was not worried he cleaned away some of the poison and then tried without success to stop the bleeding a wave of anger swept over andrew good heavens he thought this man is not a surgeon he has no idea what he is doing the second doctor said in a quiet voice im afraid that hes dying ivory ivory did not answer did not appear to hear yes hes dead now said the other doctor ivory laid down his instruments a pity he remarked the shock of the operation must have killed him andrew could not speak he suddenly remembered mrs vidler who was waiting downstairs ivory read his thoughts dont worry manson he said ill speak to the little woman for you come with me andrew followed him down the stairs to the room where mrs vidler was waiting my dear lady said ivory putting his hand gently on her shoulder im afraid that we have bad news for you your poor husband in spite of everything that we did for him she turned white harry she whispered nobody ivory continued sadly could have saved him and even if he had lived she looked up at him i understand thank you doctor for being so kind she began to cry he went out of the room and again andrew followed him well thats done ivory said coldly im sorry manson i didnt expect that to happen of course the man didnt die during the operation i had finished before he died so there is nothing to worry about therell be no need for an inquiry andrew was trembling with anger oh stop talking he shouted you killed him youre not a surgeon you never were and you never will be a surgeon ivory gave andrew a bitter look i advise you not to talk in that manner manson its the truth oh god why did i trust you why be silent you fool andrew was almost blind with anger you know that its the truth you did the operation so badly that it was almost murder for a moment it seemed as if ivory would hit him but with a great effort he controlled himself and walked out of the room with a sad heart and an aching head andrew went home he returned just in time for his evening surgery many people were waiting to see him he looked at them and thought the same stupid faces theres nothing wrong with most of them he then went into his room and began his duties trying to behave in his usual friendly manner andrew made polite conversation with each patient and then told christine which medicine to give him after the surgery he sat down to work out his accounts as was his custom every evening but he could not think clearly well how much money have you made today christine asked him he did not could not answer when she left the room he sat quite still like a man in a dream oh god what have i done what have i done he kept saying suddenly he noticed the bag of money which his patients had paid him for his services that day another wave of anger swept over him he picked up the bag and threw it across the room he jumped up from his chair he was hot he could hardly breathe he ran outside to the back of the house and was sick chapter thirty three a change of heart andrew could not sleep that night next morning he felt half dead he ate no breakfast butjust drank one cup of coffee his first thought now was for mary boland he got out his car and drove straight to the victoria hospital to see how she was good morning she said when he entered her room arent my flowers beautiful christine brought them yesterday he sat on her bed and looked at her she seemed to be thinner yes they are nice flowers how do you feel mary oh all right her eyes avoided his anyway youll soon make me better her confidence in him added to his misery he thought if any harm comes to ìàry i will never forgive myself at that moment dr thoroughgood entered good morning manson he said pleasantly why whats the matter with you are you ill andrew stood up im quite well thank you dr thoroughgood gave him a strange look and then turned to mary they examined mary together and then walked over to a corner of the room where they could not be heard and discussed her case it seems to me said andrew that her progress is not at all satisfactory dr thoroughgood rubbed his hands oh i dont know manson her temperature is higher yes but this case is very important to me i dont want to tell you your business but i think that you should do an operation on her lung i suggested this when mary first came into hospital thoroughgood was annoyed i dont agree with you he said im sorry manson but you must allow me to treat this case in the way that i consider best andrew felt too weak to argue he went back to mary told her that he would call to see her again on the following day and left the hospital it was now nearly one oclock he went to a cheap restaurant where he drank another cup of coffee but ate no food and then drove to his office in welbeck street where nurse sharp who was in a bad temper also inquired if he felt ill his first patient was a young man with a weak heart andrew gave him a thorough examination and then asked him many questions before deciding on the treatment to give him when at the end of the examination the young man tried to pay him for his services andrew said quickly please dont pay me now wait till i send you a bill the thought that he would never send a bill that he had lost his desire for money and now hated it comforted him strangely his second patient was a rich woman of fortyfive miss basden who visited him every few days smiling sweedy she began to tell him about her imaginary aches and pains andrew interrupted her why do you come to me miss basden she stopped in the middle of a sentence and looked at him in surprise oh i know im to blame he said i told you to come but theres nothing the matter with you dr manson im sorry he said i can be of no further service to you miss basden but i am sure that there are many other doctors in this area who will be very pleased to tell you that you are ill and to give you expensive treatments she opened her mouth to speak but no words came then she hurried out of the room andrew was about to go home when nurse sharp came in smiling dr hamson to see you the next minute freddie entered his manner had never been so friendly listen manson he said i have heard about that operation yesterday and i think that you were quite right to be angry with ivory it was shameful as a matter of fact old man im rather annoyed with ivory and deedman weve been working together sending each other patients but they havent been paying me my fair share of the money theyre cheats i could tell you a lot of other things about them too hamson paused listen old man ive got an idea lets work together you and i without ivory and deedman we dont need them i know all the tricks all the ways to make money and youre a clever doctor if we work together well make a fortune andrew sat quite still he felt no anger against hamson only a bitter hatred of himself at last he said im sorry i cant work with you freddie im tired of all this there are too many doctors whose only thought is to make money hamsons face turned red what the he jumped up have you gone mad perhaps but i am going to stop thinking about money and success a doctor shouldnt try to make money out of sick people youre a fool shouted hamson he turned and rushed out of the room andrew got up and drove home christine was in the living room the sight of her pale sad face made him tremble she said youve had a busy day will you have some tea before the surgery there will be no surgery this evening he said she looked at him in surprise but its saturday your busiest night he did not answer why what is the matter she asked andrew gave her one look christine he said he ran forward and knelt at her feet crying chapter thirty four a visit to mr stillman next morning which was sunday andrew lay in bed beside christine talking and pouring out his feelings to her in the way that he used to do why did i do it was i crazy chris oh chris im sorry she smiled actually smiled well andrew continued we must leave here now sell the practice oh chris ive thought of an excellent idea yes dear what is it to join up with denny and hope each of us has special knowledge of a different branch of medicine so we could do work of great value together honest work not simply making money denny and i have always said that a doctor who works alone attempts too much i mean he may know a lot about one subject but very little about another now if we three work together we can share our knowledge and provide a really useful medical service for our patients denny is a surgeon and can do the operations i can do the general work of the practice and hope can do the scientific tests and give us advice on our problems christine looked at him with shining eyes oh its so nice to hear you talk like this oh im so happy i believe that denny and hope will join with me andrew said excitedly he jumped out of bed and began to walk up and down the room suddenly he stopped chris he said theres something that i must do immediately im very worried about mary boland shes making no progress at the victoria thoroughgood doesnt understand her case i want to take mary away from the victoria and send her to stillmans new hospital stillmans yes its the best hospital that i have ever seen i intend to drive over and see stillman today and try to persuade him to admit mary will you come with me well leave as soon as you are ready she said when he had dressed andrew went downstairs and wrote long letters to denny and hope then after a light meal he and christine drove to the chiltern hills it was a long time since they had been so happy together they reached the hospital at three oclock stillman gave them a warm welcome and showed them round his hospital which though small was comfortable and full of modern equipment after this they had tea with stillman and andrew made his request i want to ask you something mr stillman he said quickly will you take over a case for me a girl with tuberculosis in its early stages shes the daughter of a friend of mine and shes making no progress at the victoria hospital stillman smiled surely you dont want to send me a case english doctors dont recognize me remember that i have no medical qualifications i cannot be trusted i am more likely to kill than to cure andrew did not smile please dont joke mr stillman im serious im very worried about this girl im afraid that i have no bed for her my friend i have a list of women who are already waiting to be admitted although the doctors dont like me some people but mr stillman andrew interrupted i was depending on you if you dont admit mary she will never get well where she is stillman leaned forward and helped himself to a piece of cake i see that you really are worried all right i will help you he promised bring mary here next wednesday and i will find her a bed i will do my best to cure her andrews face brightened i i cant thank you enough then dont try to said stillman chapter thirty five mary goes to mr stillman next morning andrew rose early after a good nights sleep he felt excited ready for anything he went straight to the telephone and gave orders to a medical property firm to sell his practice sell it for a fair price i wont accept any more than its really worth he said the people in this area have not got much money and the next doctor may not do as well as i have done at lunchtime christine handed andrew two letters they were replies to his letters to denny and hope the short note from denny read interested expect me tomorrow evening the letter from hope also expressed interest though the words showed hopes usual sense of fun after lunch andrew drove to the victoria hospital to see mary boland sitting beside marys bed he told her about the new arrangements that he had made youll like the other hospital better mary much better he promised her now i dont want to make difficulties here so i would like you to pretend that it is your own wish to leave say that you want to go home then on wednesday i will pick you up and drive you to stillmans hospital andrew returned home with a feeling that he was beginning to correct his mistakes that evening in his surgery he sorted out the patients who really were ill from those who only imagined that they were again and again he said firmly this must be your last visit youre better now it wont do you any good to go on taking medicine it was surprising how much comfort this gave him after the surgery he went in to christine feeling several years younger at that moment the telephone rang christine went to answer it when she returned she looked worried again someone wants to speak to you she told him who suddenly he realized that it was frances lawrence tell her that ive gone out he said no dont say that he walked quickly forward ill speak to her myself he came back in five minutes and said thats over too i shant see her again christine smiled happily without answering on the following evening denny came to dinner he brought a message from hope saying he was sorry that he had another appointment he said that he had work to do denny remarked knocking out his pipe but i believe that his appointment is really with a young lady i wouldnt be surprised if our friend hope decides to marry her did he say anything about my ideaandrew asked quickly yes hes interested and so am i i am surprised that a man with your dull brains has the ability to think of such an excellent plan tell me about it andrew explained his plan with rising excitement they then began to discuss the practical details in my opinion said denny we ought to choose a town with a population of about people an industrial town where four or five doctors are all working against each other in such a town we would have the best opportunity to show the advantage of doctors with different medical qualifications working together we might make enemies at first but we would succeed in the end perhaps after a time we might start our own hospital yes this is a good idea suddenly feeling christines eye on him denny smiled and what do you think about it christine crazy isnt it yes she answered but sometimes the crazy things are best youre right chrisandrew cried hitting the table with his handour aim must be to set an example in medical practice they talked until such a late hour that denny missed the last train home and had to spend the night with andrew and christine on the following wednesday by which time a dr lowry was on the point of buying his practice andrew went to the victoria hospital to take mary boland away everything had worked out just as he had planned no objection was raised to marys leaving the victoria and at two oclock andrew arrived with nurse sharp to pick her up nurse sharp was in a bad temper because andrew had just told her that he intended to close his office in welbeck street and had given her a months notice she sat with mary in the back seat of the car and did not speak a single word during the journey they reached stillmans hospital at half past three as soon as mary was in bed stillman went to her room to examine her when he and andrew entered the room nurse sharp seemed surprised and annoyed stillman examined mary very thoroughly and then led andrew out of the room again she is very ill he said i must do an operation on her lung immediately it should have been done several weeks ago while stillman got ready for the operation andrew went back and told mary of their decision its nothing to worry about mary andrew comforted her you wont feel any pain ill be in the room ill see that youre all right ten minutes later stillman began the operation he worked quickly and with great skill employing several new ideas that he had discovered in america andrew had never witnessed a more skilful operation when it was over and mary was back in her bed andrew went in to see her well do you feel happier now she smiled you were right it was nothing to worry about all that you need now is rest youll soon be well again completely cured he promised her chapter thirty six the cheese from mrs smith it was nearly seven oclock when andrew left stillmans hospital he now had peace of mind about mary andrew realized that other doctors might question his action in sending mary to stillman but he did not mind he had done the best thing for the girl and that was all that mattered he drove slowly enjoying the quiet of the evening nurse sharp again sat in the back of the car without speaking when they arrived back in london he drove her to the place where she wished to get out and then went home christine met him joyfully in the hall her eyes were shining sold she cried dr lowry has bought the practice he followed christine into the living room where the remains of her evening meal were on the table isnt it good news christine continuedand weve sold it so quickly ive been thinking lets go away for a holiday we had such a lovely time she broke off suddenly why whats the matter dear you look so strange he smiled and sat down i suddenly feel a little tired perhaps because i have had no dinner what she cried i imagined that mr stillman had given you dinner she looked at the table ive had mine it doesnt matter but it does matter wait there and ill get you some food would you like some soup or an egg or what he thoughtan egg please chris and perhaps a bit of cheese after that christine ran off and got him his meal while he ate she sat beside him talking excitedly about the future about andrews plans to work with denny and hope you know dear she said i feel as if we were starting a new life the sort of life that we used to live oh im so happy he looked towards her are you really happy chris she kissed him ive never been happier in my life than i am at this moment there was a pause andrew spread some butter on a piece of bread and then lifted the lid of a dish to help himself to cheese but the dish was empty at once christine gave a little cry of shame oh i meant to buy some more cheese from mrs smith today oh its all right chris but it isnt all right im a bad wife she jumped up her eye on the clockill run along to mrs smith now before she closes her shop oh dont trouble chris i please love she silenced him cheerfully i want to do it i want to because you love mrs smiths cheese and i love you she left the room before he could say another word he heard her quick step in the hall followed by the sound of the front door opening and closing smiling to himself he sat back in his chair and waited for her return she was away for so long that he began to lose his hunger i shant want the cheese if she doesnt hurry up she must be talking to mrs smith he thought suddenly the doorbell rang violendy he looked up in surprise and went into the hall the bell rang again more violently he opened the front door a crowd of people stoodin the darkness outside the house a policeman whom he knew well came forward breathing heavily doctor theres been an accident your wife ran oh god she ran across the street and a bus icy fingers seemed to seize andrews heart before he could speak the hall filled with people mrs smith who was in tears the driver of the bus another policeman and two or three people who had witnessed the accident then two men carried in his christine in her hand was the packet of cheese which she had just bought from mrs smith they laid her on the bed in his surgery chapter thirty seven plans for the future andrew broke down for several days he hardly knew what he was doing denny spent several hours with him each day but andrew did not seem to know he was there he went to christines funeral with denny and then spent the rest of the day drinking walking from room to room with an unsteady step he shouted at himself youre to blame for her death this is a punishment for your crimes you tried to make money and that was a crime now god is punishing you he crept upstairs paused and then went into christines bedroom it was silent cold and empty on a table lay her handbag he picked it up held it against his face and then with a trembling hand opened it inside he found an old photograph of himself and the little notes that his grateful patients at aberalaw had sent him with their christmas presents she had kept them for all those years he fell on to his knees by the bed and cried denny did not attempt to stop him from drinking as dr lowry was already attending to the practice and there was therefore no need for andrew to work denny thought it wise to leave him alone for the moment but after about a week denny took action were going away he said simply andrew did not argue did not even ask where they were going in silence he watched denny pack a bag for him ah hour later they were in the train travelling to wales they went to stay at a lonely village by a beautiful river in the mountains i used to come here to fish i think that this place should suit us said denny when they arrived at their small but comfortable hotel the next morning denny took andrew for a walk it was a nice fine day but andrew tired after a sleepless night wanted to turn back when they had not walked more than a few kilometres but denny was firm he made andrew walk kilometres and on the next day he increased the distance to by the end of the week they were walking kilometres a day they did not speak during their walks at first andrew did not notice the beauty of the country but gradually he began to enjoy the woods and rivers and mountains the exercise and fresh air made him feel better he began to eat and to sleep well he even began to talk again at first he made only an occasional remark then one day he asked denny to tell him his news denny had been waiting for this moment hope and i are both free men now weve both given up our posts he told andrew andrews face lit up given up then this means that we denny smiled i shall be fit to work again very soon andrew said that evening denny and he looked at a map and made a fist of possible towns in which to start their new practice a few days later to andrews surprise hope arrived to join in the discussions he made his usual jokes and andrew actually laughed of course said denny we are all completely crazy we havent much money and we shall probably quarrel but somehow we shall probably murder each other said hope rising and stretching himself hope left the next morning after breakfast andrew went for a walk by himself it was good to feel fit again he was looking forward to working with denny and hope yes he really wanted to work again when he returned at oclock he found two letters waiting for him he sat beside denny who was reading the newspaper and opened them one letter was from mary boland she sent him her sympathy over christines death told him that she herself was quite well again and thanked him for everything that he had done for her smiling andrew put down her letter and read the other one at once the smile left his face he turned white for a minute he sat quite still looking at the letter denny he said in a quiet voice read this chapter thirty eight andrew in trouble eight weeks before on her return from stillmans hospital nurse sharp had gone straight to see her friend nurse trent who was employed by dr hamson they had arranged to go to the theatre together that evening im sorry that im so late she cried but dr manson has at that moment hamson had come down the stairs hullo nurse sharp he said cheerfully you look tired and why are you both here so late i thought that you were going to the theatre tonight yes doctor said nurse sharp but i was delayed by dr manson she thought for a moment and then decided to tell him the facts dr manson took a girl away from the victoria hospital and drove her to that place in the chilterns to that new hospital run by an american who is not a qualified doctor she told him the whole story there was a silence when she finished i am sorry that you have had such a bad time nurse freddie said finally now you had better hurry or you will be late for the theatre freddie drove straight to his club to have dinner with deedman and ivory with whom since his quarrel with andrew he was now friendly again during the meal freddie remarked manson seems to be taking some risks since he left us i hear that he is sending patients to that man stillman what ivory almost shouted yes and i understand that he also helped stillman at an operation his own nurse told me so ivory looked down at his plate and ate his dinner he had not forgiven manson for his remarks about the vidler operation ivory knew that he was a bad surgeon but nobody else had dared to tell him so he hated manson for that bitter truth after a few moments he raised his head and said we must do something about this we must tell gadsby gadsby spoke to me about stillman the other evening he had read a piece in a newspaper praising stillmans work and he was very angry gadsby is the man to tell hamson felt awkward he did not want to get manson into trouble in a strange way he quite liked andrew he said dont mention my name to dr gadsby dont be a fool freddie we cant allow manson to behave like this after dinner ivory went to see dr gadsby who listened with interest to his story well well he said i know this man manson he worked for the coal and mines board i didnt like him hes a very unpleasant man and you say that he actually took a patient from the victoria and sent her to stillmans place yes and he helped at the operation then we must report the matter to the general medical council said gadsby i will report the matter personally i consider this my duty this man stillman is a danger to the profession if manson has been working with him he must not be allowed to practise he must be disqualified while andrew was in wales he was reported without his knowledge to the general medical council after taking statements from dr thoroughgood nurse sharp and one or two other people the council decided to hold an inquiry to consider the complaints against andrew the letter which he now held in his hand gave andrew notice of this decision chapter thirty nine the inquiry a week before the inquiry andrew went to london to make arrangements for his defence he was alone he had told denny and hope that he would prefer to be alone he felt very miserable he could not believe that he andrew manson was in this situation a situation which every doctor feared why should the council wish to disqualify him from practising he had done nothing shameful in fact he had done something that deserved praise he had cured mary boland a lawyer named hopper suggested by denny agreed to defend andrew at the inquiry andrew considered hopper a weak stupid man and they nearly had a quarrel at their first meeting andrew wanted to ask sir robert abbey his only influential friend in london to help him but hopper objected to this because abbey was a member of the general medical council the lawyer also refused to allow andrew to call stillman as a witness because he was afraid that stillmans presence might anger the members of the council what does that matter andrew cried i havent done anything wrong im not ashamed of my actions i want the council to know the truth i want to prove to them that i saved this girls life by sending her to stillman that my action was right and wise dr manson hopper cried i warn you not to talk like that at the inquiry if you address the council in that manner they will certainly disqualify you i advise you to say as little as possible simply answer their questions andrew realized that he must try to control his feelings on the evening before the inquiry while out for a walk andrew came to the open doorway of a church he entered it was dark inside he sat down in the back seat and remembered how christine used to read a prayer book when she was unhappy he rarely went to church but now here he was like a man resting at the end of a journey he prayed in silence god dont let them disqualify me dont let them disqualify me he remained there for perhaps half an hour then he rose and went to his hotel next morning he woke feeling sick with anxiety he ate no breakfast his case was to be heard at oclock and hopper had told him to arrive early he reached the offices of the general medical council as the clock was striking eleven he hurried along to the room where the inquiry was to be held the members of the council were sitting at a long table and at the far end of the room were the lawyers and witnesses who were to take part in the case mary boland and her father nurse sharp dr thoroughgood and several other faces that he recognized were there andrew stood for a minute looking at the long line of chairs and then sat down beside hopper i thought that i told you to be early the lawyer said andrew did not answer the inquiry began immediately mr boon the lawyer employed by the doctors taking the action against andrew read out the charge against him mr president gentlemen he said this is a case of a doctor working with a person who is not qualified the facts of the case are these the patient mary boland was admitted to the victoria chest hospital on july she remained there in the care of dr thoroughgood until september she then expressed a wish to leave and return home but instead of returning home the patient was taken by dr manson to a health centre run by a man named stillman a person not qualified in medicine and er a foreigner mr stillman examined the patient as soon as she arrived and decided to operate at once on one of her lungs and dr manson agreed to help him they did the operation together gentlemen i repeat they worked together mr boon looked at the members of the council to make sure that they had understood his meaning and then called for dr thoroughgood dr thoroughgood he asked is it true that dr manson came to the victoria hospital and requested you to change the treatment for this patient mary boland yes and what did you say i refused in the interest of your patient you refused i did was dr mansons manner strange when you refused well thoroughgood paused he didnt seem to be very well that morning he argued thank you dr thoroughgood had you any reason to believe that the patient herself was not satisfied oh no she always seemed happy thank you dr thoroughgood that is all boon questioned a nurse from the victoria hospital and then called for nurse sharp and now nurse sharp can you tell us about dr mansons actions on the afternoon of wednesday september yes i was there i imagine from your voice nurse sharp that you did not wish to be there when i realized where we were going and that this man stillman is not a doctor i was disgusted boon suggested yes i was exactly boon looked pleased and now nurse sharp one more question did dr manson actually help mr stillman with this operation he did nurse sharp answered in a voice full of hate abbey now leaned forward and asked a question is it a fact nurse sharp that dr manson had just given you notice nurse sharp reddened yes yes i suppose so as she sat down andrew felt that abbey at least was still his friend boon who was a little annoyed at this interruption turned to the members of the council mr president gentlemen i could call more witnesses but i do not consider this necessary i think that i have proved the charge against dr manson to be true mr boon sat down looking extremely pleased with himself there was a moments silence andrew kept his eyes on the floor bitterly he told himself that they were treating him like a criminal then his own lawyer began to address the council hopper seemed awkward his face was red and he began to cough he said i admit the truth of this charge but my friend mr boon was not quite fair to dr manson he did not mention that miss boland was dr mansons own patient before she was in the care of dr thoroughgood dr manson had a special interest in this case i admit that dr mansons action in taking her away from the victoria hospital was quite wrong but he was not dishonourable and he certainly had no wish to offend against the medical laws he did not agree with dr thoroughgoods treatment and therefore decided to make other arrangements for the care of his patient hopper then called mary boland miss boland he asked did you find any cause of complaint while you were at mr stillmans hospital oh no certainly not your health didnt get worse no no i got much better thank you that is all hopper said quickly i will now call dr manson andrew stood up conscious that every eye was directed towards him he was pale and tired hopper addressed him dr manson did you receive any money from mr stillman none did you intend to do harm to dr thoroughgood by your actions no certainly not we were good friends i simply did not agree with his opinions about this case exactly you can tell the council honestly that you did not mean to offend against the medical laws that is the truth hopper who had worried about calling andrew as a witness in case he should say too much dismissed him with a feeling of relief then boon suddenly jumped to his feet and began to question andrew dr manson you say that you did not mean to offend against the medical laws but you knew that mr stillman was not qualified didnt you andrew looked at him coldly yes i knew that he was not a doctor i see and that didnt stop you from sending a patient to him no it did not andrew was angry he took a deep breath mr boon ive listened to you asking questions now i will ask you one have you heard of louis pasteur boon was surprised at the question yes of course everyone has heard of him exactly everyone has heard of him well mr boon do you realize that louis pasteur the greatest name in scientific medicine was not a doctor nor were many other famous names in medicine perhaps this will show you that every man who hasnt got a medical degree isnt necessarily a criminal or a fool silence every member of the council sat up abbey looked at andrew with a friendly expression hopper looked embarrassed boon was annoyed yes yes but those men had rare qualities said boon surely you dont compare stillman with them why not those men had a long struggle before they became famous stillman has done more for medicine than thousands of men with degrees far more than these doctors who drive about in expensive cars and charge high prices for their services stillman is a great man hes done more for the cure of tuberculosis than any doctor in this country his words caused surprise throughout the courtroom mary boland looked at him with admiration hopper slowly and sadly began to put away his papers feeling certain that andrew had lost his case the president spoke do you really mean what you are saying dr manson i do andrew said firmly he was determined to express his opinions if they were going to disqualify him he would give them cause to do so he continued there are a great many things wrong with our profession and its time that we tried to correct them doctors are not trained properly they learn only the basis of medicine at the medical schools when i qualified i was a danger to society i only knew the names of a few diseases and the medicines that were supposed to cure them ive learned nearly evefything that i now know about medicine since i left medical school but how many doctors study when they are running a practice very few they are too busy to study our whole system is rotten doctors should work together and share their knowledge make a real study of the causes and cures of their patients diseases instead of just giving bottles of medicine whats happening now many doctors make fortunes from their patients by giving them medicines and expensive treatments that are useless it isnt right it isnt honest i have made many mistakes myself and i am sorry about them but i made no mistake about stillman and i was right to turn to him i ask you to look at mary boland when she went to stillman she was dangerously ill now shes cured judge my actions by that andrew sat down for a minute there was silence then the president ordered everyone to leave the room andrew went out with the others he now felt angry with himself he wished that he had controlled his feelings and had not spoken in that manner he wanted so much to work with denny and hope but now they would disqualify him the sound of people moving brought him to himself again he joined the others and returned to the council room he sat quite still his heart beating fast the president spoke andrew manson the council has carefully considered the charge brought against you and has decided to allow you to continue to practise medicine for a moment andrew hardly understood his words then his heart beat still faster with joy and relief they had not disqualified him he was free he raised his head and looked at the members of the council of all the faces that were turned towards him the one that he saw most clearly was the face of robert abbey at once he realized that it was abbey who had saved him he addressed the president but it was to abbey that he really spoke thank you sir then his friends con mary the surprised mr hopper and people whom he had never seen before came up to him and shook his hand mary whose eyes were filled with tears said if they had disqualified you after all that you have done for me id id have killed that old president andrew smiled the three andrew con and mary went to andrews hotel there waiting for them was denny he walked towards them smiling hopper had telephoned the news to him but he did not mention this he said simply im hungry lets have lunch denny did not say a single word about the inquiry during lunch after the meal he told andrew we can buy that house that we want for our practice its quite cheap hope has gone to see it our train leaves at four oclock i must do some shopping now ill meet you at the station andrew looked at denny thinking of their friendship and of all that he owed to him since their first meeting in the little drineffy surgery he said suddenly what would have happened if they had disqualified me they didnt disqualify you philip shook his head and i will make sure that they never do when denny con and mary had left andrew went to the churchyard where christine was buried and stood for a long time by her grave it was a bright fresh afternoon the sort of weather that she had always loved when at last he turned away hurrying for fear that he might be late there in the sky before him a bank of cloud lay brightly bearing the shape of battlements the end
